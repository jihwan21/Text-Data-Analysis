Diffusion Self-Guidance for Controllable Image Generation,"Large-scale generative models are capable of producing high-quality images from detailed text descriptions. However, many aspects of an image are difficult or impossible to convey through text. We introduce self-guidance, a method that provides greater control over generated images by guiding the internal representations of diffusion models. We demonstrate that properties such as the shape, location, and appearance of objects can be extracted from these representations and used to steer sampling. Self-guidance works similarly to classifier guidance, but uses signals present in the pretrained model itself, requiring no additional models or training. We show how a simple set of properties can be composed to perform challenging image manipulations, such as modifying the position or size of objects, merging the appearance of objects in one image with the layout of another, composing objects from many images into one, and more. We also show that self-guidance can be used to edit real images. For results and an interactive demo, see our project page at https://dave.ml/selfguidance/"
StyleDrop: Text-to-Image Generation in Any Style,"Pre-trained large text-to-image models synthesize impressive images with an appropriate use of text prompts. However, ambiguities inherent in natural language and out-of-distribution effects make it hard to synthesize image styles, that leverage a specific design pattern, texture or material. In this paper, we introduce StyleDrop, a method that enables the synthesis of images that faithfully follow a specific style using a text-to-image model. The proposed method is extremely versatile and captures nuances and details of a user-provided style, such as color schemes, shading, design patterns, and local and global effects. It efficiently learns a new style by fine-tuning very few trainable parameters (less than 1\% of total model parameters) and improving the quality via iterative training with either human or automated feedback. Better yet, StyleDrop is able to deliver impressive results even when the user supplies only a single image that specifies the desired style. An extensive study shows that, for the task of style tuning text-to-image models, StyleDrop implemented on Muse convincingly outperforms other methods, including DreamBooth and textual inversion on Imagen or Stable Diffusion. More results are available at our project website: https://styledrop.github.io"
ViCo: Detail-Preserving Visual Condition for Personalized Text-to-Image Generation,"Personalized text-to-image generation using diffusion models has recently been proposed and attracted lots of attention. Given a handful of images containing a novel concept (e.g., a unique toy), we aim to tune the generative model to capture fine visual details of the novel concept and generate photorealistic images following a text condition. We present a plug-in method, named ViCo, for fast and lightweight personalized generation. Specifically, we propose an image attention module to condition the diffusion process on the patch-wise visual semantics. We introduce an attention-based object mask that comes almost at no cost from the attention module. In addition, we design a simple regularization based on the intrinsic properties of text-image attention maps to alleviate the common overfitting degradation. Unlike many existing models, our method does not finetune any parameters of the original diffusion model. This allows more flexible and transferable model deployment. With only light parameter training (~6% of the diffusion U-Net), our method achieves comparable or even better performance than all state-of-the-art models both qualitatively and quantitatively."
Cocktail: Mixing Multi-Modality Controls for Text-Conditional Image Generation,"Text-conditional diffusion models are able to generate high-fidelity images with diverse contents. However, linguistic representations frequently exhibit ambiguous descriptions of the envisioned objective imagery, requiring the incorporation of additional control signals to bolster the efficacy of text-guided diffusion models. In this work, we propose Cocktail, a pipeline to mix various modalities into one embedding, amalgamated with a generalized ControlNet (gControlNet), a controllable normalisation (ControlNorm), and a spatial guidance sampling method, to actualize multi-modal and spatially-refined control for text-conditional diffusion models. Specifically, we introduce a hyper-network gControlNet, dedicated to the alignment and infusion of the control signals from disparate modalities into the pre-trained diffusion model. gControlNet is capable of accepting flexible modality signals, encompassing the simultaneous reception of any combination of modality signals, or the supplementary fusion of multiple modality signals. The control signals are then fused and injected into the backbone model according to our proposed ControlNorm. Furthermore, our advanced spatial guidance sampling methodology proficiently incorporates the control signal into the designated region, thereby circumventing the manifestation of undesired objects within the generated image. We demonstrate the results of our method in controlling various modalities, proving high-quality synthesis and fidelity to multiple external signals."
T2IAT: Measuring Valence and Stereotypical Biases in Text-to-Image Generation,"Warning: This paper contains several contents that may be toxic, harmful, or offensive.  In the last few years, text-to-image generative models have gained remarkable success in generating images with unprecedented quality accompanied by a breakthrough of inference speed. Despite their rapid progress, human biases that manifest in the training examples, particularly with regard to common stereotypical biases, like gender and skin tone, still have been found in these generative models. In this work, we seek to measure more complex human biases exist in the task of text-to-image generations. Inspired by the well-known Implicit Association Test (IAT) from social psychology, we propose a novel Text-to-Image Association Test (T2IAT) framework that quantifies the implicit stereotypes between concepts and valence, and those in the images. We replicate the previously documented bias tests on generative models, including morally neutral tests on flowers and insects as well as demographic stereotypical tests on diverse social attributes. The results of these experiments demonstrate the presence of complex stereotypical behaviors in image generations."
Image generation with shortest path diffusion,"The field of image generation has made significant progress thanks to the introduction of Diffusion Models, which learn to progressively reverse a given image corruption. Recently, a few studies introduced alternative ways of corrupting images in Diffusion Models, with an emphasis on blurring. However, these studies are purely empirical and it remains unclear what is the optimal procedure for corrupting an image. In this work, we hypothesize that the optimal procedure minimizes the length of the path taken when corrupting an image towards a given final state. We propose the Fisher metric for the path length, measured in the space of probability distributions. We compute the shortest path according to this metric, and we show that it corresponds to a combination of image sharpening, rather than blurring, and noise deblurring. While the corruption was chosen arbitrarily in previous work, our Shortest Path Diffusion (SPD) determines uniquely the entire spatiotemporal structure of the corruption. We show that SPD improves on strong baselines without any hyperparameter tuning, and outperforms all previous Diffusion Models based on image blurring. Furthermore, any small deviation from the shortest path leads to worse performance, suggesting that SPD provides the optimal procedure to corrupt images. Our work sheds new light on observations made in recent works and provides a new approach to improve diffusion models on images and other types of data."
CapText: Large Language Model-based Caption Generation From Image Context and Description,"While deep-learning models have been shown to perform well on image-to-text datasets, it is difficult to use them in practice for captioning images. This is because \textit{captions} traditionally tend to be context-dependent and offer complementary information about an image, while models tend to produce \textit{descriptions} that describe the visual features of the image. Prior research in caption generation has explored the use of models that generate captions when provided with the images alongside their respective descriptions or contexts. We propose and evaluate a new approach, which leverages existing large language models to generate captions from textual descriptions and context alone, without ever processing the image directly. We demonstrate that after fine-tuning, our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art image-text alignment models like OSCAR-VinVL on this task on the CIDEr metric."
Diffusion Brush: A Latent Diffusion Model-based Editing Tool for AI-generated Images,"Text-to-image generative models have made remarkable advancements in generating high-quality images. However, generated images often contain undesirable artifacts or other errors due to model limitations. Existing techniques to fine-tune generated images are time-consuming (manual editing), produce poorly-integrated results (inpainting), or result in unexpected changes across the entire image (variation selection and prompt fine-tuning). In this work, we present Diffusion Brush, a Latent Diffusion Model-based (LDM) tool to efficiently fine-tune desired regions within an AI-synthesized image. Our method introduces new random noise patterns at targeted regions during the reverse diffusion process, enabling the model to efficiently make changes to the specified regions while preserving the original context for the rest of the image. We evaluate our method's usability and effectiveness through a user study with artists, comparing our technique against other state-of-the-art image inpainting techniques and editing software for fine-tuning AI-generated imagery."
Treasure in Distribution: A Domain Randomization based Multi-Source Domain Generalization for 2D Medical Image Segmentation,"Although recent years have witnessed the great success of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in medical image segmentation, the domain shift issue caused by the highly variable image quality of medical images hinders the deployment of CNNs in real-world clinical applications. Domain generalization (DG) methods aim to address this issue by training a robust model on the source domain, which has a strong generalization ability. Previously, many DG methods based on feature-space domain randomization have been proposed, which, however, suffer from the limited and unordered search space of feature styles. In this paper, we propose a multi-source DG method called Treasure in Distribution (TriD), which constructs an unprecedented search space to obtain the model with strong robustness by randomly sampling from a uniform distribution. To learn the domain-invariant representations explicitly, we further devise a style-mixing strategy in our TriD, which mixes the feature styles by randomly mixing the augmented and original statistics along the channel wise and can be extended to other DG methods. Extensive experiments on two medical segmentation tasks with different modalities demonstrate that our TriD achieves superior generalization performance on unseen target-domain data. Code is available at https://github.com/Chen-Ziyang/TriD."
A Unified GAN Framework Regarding Manifold Alignment for Remote Sensing Images Generation,"Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and their variants have achieved remarkable success on natural images. It aims to approximate the distribution of the training datasets. However, their performance degrades when applied to remote sensing (RS) images, and the discriminator often suffers from the overfitting problem. In this paper, we examine the differences between natural and RS images and find that the intrinsic dimensions of RS images are much lower than those of natural images. Besides, the low-dimensional data manifold of RS images may exacerbate the uneven sampling of training datasets and introduce biased information. The discriminator can easily overfit to the biased training distribution, leading to a faulty generation model, even the mode collapse problem. While existing GANs focus on the general distribution of RS datasets, they often neglect the underlying data manifold. In respond, we propose a learnable information-theoretic measure that preserves the intrinsic structures of the original data, and establish a unified GAN framework for manifold alignment in supervised and unsupervised RS image generation."
Translation-Enhanced Multilingual Text-to-Image Generation,"Research on text-to-image generation (TTI) still predominantly focuses on the English language due to the lack of annotated image-caption data in other languages; in the long run, this might widen inequitable access to TTI technology. In this work, we thus investigate multilingual TTI (termed mTTI) and the current potential of neural machine translation (NMT) to bootstrap mTTI systems. We provide two key contributions. 1) Relying on a multilingual multi-modal encoder, we provide a systematic empirical study of standard methods used in cross-lingual NLP when applied to mTTI: Translate Train, Translate Test, and Zero-Shot Transfer. 2) We propose Ensemble Adapter (EnsAd), a novel parameter-efficient approach that learns to weigh and consolidate the multilingual text knowledge within the mTTI framework, mitigating the language gap and thus improving mTTI performance. Our evaluations on standard mTTI datasets COCO-CN, Multi30K Task2, and LAION-5B demonstrate the potential of translation-enhanced mTTI systems and also validate the benefits of the proposed EnsAd which derives consistent gains across all datasets. Further investigations on model variants, ablation studies, and qualitative analyses provide additional insights on the inner workings of the proposed mTTI approaches."
LANCE: Stress-testing Visual Models by Generating Language-guided Counterfactual Images,"We propose an automated algorithm to stress-test a trained visual model by generating language-guided counterfactual test images (LANCE). Our method leverages recent progress in large language modeling and text-based image editing to augment an IID test set with a suite of diverse, realistic, and challenging test images without altering model weights. We benchmark the performance of a diverse set of pretrained models on our generated data and observe significant and consistent performance drops. We further analyze model sensitivity across different types of edits, and demonstrate its applicability at surfacing previously unknown class-level model biases in ImageNet."
Nested Diffusion Processes for Anytime Image Generation,"Diffusion models are the current state-of-the-art in image generation, synthesizing high-quality images by breaking down the generation process into many fine-grained denoising steps. Despite their good performance, diffusion models are computationally expensive, requiring many neural function evaluations (NFEs). In this work, we propose an anytime diffusion-based method that can generate viable images when stopped at arbitrary times before completion. Using existing pretrained diffusion models, we show that the generation scheme can be recomposed as two nested diffusion processes, enabling fast iterative refinement of a generated image. We use this Nested Diffusion approach to peek into the generation process and enable flexible scheduling based on the instantaneous preference of the user. In experiments on ImageNet and Stable Diffusion-based text-to-image generation, we show, both qualitatively and quantitatively, that our method's intermediate generation quality greatly exceeds that of the original diffusion model, while the final slow generation result remains comparable."
StyleAvatar3D: Leveraging Image-Text Diffusion Models for High-Fidelity 3D Avatar Generation,"The recent advancements in image-text diffusion models have stimulated research interest in large-scale 3D generative models. Nevertheless, the limited availability of diverse 3D resources presents significant challenges to learning. In this paper, we present a novel method for generating high-quality, stylized 3D avatars that utilizes pre-trained image-text diffusion models for data generation and a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based 3D generation network for training. Our method leverages the comprehensive priors of appearance and geometry offered by image-text diffusion models to generate multi-view images of avatars in various styles. During data generation, we employ poses extracted from existing 3D models to guide the generation of multi-view images. To address the misalignment between poses and images in data, we investigate view-specific prompts and develop a coarse-to-fine discriminator for GAN training. We also delve into attribute-related prompts to increase the diversity of the generated avatars. Additionally, we develop a latent diffusion model within the style space of StyleGAN to enable the generation of avatars based on image inputs. Our approach demonstrates superior performance over current state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual quality and diversity of the produced avatars."
DualVAE: Controlling Colours of Generated and Real Images,"Colour controlled image generation and manipulation are of interest to artists and graphic designers. Vector Quantised Variational AutoEncoders (VQ-VAEs) with autoregressive (AR) prior are able to produce high quality images, but lack an explicit representation mechanism to control colour attributes. We introduce DualVAE, a hybrid representation model that provides such control by learning disentangled representations for colour and geometry. The geometry is represented by an image intensity mapping that identifies structural features. The disentangled representation is obtained by two novel mechanisms:  (i) a dual branch architecture that separates image colour attributes from geometric attributes, and (ii) a new ELBO that trains the combined colour and geometry representations. DualVAE can control the colour of generated images, and recolour existing images by transferring the colour latent representation obtained from an exemplar image. We demonstrate that DualVAE generates images with FID nearly two times better than VQ-GAN on a diverse collection of datasets, including animated faces, logos and artistic landscapes."
Controllable Text-to-Image Generation with GPT-4,"Current text-to-image generation models often struggle to follow textual instructions, especially the ones requiring spatial reasoning. On the other hand, Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, have shown remarkable precision in generating code snippets for sketching out text inputs graphically, e.g., via TikZ. In this work, we introduce Control-GPT to guide the diffusion-based text-to-image pipelines with programmatic sketches generated by GPT-4, enhancing their abilities for instruction following. Control-GPT works by querying GPT-4 to write TikZ code, and the generated sketches are used as references alongside the text instructions for diffusion models (e.g., ControlNet) to generate photo-realistic images. One major challenge to training our pipeline is the lack of a dataset containing aligned text, images, and sketches. We address the issue by converting instance masks in existing datasets into polygons to mimic the sketches used at test time. As a result, Control-GPT greatly boosts the controllability of image generation. It establishes a new state-of-art on the spatial arrangement and object positioning generation and enhances users' control of object positions, sizes, etc., nearly doubling the accuracy of prior models. Our work, as a first attempt, shows the potential for employing LLMs to enhance the performance in computer vision tasks."
Alteration-free and Model-agnostic Origin Attribution of Generated Images,"Recently, there has been a growing attention in image generation models. However, concerns have emerged regarding potential misuse and intellectual property (IP) infringement associated with these models. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the origin of images by inferring if a specific image was generated by a particular model, i.e., origin attribution. Existing methods are limited in their applicability to specific types of generative models and require additional steps during training or generation. This restricts their use with pre-trained models that lack these specific operations and may compromise the quality of image generation. To overcome this problem, we first develop an alteration-free and model-agnostic origin attribution method via input reverse-engineering on image generation models, i.e., inverting the input of a particular model for a specific image. Given a particular model, we first analyze the differences in the hardness of reverse-engineering tasks for the generated images of the given model and other images. Based on our analysis, we propose a method that utilizes the reconstruction loss of reverse-engineering to infer the origin. Our proposed method effectively distinguishes between generated images from a specific generative model and other images, including those generated by different models and real images."
Mitigating Inappropriateness in Image Generation: Can there be Value in Reflecting the World's Ugliness?,"Text-conditioned image generation models have recently achieved astonishing results in image quality and text alignment and are consequently employed in a fast-growing number of applications. Since they are highly data-driven, relying on billion-sized datasets randomly scraped from the web, they also reproduce inappropriate human behavior. Specifically, we demonstrate inappropriate degeneration on a large-scale for various generative text-to-image models, thus motivating the need for monitoring and moderating them at deployment. To this end, we evaluate mitigation strategies at inference to suppress the generation of inappropriate content. Our findings show that we can use models' representations of the world's ugliness to align them with human preferences."
RAPHAEL: Text-to-Image Generation via Large Mixture of Diffusion Paths,"Text-to-image generation has recently witnessed remarkable achievements. We introduce a text-conditional image diffusion model, termed RAPHAEL, to generate highly artistic images, which accurately portray the text prompts, encompassing multiple nouns, adjectives, and verbs. This is achieved by stacking tens of mixture-of-experts (MoEs) layers, i.e., space-MoE and time-MoE layers, enabling billions of diffusion paths (routes) from the network input to the output. Each path intuitively functions as a ""painter"" for depicting a particular textual concept onto a specified image region at a diffusion timestep. Comprehensive experiments reveal that RAPHAEL outperforms recent cutting-edge models, such as Stable Diffusion, ERNIE-ViLG 2.0, DeepFloyd, and DALL-E 2, in terms of both image quality and aesthetic appeal. Firstly, RAPHAEL exhibits superior performance in switching images across diverse styles, such as Japanese comics, realism, cyberpunk, and ink illustration. Secondly, a single model with three billion parameters, trained on 1,000 A100 GPUs for two months, achieves a state-of-the-art zero-shot FID score of 6.61 on the COCO dataset. Furthermore, RAPHAEL significantly surpasses its counterparts in human evaluation on the ViLG-300 benchmark. We believe that RAPHAEL holds the potential to propel the frontiers of image generation research in both academia and industry, paving the way for future breakthroughs in this rapidly evolving field. More details can be found on a project webpage: https://raphael-painter.github.io/."
High-Fidelity Image Compression with Score-based Generative Models,"Despite the tremendous success of diffusion generative models in text-to-image generation, replicating this success in the domain of image compression has proven difficult. In this paper, we demonstrate that diffusion can significantly improve perceptual quality at a given bit-rate, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches PO-ELIC and HiFiC as measured by FID score. This is achieved using a simple but theoretically motivated two-stage approach combining an autoencoder targeting MSE followed by a further score-based decoder. However, as we will show, implementation details matter and the optimal design decisions can differ greatly from typical text-to-image models."
Text-Only Image Captioning with Multi-Context Data Generation,"Text-only Image Captioning (TIC) is an approach that aims to construct a model solely based on text that can accurately describe images. Recently, diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating high-quality images that are semantically coherent with given texts. This presents an opportunity to generate synthetic training images for TIC. However, we have identified a challenge that the images generated from simple descriptions typically exhibit a single perspective with one or limited contexts, which is not aligned with the complexity of real-world scenes in the image domain. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that addresses this issue by introducing multi-context data generation. Starting with an initial text corpus, our framework employs a large language model to select multiple sentences that describe the same scene from various perspectives. These sentences are then summarized into a single sentence with multiple contexts. We generate simple images using the straightforward sentences and complex images using the summarized sentences through diffusion models. Finally, we train the model exclusively using the synthetic image-text pairs obtained from this process. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework effectively tackles the central challenge we have identified, achieving the state-of-the-art performance on popular datasets such as MSCOCO, Flickr30k, and SS1M."
CCDWT-GAN: Generative Adversarial Networks Based on Color Channel Using Discrete Wavelet Transform for Document Image Binarization,"To efficiently extract the textual information from color degraded document images is an important research topic. Long-term imperfect preservation of ancient documents has led to various types of degradation such as page staining, paper yellowing, and ink bleeding; these degradations badly impact the image processing for information extraction. In this paper, we present CCDWT-GAN, a generative adversarial network (GAN) that utilizes the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) on RGB (red, green, blue) channel splited images. The proposed method comprises three stages: image preprocessing, image enhancement, and image binarization. This work conducts comparative experiments in the image preprocessing stage to determine the optimal selection of DWT with normalization. Additionally, we perform an ablation study on the results of the image enhancement stage and the image binarization stage to validate their positive effect on the model performance. This work compares the performance of the proposed method with other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on DIBCO and H-DIBCO ((Handwritten) Document Image Binarization Competition) datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that CCDWT-GAN achieves a top two performance on multiple benchmark datasets, and outperforms other SOTA methods."
Generating Images with Multimodal Language Models,"We propose a method to fuse frozen text-only large language models (LLMs) with pre-trained image encoder and decoder models, by mapping between their embedding spaces. Our model demonstrates a wide suite of multimodal capabilities: image retrieval, novel image generation, and multimodal dialogue. Ours is the first approach capable of conditioning on arbitrarily interleaved image and text inputs to generate coherent image (and text) outputs. To achieve strong performance on image generation, we propose an efficient mapping network to ground the LLM to an off-the-shelf text-to-image generation model. This mapping network translates hidden representations of text into the embedding space of the visual models, enabling us to leverage the strong text representations of the LLM for visual outputs. Our approach outperforms baseline generation models on tasks with longer and more complex language. In addition to novel image generation, our model is also capable of image retrieval from a prespecified dataset, and decides whether to retrieve or generate at inference time. This is done with a learnt decision module which conditions on the hidden representations of the LLM. Our model exhibits a wider range of capabilities compared to prior multimodal language models. It can process image-and-text inputs, and produce retrieved images, generated images, and generated text -- outperforming non-LLM based generation models across several text-to-image tasks that measure context dependence."
Fast refacing of MR images with a generative neural network lowers re-identification risk and preserves volumetric consistency,"With the rise of open data, identifiability of individuals based on 3D renderings obtained from routine structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the head has become a growing privacy concern. To protect subject privacy, several algorithms have been developed to de-identify imaging data using blurring, defacing or refacing. Completely removing facial structures provides the best re-identification protection but can significantly impact post-processing steps, like brain morphometry. As an alternative, refacing methods that replace individual facial structures with generic templates have a lower effect on the geometry and intensity distribution of original scans, and are able to provide more consistent post-processing results by the price of higher re-identification risk and computational complexity. In the current study, we propose a novel method for anonymised face generation for defaced 3D T1-weighted scans based on a 3D conditional generative adversarial network. To evaluate the performance of the proposed de-identification tool, a comparative study was conducted between several existing defacing and refacing tools, with two different segmentation algorithms (FAST and Morphobox). The aim was to evaluate (i) impact on brain morphometry reproducibility, (ii) re-identification risk, (iii) balance between (i) and (ii), and (iv) the processing time. The proposed method takes 9 seconds for face generation and is suitable for recovering consistent post-processing results after defacing."
ZeroAvatar: Zero-shot 3D Avatar Generation from a Single Image,"Recent advancements in text-to-image generation have enabled significant progress in zero-shot 3D shape generation. This is achieved by score distillation, a methodology that uses pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models to optimize the parameters of a 3D neural presentation, e.g. Neural Radiance Field (NeRF). While showing promising results, existing methods are often not able to preserve the geometry of complex shapes, such as human bodies. To address this challenge, we present ZeroAvatar, a method that introduces the explicit 3D human body prior to the optimization process. Specifically, we first estimate and refine the parameters of a parametric human body from a single image. Then during optimization, we use the posed parametric body as additional geometry constraint to regularize the diffusion model as well as the underlying density field. Lastly, we propose a UV-guided texture regularization term to further guide the completion of texture on invisible body parts. We show that ZeroAvatar significantly enhances the robustness and 3D consistency of optimization-based image-to-3D avatar generation, outperforming existing zero-shot image-to-3D methods."
ProSpect: Expanded Conditioning for the Personalization of Attribute-aware Image Generation,"Personalizing generative models offers a way to guide image generation with user-provided references. Current personalization methods can invert an object or concept into the textual conditioning space and compose new natural sentences for text-to-image diffusion models. However, representing and editing specific visual attributes like material, style, layout, etc. remains a challenge, leading to a lack of disentanglement and editability. To address this, we propose a novel approach that leverages the step-by-step generation process of diffusion models, which generate images from low- to high-frequency information, providing a new perspective on representing, generating, and editing images. We develop Prompt Spectrum Space P*, an expanded textual conditioning space, and a new image representation method called ProSpect. ProSpect represents an image as a collection of inverted textual token embeddings encoded from per-stage prompts, where each prompt corresponds to a specific generation stage (i.e., a group of consecutive steps) of the diffusion model. Experimental results demonstrate that P* and ProSpect offer stronger disentanglement and controllability compared to existing methods. We apply ProSpect in various personalized attribute-aware image generation applications, such as image/text-guided material/style/layout transfer/editing, achieving previously unattainable results with a single image input without fine-tuning the diffusion models."
Generative Adversarial Networks for Brain Images Synthesis: A Review,"In medical imaging, image synthesis is the estimation process of one image (sequence, modality) from another image (sequence, modality). Since images with different modalities provide diverse biomarkers and capture various features, multi-modality imaging is crucial in medicine. While multi-screening is expensive, costly, and time-consuming to report by radiologists, image synthesis methods are capable of artificially generating missing modalities. Deep learning models can automatically capture and extract the high dimensional features. Especially, generative adversarial network (GAN) as one of the most popular generative-based deep learning methods, uses convolutional networks as generators, and estimated images are discriminated as true or false based on a discriminator network. This review provides brain image synthesis via GANs. We summarized the recent developments of GANs for cross-modality brain image synthesis including CT to PET, CT to MRI, MRI to PET, and vice versa."
Visual Programming for Text-to-Image Generation and Evaluation,"As large language models have demonstrated impressive performance in many domains, recent works have adopted language models (LMs) as controllers of visual modules for vision-and-language tasks. While existing work focuses on equipping LMs with visual understanding, we propose two novel interpretable/explainable visual programming frameworks for text-to-image (T2I) generation and evaluation. First, we introduce VPGen, an interpretable step-by-step T2I generation framework that decomposes T2I generation into three steps: object/count generation, layout generation, and image generation. We employ an LM to handle the first two steps (object/count generation and layout generation), by finetuning it on text-layout pairs. Our step-by-step T2I generation framework provides stronger spatial control than end-to-end models, the dominant approach for this task. Furthermore, we leverage the world knowledge of pretrained LMs, overcoming the limitation of previous layout-guided T2I works that can only handle predefined object classes. We demonstrate that our VPGen has improved control in counts/spatial relations/scales of objects than state-of-the-art T2I generation models. Second, we introduce VPEval, an interpretable and explainable evaluation framework for T2I generation based on visual programming. Unlike previous T2I evaluations with a single scoring model that is accurate in some skills but unreliable in others, VPEval produces evaluation programs that invoke a set of visual modules that are experts in different skills, and also provides visual+textual explanations of the evaluation results. Our analysis shows VPEval provides a more human-correlated evaluation for skill-specific and open-ended prompts than widely used single model-based evaluation. We hope our work encourages future progress on interpretable/explainable generation and evaluation for T2I models. Website: https://vp-t2i.github.io"
Training on Thin Air: Improve Image Classification with Generated Data,"Acquiring high-quality data for training discriminative models is a crucial yet challenging aspect of building effective predictive systems. In this paper, we present Diffusion Inversion, a simple yet effective method that leverages the pre-trained generative model, Stable Diffusion, to generate diverse, high-quality training data for image classification. Our approach captures the original data distribution and ensures data coverage by inverting images to the latent space of Stable Diffusion, and generates diverse novel training images by conditioning the generative model on noisy versions of these vectors. We identify three key components that allow our generated images to successfully supplant the original dataset, leading to a 2-3x enhancement in sample complexity and a 6.5x decrease in sampling time. Moreover, our approach consistently outperforms generic prompt-based steering methods and KNN retrieval baseline across a wide range of datasets. Additionally, we demonstrate the compatibility of our approach with widely-used data augmentation techniques, as well as the reliability of the generated data in supporting various neural architectures and enhancing few-shot learning."
"MultiFusion: Fusing Pre-Trained Models for Multi-Lingual, Multi-Modal Image Generation","The recent popularity of text-to-image diffusion models (DM) can largely be attributed to the intuitive interface they provide to users. The intended generation can be expressed in natural language, with the model producing faithful interpretations of text prompts. However, expressing complex or nuanced ideas in text alone can be difficult. To ease image generation, we propose MultiFusion that allows one to express complex and nuanced concepts with arbitrarily interleaved inputs of multiple modalities and languages. MutliFusion leverages pre-trained models and aligns them for integration into a cohesive system, thereby avoiding the need for extensive training from scratch. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficient transfer of capabilities from individual modules to the downstream model. Specifically, the fusion of all independent components allows the image generation module to utilize multilingual, interleaved multimodal inputs despite being trained solely on monomodal data in a single language."
Networks are Slacking Off: Understanding Generalization Problem in Image Deraining,"Deep deraining networks, while successful in laboratory benchmarks, consistently encounter substantial generalization issues when deployed in real-world applications. A prevailing perspective in deep learning encourages the use of highly complex training data, with the expectation that a richer image content knowledge will facilitate overcoming the generalization problem. However, through comprehensive and systematic experimentation, we discovered that this strategy does not enhance the generalization capability of these networks. On the contrary, it exacerbates the tendency of networks to overfit to specific degradations. Our experiments reveal that better generalization in a deraining network can be achieved by simplifying the complexity of the training data. This is due to the networks are slacking off during training, that is, learning the least complex elements in the image content and degradation to minimize training loss. When the complexity of the background image is less than that of the rain streaks, the network will prioritize the reconstruction of the background, thereby avoiding overfitting to the rain patterns and resulting in improved generalization performance. Our research not only offers a valuable perspective and methodology for better understanding the generalization problem in low-level vision tasks, but also displays promising practical potential."
Transferring Visual Attributes from Natural Language to Verified Image Generation,"Text to image generation methods (T2I) are widely popular in generating art and other creative artifacts. While visual hallucinations can be a positive factor in scenarios where creativity is appreciated, such artifacts are poorly suited for cases where the generated image needs to be grounded in complex natural language without explicit visual elements. In this paper, we propose to strengthen the consistency property of T2I methods in the presence of natural complex language, which often breaks the limits of T2I methods by including non-visual information, and textual elements that require knowledge for accurate generation. To address these phenomena, we propose a Natural Language to Verified Image generation approach (NL2VI) that converts a natural prompt into a visual prompt, which is more suitable for image generation. A T2I model then generates an image for the visual prompt, which is then verified with VQA algorithms. Experimentally, aligning natural prompts with image generation can improve the consistency of the generated images by up to 11% over the state of the art. Moreover, improvements can generalize to challenging domains like cooking and DIY tasks, where the correctness of the generated image is crucial to illustrate actions."
Text Conditional Alt-Text Generation for Twitter Images,"In this work we present an approach for generating alternative text (or alt-text) descriptions for images shared on social media, specifically Twitter. This task is more than just a special case of image captioning, as alt-text is both more literally descriptive and context-specific. Also critically, images posted to Twitter are often accompanied by user-written text that despite not necessarily describing the image may provide useful context that if properly leveraged can be informative -- e.g. the tweet may name an uncommon object in the image that the model has not previously seen. We address this with a CLIP prefix model that extracts an embedding of the image and passes it to a mapping network that outputs a short sequence in word embedding space, or a ``prefix'', to which we also concatenate the text from the tweet itself. This lets the model condition on both visual and textual information from the post. The combined multimodal prefix is then fed as a prompt to a pretrained language model which autoregressively completes the sequence to generate the alt-text. While prior work has used similar methods for captioning, ours is the first to our knowledge that incorporates textual information from the associated social media post into the prefix as well, and we further demonstrate through ablations that utility of these two information sources stacks. We put forward a new dataset scraped from Twitter and evaluate on it across a variety of automated metrics as well as human evaluation, and show that our approach of conditioning on both tweet text and visual information significantly outperforms prior work."
BLIP-Diffusion: Pre-trained Subject Representation for Controllable Text-to-Image Generation and Editing,"Subject-driven text-to-image generation models create novel renditions of an input subject based on text prompts. Existing models suffer from lengthy fine-tuning and difficulties preserving the subject fidelity. To overcome these limitations, we introduce BLIP-Diffusion, a new subject-driven image generation model that supports multimodal control which consumes inputs of subject images and text prompts. Unlike other subject-driven generation models, BLIP-Diffusion introduces a new multimodal encoder which is pre-trained to provide subject representation. We first pre-train the multimodal encoder following BLIP-2 to produce visual representation aligned with the text. Then we design a subject representation learning task which enables a diffusion model to leverage such visual representation and generates new subject renditions. Compared with previous methods such as DreamBooth, our model enables zero-shot subject-driven generation, and efficient fine-tuning for customized subject with up to 20x speedup. We also demonstrate that BLIP-Diffusion can be flexibly combined with existing techniques such as ControlNet and prompt-to-prompt to enable novel subject-driven generation and editing applications. Code and models will be released at https://github.com/salesforce/LAVIS/tree/main/projects/blip-diffusion. Project page at https://dxli94.github.io/BLIP-Diffusion-website/."
Attentive Continuous Generative Self-training for Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Medical Image Translation,"Self-training is an important class of unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) approaches that are used to mitigate the problem of domain shift, when applying knowledge learned from a labeled source domain to unlabeled and heterogeneous target domains. While self-training-based UDA has shown considerable promise on discriminative tasks, including classification and segmentation, through reliable pseudo-label filtering based on the maximum softmax probability, there is a paucity of prior work on self-training-based UDA for generative tasks, including image modality translation. To fill this gap, in this work, we seek to develop a generative self-training (GST) framework for domain adaptive image translation with continuous value prediction and regression objectives. Specifically, we quantify both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties within our GST using variational Bayes learning to measure the reliability of synthesized data. We also introduce a self-attention scheme that de-emphasizes the background region to prevent it from dominating the training process. The adaptation is then carried out by an alternating optimization scheme with target domain supervision that focuses attention on the regions with reliable pseudo-labels. We evaluated our framework on two cross-scanner/center, inter-subject translation tasks, including tagged-to-cine magnetic resonance (MR) image translation and T1-weighted MR-to-fractional anisotropy translation. Extensive validations with unpaired target domain data showed that our GST yielded superior synthesis performance in comparison to adversarial training UDA methods."
Generalized Expectation Maximization Framework for Blind Image Super Resolution,"Learning-based methods for blind single image super resolution (SISR) conduct the restoration by a learned mapping between high-resolution (HR) images and their low-resolution (LR) counterparts degraded with arbitrary blur kernels. However, these methods mostly require an independent step to estimate the blur kernel, leading to error accumulation between steps. We propose an end-to-end learning framework for the blind SISR problem, which enables image restoration within a unified Bayesian framework with either full- or semi-supervision. The proposed method, namely SREMN, integrates learning techniques into the generalized expectation-maximization (GEM) algorithm and infers HR images from the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). Extensive experiments show the superiority of the proposed method with comparison to existing work and novelty in semi-supervised learning."
Unsafe Diffusion: On the Generation of Unsafe Images and Hateful Memes From Text-To-Image Models,"State-of-the-art Text-to-Image models like Stable Diffusion and DALLE\cdot2 are revolutionizing how people generate visual content. At the same time, society has serious concerns about how adversaries can exploit such models to generate unsafe images. In this work, we focus on demystifying the generation of unsafe images and hateful memes from Text-to-Image models. We first construct a typology of unsafe images consisting of five categories (sexually explicit, violent, disturbing, hateful, and political). Then, we assess the proportion of unsafe images generated by four advanced Text-to-Image models using four prompt datasets. We find that these models can generate a substantial percentage of unsafe images; across four models and four prompt datasets, 14.56% of all generated images are unsafe. When comparing the four models, we find different risk levels, with Stable Diffusion being the most prone to generating unsafe content (18.92% of all generated images are unsafe). Given Stable Diffusion's tendency to generate more unsafe content, we evaluate its potential to generate hateful meme variants if exploited by an adversary to attack a specific individual or community. We employ three image editing methods, DreamBooth, Textual Inversion, and SDEdit, which are supported by Stable Diffusion. Our evaluation result shows that 24% of the generated images using DreamBooth are hateful meme variants that present the features of the original hateful meme and the target individual/community; these generated images are comparable to hateful meme variants collected from the real world. Overall, our results demonstrate that the danger of large-scale generation of unsafe images is imminent. We discuss several mitigating measures, such as curating training data, regulating prompts, and implementing safety filters, and encourage better safeguard tools to be developed to prevent unsafe generation."
Variational Bayesian Framework for Advanced Image Generation with Domain-Related Variables,"Deep generative models (DGMs) and their conditional counterparts provide a powerful ability for general-purpose generative modeling of data distributions. However, it remains challenging for existing methods to address advanced conditional generative problems without annotations, which can enable multiple applications like image-to-image translation and image editing. We present a unified Bayesian framework for such problems, which introduces an inference stage on latent variables within the learning process. In particular, we propose a variational Bayesian image translation network (VBITN) that enables multiple image translation and editing tasks. Comprehensive experiments show the effectiveness of our method on unsupervised image-to-image translation, and demonstrate the novel advanced capabilities for semantic editing and mixed domain translation."
Know Your Self-supervised Learning: A Survey on Image-based Generative and Discriminative Training,"Although supervised learning has been highly successful in improving the state-of-the-art in the domain of image-based computer vision in the past, the margin of improvement has diminished significantly in recent years, indicating that a plateau is in sight. Meanwhile, the use of self-supervised learning (SSL) for the purpose of natural language processing (NLP) has seen tremendous successes during the past couple of years, with this new learning paradigm yielding powerful language models. Inspired by the excellent results obtained in the field of NLP, self-supervised methods that rely on clustering, contrastive learning, distillation, and information-maximization, which all fall under the banner of discriminative SSL, have experienced a swift uptake in the area of computer vision. Shortly afterwards, generative SSL frameworks that are mostly based on masked image modeling, complemented and surpassed the results obtained with discriminative SSL. Consequently, within a span of three years, over 100 unique general-purpose frameworks for generative and discriminative SSL, with a focus on imaging, were proposed. In this survey, we review a plethora of research efforts conducted on image-oriented SSL, providing a historic view and paying attention to best practices as well as useful software packages. While doing so, we discuss pretext tasks for image-based SSL, as well as techniques that are commonly used in image-based SSL. Lastly, to aid researchers who aim at contributing to image-focused SSL, we outline a number of promising research directions."
Not All Image Regions Matter: Masked Vector Quantization for Autoregressive Image Generation,"Existing autoregressive models follow the two-stage generation paradigm that first learns a codebook in the latent space for image reconstruction and then completes the image generation autoregressively based on the learned codebook. However, existing codebook learning simply models all local region information of images without distinguishing their different perceptual importance, which brings redundancy in the learned codebook that not only limits the next stage's autoregressive model's ability to model important structure but also results in high training cost and slow generation speed. In this study, we borrow the idea of importance perception from classical image coding theory and propose a novel two-stage framework, which consists of Masked Quantization VAE (MQ-VAE) and Stackformer, to relieve the model from modeling redundancy. Specifically, MQ-VAE incorporates an adaptive mask module for masking redundant region features before quantization and an adaptive de-mask module for recovering the original grid image feature map to faithfully reconstruct the original images after quantization. Then, Stackformer learns to predict the combination of the next code and its position in the feature map. Comprehensive experiments on various image generation validate our effectiveness and efficiency. Code will be released at https://github.com/CrossmodalGroup/MaskedVectorQuantization."
Enhancing Detail Preservation for Customized Text-to-Image Generation: A Regularization-Free Approach,"Recent text-to-image generation models have demonstrated impressive capability of generating text-aligned images with high fidelity. However, generating images of novel concept provided by the user input image is still a challenging task. To address this problem, researchers have been exploring various methods for customizing pre-trained text-to-image generation models. Currently, most existing methods for customizing pre-trained text-to-image generation models involve the use of regularization techniques to prevent over-fitting. While regularization will ease the challenge of customization and leads to successful content creation with respect to text guidance, it may restrict the model capability, resulting in the loss of detailed information and inferior performance. In this work, we propose a novel framework for customized text-to-image generation without the use of regularization. Specifically, our proposed framework consists of an encoder network and a novel sampling method which can tackle the over-fitting problem without the use of regularization. With the proposed framework, we are able to customize a large-scale text-to-image generation model within half a minute on single GPU, with only one image provided by the user. We demonstrate in experiments that our proposed framework outperforms existing methods, and preserves more fine-grained details."
"If at First You Don't Succeed, Try, Try Again: Faithful Diffusion-based Text-to-Image Generation by Selection","Despite their impressive capabilities, diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models can lack faithfulness to the text prompt, where generated images may not contain all the mentioned objects, attributes or relations. To alleviate these issues, recent works proposed post-hoc methods to improve model faithfulness without costly retraining, by modifying how the model utilizes the input prompt. In this work, we take a step back and show that large T2I diffusion models are more faithful than usually assumed, and can generate images faithful to even complex prompts without the need to manipulate the generative process. Based on that, we show how faithfulness can be simply treated as a candidate selection problem instead, and introduce a straightforward pipeline that generates candidate images for a text prompt and picks the best one according to an automatic scoring system that can leverage already existing T2I evaluation metrics. Quantitative comparisons alongside user studies on diverse benchmarks show consistently improved faithfulness over post-hoc enhancement methods, with comparable or lower computational cost. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/ExplainableML/ImageSelect}."
Iterative Adversarial Attack on Image-guided Story Ending Generation,"Multimodal learning involves developing models that can integrate information from various sources like images and texts. In this field, multimodal text generation is a crucial aspect that involves processing data from multiple modalities and outputting text. The image-guided story ending generation (IgSEG) is a particularly significant task, targeting on an understanding of complex relationships between text and image data with a complete story text ending. Unfortunately, deep neural networks, which are the backbone of recent IgSEG models, are vulnerable to adversarial samples. Current adversarial attack methods mainly focus on single-modality data and do not analyze adversarial attacks for multimodal text generation tasks that use cross-modal information. To this end, we propose an iterative adversarial attack method (Iterative-attack) that fuses image and text modality attacks, allowing for an attack search for adversarial text and image in an more effective iterative way. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing single-modal and non-iterative multimodal attack methods, indicating the potential for improving the adversarial robustness of multimodal text generation models, such as multimodal machine translation, multimodal question answering, etc."
AudioToken: Adaptation of Text-Conditioned Diffusion Models for Audio-to-Image Generation,"In recent years, image generation has shown a great leap in performance, where diffusion models play a central role. Although generating high-quality images, such models are mainly conditioned on textual descriptions. This begs the question: ""how can we adopt such models to be conditioned on other modalities?"". In this paper, we propose a novel method utilizing latent diffusion models trained for text-to-image-generation to generate images conditioned on audio recordings. Using a pre-trained audio encoding model, the proposed method encodes audio into a new token, which can be considered as an adaptation layer between the audio and text representations. Such a modeling paradigm requires a small number of trainable parameters, making the proposed approach appealing for lightweight optimization. Results suggest the proposed method is superior to the evaluated baseline methods, considering objective and subjective metrics. Code and samples are available at: https://pages.cs.huji.ac.il/adiyoss-lab/AudioToken."
SG-GAN: Fine Stereoscopic-Aware Generation for 3D Brain Point Cloud Up-sampling from a Single Image,"In minimally-invasive brain surgeries with indirect and narrow operating environments, 3D brain reconstruction is crucial. However, as requirements of accuracy for some new minimally-invasive surgeries (such as brain-computer interface surgery) are higher and higher, the outputs of conventional 3D reconstruction, such as point cloud (PC), are facing the challenges that sample points are too sparse and the precision is insufficient. On the other hand, there is a scarcity of high-density point cloud datasets, which makes it challenging to train models for direct reconstruction of high-density brain point clouds. In this work, a novel model named stereoscopic-aware graph generative adversarial network (SG-GAN) with two stages is proposed to generate fine high-density PC conditioned on a single image. The Stage-I GAN sketches the primitive shape and basic structure of the organ based on the given image, yielding Stage-I point clouds. The Stage-II GAN takes the results from Stage-I and generates high-density point clouds with detailed features. The Stage-II GAN is capable of correcting defects and restoring the detailed features of the region of interest (ROI) through the up-sampling process. Furthermore, a parameter-free-attention-based free-transforming module is developed to learn the efficient features of input, while upholding a promising performance. Comparing with the existing methods, the SG-GAN model shows superior performance in terms of visual quality, objective measurements, and performance in classification, as demonstrated by comprehensive results measured by several evaluation metrics including PC-to-PC error and Chamfer distance."
iWarpGAN: Disentangling Identity and Style to Generate Synthetic Iris Images,"Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown success in approximating complex distributions for synthetic image generation and for editing specific portions of an input image, particularly in faces. However, current GAN-based methods for generating biometric images, such as iris, have limitations in controlling the identity of the generated images, i.e., the synthetically generated images often closely resemble images in the training dataset. Further, the generated images often lack diversity in terms of the number of unique identities represented in them. To overcome these issues, we propose iWarpGAN that disentangles identity and style in the context of the iris modality by using two transformation pathways: Identity Transformation Pathway to generate unique identities from the training set, and Style Transformation Pathway to extract the style code from a reference image and output an iris image using this style. By concatenating the transformed identity code and reference style code, iWarpGAN generates iris images with both inter and intra-class variations. The efficacy of the proposed method in generating Iris DeepFakes is evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively using ISO/IEC 29794-6 Standard Quality Metrics and the VeriEye iris matcher. Finally, the utility of the synthetically generated images is demonstrated by improving the performance of multiple deep learning based iris matchers that augment synthetic data with real data during the training process."
SneakyPrompt: Evaluating Robustness of Text-to-image Generative Models' Safety Filters,"Text-to-image generative models such as Stable Diffusion and DALL\cdotE 2 have attracted much attention since their publication due to their wide application in the real world. One challenging problem of text-to-image generative models is the generation of Not-Safe-for-Work (NSFW) content, e.g., those related to violence and adult. Therefore, a common practice is to deploy a so-called safety filter, which blocks NSFW content based on either text or image features. Prior works have studied the possible bypass of such safety filters. However, existing works are largely manual and specific to Stable Diffusion's official safety filter. Moreover, the bypass ratio of Stable Diffusion's safety filter is as low as 23.51% based on our evaluation.  In this paper, we propose the first automated attack framework, called SneakyPrompt, to evaluate the robustness of real-world safety filters in state-of-the-art text-to-image generative models. Our key insight is to search for alternative tokens in a prompt that generates NSFW images so that the generated prompt (called an adversarial prompt) bypasses existing safety filters. Specifically, SneakyPrompt utilizes reinforcement learning (RL) to guide an agent with positive rewards on semantic similarity and bypass success.  Our evaluation shows that SneakyPrompt successfully generated NSFW content using an online model DALL\cdotE 2 with its default, closed-box safety filter enabled. At the same time, we also deploy several open-source state-of-the-art safety filters on a Stable Diffusion model and show that SneakyPrompt not only successfully generates NSFW content, but also outperforms existing adversarial attacks in terms of the number of queries and image qualities."
Towards Accurate Image Coding: Improved Autoregressive Image Generation with Dynamic Vector Quantization,"Existing vector quantization (VQ) based autoregressive models follow a two-stage generation paradigm that first learns a codebook to encode images as discrete codes, and then completes generation based on the learned codebook. However, they encode fixed-size image regions into fixed-length codes and ignore their naturally different information densities, which results in insufficiency in important regions and redundancy in unimportant ones, and finally degrades the generation quality and speed. Moreover, the fixed-length coding leads to an unnatural raster-scan autoregressive generation. To address the problem, we propose a novel two-stage framework: (1) Dynamic-Quantization VAE (DQ-VAE) which encodes image regions into variable-length codes based on their information densities for an accurate and compact code representation. (2) DQ-Transformer which thereby generates images autoregressively from coarse-grained (smooth regions with fewer codes) to fine-grained (details regions with more codes) by modeling the position and content of codes in each granularity alternately, through a novel stacked-transformer architecture and shared-content, non-shared position input layers designs. Comprehensive experiments on various generation tasks validate our superiorities in both effectiveness and efficiency. Code will be released at https://github.com/CrossmodalGroup/DynamicVectorQuantization."
LLM Itself Can Read and Generate CXR Images,"Building on the recent remarkable development of large language models (LLMs), active attempts are being made to extend the utility of LLMs to multimodal tasks. There have been previous efforts to link language and visual information, and attempts to add visual capabilities to LLMs are ongoing as well. However, existing attempts use LLMs only as image decoders and no attempt has been made to generate images in the same line as the natural language. By adopting a VQ-GAN framework in which latent representations of images are treated as a kind of text tokens, we present a novel method to fine-tune a pre-trained LLM to read and generate images like text without any structural changes, extra training objectives, or the need for training an ad-hoc network while still preserving the of the instruction-following capability of the LLM. We apply this framework to chest X-ray (CXR) image and report generation tasks as it is a domain in which translation of complex information between visual and language domains is important. The code is available at https://github.com/hyn2028/llm-cxr."
Collaborative Generative AI: Integrating GPT-k for Efficient Editing in Text-to-Image Generation,"The field of text-to-image (T2I) generation has garnered significant attention both within the research community and among everyday users. Despite the advancements of T2I models, a common issue encountered by users is the need for repetitive editing of input prompts in order to receive a satisfactory image, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Given the demonstrated text generation power of large-scale language models, such as GPT-k, we investigate the potential of utilizing such models to improve the prompt editing process for T2I generation. We conduct a series of experiments to compare the common edits made by humans and GPT-k, evaluate the performance of GPT-k in prompting T2I, and examine factors that may influence this process. We found that GPT-k models focus more on inserting modifiers while humans tend to replace words and phrases, which includes changes to the subject matter. Experimental results show that GPT-k are more effective in adjusting modifiers rather than predicting spontaneous changes in the primary subject matters. Adopting the edit suggested by GPT-k models may reduce the percentage of remaining edits by 20-30%."
Drag Your GAN: Interactive Point-based Manipulation on the Generative Image Manifold,"Synthesizing visual content that meets users' needs often requires flexible and precise controllability of the pose, shape, expression, and layout of the generated objects. Existing approaches gain controllability of generative adversarial networks (GANs) via manually annotated training data or a prior 3D model, which often lack flexibility, precision, and generality. In this work, we study a powerful yet much less explored way of controlling GANs, that is, to ""drag"" any points of the image to precisely reach target points in a user-interactive manner, as shown in Fig.1. To achieve this, we propose DragGAN, which consists of two main components: 1) a feature-based motion supervision that drives the handle point to move towards the target position, and 2) a new point tracking approach that leverages the discriminative generator features to keep localizing the position of the handle points. Through DragGAN, anyone can deform an image with precise control over where pixels go, thus manipulating the pose, shape, expression, and layout of diverse categories such as animals, cars, humans, landscapes, etc. As these manipulations are performed on the learned generative image manifold of a GAN, they tend to produce realistic outputs even for challenging scenarios such as hallucinating occluded content and deforming shapes that consistently follow the object's rigidity. Both qualitative and quantitative comparisons demonstrate the advantage of DragGAN over prior approaches in the tasks of image manipulation and point tracking. We also showcase the manipulation of real images through GAN inversion."
StawGAN: Structural-Aware Generative Adversarial Networks for Infrared Image Translation,"This paper addresses the problem of translating night-time thermal infrared images, which are the most adopted image modalities to analyze night-time scenes, to daytime color images (NTIT2DC), which provide better perceptions of objects. We introduce a novel model that focuses on enhancing the quality of the target generation without merely colorizing it. The proposed structural aware (StawGAN) enables the translation of better-shaped and high-definition objects in the target domain. We test our model on aerial images of the DroneVeichle dataset containing RGB-IR paired images. The proposed approach produces a more accurate translation with respect to other state-of-the-art image translation models. The source code is available at https://github.com/LuigiSigillo/StawGAN"
X-IQE: eXplainable Image Quality Evaluation for Text-to-Image Generation with Visual Large Language Models,"This paper introduces a novel explainable image quality evaluation approach called X-IQE, which leverages visual large language models (LLMs) to evaluate text-to-image generation methods by generating textual explanations. X-IQE utilizes a hierarchical Chain of Thought (CoT) to enable MiniGPT-4 to produce self-consistent, unbiased texts that are highly correlated with human evaluation. It offers several advantages, including the ability to distinguish between real and generated images, evaluate text-image alignment, and assess image aesthetics without requiring model training or fine-tuning. X-IQE is more cost-effective and efficient compared to human evaluation, while significantly enhancing the transparency and explainability of deep image quality evaluation models. We validate the effectiveness of our method as a benchmark using images generated by prevalent diffusion models. X-IQE demonstrates similar performance to state-of-the-art (SOTA) evaluation methods on COCO Caption, while overcoming the limitations of previous evaluation models on DrawBench, particularly in handling ambiguous generation prompts and text recognition in generated images.

AIwriting: Relations Between Image Generation and Digital Writing,"During 2022, both transformer-based AI text generation sys-tems such as GPT-3 and AI text-to-image generation systems such as DALL-E 2 and Stable Diffusion made exponential leaps forward and are unquestionably altering the fields of digital art and electronic literature. In this panel a group of electronic literature authors and theorists consider new oppor-tunities for human creativity presented by these systems and present new works have produced during the past year that specifically address these systems as environments for literary expressions that are translated through iterative interlocutive processes into visual representations. The premise that binds these presentations is that these systems and the works gener-ated must be considered from a literary perspective, as they originate in human writing. In works ranging from a visual memoir of the personal experience of a health crisis, to interac-tive web comics, to architectures based on abstract poetic language, to political satire, four artists explore the capabili-ties of these writing environments for new genres of literary artist practice, while a digital culture theorist considers the origins and effects of the particular training datasets of human language and images on which these new hybrid forms are based."
Learning Differentially Private Probabilistic Models for Privacy-Preserving Image Generation,"A number of deep models trained on high-quality and valuable images have been deployed in practical applications, which may pose a leakage risk of data privacy. Learning differentially private generative models can sidestep this challenge through indirect data access. However, such differentially private generative models learned by existing approaches can only generate images with a low-resolution of less than 128x128, hindering the widespread usage of generated images in downstream training. In this work, we propose learning differentially private probabilistic models (DPPM) to generate high-resolution images with differential privacy guarantee. In particular, we first train a model to fit the distribution of the training data and make it satisfy differential privacy by performing a randomized response mechanism during training process. Then we perform Hamiltonian dynamics sampling along with the differentially private movement direction predicted by the trained probabilistic model to obtain the privacy-preserving images. In this way, it is possible to apply these images to different downstream tasks while protecting private information. Notably, compared to other state-of-the-art differentially private generative approaches, our approach can generate images up to 256x256 with remarkable visual quality and data utility. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our approach."
INCLG: Inpainting for Non-Cleft Lip Generation with a Multi-Task Image Processing Network,"We present a software that predicts non-cleft facial images for patients with cleft lip, thereby facilitating the understanding, awareness and discussion of cleft lip surgeries. To protect patients privacy, we design a software framework using image inpainting, which does not require cleft lip images for training, thereby mitigating the risk of model leakage. We implement a novel multi-task architecture that predicts both the non-cleft facial image and facial landmarks, resulting in better performance as evaluated by surgeons. The software is implemented with PyTorch and is usable with consumer-level color images with a fast prediction speed, enabling effective deployment."
Smiling Women Pitching Down: Auditing Representational and Presentational Gender Biases in Image Generative AI,"Generative AI models like DALL-E 2 can interpret textual prompts and generate high-quality images exhibiting human creativity. Though public enthusiasm is booming, systematic auditing of potential gender biases in AI-generated images remains scarce. We addressed this gap by examining the prevalence of two occupational gender biases (representational and presentational biases) in 15,300 DALL-E 2 images spanning 153 occupations, and assessed potential bias amplification by benchmarking against 2021 census labor statistics and Google Images. Our findings reveal that DALL-E 2 underrepresents women in male-dominated fields while overrepresenting them in female-dominated occupations. Additionally, DALL-E 2 images tend to depict more women than men with smiling faces and downward-pitching heads, particularly in female-dominated (vs. male-dominated) occupations. Our computational algorithm auditing study demonstrates more pronounced representational and presentational biases in DALL-E 2 compared to Google Images and calls for feminist interventions to prevent such bias-laden AI-generated images to feedback into the media ecology."
FastComposer: Tuning-Free Multi-Subject Image Generation with Localized Attention,"Diffusion models excel at text-to-image generation, especially in subject-driven generation for personalized images. However, existing methods are inefficient due to the subject-specific fine-tuning, which is computationally intensive and hampers efficient deployment. Moreover, existing methods struggle with multi-subject generation as they often blend features among subjects. We present FastComposer which enables efficient, personalized, multi-subject text-to-image generation without fine-tuning. FastComposer uses subject embeddings extracted by an image encoder to augment the generic text conditioning in diffusion models, enabling personalized image generation based on subject images and textual instructions with only forward passes. To address the identity blending problem in the multi-subject generation, FastComposer proposes cross-attention localization supervision during training, enforcing the attention of reference subjects localized to the correct regions in the target images. Naively conditioning on subject embeddings results in subject overfitting. FastComposer proposes delayed subject conditioning in the denoising step to maintain both identity and editability in subject-driven image generation. FastComposer generates images of multiple unseen individuals with different styles, actions, and contexts. It achieves 300\times-2500\times speedup compared to fine-tuning-based methods and requires zero extra storage for new subjects. FastComposer paves the way for efficient, personalized, and high-quality multi-subject image creation. Code, model, and dataset are available at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/fastcomposer."
Fusion-S2iGan: An Efficient and Effective Single-Stage Framework for Speech-to-Image Generation,"The goal of a speech-to-image transform is to produce a photo-realistic picture directly from a speech signal. Recently, various studies have focused on this task and have achieved promising performance. However, current speech-to-image approaches are based on a stacked modular framework that suffers from three vital issues: 1) Training separate networks is time-consuming as well as inefficient and the convergence of the final generative model strongly depends on the previous generators; 2) The quality of precursor images is ignored by this architecture; 3) Multiple discriminator networks are required to be trained. To this end, we propose an efficient and effective single-stage framework called Fusion-S2iGan to yield perceptually plausible and semantically consistent image samples on the basis of given spoken descriptions. Fusion-S2iGan introduces a visual+speech fusion module (VSFM), constructed with a pixel-attention module (PAM), a speech-modulation module (SMM) and a weighted-fusion module (WFM), to inject the speech embedding from a speech encoder into the generator while improving the quality of synthesized pictures. Fusion-S2iGan spreads the bimodal information over all layers of the generator network to reinforce the visual feature maps at various hierarchical levels in the architecture. We conduct a series of experiments on four benchmark data sets, i.e., CUB birds, Oxford-102, Flickr8k and Places-subset. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the presented Fusion-S2iGan compared to the state-of-the-art models with a multi-stage architecture and a performance level that is close to traditional text-to-image approaches."
A Method for Training-free Person Image Picture Generation,"The current state-of-the-art Diffusion model has demonstrated excellent results in generating images. However, the images are monotonous and are mostly the result of the distribution of images of people in the training set, making it challenging to generate multiple images for a fixed number of individuals. This problem can often only be solved by fine-tuning the training of the model. This means that each individual/animated character image must be trained if it is to be drawn, and the hardware and cost of this training is often beyond the reach of the average user, who accounts for the largest number of people. To solve this problem, the Character Image Feature Encoder model proposed in this paper enables the user to use the process by simply providing a picture of the character to make the image of the character in the generated image match the expectation. In addition, various details can be adjusted during the process using prompts. Unlike traditional Image-to-Image models, the Character Image Feature Encoder extracts only the relevant image features, rather than information about the model's composition or movements. In addition, the Character Image Feature Encoder can be adapted to different models after training. The proposed model can be conveniently incorporated into the Stable Diffusion generation process without modifying the model's ontology or used in combination with Stable Diffusion as a joint model."
A Comparative Study of GAN-Generated Handwriting Images and MNIST Images using t-SNE Visualization,"The quality of GAN-generated images on the MNIST dataset was explored in this paper by comparing them to the original images using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t- SNE) visualization. A GAN was trained with the dataset to generate images and the result of generating all synthetic images, the corresponding labels were saved. The dimensionality of the generated images and the original MNIST dataset was reduced using t-SNE and the resulting embeddings were plotted. The rate of the GAN-generated images was examined by comparing the t-SNE plots of the generated images and the original MNIST images. It was found that the GAN- generated images were similar to the original images but had some differences in the distribution of the features. It is believed that this study provides a useful evaluation method for assessing the quality of GAN-generated images and can help to improve their generation in the future."
Urban-StyleGAN: Learning to Generate and Manipulate Images of Urban Scenes,"A promise of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is to provide cheap photorealistic data for training and validating AI models in autonomous driving. Despite their huge success, their performance on complex images featuring multiple objects is understudied. While some frameworks produce high-quality street scenes with little to no control over the image content, others offer more control at the expense of high-quality generation. A common limitation of both approaches is the use of global latent codes for the whole image, which hinders the learning of independent object distributions. Motivated by SemanticStyleGAN (SSG), a recent work on latent space disentanglement in human face generation, we propose a novel framework, Urban-StyleGAN, for urban scene generation and manipulation. We find that a straightforward application of SSG leads to poor results because urban scenes are more complex than human faces. To provide a more compact yet disentangled latent representation, we develop a class grouping strategy wherein individual classes are grouped into super-classes. Moreover, we employ an unsupervised latent exploration algorithm in the \mathcal{S}-space of the generator and show that it is more efficient than the conventional \mathcal{W}^{+}-space in controlling the image content. Results on the Cityscapes and Mapillary datasets show the proposed approach achieves significantly more controllability and improved image quality than previous approaches on urban scenes and is on par with general-purpose non-controllable generative models (like StyleGAN2) in terms of quality."
Generative Adversarial Networks for Spatio-Spectral Compression of Hyperspectral Images,"Deep learning-based image compression methods have led to high rate-distortion performances compared to traditional codecs. Recently, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)-based compression models, e.g., High Fidelity Compression (HiFiC), have attracted great attention in the computer vision community. However, most of these works aim for spatial compression only and do not consider the spatio-spectral redundancies observed in hyperspectral images (HSIs). To address this problem, in this paper, we adapt the HiFiC spatial compression model to perform spatio-spectral compression of HSIs. To this end, we introduce two new models: i) HiFiC using Squeeze and Excitation (SE) blocks (denoted as HiFiC_{SE}); and ii) HiFiC with 3D convolutions (denoted as HiFiC_{3D}). We analyze the effectiveness of HiFiC_{SE} and HiFiC_{3D} in exploiting the spatio-spectral redundancies with channel attention and inter-dependency analysis. Experimental results show the efficacy of the proposed models in performing spatio-spectral compression and reconstruction at reduced bitrates and higher reconstruction quality when compared to JPEG 2000 and the standard HiFiC spatial compression model. The code of the proposed models is publicly available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/HSI-SSC ."
Exploiting Frequency Spectrum of Adversarial Images for General Robustness,"In recent years, there has been growing concern over the vulnerability of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to image perturbations. However, achieving general robustness against different types of perturbations remains challenging, in which enhancing robustness to some perturbations (e.g., adversarial perturbations) may degrade others (e.g., common corruptions). In this paper, we demonstrate that adversarial training with an emphasis on phase components significantly improves model performance on clean, adversarial, and common corruption accuracies. We propose a frequency-based data augmentation method, Adversarial Amplitude Swap, that swaps the amplitude spectrum between clean and adversarial images to generate two novel training images: adversarial amplitude and adversarial phase images. These images act as substitutes for adversarial images and can be implemented in various adversarial training setups. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method enables the CNNs to gain general robustness against different types of perturbations and results in a uniform performance against all types of common corruptions."
Generation of Structurally Realistic Retinal Fundus Images with Diffusion Models,"We introduce a new technique for generating retinal fundus images that have anatomically accurate vascular structures, using diffusion models. We generate artery/vein masks to create the vascular structure, which we then condition to produce retinal fundus images. The proposed method can generate high-quality images with more realistic vascular structures and can create a diverse range of images based on the strengths of the diffusion model. We present quantitative evaluations that demonstrate the performance improvement using our method for data augmentation on vessel segmentation and artery/vein classification. We also present Turing test results by clinical experts, showing that our generated images are difficult to distinguish with real images. We believe that our method can be applied to construct stand-alone datasets that are irrelevant of patient privacy."
WeditGAN: Few-shot Image Generation via Latent Space Relocation,"In few-shot image generation, directly training GAN models on just a handful of images faces the risk of overfitting. A popular solution is to transfer the models pretrained on large source domains to small target ones. In this work, we introduce WeditGAN, which realizes model transfer by editing the intermediate latent codes w in StyleGANs with learned constant offsets (Δw), discovering and constructing target latent spaces via simply relocating the distribution of source latent spaces. The established one-to-one mapping between latent spaces can naturally prevents mode collapse and overfitting. Besides, we also propose variants of WeditGAN to further enhance the relocation process by regularizing the direction or finetuning the intensity of Δw. Experiments on a collection of widely used source/target datasets manifest the capability of WeditGAN in generating realistic and diverse images, which is simple yet highly effective in the research area of few-shot image generation."
Echo from noise: synthetic ultrasound image generation using diffusion models for real image segmentation,"We propose a novel pipeline for the generation of synthetic images via Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) guided by cardiac ultrasound semantic label maps. We show that these synthetic images can serve as a viable substitute for real data in the training of deep-learning models for medical image analysis tasks such as image segmentation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, we generated synthetic 2D echocardiography images and trained a neural network for segmentation of the left ventricle and left atrium. The performance of the network trained on exclusively synthetic images was evaluated on an unseen dataset of real images and yielded mean Dice scores of 88.5 \pm 6.0 , 92.3 \pm 3.9, 86.3 \pm 10.7 \% for left ventricular endocardial, epicardial and left atrial segmentation respectively. This represents an increase of 9.09, 3.7 and 15.0 \% in Dice scores compared to the previous state-of-the-art. The proposed pipeline has the potential for application to a wide range of other tasks across various medical imaging modalities."
Semantic Embedded Deep Neural Network: A Generic Approach to Boost Multi-Label Image Classification Performance,"Fine-grained multi-label classification models have broad applications in Amazon production features, such as visual based label predictions ranging from fashion attribute detection to brand recognition. One challenge to achieve satisfactory performance for those classification tasks in real world is the wild visual background signal that contains irrelevant pixels which confuses model to focus onto the region of interest and make prediction upon the specific region. In this paper, we introduce a generic semantic-embedding deep neural network to apply the spatial awareness semantic feature incorporating a channel-wise attention based model to leverage the localization guidance to boost model performance for multi-label prediction. We observed an Avg.relative improvement of 15.27% in terms of AUC score across all labels compared to the baseline approach. Core experiment and ablation studies involve multi-label fashion attribute classification performed on Instagram fashion apparels' image. We compared the model performances among our approach, baseline approach, and 3 alternative approaches to leverage semantic features. Results show favorable performance for our approach."
Adaptive Domain Generalization for Digital Pathology Images,"In AI-based histopathology, domain shifts are common and well-studied. However, this research focuses on stain and scanner variations, which do not show the full picture -- shifts may be combinations of other shifts, or ""invisible"" shifts that are not obvious but still damage performance of machine learning models. Furthermore, it is important for models to generalize to these shifts without expensive or scarce annotations, especially in the histopathology space and if wanting to deploy models on a larger scale. Thus, there is a need for ""reactive"" domain generalization techniques: ones that adapt to domain shifts at test-time rather than requiring predictions of or examples of the shifts at training time. We conduct a literature review and introduce techniques that react to domain shifts rather than requiring a prediction of them in advance. We investigate test time training, a technique for domain generalization that adapts model parameters at test-time through optimization of a secondary self-supervised task."
Learning to Evaluate the Artness of AI-generated Images,"Assessing the artness of AI-generated images continues to be a challenge within the realm of image generation. Most existing metrics cannot be used to perform instance-level and reference-free artness evaluation. This paper presents ArtScore, a metric designed to evaluate the degree to which an image resembles authentic artworks by artists (or conversely photographs), thereby offering a novel approach to artness assessment. We first blend pre-trained models for photo and artwork generation, resulting in a series of mixed models. Subsequently, we utilize these mixed models to generate images exhibiting varying degrees of artness with pseudo-annotations. Each photorealistic image has a corresponding artistic counterpart and a series of interpolated images that range from realistic to artistic. This dataset is then employed to train a neural network that learns to estimate quantized artness levels of arbitrary images. Extensive experiments reveal that the artness levels predicted by ArtScore align more closely with human artistic evaluation than existing evaluation metrics, such as Gram loss and ArtFID."
Robust Image Ordinal Regression with Controllable Image Generation,"Image ordinal regression has been mainly studied along the line of exploiting the order of categories. However, the issues of class imbalance and category overlap that are very common in ordinal regression were largely overlooked. As a result, the performance on minority categories is often unsatisfactory. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called CIG based on controllable image generation to directly tackle these two issues. Our main idea is to generate extra training samples with specific labels near category boundaries, and the sample generation is biased toward the less-represented categories. To achieve controllable image generation, we seek to separate structural and categorical information of images based on structural similarity, categorical similarity, and reconstruction constraints. We evaluate the effectiveness of our new CIG approach in three different image ordinal regression scenarios. The results demonstrate that CIG can be flexibly integrated with off-the-shelf image encoders or ordinal regression models to achieve improvement, and further, the improvement is more significant for minority categories."
LEO: Generative Latent Image Animator for Human Video Synthesis,"Spatio-temporal coherency is a major challenge in synthesizing high quality videos, particularly in synthesizing human videos that contain rich global and local deformations. To resolve this challenge, previous approaches have resorted to different features in the generation process aimed at representing appearance and motion. However, in the absence of strict mechanisms to guarantee such disentanglement, a separation of motion from appearance has remained challenging, resulting in spatial distortions and temporal jittering that break the spatio-temporal coherency. Motivated by this, we here propose LEO, a novel framework for human video synthesis, placing emphasis on spatio-temporal coherency. Our key idea is to represent motion as a sequence of flow maps in the generation process, which inherently isolate motion from appearance. We implement this idea via a flow-based image animator and a Latent Motion Diffusion Model (LMDM). The former bridges a space of motion codes with the space of flow maps, and synthesizes video frames in a warp-and-inpaint manner. LMDM learns to capture motion prior in the training data by synthesizing sequences of motion codes. Extensive quantitative and qualitative analysis suggests that LEO significantly improves coherent synthesis of human videos over previous methods on the datasets TaichiHD, FaceForensics and CelebV-HQ. In addition, the effective disentanglement of appearance and motion in LEO allows for two additional tasks, namely infinite-length human video synthesis, as well as content-preserving video editing."
Data Curation for Image Captioning with Text-to-Image Generative Models,"Recent advances in image captioning are mainly driven by large-scale vision-language pretraining, relying heavily on computational resources and increasingly large multimodal datasets. Instead of scaling up pretraining data, we ask whether it is possible to improve performance by improving the quality of the samples in existing datasets. We pursue this question through two approaches to data curation: one that assumes that some examples should be avoided due to mismatches between the image and caption, and one that assumes that the mismatch can be addressed by replacing the image, for which we use the state-of-the-art Stable Diffusion model. These approaches are evaluated using the BLIP model on MS COCO and Flickr30K in both finetuning and few-shot learning settings. Our simple yet effective approaches consistently outperform baselines, indicating that better image captioning models can be trained by curating existing resources. Finally, we conduct a human study to understand the errors made by the Stable Diffusion model and highlight directions for future work in text-to-image generation."
Breast Cancer Immunohistochemical Image Generation: a Benchmark Dataset and Challenge Review,"For invasive breast cancer, immunohistochemical (IHC) techniques are often used to detect the expression level of human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) in breast tissue to formulate a precise treatment plan. From the perspective of saving manpower, material and time costs, directly generating IHC-stained images from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained images is a valuable research direction. Therefore, we held the breast cancer immunohistochemical image generation challenge, aiming to explore novel ideas of deep learning technology in pathological image generation and promote research in this field. The challenge provided registered H&E and IHC-stained image pairs, and participants were required to use these images to train a model that can directly generate IHC-stained images from corresponding H&E-stained images. We selected and reviewed the five highest-ranking methods based on their PSNR and SSIM metrics, while also providing overviews of the corresponding pipelines and implementations. In this paper, we further analyze the current limitations in the field of breast cancer immunohistochemical image generation and forecast the future development of this field. We hope that the released dataset and the challenge will inspire more scholars to jointly study higher-quality IHC-stained image generation."
DisenBooth: Identity-Preserving Disentangled Tuning for Subject-Driven Text-to-Image Generation,"Subject-driven text-to-image generation aims to generate customized images of the given subject based on the text descriptions, which has drawn increasing attention recently. Existing methods mainly resort to finetuning a pretrained generative model, where the identity-relevant information and the identity-irrelevant information are entangled in the latent embedding space. However, the highly entangled latent embedding may lead to the failure of subject-driven text-to-image generation as follows: (i) the identity-irrelevant information hidden in the entangled embedding may dominate the generation process, resulting in the generated images heavily dependent on the irrelevant information while ignoring the given text descriptions; (ii) the identity-relevant information carried in the entangled embedding can not be appropriately preserved, resulting in identity change of the subject in the generated images. To tackle the problems, we propose DisenBooth, an identity-preserving disentangled tuning framework for subject-driven text-to-image generation in this paper. Specifically, DisenBooth finetunes the pretrained diffusion model in the denoising process. Different from previous works that utilize an entangled embedding to denoise each image, DisenBooth instead utilizes disentangled embeddings to respectively preserve the subject identity and capture the identity-irrelevant information. We further design the novel weak denoising and contrastive embedding auxiliary tuning objectives to achieve the disentanglement. Extensive experiments show that our proposed DisenBooth framework outperforms baseline models for subject-driven text-to-image generation with the identity-preserved embedding. Additionally, by combining the identity-preserved embedding and identity-irrelevant embedding, DisenBooth demonstrates more generation flexibility and controllability."
Meta-Learning Enabled Score-Based Generative Model for 1.5T-Like Image Reconstruction from 0.5T MRI,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is known to have reduced signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) at lower field strengths, leading to signal degradation when producing a low-field MRI image from a high-field one. Therefore, reconstructing a high-field-like image from a low-field MRI is a complex problem due to the ill-posed nature of the task. Additionally, obtaining paired low-field and high-field MR images is often not practical. We theoretically uncovered that the combination of these challenges renders conventional deep learning methods that directly learn the mapping from a low-field MR image to a high-field MR image unsuitable. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel meta-learning approach that employs a teacher-student mechanism. Firstly, an optimal-transport-driven teacher learns the degradation process from high-field to low-field MR images and generates pseudo-paired high-field and low-field MRI images. Then, a score-based student solves the inverse problem of reconstructing a high-field-like MR image from a low-field MRI within the framework of iterative regularization, by learning the joint distribution of pseudo-paired images to act as a regularizer. Experimental results on real low-field MRI data demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art unpaired learning methods."
AG3D: Learning to Generate 3D Avatars from 2D Image Collections,"While progress in 2D generative models of human appearance has been rapid, many applications require 3D avatars that can be animated and rendered. Unfortunately, most existing methods for learning generative models of 3D humans with diverse shape and appearance require 3D training data, which is limited and expensive to acquire. The key to progress is hence to learn generative models of 3D avatars from abundant unstructured 2D image collections. However, learning realistic and complete 3D appearance and geometry in this under-constrained setting remains challenging, especially in the presence of loose clothing such as dresses. In this paper, we propose a new adversarial generative model of realistic 3D people from 2D images. Our method captures shape and deformation of the body and loose clothing by adopting a holistic 3D generator and integrating an efficient and flexible articulation module. To improve realism, we train our model using multiple discriminators while also integrating geometric cues in the form of predicted 2D normal maps. We experimentally find that our method outperforms previous 3D- and articulation-aware methods in terms of geometry and appearance. We validate the effectiveness of our model and the importance of each component via systematic ablation studies."
District-scale surface temperatures generated from high-resolution longitudinal thermal infrared images,"The paper describes a dataset that was collected by infrared thermography, which is a non-contact, non-intrusive technique to collect data and analyze the built environment in various aspects. While most studies focus on the city and building scales, the rooftop observatory provides high temporal and spatial resolution observations with dynamic interactions on the district scale. The rooftop infrared thermography observatory with a multi-modal platform that is capable of assessing a wide range of dynamic processes in urban systems was deployed in Singapore. It was placed on the top of two buildings that overlook the outdoor context of the campus of the National University of Singapore. The platform collects remote sensing data from tropical areas on a temporal scale, allowing users to determine the temperature trend of individual features such as buildings, roads, and vegetation. The dataset includes 1,365,921 thermal images collected on average at approximately 10 seconds intervals from two locations during ten months."
Pick-a-Pic: An Open Dataset of User Preferences for Text-to-Image Generation,"The ability to collect a large dataset of human preferences from text-to-image users is usually limited to companies, making such datasets inaccessible to the public. To address this issue, we create a web app that enables text-to-image users to generate images and specify their preferences. Using this web app we build Pick-a-Pic, a large, open dataset of text-to-image prompts and real users' preferences over generated images. We leverage this dataset to train a CLIP-based scoring function, PickScore, which exhibits superhuman performance on the task of predicting human preferences. Then, we test PickScore's ability to perform model evaluation and observe that it correlates better with human rankings than other automatic evaluation metrics. Therefore, we recommend using PickScore for evaluating future text-to-image generation models, and using Pick-a-Pic prompts as a more relevant dataset than MS-COCO. Finally, we demonstrate how PickScore can enhance existing text-to-image models via ranking."
Generating Texture for 3D Human Avatar from a Single Image using Sampling and Refinement Networks,"There has been significant progress in generating an animatable 3D human avatar from a single image. However, recovering texture for the 3D human avatar from a single image has been relatively less addressed. Because the generated 3D human avatar reveals the occluded texture of the given image as it moves, it is critical to synthesize the occluded texture pattern that is unseen from the source image. To generate a plausible texture map for 3D human avatars, the occluded texture pattern needs to be synthesized with respect to the visible texture from the given image. Moreover, the generated texture should align with the surface of the target 3D mesh. In this paper, we propose a texture synthesis method for a 3D human avatar that incorporates geometry information. The proposed method consists of two convolutional networks for the sampling and refining process. The sampler network fills in the occluded regions of the source image and aligns the texture with the surface of the target 3D mesh using the geometry information. The sampled texture is further refined and adjusted by the refiner network. To maintain the clear details in the given image, both sampled and refined texture is blended to produce the final texture map. To effectively guide the sampler network to achieve its goal, we designed a curriculum learning scheme that starts from a simple sampling task and gradually progresses to the task where the alignment needs to be considered. We conducted experiments to show that our method outperforms previous methods qualitatively and quantitatively."
LD-GAN: Low-Dimensional Generative Adversarial Network for Spectral Image Generation with Variance Regularization,"Deep learning methods are state-of-the-art for spectral image (SI) computational tasks. However, these methods are constrained in their performance since available datasets are limited due to the highly expensive and long acquisition time. Usually, data augmentation techniques are employed to mitigate the lack of data. Surpassing classical augmentation methods, such as geometric transformations, GANs enable diverse augmentation by learning and sampling from the data distribution. Nevertheless, GAN-based SI generation is challenging since the high-dimensionality nature of this kind of data hinders the convergence of the GAN training yielding to suboptimal generation. To surmount this limitation, we propose low-dimensional GAN (LD-GAN), where we train the GAN employing a low-dimensional representation of the {dataset} with the latent space of a pretrained autoencoder network. Thus, we generate new low-dimensional samples which are then mapped to the SI dimension with the pretrained decoder network. Besides, we propose a statistical regularization to control the low-dimensional representation variance for the autoencoder training and to achieve high diversity of samples generated with the GAN. We validate our method LD-GAN as data augmentation strategy for compressive spectral imaging, SI super-resolution, and RBG to spectral tasks with improvements varying from 0.5 to 1 [dB] in each task respectively. We perform comparisons against the non-data augmentation training, traditional DA, and with the same GAN adjusted and trained to generate the full-sized SIs. The code of this paper can be found in https://github.com/romanjacome99/LD_GAN.git"
Let the Chart Spark: Embedding Semantic Context into Chart with Text-to-Image Generative Model,"Pictorial visualization seamlessly integrates data and semantic context into visual representation, conveying complex information in a manner that is both engaging and informative. Extensive studies have been devoted to developing authoring tools to simplify the creation of pictorial visualizations. However, mainstream works mostly follow a retrieving-and-editing pipeline that heavily relies on retrieved visual elements from a dedicated corpus, which often compromise the data integrity. Text-guided generation methods are emerging, but may have limited applicability due to its predefined recognized entities. In this work, we propose ChartSpark, a novel system that embeds semantic context into chart based on text-to-image generative model. ChartSpark generates pictorial visualizations conditioned on both semantic context conveyed in textual inputs and data information embedded in plain charts. The method is generic for both foreground and background pictorial generation, satisfying the design practices identified from an empirical research into existing pictorial visualizations. We further develop an interactive visual interface that integrates a text analyzer, editing module, and evaluation module to enable users to generate, modify, and assess pictorial visualizations. We experimentally demonstrate the usability of our tool, and conclude with a discussion of the potential of using text-to-image generative model combined with interactive interface for visualization design."
It is all about where you start: Text-to-image generation with seed selection,"Text-to-image diffusion models can synthesize a large variety of concepts in new compositions and scenarios. However, they still struggle with generating uncommon concepts, rare unusual combinations, or structured concepts like hand palms. Their limitation is partly due to the long-tail nature of their training data: web-crawled data sets are strongly unbalanced, causing models to under-represent concepts from the tail of the distribution. Here we characterize the effect of unbalanced training data on text-to-image models and offer a remedy. We show that rare concepts can be correctly generated by carefully selecting suitable generation seeds in the noise space, a technique that we call SeedSelect. SeedSelect is efficient and does not require retraining the diffusion model. We evaluate the benefit of SeedSelect on a series of problems. First, in few-shot semantic data augmentation, where we generate semantically correct images for few-shot and long-tail benchmarks. We show classification improvement on all classes, both from the head and tail of the training data of diffusion models. We further evaluate SeedSelect on correcting images of hands, a well-known pitfall of current diffusion models, and show that it improves hand generation substantially."
ganX -- generate artificially new XRF a python library to generate MA-XRF raw data out of RGB images,"In this paper we present the first version of ganX -- generate artificially new XRF, a Python library to generate X-ray fluorescence Macro maps (MA-XRF) from a coloured RGB image. To do that, a Monte Carlo method is used, where each MA-XRF pixel signal is sampled out of an XRF signal probability function. Such probability function is computed using a database of couples (pigment characteristic XRF signal, RGB), by a weighted sum of such pigment XRF signal by proximity of the image RGB to the pigment characteristic RGB. The library is released to PyPi and the code is available open source on GitHub."
Edit Everything: A Text-Guided Generative System for Images Editing,"We introduce a new generative system called Edit Everything, which can take image and text inputs and produce image outputs. Edit Everything allows users to edit images using simple text instructions. Our system designs prompts to guide the visual module in generating requested images. Experiments demonstrate that Edit Everything facilitates the implementation of the visual aspects of Stable Diffusion with the use of Segment Anything model and CLIP. Our system is publicly available at https://github.com/DefengXie/Edit_Everything."
Controllable Image Generation via Collage Representations,"Recent advances in conditional generative image models have enabled impressive results. On the one hand, text-based conditional models have achieved remarkable generation quality, by leveraging large-scale datasets of image-text pairs. To enable fine-grained controllability, however, text-based models require long prompts, whose details may be ignored by the model. On the other hand, layout-based conditional models have also witnessed significant advances. These models rely on bounding boxes or segmentation maps for precise spatial conditioning in combination with coarse semantic labels. The semantic labels, however, cannot be used to express detailed appearance characteristics. In this paper, we approach fine-grained scene controllability through image collages which allow a rich visual description of the desired scene as well as the appearance and location of the objects therein, without the need of class nor attribute labels. We introduce ""mixing and matching scenes"" (M&Ms), an approach that consists of an adversarially trained generative image model which is conditioned on appearance features and spatial positions of the different elements in a collage, and integrates these into a coherent image. We train our model on the OpenImages (OI) dataset and evaluate it on collages derived from OI and MS-COCO datasets. Our experiments on the OI dataset show that M&Ms outperforms baselines in terms of fine-grained scene controllability while being very competitive in terms of image quality and sample diversity. On the MS-COCO dataset, we highlight the generalization ability of our model by outperforming DALL-E in terms of the zero-shot FID metric, despite using two magnitudes fewer parameters and data. Collage based generative models have the potential to advance content creation in an efficient and effective way as they are intuitive to use and yield high quality generations."
Ray Conditioning: Trading Photo-consistency for Photo-realism in Multi-view Image Generation,"Multi-view image generation attracts particular attention these days due to its promising 3D-related applications, e.g., image viewpoint editing. Most existing methods follow a paradigm where a 3D representation is first synthesized, and then rendered into 2D images to ensure photo-consistency across viewpoints. However, such explicit bias for photo-consistency sacrifices photo-realism, causing geometry artifacts and loss of fine-scale details when these methods are applied to edit real images. To address this issue, we propose ray conditioning, a geometry-free alternative that relaxes the photo-consistency constraint. Our method generates multi-view images by conditioning a 2D GAN on a light field prior. With explicit viewpoint control, state-of-the-art photo-realism and identity consistency, our method is particularly suited for the viewpoint editing task."
Generating Procedural Materials from Text or Image Prompts,"Node graph systems are used ubiquitously for material design in computer graphics. They allow the use of visual programming to achieve desired effects without writing code. As high-level design tools they provide convenience and flexibility, but mastering the creation of node graphs usually requires professional training. We propose an algorithm capable of generating multiple node graphs from different types of prompts, significantly lowering the bar for users to explore a specific design space. Previous work was limited to unconditional generation of random node graphs, making the generation of an envisioned material challenging. We propose a multi-modal node graph generation neural architecture for high-quality procedural material synthesis which can be conditioned on different inputs (text or image prompts), using a CLIP-based encoder. We also create a substantially augmented material graph dataset, key to improving the generation quality. Finally, we generate high-quality graph samples using a regularized sampling process and improve the matching quality by differentiable optimization for top-ranked samples. We compare our methods to CLIP-based database search baselines (which are themselves novel) and achieve superior or similar performance without requiring massive data storage. We further show that our model can produce a set of material graphs unconditionally, conditioned on images, text prompts or partial graphs, serving as a tool for automatic visual programming completion."
Seeing is not always believing: A Quantitative Study on Human Perception of AI-Generated Images,"Photos serve as a way for humans to record what they experience in their daily lives, and they are often regarded as trustworthy sources of information. However, there is a growing concern that the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technology may produce fake photos, which can create confusion and diminish trust in photographs. This study aims to answer the question of whether the current state-of-the-art AI-based visual content generation models can consistently deceive human eyes and convey false information. By conducting a high-quality quantitative study with fifty participants, we reveal, for the first time, that humans cannot distinguish between real photos and AI-created fake photos to a significant degree 38.7%. Our study also finds that an individual's background, such as their gender, age, and experience with AI-generated content (AIGC), does not significantly affect their ability to distinguish AI-generated images from real photographs. However, we do observe that there tend to be certain defects in AI-generated images that serve as cues for people to distinguish between real and fake photos. We hope that our study can raise awareness of the potential risks of AI-generated images and encourage further research to prevent the spread of false information. From a positive perspective, AI-generated images have the potential to revolutionize various industries and create a better future for humanity if they are used and regulated properly."
GlyphDiffusion: Text Generation as Image Generation,"Diffusion models have become a new generative paradigm for text generation. Considering the discrete categorical nature of text, in this paper, we propose GlyphDiffusion, a novel diffusion approach for text generation via text-guided image generation. Our key idea is to render the target text as a glyph image containing visual language content. In this way, conditional text generation can be cast as a glyph image generation task, and it is then natural to apply continuous diffusion models to discrete texts. Specially, we utilize a cascaded architecture (ie a base and a super-resolution diffusion model) to generate high-fidelity glyph images, conditioned on the input text. Furthermore, we design a text grounding module to transform and refine the visual language content from generated glyph images into the final texts. In experiments over four conditional text generation tasks and two classes of metrics (ie quality and diversity), GlyphDiffusion can achieve comparable or even better results than several baselines, including pretrained language models. Our model also makes significant improvements compared to the recent diffusion model."
Improving Synthetically Generated Image Detection in Cross-Concept Settings,"New advancements for the detection of synthetic images are critical for fighting disinformation, as the capabilities of generative AI models continuously evolve and can lead to hyper-realistic synthetic imagery at unprecedented scale and speed. In this paper, we focus on the challenge of generalizing across different concept classes, e.g., when training a detector on human faces and testing on synthetic animal images - highlighting the ineffectiveness of existing approaches that randomly sample generated images to train their models. By contrast, we propose an approach based on the premise that the robustness of the detector can be enhanced by training it on realistic synthetic images that are selected based on their quality scores according to a probabilistic quality estimation model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by conducting experiments with generated images from two seminal architectures, StyleGAN2 and Latent Diffusion, and using three different concepts for each, so as to measure the cross-concept generalization ability. Our results show that our quality-based sampling method leads to higher detection performance for nearly all concepts, improving the overall effectiveness of the synthetic image detectors."
GRIG: Few-Shot Generative Residual Image Inpainting,"Image inpainting is the task of filling in missing or masked region of an image with semantically meaningful contents. Recent methods have shown significant improvement in dealing with large-scale missing regions. However, these methods usually require large training datasets to achieve satisfactory results and there has been limited research into training these models on a small number of samples. To address this, we present a novel few-shot generative residual image inpainting method that produces high-quality inpainting results. The core idea is to propose an iterative residual reasoning method that incorporates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and Transformers for global reasoning within generative adversarial networks, along with image-level and patch-level discriminators. We also propose a novel forgery-patch adversarial training strategy to create faithful textures and detailed appearances. Extensive evaluations show that our method outperforms previous methods on the few-shot image inpainting task, both quantitatively and qualitatively."
Deep reproductive feature generation framework for the diagnosis of COVID-19 and viral pneumonia using chest X-ray images,"The rapid and accurate detection of COVID-19 cases is critical for timely treatment and preventing the spread of the disease. In this study, a two-stage feature extraction framework using eight state-of-the-art pre-trained deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and an autoencoder is proposed to determine the health conditions of patients (COVID-19, Normal, Viral Pneumonia) based on chest X-rays. The X-ray scans are divided into four equally sized sections and analyzed by deep pre-trained CNNs. Subsequently, an autoencoder with three hidden layers is trained to extract reproductive features from the concatenated ouput of CNNs. To evaluate the performance of the proposed framework, three different classifiers, which are single-layer perceptron (SLP), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and support vector machine (SVM) are used. Furthermore, the deep CNN architectures are used to create benchmark models and trained on the same dataset for comparision. The proposed framework outperforms other frameworks wih pre-trained feature extractors in binary classification and shows competitive results in three-class classification. The proposed methodology is task-independent and suitable for addressing various problems. The results show that the discriminative features are a subset of the reproductive features, suggesting that extracting task-independent features is superior to the extraction only task-based features. The flexibility and task-independence of the reproductive features make the conceptive information approach more favorable. The proposed methodology is novel and shows promising results for analyzing medical image data."
Domain Generalization for Mammographic Image Analysis via Contrastive Learning,"Mammographic image analysis is a fundamental problem in the computer-aided diagnosis scheme, which has recently made remarkable progress with the advance of deep learning. However, the construction of a deep learning model requires training data that are large and sufficiently diverse in terms of image style and quality. In particular, the diversity of image style may be majorly attributed to the vendor factor. However, mammogram collection from vendors as many as possible is very expensive and sometimes impractical for laboratory-scale studies. Accordingly, to further augment the generalization capability of deep learning models to various vendors with limited resources, a new contrastive learning scheme is developed. Specifically, the backbone network is firstly trained with a multi-style and multi-view unsupervised self-learning scheme for the embedding of invariant features to various vendor styles. Afterward, the backbone network is then recalibrated to the downstream tasks of mass detection, multi-view mass matching, BI-RADS classification and breast density classification with specific supervised learning. The proposed method is evaluated with mammograms from four vendors and two unseen public datasets. The experimental results suggest that our approach can effectively improve analysis performance on both seen and unseen domains, and outperforms many state-of-the-art (SOTA) generalization methods."
Using Text-to-Image Generation for Architectural Design Ideation,"The recent progress of text-to-image generation has been recognized in architectural design. Our study is the first to investigate the potential of text-to-image generators in supporting creativity during the early stages of the architectural design process. We conducted a laboratory study with 17 architecture students, who developed a concept for a culture center using three popular text-to-image generators: Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and DALL-E. Through standardized questionnaires and group interviews, we found that image generation could be a meaningful part of the design process when design constraints are carefully considered. Generative tools support serendipitous discovery of ideas and an imaginative mindset, enriching the design process. We identified several challenges of image generators and provided considerations for software development and educators to support creativity and emphasize designers' imaginative mindset. By understanding the limitations and potential of text-to-image generators, architects and designers can leverage this technology in their design process and education, facilitating innovation and effective communication of concepts."
Attributing Image Generative Models using Latent Fingerprints,"Generative models have enabled the creation of contents that are indistinguishable from those taken from nature. Open-source development of such models raised concerns about the risks of their misuse for malicious purposes. One potential risk mitigation strategy is to attribute generative models via fingerprinting. Current fingerprinting methods exhibit a significant tradeoff between robust attribution accuracy and generation quality while lacking design principles to improve this tradeoff. This paper investigates the use of latent semantic dimensions as fingerprints, from where we can analyze the effects of design variables, including the choice of fingerprinting dimensions, strength, and capacity, on the accuracy-quality tradeoff. Compared with previous SOTA, our method requires minimum computation and is more applicable to large-scale models. We use StyleGAN2 and the latent diffusion model to demonstrate the efficacy of our method."
Promptify: Text-to-Image Generation through Interactive Prompt Exploration with Large Language Models,"Text-to-image generative models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating high-quality images based on textual prompts. However, crafting prompts that accurately capture the user's creative intent remains challenging. It often involves laborious trial-and-error procedures to ensure that the model interprets the prompts in alignment with the user's intention. To address the challenges, we present Promptify, an interactive system that supports prompt exploration and refinement for text-to-image generative models. Promptify utilizes a suggestion engine powered by large language models to help users quickly explore and craft diverse prompts. Our interface allows users to organize the generated images flexibly, and based on their preferences, Promptify suggests potential changes to the original prompt. This feedback loop enables users to iteratively refine their prompts and enhance desired features while avoiding unwanted ones. Our user study shows that Promptify effectively facilitates the text-to-image workflow and outperforms an existing baseline tool widely used for text-to-image generation."
Text-guided Image-and-Shape Editing and Generation: A Short Survey,"Image and shape editing are ubiquitous among digital artworks. Graphics algorithms facilitate artists and designers to achieve desired editing intents without going through manually tedious retouching. In the recent advance of machine learning, artists' editing intents can even be driven by text, using a variety of well-trained neural networks. They have seen to be receiving an extensive success on such as generating photorealistic images, artworks and human poses, stylizing meshes from text, or auto-completion given image and shape priors. In this short survey, we provide an overview over 50 papers on state-of-the-art (text-guided) image-and-shape generation techniques. We start with an overview on recent editing algorithms in the introduction. Then, we provide a comprehensive review on text-guided editing techniques for 2D and 3D independently, where each of its sub-section begins with a brief background introduction. We also contextualize editing algorithms under recent implicit neural representations. Finally, we conclude the survey with the discussion over existing methods and potential research ideas."
"UPGPT: Universal Diffusion Model for Person Image Generation, Editing and Pose Transfer","Existing person image generative models can do either image generation or pose transfer but not both. We propose a unified diffusion model, UPGPT to provide a universal solution to perform all the person image tasks - generative, pose transfer, and editing. With fine-grained multimodality and disentanglement capabilities, our approach offers fine-grained control over the generation and the editing process of images using a combination of pose, text, and image, all without needing a semantic segmentation mask which can be challenging to obtain or edit. We also pioneer the parameterized body SMPL model in pose-guided person image generation to demonstrate new capability - simultaneous pose and camera view interpolation while maintaining a person's appearance. Results on the benchmark DeepFashion dataset show that UPGPT is the new state-of-the-art while simultaneously pioneering new capabilities of edit and pose transfer in human image generation."
TTIDA: Controllable Generative Data Augmentation via Text-to-Text and Text-to-Image Models,"Data augmentation has been established as an efficacious approach to supplement useful information for low-resource datasets. Traditional augmentation techniques such as noise injection and image transformations have been widely used. In addition, generative data augmentation (GDA) has been shown to produce more diverse and flexible data. While generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been frequently used for GDA, they lack diversity and controllability compared to text-to-image diffusion models. In this paper, we propose TTIDA (Text-to-Text-to-Image Data Augmentation) to leverage the capabilities of large-scale pre-trained Text-to-Text (T2T) and Text-to-Image (T2I) generative models for data augmentation. By conditioning the T2I model on detailed descriptions produced by T2T models, we are able to generate photo-realistic labeled images in a flexible and controllable manner. Experiments on in-domain classification, cross-domain classification, and image captioning tasks show consistent improvements over other data augmentation baselines. Analytical studies in varied settings, including few-shot, long-tail, and adversarial, further reinforce the effectiveness of TTIDA in enhancing performance and increasing robustness."
Insta(nt) Pet Therapy: GAN-generated Images for Therapeutic Social Media Content,"The positive therapeutic effect of viewing pet images online has been well-studied. However, it is difficult to obtain large-scale production of such content since it relies on pet owners to capture photographs and upload them. I use a Generative Adversarial Network-based framework for the creation of fake pet images at scale. These images are uploaded on an Instagram account where they drive user engagement at levels comparable to those seen with images from accounts with traditional pet photographs, underlining the applicability of the framework to be used for pet-therapy social media content."
Likelihood-Based Generative Radiance Field with Latent Space Energy-Based Model for 3D-Aware Disentangled Image Representation,"We propose the NeRF-LEBM, a likelihood-based top-down 3D-aware 2D image generative model that incorporates 3D representation via Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 2D imaging process via differentiable volume rendering. The model represents an image as a rendering process from 3D object to 2D image and is conditioned on some latent variables that account for object characteristics and are assumed to follow informative trainable energy-based prior models. We propose two likelihood-based learning frameworks to train the NeRF-LEBM: (i) maximum likelihood estimation with Markov chain Monte Carlo-based inference and (ii) variational inference with the reparameterization trick. We study our models in the scenarios with both known and unknown camera poses. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that the NeRF-LEBM can infer 3D object structures from 2D images, generate 2D images with novel views and objects, learn from incomplete 2D images, and learn from 2D images with known or unknown camera poses."
Exploring Incompatible Knowledge Transfer in Few-shot Image Generation,"Few-shot image generation (FSIG) learns to generate diverse and high-fidelity images from a target domain using a few (e.g., 10) reference samples. Existing FSIG methods select, preserve and transfer prior knowledge from a source generator (pretrained on a related domain) to learn the target generator. In this work, we investigate an underexplored issue in FSIG, dubbed as incompatible knowledge transfer, which would significantly degrade the realisticness of synthetic samples. Empirical observations show that the issue stems from the least significant filters from the source generator. To this end, we propose knowledge truncation to mitigate this issue in FSIG, which is a complementary operation to knowledge preservation and is implemented by a lightweight pruning-based method. Extensive experiments show that knowledge truncation is simple and effective, consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance, including challenging setups where the source and target domains are more distant.

PTW: Pivotal Tuning Watermarking for Pre-Trained Image Generators,"Deepfakes refer to content synthesized using deep generators, which, when misused, have the potential to erode trust in digital media. Synthesizing high-quality deepfakes requires access to large and complex generators only a few entities can train and provide. The threat is malicious users that exploit access to the provided model and generate harmful deepfakes without risking detection. Watermarking makes deepfakes detectable by embedding an identifiable code into the generator that is later extractable from its generated images. We propose Pivotal Tuning Watermarking (PTW), a method for watermarking pre-trained generators (i) three orders of magnitude faster than watermarking from scratch and (ii) without the need for any training data. We improve existing watermarking methods and scale to generators 4 \times larger than related work. PTW can embed longer codes than existing methods while better preserving the generator's image quality. We propose rigorous, game-based definitions for robustness and undetectability and our study reveals that watermarking is not robust against an adaptive white-box attacker who has control over the generator's parameters. We propose an adaptive attack that can successfully remove any watermarking with access to only 200 non-watermarked images. Our work challenges the trustworthiness of watermarking for deepfake detection when the parameters of a generator are available. Source code to reproduce our experiments is available at https://github.com/dnn-security/gan-watermark."
A Comparative Study on Generative Models for High Resolution Solar Observation Imaging,"Solar activity is one of the main drivers of variability in our solar system and the key source of space weather phenomena that affect Earth and near Earth space. The extensive record of high resolution extreme ultraviolet (EUV) observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) offers an unprecedented, very large dataset of solar images. In this work, we make use of this comprehensive dataset to investigate capabilities of current state-of-the-art generative models to accurately capture the data distribution behind the observed solar activity states. Starting from StyleGAN-based methods, we uncover severe deficits of this model family in handling fine-scale details of solar images when training on high resolution samples, contrary to training on natural face images. When switching to the diffusion based generative model family, we observe strong improvements of fine-scale detail generation. For the GAN family, we are able to achieve similar improvements in fine-scale generation when turning to ProjectedGANs, which uses multi-scale discriminators with a pre-trained frozen feature extractor. We conduct ablation studies to clarify mechanisms responsible for proper fine-scale handling. Using distributed training on supercomputers, we are able to train generative models for up to 1024x1024 resolution that produce high quality samples indistinguishable to human experts, as suggested by the evaluation we conduct. We make all code, models and workflows used in this study publicly available at \url{https://github.com/SLAMPAI/generative-models-for-highres-solar-images}."
Machine Perception-Driven Image Compression: A Layered Generative Approach,"In this age of information, images are a critical medium for storing and transmitting information. With the rapid growth of image data amount, visual compression and visual data perception are two important research topics attracting a lot attention. However, those two topics are rarely discussed together and follow separate research path. Due to the compact compressed domain representation offered by learning-based image compression methods, there exists possibility to have one stream targeting both efficient data storage and compression, and machine perception tasks. In this paper, we propose a layered generative image compression model achieving high human vision-oriented image reconstructed quality, even at extreme compression ratios. To obtain analysis efficiency and flexibility, a task-agnostic learning-based compression model is proposed, which effectively supports various compressed domain-based analytical tasks while reserves outstanding reconstructed perceptual quality, compared with traditional and learning-based codecs. In addition, joint optimization schedule is adopted to acquire best balance point among compression ratio, reconstructed image quality, and downstream perception performance. Experimental results verify that our proposed compressed domain-based multi-task analysis method can achieve comparable analysis results against the RGB image-based methods with up to 99.6% bit rate saving (i.e., compared with taking original RGB image as the analysis model input). The practical ability of our model is further justified from model size and information fidelity aspects."
Expressive Text-to-Image Generation with Rich Text,"Plain text has become a prevalent interface for text-to-image synthesis. However, its limited customization options hinder users from accurately describing desired outputs. For example, plain text makes it hard to specify continuous quantities, such as the precise RGB color value or importance of each word. Furthermore, creating detailed text prompts for complex scenes is tedious for humans to write and challenging for text encoders to interpret. To address these challenges, we propose using a rich-text editor supporting formats such as font style, size, color, and footnote. We extract each word's attributes from rich text to enable local style control, explicit token reweighting, precise color rendering, and detailed region synthesis. We achieve these capabilities through a region-based diffusion process. We first obtain each word's region based on cross-attention maps of a vanilla diffusion process using plain text. For each region, we enforce its text attributes by creating region-specific detailed prompts and applying region-specific guidance. We present various examples of image generation from rich text and demonstrate that our method outperforms strong baselines with quantitative evaluations."
Diagnostic Benchmark and Iterative Inpainting for Layout-Guided Image Generation,"Spatial control is a core capability in controllable image generation. Advancements in layout-guided image generation have shown promising results on in-distribution (ID) datasets with similar spatial configurations. However, it is unclear how these models perform when facing out-of-distribution (OOD) samples with arbitrary, unseen layouts. In this paper, we propose LayoutBench, a diagnostic benchmark for layout-guided image generation that examines four categories of spatial control skills: number, position, size, and shape. We benchmark two recent representative layout-guided image generation methods and observe that the good ID layout control may not generalize well to arbitrary layouts in the wild (e.g., objects at the boundary). Next, we propose IterInpaint, a new baseline that generates foreground and background regions in a step-by-step manner via inpainting, demonstrating stronger generalizability than existing models on OOD layouts in LayoutBench. We perform quantitative and qualitative evaluation and fine-grained analysis on the four LayoutBench skills to pinpoint the weaknesses of existing models. Lastly, we show comprehensive ablation studies on IterInpaint, including training task ratio, crop&paste vs. repaint, and generation order. Project website: https://layoutbench.github.io"
Qualitative Failures of Image Generation Models and Their Application in Detecting Deepfakes,"The ability of image and video generation models to create photorealistic images has reached unprecedented heights, making it difficult to distinguish between real and fake images in many cases. However, despite this progress, a gap remains between the quality of generated images and those found in the real world. To address this, we have reviewed a vast body of literature from both academic publications and social media to identify qualitative shortcomings in image generation models, which we have classified into five categories. By understanding these failures, we can identify areas where these models need improvement, as well as develop strategies for detecting deep fakes. The prevalence of deep fakes in today's society is a serious concern, and our findings can help mitigate their negative impact."
Intriguing properties of synthetic images: from generative adversarial networks to diffusion models,"Detecting fake images is becoming a major goal of computer vision. This need is becoming more and more pressing with the continuous improvement of synthesis methods based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), and even more with the appearance of powerful methods based on Diffusion Models (DM). Towards this end, it is important to gain insight into which image features better discriminate fake images from real ones. In this paper we report on our systematic study of a large number of image generators of different families, aimed at discovering the most forensically relevant characteristics of real and generated images. Our experiments provide a number of interesting observations and shed light on some intriguing properties of synthetic images: (1) not only the GAN models but also the DM and VQ-GAN (Vector Quantized Generative Adversarial Networks) models give rise to visible artifacts in the Fourier domain and exhibit anomalous regular patterns in the autocorrelation; (2) when the dataset used to train the model lacks sufficient variety, its biases can be transferred to the generated images; (3) synthetic and real images exhibit significant differences in the mid-high frequency signal content, observable in their radial and angular spectral power distributions."
Generation of artificial facial drug abuse images using Deep De-identified anonymous Dataset augmentation through Genetics Algorithm (3DG-GA),"In biomedical research and artificial intelligence, access to large, well-balanced, and representative datasets is crucial for developing trustworthy applications that can be used in real-world scenarios. However, obtaining such datasets can be challenging, as they are often restricted to hospitals and specialized facilities. To address this issue, the study proposes to generate highly realistic synthetic faces exhibiting drug abuse traits through augmentation. The proposed method, called ""3DG-GA"", Deep De-identified anonymous Dataset Generation, uses Genetics Algorithm as a strategy for synthetic faces generation. The algorithm includes GAN artificial face generation, forgery detection, and face recognition. Initially, a dataset of 120 images of actual facial drug abuse is used. By preserving, the drug traits, the 3DG-GA provides a dataset containing 3000 synthetic facial drug abuse images. The dataset will be open to the scientific community, which can reproduce our results and benefit from the generated datasets while avoiding legal or ethical restrictions."
Social Biases through the Text-to-Image Generation Lens,"Text-to-Image (T2I) generation is enabling new applications that support creators, designers, and general end users of productivity software by generating illustrative content with high photorealism starting from a given descriptive text as a prompt. Such models are however trained on massive amounts of web data, which surfaces the peril of potential harmful biases that may leak in the generation process itself. In this paper, we take a multi-dimensional approach to studying and quantifying common social biases as reflected in the generated images, by focusing on how occupations, personality traits, and everyday situations are depicted across representations of (perceived) gender, age, race, and geographical location. Through an extensive set of both automated and human evaluation experiments we present findings for two popular T2I models: DALLE-v2 and Stable Diffusion. Our results reveal that there exist severe occupational biases of neutral prompts majorly excluding groups of people from results for both models. Such biases can get mitigated by increasing the amount of specification in the prompt itself, although the prompting mitigation will not address discrepancies in image quality or other usages of the model or its representations in other scenarios. Further, we observe personality traits being associated with only a limited set of people at the intersection of race, gender, and age. Finally, an analysis of geographical location representations on everyday situations (e.g., park, food, weddings) shows that for most situations, images generated through default location-neutral prompts are closer and more similar to images generated for locations of United States and Germany."
Generating Aligned Pseudo-Supervision from Non-Aligned Data for Image Restoration in Under-Display Camera,"Due to the difficulty in collecting large-scale and perfectly aligned paired training data for Under-Display Camera (UDC) image restoration, previous methods resort to monitor-based image systems or simulation-based methods, sacrificing the realness of the data and introducing domain gaps. In this work, we revisit the classic stereo setup for training data collection -- capturing two images of the same scene with one UDC and one standard camera. The key idea is to ""copy"" details from a high-quality reference image and ""paste"" them on the UDC image. While being able to generate real training pairs, this setting is susceptible to spatial misalignment due to perspective and depth of field changes. The problem is further compounded by the large domain discrepancy between the UDC and normal images, which is unique to UDC restoration. In this paper, we mitigate the non-trivial domain discrepancy and spatial misalignment through a novel Transformer-based framework that generates well-aligned yet high-quality target data for the corresponding UDC input. This is made possible through two carefully designed components, namely, the Domain Alignment Module (DAM) and Geometric Alignment Module (GAM), which encourage robust and accurate discovery of correspondence between the UDC and normal views. Extensive experiments show that high-quality and well-aligned pseudo UDC training pairs are beneficial for training a robust restoration network. Code and the dataset are available at https://github.com/jnjaby/AlignFormer."
APPLeNet: Visual Attention Parameterized Prompt Learning for Few-Shot Remote Sensing Image Generalization using CLIP,"In recent years, the success of large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP has led to their increased usage in various computer vision tasks. These models enable zero-shot inference through carefully crafted instructional text prompts without task-specific supervision. However, the potential of VLMs for generalization tasks in remote sensing (RS) has not been fully realized. To address this research gap, we propose a novel image-conditioned prompt learning strategy called the Visual Attention Parameterized Prompts Learning Network (APPLeNet). APPLeNet emphasizes the importance of multi-scale feature learning in RS scene classification and disentangles visual style and content primitives for domain generalization tasks. To achieve this, APPLeNet combines visual content features obtained from different layers of the vision encoder and style properties obtained from feature statistics of domain-specific batches. An attention-driven injection module is further introduced to generate visual tokens from this information. We also introduce an anti-correlation regularizer to ensure discrimination among the token embeddings, as this visual information is combined with the textual tokens. To validate APPLeNet, we curated four available RS benchmarks and introduced experimental protocols and datasets for three domain generalization tasks. Our results consistently outperform the relevant literature and code is available at https://github.com/mainaksingha01/APPLeNet"
ImageReward: Learning and Evaluating Human Preferences for Text-to-Image Generation,"We present ImageReward -- the first general-purpose text-to-image human preference reward model -- to address various prevalent issues in generative models and align them with human values and preferences. Its training is based on our systematic annotation pipeline that covers both the rating and ranking components, collecting a dataset of 137k expert comparisons to date. In human evaluation, ImageReward outperforms existing scoring methods (e.g., CLIP by 38.6\%), making it a promising automatic metric for evaluating and improving text-to-image synthesis. The reward model is publicly available via the \texttt{image-reward} package at \url{https://github.com/THUDM/ImageReward}."
Mesh2Tex: Generating Mesh Textures from Image Queries,"Remarkable advances have been achieved recently in learning neural representations that characterize object geometry, while generating textured objects suitable for downstream applications and 3D rendering remains at an early stage. In particular, reconstructing textured geometry from images of real objects is a significant challenge -- reconstructed geometry is often inexact, making realistic texturing a significant challenge. We present Mesh2Tex, which learns a realistic object texture manifold from uncorrelated collections of 3D object geometry and photorealistic RGB images, by leveraging a hybrid mesh-neural-field texture representation. Our texture representation enables compact encoding of high-resolution textures as a neural field in the barycentric coordinate system of the mesh faces. The learned texture manifold enables effective navigation to generate an object texture for a given 3D object geometry that matches to an input RGB image, which maintains robustness even under challenging real-world scenarios where the mesh geometry approximates an inexact match to the underlying geometry in the RGB image. Mesh2Tex can effectively generate realistic object textures for an object mesh to match real images observations towards digitization of real environments, significantly improving over previous state of the art."
NoisyTwins: Class-Consistent and Diverse Image Generation through StyleGANs,"StyleGANs are at the forefront of controllable image generation as they produce a latent space that is semantically disentangled, making it suitable for image editing and manipulation. However, the performance of StyleGANs severely degrades when trained via class-conditioning on large-scale long-tailed datasets. We find that one reason for degradation is the collapse of latents for each class in the \mathcal{W} latent space. With NoisyTwins, we first introduce an effective and inexpensive augmentation strategy for class embeddings, which then decorrelates the latents based on self-supervision in the \mathcal{W} space. This decorrelation mitigates collapse, ensuring that our method preserves intra-class diversity with class-consistency in image generation. We show the effectiveness of our approach on large-scale real-world long-tailed datasets of ImageNet-LT and iNaturalist 2019, where our method outperforms other methods by \sim 19\% on FID, establishing a new state-of-the-art."
Controllable Textual Inversion for Personalized Text-to-Image Generation,"The recent large-scale generative modeling has attained unprecedented performance especially in producing high-fidelity images driven by text prompts. Text inversion (TI), alongside the text-to-image model backbones, is proposed as an effective technique in personalizing the generation when the prompts contain user-defined, unseen or long-tail concept tokens. Despite that, we find and show that the deployment of TI remains full of ""dark-magics"" -- to name a few, the harsh requirement of additional datasets, arduous human efforts in the loop and lack of robustness. In this work, we propose a much-enhanced version of TI, dubbed Controllable Textual Inversion (COTI), in resolving all the aforementioned problems and in turn delivering a robust, data-efficient and easy-to-use framework. The core to COTI is a theoretically-guided loss objective instantiated with a comprehensive and novel weighted scoring mechanism, encapsulated by an active-learning paradigm. The extensive results show that COTI significantly outperforms the prior TI-related approaches with a 26.05 decrease in the FID score and a 23.00% boost in the R-precision."
Mask-conditioned latent diffusion for generating gastrointestinal polyp images,"In order to take advantage of AI solutions in endoscopy diagnostics, we must overcome the issue of limited annotations. These limitations are caused by the high privacy concerns in the medical field and the requirement of getting aid from experts for the time-consuming and costly medical data annotation process. In computer vision, image synthesis has made a significant contribution in recent years as a result of the progress of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion probabilistic models (DPM). Novel DPMs have outperformed GANs in text, image, and video generation tasks. Therefore, this study proposes a conditional DPM framework to generate synthetic GI polyp images conditioned on given generated segmentation masks. Our experimental results show that our system can generate an unlimited number of high-fidelity synthetic polyp images with the corresponding ground truth masks of polyps. To test the usefulness of the generated data, we trained binary image segmentation models to study the effect of using synthetic data. Results show that the best micro-imagewise IOU of 0.7751 was achieved from DeepLabv3+ when the training data consists of both real data and synthetic data. However, the results reflect that achieving good segmentation performance with synthetic data heavily depends on model architectures."
Improving Vision-and-Language Navigation by Generating Future-View Image Semantics,"Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is the task that requires an agent to navigate through the environment based on natural language instructions. At each step, the agent takes the next action by selecting from a set of navigable locations. In this paper, we aim to take one step further and explore whether the agent can benefit from generating the potential future view during navigation. Intuitively, humans will have an expectation of how the future environment will look like, based on the natural language instructions and surrounding views, which will aid correct navigation. Hence, to equip the agent with this ability to generate the semantics of future navigation views, we first propose three proxy tasks during the agent's in-domain pre-training: Masked Panorama Modeling (MPM), Masked Trajectory Modeling (MTM), and Action Prediction with Image Generation (APIG). These three objectives teach the model to predict missing views in a panorama (MPM), predict missing steps in the full trajectory (MTM), and generate the next view based on the full instruction and navigation history (APIG), respectively. We then fine-tune the agent on the VLN task with an auxiliary loss that minimizes the difference between the view semantics generated by the agent and the ground truth view semantics of the next step. Empirically, our VLN-SIG achieves the new state-of-the-art on both the Room-to-Room dataset and the CVDN dataset. We further show that our agent learns to fill in missing patches in future views qualitatively, which brings more interpretability over agents' predicted actions. Lastly, we demonstrate that learning to predict future view semantics also enables the agent to have better performance on longer paths."
HumanSD: A Native Skeleton-Guided Diffusion Model for Human Image Generation,"Controllable human image generation (HIG) has numerous real-life applications. State-of-the-art solutions, such as ControlNet and T2I-Adapter, introduce an additional learnable branch on top of the frozen pre-trained stable diffusion (SD) model, which can enforce various conditions, including skeleton guidance of HIG. While such a plug-and-play approach is appealing, the inevitable and uncertain conflicts between the original images produced from the frozen SD branch and the given condition incur significant challenges for the learnable branch, which essentially conducts image feature editing for condition enforcement. In this work, we propose a native skeleton-guided diffusion model for controllable HIG called HumanSD. Instead of performing image editing with dual-branch diffusion, we fine-tune the original SD model using a novel heatmap-guided denoising loss. This strategy effectively and efficiently strengthens the given skeleton condition during model training while mitigating the catastrophic forgetting effects. HumanSD is fine-tuned on the assembly of three large-scale human-centric datasets with text-image-pose information, two of which are established in this work. As shown in Figure 1, HumanSD outperforms ControlNet in terms of accurate pose control and image quality, particularly when the given skeleton guidance is sophisticated."
MedGen3D: A Deep Generative Framework for Paired 3D Image and Mask Generation,"Acquiring and annotating sufficient labeled data is crucial in developing accurate and robust learning-based models, but obtaining such data can be challenging in many medical image segmentation tasks. One promising solution is to synthesize realistic data with ground-truth mask annotations. However, no prior studies have explored generating complete 3D volumetric images with masks. In this paper, we present MedGen3D, a deep generative framework that can generate paired 3D medical images and masks. First, we represent the 3D medical data as 2D sequences and propose the Multi-Condition Diffusion Probabilistic Model (MC-DPM) to generate multi-label mask sequences adhering to anatomical geometry. Then, we use an image sequence generator and semantic diffusion refiner conditioned on the generated mask sequences to produce realistic 3D medical images that align with the generated masks. Our proposed framework guarantees accurate alignment between synthetic images and segmentation maps. Experiments on 3D thoracic CT and brain MRI datasets show that our synthetic data is both diverse and faithful to the original data, and demonstrate the benefits for downstream segmentation tasks. We anticipate that MedGen3D's ability to synthesize paired 3D medical images and masks will prove valuable in training deep learning models for medical imaging tasks."
InstantBooth: Personalized Text-to-Image Generation without Test-Time Finetuning,"Recent advances in personalized image generation allow a pre-trained text-to-image model to learn a new concept from a set of images. However, existing personalization approaches usually require heavy test-time finetuning for each concept, which is time-consuming and difficult to scale. We propose InstantBooth, a novel approach built upon pre-trained text-to-image models that enables instant text-guided image personalization without any test-time finetuning. We achieve this with several major components. First, we learn the general concept of the input images by converting them to a textual token with a learnable image encoder. Second, to keep the fine details of the identity, we learn rich visual feature representation by introducing a few adapter layers to the pre-trained model. We train our components only on text-image pairs without using paired images of the same concept. Compared to test-time finetuning-based methods like DreamBooth and Textual-Inversion, our model can generate competitive results on unseen concepts concerning language-image alignment, image fidelity, and identity preservation while being 100 times faster."
ImaGen: A General Framework for Generating Memory- and Power-Efficient Image Processing Accelerators,"Image processing algorithms are prime targets for hardware acceleration as they are commonly used in resource- and power-limited applications. Today's image processing accelerator designs make rigid assumptions about the algorithm structures and/or on-chip memory resources. As a result, they either have narrow applicability or result in inefficient designs.  This paper presents a compiler framework that automatically generates memory- and power-efficient image processing accelerators. We allow programmers to describe generic image processing algorithms (in a domain specific language) and specify on-chip memory structures available. Our framework then formulates a constrained optimization problem that minimizes on-chip memory usage while maintaining theoretical maximum throughput. The key challenge we address is to analytically express the throughput bottleneck, on-chip memory contention, to enable a lightweight compilation. FPGA prototyping and ASIC synthesis show that, compared to existing approaches, accelerators generated by our framework reduce the on-chip memory usage and/or power consumption by double digits."
Zero-shot Generative Model Adaptation via Image-specific Prompt Learning,"Recently, CLIP-guided image synthesis has shown appealing performance on adapting a pre-trained source-domain generator to an unseen target domain. It does not require any target-domain samples but only the textual domain labels. The training is highly efficient, e.g., a few minutes. However, existing methods still have some limitations in the quality of generated images and may suffer from the mode collapse issue. A key reason is that a fixed adaptation direction is applied for all cross-domain image pairs, which leads to identical supervision signals. To address this issue, we propose an Image-specific Prompt Learning (IPL) method, which learns specific prompt vectors for each source-domain image. This produces a more precise adaptation direction for every cross-domain image pair, endowing the target-domain generator with greatly enhanced flexibility. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations on various domains demonstrate that IPL effectively improves the quality and diversity of synthesized images and alleviates the mode collapse. Moreover, IPL is independent of the structure of the generative model, such as generative adversarial networks or diffusion models. Code is available at https://github.com/Picsart-AI-Research/IPL-Zero-Shot-Generative-Model-Adaptation."
Domain Generalization with Adversarial Intensity Attack for Medical Image Segmentation,"Most statistical learning algorithms rely on an over-simplified assumption, that is, the train and test data are independent and identically distributed. In real-world scenarios, however, it is common for models to encounter data from new and different domains to which they were not exposed to during training. This is often the case in medical imaging applications due to differences in acquisition devices, imaging protocols, and patient characteristics. To address this problem, domain generalization (DG) is a promising direction as it enables models to handle data from previously unseen domains by learning domain-invariant features robust to variations across different domains. To this end, we introduce a novel DG method called Adversarial Intensity Attack (AdverIN), which leverages adversarial training to generate training data with an infinite number of styles and increase data diversity while preserving essential content information. We conduct extensive evaluation experiments on various multi-domain segmentation datasets, including 2D retinal fundus optic disc/cup and 3D prostate MRI. Our results demonstrate that AdverIN significantly improves the generalization ability of the segmentation models, achieving significant improvement on these challenging datasets. Code is available upon publication."
A Diffusion-based Method for Multi-turn Compositional Image Generation,"Multi-turn compositional image generation (M-CIG) is a challenging task that aims to iteratively manipulate a reference image given a modification text. While most of the existing methods for M-CIG are based on generative adversarial networks (GANs), recent advances in image generation have demonstrated the superiority of diffusion models over GANs. In this paper, we propose a diffusion-based method for M-CIG named conditional denoising diffusion with image compositional matching (CDD-ICM). We leverage CLIP as the backbone of image and text encoders, and incorporate a gated fusion mechanism, originally proposed for question answering, to compositionally fuse the reference image and the modification text at each turn of M-CIG. We introduce a conditioning scheme to generate the target image based on the fusion results. To prioritize the semantic quality of the generated target image, we learn an auxiliary image compositional match (ICM) objective, along with the conditional denoising diffusion (CDD) objective in a multi-task learning framework. Additionally, we also perform ICM guidance and classifier-free guidance to improve performance. Experimental results show that CDD-ICM achieves state-of-the-art results on two benchmark datasets for M-CIG, i.e., CoDraw and i-CLEVR."
EGC: Image Generation and Classification via a Diffusion Energy-Based Model,"Learning image classification and image generation using the same set of network parameters is a challenging problem. Recent advanced approaches perform well in one task often exhibit poor performance in the other. This work introduces an energy-based classifier and generator, namely EGC, which can achieve superior performance in both tasks using a single neural network. Unlike a conventional classifier that outputs a label given an image (i.e., a conditional distribution p(y|\mathbf{x})), the forward pass in EGC is a classifier that outputs a joint distribution p(\mathbf{x},y), enabling an image generator in its backward pass by marginalizing out the label y. This is done by estimating the energy and classification probability given a noisy image in the forward pass, while denoising it using the score function estimated in the backward pass. EGC achieves competitive generation results compared with state-of-the-art approaches on ImageNet-1k, CelebA-HQ and LSUN Church, while achieving superior classification accuracy and robustness against adversarial attacks on CIFAR-10. This work represents the first successful attempt to simultaneously excel in both tasks using a single set of network parameters. We believe that EGC bridges the gap between discriminative and generative learning."
Cross-modulated Few-shot Image Generation for Colorectal Tissue Classification,"In this work, we propose a few-shot colorectal tissue image generation method for addressing the scarcity of histopathological training data for rare cancer tissues. Our few-shot generation method, named XM-GAN, takes one base and a pair of reference tissue images as input and generates high-quality yet diverse images. Within our XM-GAN, a novel controllable fusion block densely aggregates local regions of reference images based on their similarity to those in the base image, resulting in locally consistent features. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate few-shot generation in colorectal tissue images. We evaluate our few-shot colorectral tissue image generation by performing extensive qualitative, quantitative and subject specialist (pathologist) based evaluations. Specifically, in specialist-based evaluation, pathologists could differentiate between our XM-GAN generated tissue images and real images only 55% time. Moreover, we utilize these generated images as data augmentation to address the few-shot tissue image classification task, achieving a gain of 4.4% in terms of mean accuracy over the vanilla few-shot classifier.

PODIA-3D: Domain Adaptation of 3D Generative Model Across Large Domain Gap Using Pose-Preserved Text-to-Image Diffusion,"Recently, significant advancements have been made in 3D generative models, however training these models across diverse domains is challenging and requires an huge amount of training data and knowledge of pose distribution. Text-guided domain adaptation methods have allowed the generator to be adapted to the target domains using text prompts, thereby obviating the need for assembling numerous data. Recently, DATID-3D presents impressive quality of samples in text-guided domain, preserving diversity in text by leveraging text-to-image diffusion. However, adapting 3D generators to domains with significant domain gaps from the source domain still remains challenging due to issues in current text-to-image diffusion models as following: 1) shape-pose trade-off in diffusion-based translation, 2) pose bias, and 3) instance bias in the target domain, resulting in inferior 3D shapes, low text-image correspondence, and low intra-domain diversity in the generated samples. To address these issues, we propose a novel pipeline called PODIA-3D, which uses pose-preserved text-to-image diffusion-based domain adaptation for 3D generative models. We construct a pose-preserved text-to-image diffusion model that allows the use of extremely high-level noise for significant domain changes. We also propose specialized-to-general sampling strategies to improve the details of the generated samples. Moreover, to overcome the instance bias, we introduce a text-guided debiasing method that improves intra-domain diversity. Consequently, our method successfully adapts 3D generators across significant domain gaps. Our qualitative results and user study demonstrates that our approach outperforms existing 3D text-guided domain adaptation methods in terms of text-image correspondence, realism, diversity of rendered images, and sense of depth of 3D shapes in the generated samples"
Toward Verifiable and Reproducible Human Evaluation for Text-to-Image Generation,"Human evaluation is critical for validating the performance of text-to-image generative models, as this highly cognitive process requires deep comprehension of text and images. However, our survey of 37 recent papers reveals that many works rely solely on automatic measures (e.g., FID) or perform poorly described human evaluations that are not reliable or repeatable. This paper proposes a standardized and well-defined human evaluation protocol to facilitate verifiable and reproducible human evaluation in future works. In our pilot data collection, we experimentally show that the current automatic measures are incompatible with human perception in evaluating the performance of the text-to-image generation results. Furthermore, we provide insights for designing human evaluation experiments reliably and conclusively. Finally, we make several resources publicly available to the community to facilitate easy and fast implementations."
Text-Conditioned Sampling Framework for Text-to-Image Generation with Masked Generative Models,"Token-based masked generative models are gaining popularity for their fast inference time with parallel decoding. While recent token-based approaches achieve competitive performance to diffusion-based models, their generation performance is still suboptimal as they sample multiple tokens simultaneously without considering the dependence among them. We empirically investigate this problem and propose a learnable sampling model, Text-Conditioned Token Selection (TCTS), to select optimal tokens via localized supervision with text information. TCTS improves not only the image quality but also the semantic alignment of the generated images with the given texts. To further improve the image quality, we introduce a cohesive sampling strategy, Frequency Adaptive Sampling (FAS), to each group of tokens divided according to the self-attention maps. We validate the efficacy of TCTS combined with FAS with various generative tasks, demonstrating that it significantly outperforms the baselines in image-text alignment and image quality. Our text-conditioned sampling framework further reduces the original inference time by more than 50% without modifying the original generative model."
Generative Diffusion Prior for Unified Image Restoration and Enhancement,"Existing image restoration methods mostly leverage the posterior distribution of natural images. However, they often assume known degradation and also require supervised training, which restricts their adaptation to complex real applications. In this work, we propose the Generative Diffusion Prior (GDP) to effectively model the posterior distributions in an unsupervised sampling manner. GDP utilizes a pre-train denoising diffusion generative model (DDPM) for solving linear inverse, non-linear, or blind problems. Specifically, GDP systematically explores a protocol of conditional guidance, which is verified more practical than the commonly used guidance way. Furthermore, GDP is strength at optimizing the parameters of degradation model during the denoising process, achieving blind image restoration. Besides, we devise hierarchical guidance and patch-based methods, enabling the GDP to generate images of arbitrary resolutions. Experimentally, we demonstrate GDP's versatility on several image datasets for linear problems, such as super-resolution, deblurring, inpainting, and colorization, as well as non-linear and blind issues, such as low-light enhancement and HDR image recovery. GDP outperforms the current leading unsupervised methods on the diverse benchmarks in reconstruction quality and perceptual quality. Moreover, GDP also generalizes well for natural images or synthesized images with arbitrary sizes from various tasks out of the distribution of the ImageNet training set."
Generative Multiplane Neural Radiance for 3D-Aware Image Generation,"We present a method to efficiently generate 3D-aware high-resolution images that are view-consistent across multiple target views. The proposed multiplane neural radiance model, named GMNR, consists of a novel α-guided view-dependent representation (α-VdR) module for learning view-dependent information. The α-VdR module, faciliated by an α-guided pixel sampling technique, computes the view-dependent representation efficiently by learning viewing direction and position coefficients. Moreover, we propose a view-consistency loss to enforce photometric similarity across multiple views. The GMNR model can generate 3D-aware high-resolution images that are viewconsistent across multiple camera poses, while maintaining the computational efficiency in terms of both training and inference time. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed modules, leading to favorable results in terms of both generation quality and inference time, compared to existing approaches. Our GMNR model generates 3D-aware images of 1024 X 1024 pixels with 17.6 FPS on a single V100. Code : https://github.com/VIROBO-15/GMNR"
CG-3DSRGAN: A classification guided 3D generative adversarial network for image quality recovery from low-dose PET images,"Positron emission tomography (PET) is the most sensitive molecular imaging modality routinely applied in our modern healthcare. High radioactivity caused by the injected tracer dose is a major concern in PET imaging and limits its clinical applications. However, reducing the dose leads to inadequate image quality for diagnostic practice. Motivated by the need to produce high quality images with minimum low-dose, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) based methods have been developed for high quality PET synthesis from its low-dose counterparts. Previous CNNs-based studies usually directly map low-dose PET into features space without consideration of different dose reduction level. In this study, a novel approach named CG-3DSRGAN (Classification-Guided Generative Adversarial Network with Super Resolution Refinement) is presented. Specifically, a multi-tasking coarse generator, guided by a classification head, allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the noise-level features present in the low-dose data, resulting in improved image synthesis. Moreover, to recover spatial details of standard PET, an auxiliary super resolution network - Contextual-Net - is proposed as a second-stage training to narrow the gap between coarse prediction and standard PET. We compared our method to the state-of-the-art methods on whole-body PET with different dose reduction factors (DRFs). Experiments demonstrate our method can outperform others on all DRF."
Subject-driven Text-to-Image Generation via Apprenticeship Learning,"Recent text-to-image generation models like DreamBooth have made remarkable progress in generating highly customized images of a target subject, by fine-tuning an ``expert model'' for a given subject from a few examples. However, this process is expensive, since a new expert model must be learned for each subject. In this paper, we present SuTI, a Subject-driven Text-to-Image generator that replaces subject-specific fine tuning with in-context learning. Given a few demonstrations of a new subject, SuTI can instantly generate novel renditions of the subject in different scenes, without any subject-specific optimization. SuTI is powered by apprenticeship learning, where a single apprentice model is learned from data generated by a massive number of subject-specific expert models. Specifically, we mine millions of image clusters from the Internet, each centered around a specific visual subject. We adopt these clusters to train a massive number of expert models, each specializing in a different subject. The apprentice model SuTI then learns to imitate the behavior of these fine-tuned experts. SuTI can generate high-quality and customized subject-specific images 20x faster than optimization-based SoTA methods. On the challenging DreamBench and DreamBench-v2, our human evaluation shows that SuTI significantly outperforms existing models like InstructPix2Pix, Textual Inversion, Imagic, Prompt2Prompt, Re-Imagen and DreamBooth."
PrefGen: Preference Guided Image Generation with Relative Attributes,"Deep generative models have the capacity to render high fidelity images of content like human faces. Recently, there has been substantial progress in conditionally generating images with specific quantitative attributes, like the emotion conveyed by one's face. These methods typically require a user to explicitly quantify the desired intensity of a visual attribute. A limitation of this method is that many attributes, like how ""angry"" a human face looks, are difficult for a user to precisely quantify. However, a user would be able to reliably say which of two faces seems ""angrier"". Following this premise, we develop the \textit{PrefGen} system, which allows users to control the relative attributes of generated images by presenting them with simple paired comparison queries of the form ""do you prefer image a or image b?"" Using information from a sequence of query responses, we can estimate user preferences over a set of image attributes and perform preference-guided image editing and generation. Furthermore, to make preference localization feasible and efficient, we apply an active query selection strategy. We demonstrate the success of this approach using a StyleGAN2 generator on the task of human face editing. Additionally, we demonstrate how our approach can be combined with CLIP, allowing a user to edit the relative intensity of attributes specified by text prompts. Code at https://github.com/helblazer811/PrefGen."
Live image-based neurosurgical guidance and roadmap generation using unsupervised embedding,"Advanced minimally invasive neurosurgery navigation relies mainly on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) guidance. MRI guidance, however, only provides pre-operative information in the majority of the cases. Once the surgery begins, the value of this guidance diminishes to some extent because of the anatomical changes due to surgery. Guidance with live image feedback coming directly from the surgical device, e.g., endoscope, can complement MRI-based navigation or be an alternative if MRI guidance is not feasible. With this motivation, we present a method for live image-only guidance leveraging a large data set of annotated neurosurgical videos.First, we report the performance of a deep learning-based object detection method, YOLO, on detecting anatomical structures in neurosurgical images. Second, we present a method for generating neurosurgical roadmaps using unsupervised embedding without assuming exact anatomical matches between patients, presence of an extensive anatomical atlas, or the need for simultaneous localization and mapping. A generated roadmap encodes the common anatomical paths taken in surgeries in the training set. At inference, the roadmap can be used to map a surgeon's current location using live image feedback on the path to provide guidance by being able to predict which structures should appear going forward or backward, much like a mapping application. Even though the embedding is not supervised by position information, we show that it is correlated to the location inside the brain and on the surgical path. We trained and evaluated the proposed method with a data set of 166 transsphenoidal adenomectomy procedures."
3D-aware Image Generation using 2D Diffusion Models,"In this paper, we introduce a novel 3D-aware image generation method that leverages 2D diffusion models. We formulate the 3D-aware image generation task as multiview 2D image set generation, and further to a sequential unconditional-conditional multiview image generation process. This allows us to utilize 2D diffusion models to boost the generative modeling power of the method. Additionally, we incorporate depth information from monocular depth estimators to construct the training data for the conditional diffusion model using only still images. We train our method on a large-scale dataset, i.e., ImageNet, which is not addressed by previous methods. It produces high-quality images that significantly outperform prior methods. Furthermore, our approach showcases its capability to generate instances with large view angles, even though the training images are diverse and unaligned, gathered from ""in-the-wild"" real-world environments."
GlyphDraw: Seamlessly Rendering Text with Intricate Spatial Structures in Text-to-Image Generation,"Recent breakthroughs in the field of language-guided image generation have yielded impressive achievements, enabling the creation of high-quality and diverse images based on user instructions.Although the synthesis performance is fascinating, one significant limitation of current image generation models is their insufficient ability to generate text coherently within images, particularly for complex glyph structures like Chinese characters. To address this problem, we introduce GlyphDraw, a general learning framework aiming to endow image generation models with the capacity to generate images coherently embedded with text for any specific language.We first sophisticatedly design the image-text dataset's construction strategy, then build our model specifically on a diffusion-based image generator and carefully modify the network structure to allow the model to learn drawing language characters with the help of glyph and position information.Furthermore, we maintain the model's open-domain image synthesis capability by preventing catastrophic forgetting by using parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques.Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method not only produces accurate language characters as in prompts, but also seamlessly blends the generated text into the background.Please refer to our \href{https://1073521013.github.io/glyph-draw.github.io/}{project page}. \end{abstract}"
Multimodal Image-Text Matching Improves Retrieval-based Chest X-Ray Report Generation,"Automated generation of clinically accurate radiology reports can improve patient care. Previous report generation methods that rely on image captioning models often generate incoherent and incorrect text due to their lack of relevant domain knowledge, while retrieval-based attempts frequently retrieve reports that are irrelevant to the input image. In this work, we propose Contrastive X-Ray REport Match (X-REM), a novel retrieval-based radiology report generation module that uses an image-text matching score to measure the similarity of a chest X-ray image and radiology report for report retrieval. We observe that computing the image-text matching score with a language-image model can effectively capture the fine-grained interaction between image and text that is often lost when using cosine similarity. X-REM outperforms multiple prior radiology report generation modules in terms of both natural language and clinical metrics. Human evaluation of the generated reports suggests that X-REM increased the number of zero-error reports and decreased the average error severity compared to the baseline retrieval approach. Our code is available at: https://github.com/rajpurkarlab/X-REM"
LayoutDiffusion: Controllable Diffusion Model for Layout-to-image Generation,"Recently, diffusion models have achieved great success in image synthesis. However, when it comes to the layout-to-image generation where an image often has a complex scene of multiple objects, how to make strong control over both the global layout map and each detailed object remains a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a diffusion model named LayoutDiffusion that can obtain higher generation quality and greater controllability than the previous works. To overcome the difficult multimodal fusion of image and layout, we propose to construct a structural image patch with region information and transform the patched image into a special layout to fuse with the normal layout in a unified form. Moreover, Layout Fusion Module (LFM) and Object-aware Cross Attention (OaCA) are proposed to model the relationship among multiple objects and designed to be object-aware and position-sensitive, allowing for precisely controlling the spatial related information. Extensive experiments show that our LayoutDiffusion outperforms the previous SOTA methods on FID, CAS by relatively 46.35%, 26.70% on COCO-stuff and 44.29%, 41.82% on VG. Code is available at https://github.com/ZGCTroy/LayoutDiffusion."
KD-DLGAN: Data Limited Image Generation via Knowledge Distillation,"Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) rely heavily on large-scale training data for training high-quality image generation models. With limited training data, the GAN discriminator often suffers from severe overfitting which directly leads to degraded generation especially in generation diversity. Inspired by the recent advances in knowledge distillation (KD), we propose KD-DLGAN, a knowledge-distillation based generation framework that introduces pre-trained vision-language models for training effective data-limited generation models. KD-DLGAN consists of two innovative designs. The first is aggregated generative KD that mitigates the discriminator overfitting by challenging the discriminator with harder learning tasks and distilling more generalizable knowledge from the pre-trained models. The second is correlated generative KD that improves the generation diversity by distilling and preserving the diverse image-text correlation within the pre-trained models. Extensive experiments over multiple benchmarks show that KD-DLGAN achieves superior image generation with limited training data. In addition, KD-DLGAN complements the state-of-the-art with consistent and substantial performance gains."
Deep Learning-Assisted Localisation of Nanoparticles in synthetically generated two-photon microscopy images,"Tracking single molecules is instrumental for quantifying the transport of molecules and nanoparticles in biological samples, e.g., in brain drug delivery studies. Existing intensity-based localisation methods are not developed for imaging with a scanning microscope, typically used for in vivo imaging. Low signal-to-noise ratios, movement of molecules out-of-focus, and high motion blur on images recorded with scanning two-photon microscopy (2PM) in vivo pose a challenge to the accurate localisation of molecules. Using data-driven models is challenging due to low data volumes, typical for in vivo experiments. We developed a 2PM image simulator to supplement scarce training data. The simulator mimics realistic motion blur, background fluorescence, and shot noise observed in vivo imaging. Training a data-driven model with simulated data improves localisation quality in simulated images and shows why intensity-based methods fail."
MDP: A Generalized Framework for Text-Guided Image Editing by Manipulating the Diffusion Path,"Image generation using diffusion can be controlled in multiple ways. In this paper, we systematically analyze the equations of modern generative diffusion networks to propose a framework, called MDP, that explains the design space of suitable manipulations. We identify 5 different manipulations, including intermediate latent, conditional embedding, cross attention maps, guidance, and predicted noise. We analyze the corresponding parameters of these manipulations and the manipulation schedule. We show that some previous editing methods fit nicely into our framework. Particularly, we identified one specific configuration as a new type of control by manipulating the predicted noise, which can perform higher-quality edits than previous work for a variety of local and global edits."
Variational Distribution Learning for Unsupervised Text-to-Image Generation,"We propose a text-to-image generation algorithm based on deep neural networks when text captions for images are unavailable during training. In this work, instead of simply generating pseudo-ground-truth sentences of training images using existing image captioning methods, we employ a pretrained CLIP model, which is capable of properly aligning embeddings of images and corresponding texts in a joint space and, consequently, works well on zero-shot recognition tasks. We optimize a text-to-image generation model by maximizing the data log-likelihood conditioned on pairs of image-text CLIP embeddings. To better align data in the two domains, we employ a principled way based on a variational inference, which efficiently estimates an approximate posterior of the hidden text embedding given an image and its CLIP feature. Experimental results validate that the proposed framework outperforms existing approaches by large margins under unsupervised and semi-supervised text-to-image generation settings."
Multimodal and multicontrast image fusion via deep generative models,"Recently, it has become progressively more evident that classic diagnostic labels are unable to reliably describe the complexity and variability of several clinical phenotypes. This is particularly true for a broad range of neuropsychiatric illnesses (e.g., depression, anxiety disorders, behavioral phenotypes). Patient heterogeneity can be better described by grouping individuals into novel categories based on empirically derived sections of intersecting continua that span across and beyond traditional categorical borders. In this context, neuroimaging data carry a wealth of spatiotemporally resolved information about each patient's brain. However, they are usually heavily collapsed a priori through procedures which are not learned as part of model training, and consequently not optimized for the downstream prediction task. This is because every individual participant usually comes with multiple whole-brain 3D imaging modalities often accompanied by a deep genotypic and phenotypic characterization, hence posing formidable computational challenges. In this paper we design a deep learning architecture based on generative models rooted in a modular approach and separable convolutional blocks to a) fuse multiple 3D neuroimaging modalities on a voxel-wise level, b) convert them into informative latent embeddings through heavy dimensionality reduction, c) maintain good generalizability and minimal information loss. As proof of concept, we test our architecture on the well characterized Human Connectome Project database demonstrating that our latent embeddings can be clustered into easily separable subject strata which, in turn, map to different phenotypical information which was not included in the embedding creation process. This may be of aid in predicting disease evolution as well as drug response, hence supporting mechanistic disease understanding and empowering clinical trials."
Physics-guided adversarial networks for artificial digital image correlation data generation,"Digital image correlation (DIC) has become a valuable tool in the evaluation of mechanical experiments, particularly fatigue crack growth experiments. The evaluation requires accurate information of the crack path and crack tip position, which is difficult to obtain due to inherent noise and artefacts. Machine learning models have been extremely successful in recognizing this relevant information given labelled DIC displacement data. For the training of robust models, which generalize well, big data is needed. However, data is typically scarce in the field of material science and engineering because experiments are expensive and time-consuming. We present a method to generate synthetic DIC displacement data using generative adversarial networks with a physics-guided discriminator. To decide whether data samples are real or fake, this discriminator additionally receives the derived von Mises equivalent strain. We show that this physics-guided approach leads to improved results in terms of visual quality of samples, sliced Wasserstein distance, and geometry score."
Generalizable Denoising of Microscopy Images using Generative Adversarial Networks and Contrastive Learning,"Microscopy images often suffer from high levels of noise, which can hinder further analysis and interpretation. Content-aware image restoration (CARE) methods have been proposed to address this issue, but they often require large amounts of training data and suffer from over-fitting. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel framework for few-shot microscopy image denoising. Our approach combines a generative adversarial network (GAN) trained via contrastive learning (CL) with two structure preserving loss terms (Structural Similarity Index and Total Variation loss) to further improve the quality of the denoised images using little data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on three well-known microscopy imaging datasets, and show that we can drastically reduce the amount of training data while retaining the quality of the denoising, thus alleviating the burden of acquiring paired data and enabling few-shot learning. The proposed framework can be easily extended to other image restoration tasks and has the potential to significantly advance the field of microscopy image analysis."
ISS++: Image as Stepping Stone for Text-Guided 3D Shape Generation,"In this paper, we present a new text-guided 3D shape generation approach (ISS++) that uses images as a stepping stone to bridge the gap between text and shape modalities for generating 3D shapes without requiring paired text and 3D data. The core of our approach is a two-stage feature-space alignment strategy that leverages a pre-trained single-view reconstruction (SVR) model to map CLIP features to shapes: to begin with, map the CLIP image feature to the detail-rich 3D shape space of the SVR model, then map the CLIP text feature to the 3D shape space through encouraging the CLIP-consistency between rendered images and the input text. Besides, to extend beyond the generative capability of the SVR model, we design a text-guided 3D shape stylization module that can enhance the output shapes with novel structures and textures. Further, we exploit pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models to enhance the generative diversity, fidelity, and stylization capability. Our approach is generic, flexible, and scalable, and it can be easily integrated with various SVR models to expand the generative space and improve the generative fidelity. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of generative quality and consistency with the input text. Codes and models are released at https://github.com/liuzhengzhe/ISS-Image-as-Stepping-Stone-for-Text-Guided-3D-Shape-Generation."
Learning Generative Structure Prior for Blind Text Image Super-resolution,"Blind text image super-resolution (SR) is challenging as one needs to cope with diverse font styles and unknown degradation. To address the problem, existing methods perform character recognition in parallel to regularize the SR task, either through a loss constraint or intermediate feature condition. Nonetheless, the high-level prior could still fail when encountering severe degradation. The problem is further compounded given characters of complex structures, e.g., Chinese characters that combine multiple pictographic or ideographic symbols into a single character. In this work, we present a novel prior that focuses more on the character structure. In particular, we learn to encapsulate rich and diverse structures in a StyleGAN and exploit such generative structure priors for restoration. To restrict the generative space of StyleGAN so that it obeys the structure of characters yet remains flexible in handling different font styles, we store the discrete features for each character in a codebook. The code subsequently drives the StyleGAN to generate high-resolution structural details to aid text SR. Compared to priors based on character recognition, the proposed structure prior exerts stronger character-specific guidance to restore faithful and precise strokes of a designated character. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the compelling performance of the proposed generative structure prior in facilitating robust text SR."
Relational Inductive Biases for Object-Centric Image Generation,"Conditioning image generation on specific features of the desired output is a key ingredient of modern generative models. Most existing approaches focus on conditioning the generation based on free-form text, while some niche studies use scene graphs to describe the content of the image to be generated. This paper explores novel methods to condition image generation that are based on object-centric relational representations. In particular, we propose a methodology to condition the generation of a particular object in an image on the attributed graph representing its structure and associated style. We show that such architectural biases entail properties that facilitate the manipulation and conditioning of the generative process and allow for regularizing the training procedure. The proposed framework is implemented by means of a neural network architecture combining convolutional operators that operate on both the underlying graph and the 2D grid that becomes the output image. The resulting model learns to generate multi-channel masks of the object that can be used as a soft inductive bias in the downstream generative task. Empirical results show that the proposed approach compares favorably against relevant baselines on image generation conditioned on human poses."
Spatial Latent Representations in Generative Adversarial Networks for Image Generation,"In the majority of GAN architectures, the latent space is defined as a set of vectors of given dimensionality. Such representations are not easily interpretable and do not capture spatial information of image content directly. In this work, we define a family of spatial latent spaces for StyleGAN2, capable of capturing more details and representing images that are out-of-sample in terms of the number and arrangement of object parts, such as an image of multiple faces or a face with more than two eyes. We propose a method for encoding images into our spaces, together with an attribute model capable of performing attribute editing in these spaces. We show that our spaces are effective for image manipulation and encode semantic information well. Our approach can be used on pre-trained generator models, and attribute edition can be done using pre-generated direction vectors making the barrier to entry for experimentation and use extremely low. We propose a regularization method for optimizing latent representations, which equalizes distributions of parts of latent spaces, making representations much closer to generated ones. We use it for encoding images into spatial spaces to obtain significant improvement in quality while keeping semantics and ability to use our attribute model for edition purposes. In total, using our methods gives encoding quality boost even as high as 30% in terms of LPIPS score comparing to standard methods, while keeping semantics. Additionally, we propose a StyleGAN2 training procedure on our spatial latent spaces, together with a custom spatial latent representation distribution to make spatially closer elements in the representation more dependent on each other than farther elements. Such approach improves the FID score by 29% on SpaceNet, and is able to generate consistent images of arbitrary sizes on spatially homogeneous datasets, like satellite imagery."
Unsupervised Domain Adaption with Pixel-level Discriminator for Image-aware Layout Generation,"Layout is essential for graphic design and poster generation. Recently, applying deep learning models to generate layouts has attracted increasing attention. This paper focuses on using the GAN-based model conditioned on image contents to generate advertising poster graphic layouts, which requires an advertising poster layout dataset with paired product images and graphic layouts. However, the paired images and layouts in the existing dataset are collected by inpainting and annotating posters, respectively. There exists a domain gap between inpainted posters (source domain data) and clean product images (target domain data). Therefore, this paper combines unsupervised domain adaption techniques to design a GAN with a novel pixel-level discriminator (PD), called PDA-GAN, to generate graphic layouts according to image contents. The PD is connected to the shallow level feature map and computes the GAN loss for each input-image pixel. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that PDA-GAN can achieve state-of-the-art performances and generate high-quality image-aware graphic layouts for advertising posters."
CIFAKE: Image Classification and Explainable Identification of AI-Generated Synthetic Images,"Recent technological advances in synthetic data have enabled the generation of images with such high quality that human beings cannot tell the difference between real-life photographs and Artificial Intelligence (AI) generated images. Given the critical necessity of data reliability and authentication, this article proposes to enhance our ability to recognise AI-generated images through computer vision. Initially, a synthetic dataset is generated that mirrors the ten classes of the already available CIFAR-10 dataset with latent diffusion which provides a contrasting set of images for comparison to real photographs. The model is capable of generating complex visual attributes, such as photorealistic reflections in water. The two sets of data present as a binary classification problem with regard to whether the photograph is real or generated by AI. This study then proposes the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify the images into two categories; Real or Fake. Following hyperparameter tuning and the training of 36 individual network topologies, the optimal approach could correctly classify the images with 92.98% accuracy. Finally, this study implements explainable AI via Gradient Class Activation Mapping to explore which features within the images are useful for classification. Interpretation reveals interesting concepts within the image, in particular, noting that the actual entity itself does not hold useful information for classification; instead, the model focuses on small visual imperfections in the background of the images. The complete dataset engineered for this study, referred to as the CIFAKE dataset, is made publicly available to the research community for future work."
Factor Decomposed Generative Adversarial Networks for Text-to-Image Synthesis,"Prior works about text-to-image synthesis typically concatenated the sentence embedding with the noise vector, while the sentence embedding and the noise vector are two different factors, which control the different aspects of the generation. Simply concatenating them will entangle the latent factors and encumber the generative model.  In this paper, we attempt to decompose these two factors and propose Factor Decomposed Generative Adversarial Networks~(FDGAN). To achieve this, we firstly generate images from the noise vector and then apply the sentence embedding in the normalization layer for both generator and discriminators. We also design an additive norm layer to align and fuse the text-image features. The experimental results show that decomposing the noise and the sentence embedding can disentangle latent factors in text-to-image synthesis, and make the generative model more efficient. Compared with the baseline, FDGAN can achieve better performance, while fewer parameters are used."
Conditional Image-to-Video Generation with Latent Flow Diffusion Models,"Conditional image-to-video (cI2V) generation aims to synthesize a new plausible video starting from an image (e.g., a person's face) and a condition (e.g., an action class label like smile). The key challenge of the cI2V task lies in the simultaneous generation of realistic spatial appearance and temporal dynamics corresponding to the given image and condition. In this paper, we propose an approach for cI2V using novel latent flow diffusion models (LFDM) that synthesize an optical flow sequence in the latent space based on the given condition to warp the given image. Compared to previous direct-synthesis-based works, our proposed LFDM can better synthesize spatial details and temporal motion by fully utilizing the spatial content of the given image and warping it in the latent space according to the generated temporally-coherent flow. The training of LFDM consists of two separate stages: (1) an unsupervised learning stage to train a latent flow auto-encoder for spatial content generation, including a flow predictor to estimate latent flow between pairs of video frames, and (2) a conditional learning stage to train a 3D-UNet-based diffusion model (DM) for temporal latent flow generation. Unlike previous DMs operating in pixel space or latent feature space that couples spatial and temporal information, the DM in our LFDM only needs to learn a low-dimensional latent flow space for motion generation, thus being more computationally efficient. We conduct comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets, where LFDM consistently outperforms prior arts. Furthermore, we show that LFDM can be easily adapted to new domains by simply finetuning the image decoder. Our code is available at https://github.com/nihaomiao/CVPR23_LFDM."
Text-to-Image Generation: Perceptions and Realities,"Generative AI is an emerging technology that will have a profound impact on society and individuals. Only a decade ago, it was thought that creative work would be among the last to be automated - yet today, we see AI encroaching on creative domains. In this paper, we present the key findings of a survey study on people's perceptions of text-to-image generation. We touch on participants' technical understanding of the emerging technology, their ideas for potential application areas, as well as concerns, risks, and dangers of text-to-image generation to society and the individual. The study found that participants were aware of the risks and dangers associated with the technology, but only few participants considered the technology to be a risk to themselves. Additionally, those who had tried the technology rated its future importance lower than those who had not."
CoBIT: A Contrastive Bi-directional Image-Text Generation Model,"The field of vision and language has witnessed a proliferation of pre-trained foundation models. Most existing methods are independently pre-trained with contrastive objective like CLIP, image-to-text generative objective like PaLI, or text-to-image generative objective like Parti. However, the three objectives can be pre-trained on the same data, image-text pairs, and intuitively they complement each other as contrasting provides global alignment capacity and generation grants fine-grained understanding. In this work, we present a Contrastive Bi-directional Image-Text generation model (CoBIT), which attempts to unify the three pre-training objectives in one framework. Specifically, CoBIT employs a novel unicoder-decoder structure, consisting of an image unicoder, a text unicoder and a cross-modal decoder. The image/text unicoders can switch between encoding and decoding in different tasks, enabling flexibility and shared knowledge that benefits both image-to-text and text-to-image generations. CoBIT achieves superior performance in image understanding, image-text understanding (Retrieval, Captioning, VQA, SNLI-VE) and text-based content creation, particularly in zero-shot scenarios. For instance, 82.7% in zero-shot ImageNet classification, 9.37 FID score in zero-shot text-to-image generation and 44.8 CIDEr in zero-shot captioning."
Text2Video-Zero: Text-to-Image Diffusion Models are Zero-Shot Video Generators,"Recent text-to-video generation approaches rely on computationally heavy training and require large-scale video datasets. In this paper, we introduce a new task of zero-shot text-to-video generation and propose a low-cost approach (without any training or optimization) by leveraging the power of existing text-to-image synthesis methods (e.g., Stable Diffusion), making them suitable for the video domain.  Our key modifications include (i) enriching the latent codes of the generated frames with motion dynamics to keep the global scene and the background time consistent; and (ii) reprogramming frame-level self-attention using a new cross-frame attention of each frame on the first frame, to preserve the context, appearance, and identity of the foreground object.  Experiments show that this leads to low overhead, yet high-quality and remarkably consistent video generation. Moreover, our approach is not limited to text-to-video synthesis but is also applicable to other tasks such as conditional and content-specialized video generation, and Video Instruct-Pix2Pix, i.e., instruction-guided video editing.  As experiments show, our method performs comparably or sometimes better than recent approaches, despite not being trained on additional video data. Our code will be open sourced at: https://github.com/Picsart-AI-Research/Text2Video-Zero ."
Medical diffusion on a budget: textual inversion for medical image generation,"Diffusion-based models for text-to-image generation have gained immense popularity due to recent advancements in efficiency, accessibility, and quality. Although it is becoming increasingly feasible to perform inference with these systems using consumer-grade GPUs, training them from scratch still requires access to large datasets and significant computational resources. In the case of medical image generation, the availability of large, publicly accessible datasets that include text reports is limited due to legal and ethical concerns. While training a diffusion model on a private dataset may address this issue, it is not always feasible for institutions lacking the necessary computational resources. This work demonstrates that pre-trained Stable Diffusion models, originally trained on natural images, can be adapted to various medical imaging modalities by training text embeddings with textual inversion. In this study, we conducted experiments using medical datasets comprising only 100 samples from three medical modalities. Embeddings were trained in a matter of hours, while still retaining diagnostic relevance in image generation. Experiments were designed to achieve several objectives. Firstly, we fine-tuned the training and inference processes of textual inversion, revealing that larger embeddings and more examples are required. Secondly, we validated our approach by demonstrating a 2\% increase in the diagnostic accuracy (AUC) for detecting prostate cancer on MRI, which is a challenging multi-modal imaging modality, from 0.78 to 0.80. Thirdly, we performed simulations by interpolating between healthy and diseased states, combining multiple pathologies, and inpainting to show embedding flexibility and control of disease appearance. Finally, the embeddings trained in this study are small (less than 1 MB), which facilitates easy sharing of medical data with reduced privacy concerns."
Generative Image Inpainting with Segmentation Confusion Adversarial Training and Contrastive Learning,"This paper presents a new adversarial training framework for image inpainting with segmentation confusion adversarial training (SCAT) and contrastive learning. SCAT plays an adversarial game between an inpainting generator and a segmentation network, which provides pixel-level local training signals and can adapt to images with free-form holes. By combining SCAT with standard global adversarial training, the new adversarial training framework exhibits the following three advantages simultaneously: (1) the global consistency of the repaired image, (2) the local fine texture details of the repaired image, and (3) the flexibility of handling images with free-form holes. Moreover, we propose the textural and semantic contrastive learning losses to stabilize and improve our inpainting model's training by exploiting the feature representation space of the discriminator, in which the inpainting images are pulled closer to the ground truth images but pushed farther from the corrupted images. The proposed contrastive losses better guide the repaired images to move from the corrupted image data points to the real image data points in the feature representation space, resulting in more realistic completed images. We conduct extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, demonstrating our model's effectiveness and superiority both qualitatively and quantitatively."
MagicFusion: Boosting Text-to-Image Generation Performance by Fusing Diffusion Models,"The advent of open-source AI communities has produced a cornucopia of powerful text-guided diffusion models that are trained on various datasets. While few explorations have been conducted on ensembling such models to combine their strengths. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective method called Saliency-aware Noise Blending (SNB) that can empower the fused text-guided diffusion models to achieve more controllable generation. Specifically, we experimentally find that the responses of classifier-free guidance are highly related to the saliency of generated images. Thus we propose to trust different models in their areas of expertise by blending the predicted noises of two diffusion models in a saliency-aware manner. SNB is training-free and can be completed within a DDIM sampling process. Additionally, it can automatically align the semantics of two noise spaces without requiring additional annotations such as masks. Extensive experiments show the impressive effectiveness of SNB in various applications. Project page is available at https://magicfusion.github.io/."
Human Guided Ground-truth Generation for Realistic Image Super-resolution,"How to generate the ground-truth (GT) image is a critical issue for training realistic image super-resolution (Real-ISR) models. Existing methods mostly take a set of high-resolution (HR) images as GTs and apply various degradations to simulate their low-resolution (LR) counterparts. Though great progress has been achieved, such an LR-HR pair generation scheme has several limitations. First, the perceptual quality of HR images may not be high enough, limiting the quality of Real-ISR outputs. Second, existing schemes do not consider much human perception in GT generation, and the trained models tend to produce over-smoothed results or unpleasant artifacts. With the above considerations, we propose a human guided GT generation scheme. We first elaborately train multiple image enhancement models to improve the perceptual quality of HR images, and enable one LR image having multiple HR counterparts. Human subjects are then involved to annotate the high quality regions among the enhanced HR images as GTs, and label the regions with unpleasant artifacts as negative samples. A human guided GT image dataset with both positive and negative samples is then constructed, and a loss function is proposed to train the Real-ISR models. Experiments show that the Real-ISR models trained on our dataset can produce perceptually more realistic results with less artifacts. Dataset and codes can be found at https://github.com/ChrisDud0257/HGGT"
Text Semantics to Image Generation: A method of building facades design base on Stable Diffusion model,"Stable Diffusion model has been extensively employed in the study of archi-tectural image generation, but there is still an opportunity to enhance in terms of the controllability of the generated image content. A multi-network combined text-to-building facade image generating method is proposed in this work. We first fine-tuned the Stable Diffusion model on the CMP Fa-cades dataset using the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) approach, then we ap-ply the ControlNet model to further control the output. Finally, we contrast-ed the facade generating outcomes under various architectural style text con-tents and control strategies. The results demonstrate that the LoRA training approach significantly decreases the possibility of fine-tuning the Stable Dif-fusion large model, and the addition of the ControlNet model increases the controllability of the creation of text to building facade images. This pro-vides a foundation for subsequent studies on the generation of architectural images."
NASDM: Nuclei-Aware Semantic Histopathology Image Generation Using Diffusion Models,"In recent years, computational pathology has seen tremendous progress driven by deep learning methods in segmentation and classification tasks aiding prognostic and diagnostic settings. Nuclei segmentation, for instance, is an important task for diagnosing different cancers. However, training deep learning models for nuclei segmentation requires large amounts of annotated data, which is expensive to collect and label. This necessitates explorations into generative modeling of histopathological images. In this work, we use recent advances in conditional diffusion modeling to formulate a first-of-its-kind nuclei-aware semantic tissue generation framework (NASDM) which can synthesize realistic tissue samples given a semantic instance mask of up to six different nuclei types, enabling pixel-perfect nuclei localization in generated samples. These synthetic images are useful in applications in pathology pedagogy, validation of models, and supplementation of existing nuclei segmentation datasets. We demonstrate that NASDM is able to synthesize high-quality histopathology images of the colon with superior quality and semantic controllability over existing generative methods."
Picture that Sketch: Photorealistic Image Generation from Abstract Sketches,"Given an abstract, deformed, ordinary sketch from untrained amateurs like you and me, this paper turns it into a photorealistic image - just like those shown in Fig. 1(a), all non-cherry-picked. We differ significantly from prior art in that we do not dictate an edgemap-like sketch to start with, but aim to work with abstract free-hand human sketches. In doing so, we essentially democratise the sketch-to-photo pipeline, ""picturing"" a sketch regardless of how good you sketch. Our contribution at the outset is a decoupled encoder-decoder training paradigm, where the decoder is a StyleGAN trained on photos only. This importantly ensures that generated results are always photorealistic. The rest is then all centred around how best to deal with the abstraction gap between sketch and photo. For that, we propose an autoregressive sketch mapper trained on sketch-photo pairs that maps a sketch to the StyleGAN latent space. We further introduce specific designs to tackle the abstract nature of human sketches, including a fine-grained discriminative loss on the back of a trained sketch-photo retrieval model, and a partial-aware sketch augmentation strategy. Finally, we showcase a few downstream tasks our generation model enables, amongst them is showing how fine-grained sketch-based image retrieval, a well-studied problem in the sketch community, can be reduced to an image (generated) to image retrieval task, surpassing state-of-the-arts. We put forward generated results in the supplementary for everyone to scrutinise."
IRGen: Generative Modeling for Image Retrieval,"While generative modeling has been ubiquitous in natural language processing and computer vision, its application to image retrieval remains unexplored. In this paper, we recast image retrieval as a form of generative modeling by employing a sequence-to-sequence model, contributing to the current unified theme. Our framework, IRGen, is a unified model that enables end-to-end differentiable search, thus achieving superior performance thanks to direct optimization. While developing IRGen we tackle the key technical challenge of converting an image into quite a short sequence of semantic units in order to enable efficient and effective retrieval. Empirical experiments demonstrate that our model yields significant improvement over three commonly used benchmarks, for example, 22.9\% higher than the best baseline method in precision@10 on In-shop dataset with comparable recall@10 score."
GlueGen: Plug and Play Multi-modal Encoders for X-to-image Generation,"Text-to-image (T2I) models based on diffusion processes have achieved remarkable success in controllable image generation using user-provided captions. However, the tight coupling between the current text encoder and image decoder in T2I models makes it challenging to replace or upgrade. Such changes often require massive fine-tuning or even training from scratch with the prohibitive expense. To address this problem, we propose GlueGen, which applies a newly proposed GlueNet model to align features from single-modal or multi-modal encoders with the latent space of an existing T2I model. The approach introduces a new training objective that leverages parallel corpora to align the representation spaces of different encoders. Empirical results show that GlueNet can be trained efficiently and enables various capabilities beyond previous state-of-the-art models: 1) multilingual language models such as XLM-Roberta can be aligned with existing T2I models, allowing for the generation of high-quality images from captions beyond English; 2) GlueNet can align multi-modal encoders such as AudioCLIP with the Stable Diffusion model, enabling sound-to-image generation; 3) it can also upgrade the current text encoder of the latent diffusion model for challenging case generation. By the alignment of various feature representations, the GlueNet allows for flexible and efficient integration of new functionality into existing T2I models and sheds light on X-to-image (X2I) generation."
Diffusion-HPC: Generating Synthetic Images with Realistic Humans,"Recent text-to-image generative models have exhibited remarkable abilities in generating high-fidelity and photo-realistic images. However, despite the visually impressive results, these models often struggle to preserve plausible human structure in the generations. Due to this reason, while generative models have shown promising results in aiding downstream image recognition tasks by generating large volumes of synthetic data, they remain infeasible for improving downstream human pose perception and understanding. In this work, we propose Diffusion model with Human Pose Correction (Diffusion HPC), a text-conditioned method that generates photo-realistic images with plausible posed humans by injecting prior knowledge about human body structure. We show that Diffusion HPC effectively improves the realism of human generations. Furthermore, as the generations are accompanied by 3D meshes that serve as ground truths, Diffusion HPC's generated image-mesh pairs are well-suited for downstream human mesh recovery task, where a shortage of 3D training data has long been an issue."
: Extended Textual Conditioning in Text-to-Image Generation,"We introduce an Extended Textual Conditioning space in text-to-image models, referred to as P+. This space consists of multiple textual conditions, derived from per-layer prompts, each corresponding to a layer of the denoising U-net of the diffusion model.  We show that the extended space provides greater disentangling and control over image synthesis. We further introduce Extended Textual Inversion (XTI), where the images are inverted into P+, and represented by per-layer tokens.  We show that XTI is more expressive and precise, and converges faster than the original Textual Inversion (TI) space. The extended inversion method does not involve any noticeable trade-off between reconstruction and editability and induces more regular inversions.  We conduct a series of extensive experiments to analyze and understand the properties of the new space, and to showcase the effectiveness of our method for personalizing text-to-image models. Furthermore, we utilize the unique properties of this space to achieve previously unattainable results in object-style mixing using text-to-image models. Project page: https://prompt-plus.github.io"
Unified Multi-Modal Latent Diffusion for Joint Subject and Text Conditional Image Generation,"Language-guided image generation has achieved great success nowadays by using diffusion models. However, texts can be less detailed to describe highly-specific subjects such as a particular dog or a certain car, which makes pure text-to-image generation not accurate enough to satisfy user requirements. In this work, we present a novel Unified Multi-Modal Latent Diffusion (UMM-Diffusion) which takes joint texts and images containing specified subjects as input sequences and generates customized images with the subjects. To be more specific, both input texts and images are encoded into one unified multi-modal latent space, in which the input images are learned to be projected to pseudo word embedding and can be further combined with text to guide image generation. Besides, to eliminate the irrelevant parts of the input images such as background or illumination, we propose a novel sampling technique of diffusion models used by the image generator which fuses the results guided by multi-modal input and pure text input. By leveraging the large-scale pre-trained text-to-image generator and the designed image encoder, our method is able to generate high-quality images with complex semantics from both aspects of input texts and images."
DIRE for Diffusion-Generated Image Detection,"Diffusion models have shown remarkable success in visual synthesis, but have also raised concerns about potential abuse for malicious purposes. In this paper, we seek to build a detector for telling apart real images from diffusion-generated images. We find that existing detectors struggle to detect images generated by diffusion models, even if we include generated images from a specific diffusion model in their training data. To address this issue, we propose a novel image representation called DIffusion Reconstruction Error (DIRE), which measures the error between an input image and its reconstruction counterpart by a pre-trained diffusion model. We observe that diffusion-generated images can be approximately reconstructed by a diffusion model while real images cannot. It provides a hint that DIRE can serve as a bridge to distinguish generated and real images. DIRE provides an effective way to detect images generated by most diffusion models, and it is general for detecting generated images from unseen diffusion models and robust to various perturbations. Furthermore, we establish a comprehensive diffusion-generated benchmark including images generated by eight diffusion models to evaluate the performance of diffusion-generated image detectors. Extensive experiments on our collected benchmark demonstrate that DIRE exhibits superiority over previous generated-image detectors. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/ZhendongWang6/DIRE."
Privacy-Preserving Video Conferencing via Thermal-Generative Images,"Due to the COVID-19 epidemic, video conferencing has evolved as a new paradigm of communication and teamwork. However, private and personal information can be easily leaked through cameras during video conferencing. This includes leakage of a person's appearance as well as the contents in the background. This paper proposes a novel way of using online low-resolution thermal images as conditions to guide the synthesis of RGB images, bringing a promising solution for real-time video conferencing when privacy leakage is a concern. SPADE-SR (Spatially-Adaptive De-normalization with Self Resampling), a variant of SPADE, is adopted to incorporate the spatial property of a thermal heatmap and the non-thermal property of a normal, privacy-free pre-recorded RGB image provided in a form of latent code. We create a PAIR-LRT-Human (LRT = Low-Resolution Thermal) dataset to validate our claims. The result enables a convenient way of video conferencing where users no longer need to groom themselves and tidy up backgrounds for a short meeting. Additionally, it allows a user to switch to a different appearance and background during a conference."
Exploring the Power of Generative Deep Learning for Image-to-Image Translation and MRI Reconstruction: A Cross-Domain Review,"Deep learning has become a prominent computational modeling tool in the areas of computer vision and image processing in recent years. This research comprehensively analyzes the different deep-learning methods used for image-to-image translation and reconstruction in the natural and medical imaging domains. We examine the famous deep learning frameworks, such as convolutional neural networks and generative adversarial networks, and their variants, delving into the fundamental principles and difficulties of each. In the field of natural computer vision, we investigate the development and extension of various deep-learning generative models. In comparison, we investigate the possible applications of deep learning to generative medical imaging problems, including medical image translation, MRI reconstruction, and multi-contrast MRI synthesis. This thorough review provides scholars and practitioners in the areas of generative computer vision and medical imaging with useful insights for summarizing past works and getting insight into future research paths."
Conditional Synthetic Food Image Generation,"Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have been widely investigated for image synthesis based on their powerful representation learning ability. In this work, we explore the StyleGAN and its application of synthetic food image generation. Despite the impressive performance of GAN for natural image generation, food images suffer from high intra-class diversity and inter-class similarity, resulting in overfitting and visual artifacts for synthetic images. Therefore, we aim to explore the capability and improve the performance of GAN methods for food image generation. Specifically, we first choose StyleGAN3 as the baseline method to generate synthetic food images and analyze the performance. Then, we identify two issues that can cause performance degradation on food images during the training phase: (1) inter-class feature entanglement during multi-food classes training and (2) loss of high-resolution detail during image downsampling. To address both issues, we propose to train one food category at a time to avoid feature entanglement and leverage image patches cropped from high-resolution datasets to retain fine details. We evaluate our method on the Food-101 dataset and show improved quality of generated synthetic food images compared with the baseline. Finally, we demonstrate the great potential of improving the performance of downstream tasks, such as food image classification by including high-quality synthetic training samples in the data augmentation."
Investigating GANsformer: A Replication Study of a State-of-the-Art Image Generation Model,"The field of image generation through generative modelling is abundantly discussed nowadays. It can be used for various applications, such as up-scaling existing images, creating non-existing objects, such as interior design scenes, products or even human faces, and achieving transfer-learning processes. In this context, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of widely studied machine learning frameworks first appearing in the paper ""Generative adversarial nets"" by Goodfellow et al. that achieve the goal above. In our work, we reproduce and evaluate a novel variation of the original GAN network, the GANformer, proposed in ""Generative Adversarial Transformers"" by Hudson and Zitnick. This project aimed to recreate the methods presented in this paper to reproduce the original results and comment on the authors' claims. Due to resources and time limitations, we had to constrain the network's training times, dataset types, and sizes. Our research successfully recreated both variations of the proposed GANformer model and found differences between the authors' and our results. Moreover, discrepancies between the publication methodology and the one implemented, made available in the code, allowed us to study two undisclosed variations of the presented procedures."
MRGAN360: Multi-stage Recurrent Generative Adversarial Network for 360 Degree Image Saliency Prediction,"Thanks to the ability of providing an immersive and interactive experience, the uptake of 360 degree image content has been rapidly growing in consumer and industrial applications. Compared to planar 2D images, saliency prediction for 360 degree images is more challenging due to their high resolutions and spherical viewing ranges. Currently, most high-performance saliency prediction models for omnidirectional images (ODIs) rely on deeper or broader convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which benefit from CNNs' superior feature representation capabilities while suffering from their high computational costs. In this paper, inspired by the human visual cognitive process, i.e., human being's perception of a visual scene is always accomplished by multiple stages of analysis, we propose a novel multi-stage recurrent generative adversarial networks for ODIs dubbed MRGAN360, to predict the saliency maps stage by stage. At each stage, the prediction model takes as input the original image and the output of the previous stage and outputs a more accurate saliency map. We employ a recurrent neural network among adjacent prediction stages to model their correlations, and exploit a discriminator at the end of each stage to supervise the output saliency map. In addition, we share the weights among all the stages to obtain a lightweight architecture that is computationally cheap. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art model in terms of both prediction accuracy and model size."
Text-to-image Diffusion Models in Generative AI: A Survey,"This survey reviews text-to-image diffusion models in the context that diffusion models have emerged to be popular for a wide range of generative tasks. As a self-contained work, this survey starts with a brief introduction of how a basic diffusion model works for image synthesis, followed by how condition or guidance improves learning. Based on that, we present a review of state-of-the-art methods on text-conditioned image synthesis, i.e., text-to-image. We further summarize applications beyond text-to-image generation: text-guided creative generation and text-guided image editing. Beyond the progress made so far, we discuss existing challenges and promising future directions."
AGTGAN: Unpaired Image Translation for Photographic Ancient Character Generation,"The study of ancient writings has great value for archaeology and philology. Essential forms of material are photographic characters, but manual photographic character recognition is extremely time-consuming and expertise-dependent. Automatic classification is therefore greatly desired. However, the current performance is limited due to the lack of annotated data. Data generation is an inexpensive but useful solution for data scarcity. Nevertheless, the diverse glyph shapes and complex background textures of photographic ancient characters make the generation task difficult, leading to the unsatisfactory results of existing methods. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised generative adversarial network called AGTGAN. By the explicit global and local glyph shape style modeling followed by the stroke-aware texture transfer, as well as an associate adversarial learning mechanism, our method can generate characters with diverse glyphs and realistic textures. We evaluate our approach on the photographic ancient character datasets, e.g., OBC306 and CSDD. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in various metrics and performs much better in terms of the diversity and authenticity of generated samples. With our generated images, experiments on the largest photographic oracle bone character dataset show that our method can achieve a significant increase in classification accuracy, up to 16.34%."
Recursive Generalization Transformer for Image Super-Resolution,"Transformer architectures have exhibited remarkable performance in image super-resolution (SR). Since the quadratic computational complexity of the self-attention (SA) in Transformer, existing methods tend to adopt SA in a local region to reduce overheads. However, the local design restricts the global context exploitation, which is critical for accurate image reconstruction. In this work, we propose the Recursive Generalization Transformer (RGT) for image SR, which can capture global spatial information and is suitable for high-resolution images. Specifically, we propose the recursive-generalization self-attention (RG-SA). It recursively aggregates input features into representative feature maps, and then utilizes cross-attention to extract global information. Meanwhile, the channel dimensions of attention matrices (query, key, and value) are further scaled for a better trade-off between computational overheads and performance. Furthermore, we combine the RG-SA with local self-attention to enhance the exploitation of the global context, and propose the hybrid adaptive integration (HAI) for module integration. The HAI allows the direct and effective fusion between features at different levels (local or global). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our RGT outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods."
Score-Based Generative Models for Medical Image Segmentation using Signed Distance Functions,"Medical image segmentation is a crucial task that relies on the ability to accurately identify and isolate regions of interest in images. Thereby, generative approaches allow to capture the statistical properties of segmentation masks that are dependent on the respective medical images. In this work we propose a conditional score-based generative modeling framework that leverages the signed distance function to represent an implicit and smoother distribution of segmentation masks. The score function of the conditional distribution of segmentation masks is learned in a conditional denoising process, which can be effectively used to generate accurate segmentation masks. Moreover, uncertainty maps can be generated, which can aid in further analysis and thus enhance the predictive robustness. We qualitatively and quantitatively illustrate competitive performance of the proposed method on a public nuclei and gland segmentation data set, highlighting its potential utility in medical image segmentation applications."
Detecting Images Generated by Diffusers,"This paper explores the task of detecting images generated by text-to-image diffusion models. To evaluate this, we consider images generated from captions in the MSCOCO and Wikimedia datasets using two state-of-the-art models: Stable Diffusion and GLIDE. Our experiments show that it is possible to detect the generated images using simple Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), starting from features extracted by CLIP, or traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We also observe that models trained on images generated by Stable Diffusion can detect images generated by GLIDE relatively well, however, the reverse is not true. Lastly, we find that incorporating the associated textual information with the images rarely leads to significant improvement in detection results but that the type of subject depicted in the image can have a significant impact on performance. This work provides insights into the feasibility of detecting generated images, and has implications for security and privacy concerns in real-world applications.

Intriguing Property and Counterfactual Explanation of GAN for Remote Sensing Image Generation,"Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have achieved remarkable progress in the natural image field. However, when applying GANs in the remote sensing (RS) image generation task, an extraordinary phenomenon is observed: the GAN model is more sensitive to the size of training data for RS image generation than for natural image generation. In other words, the generation quality of RS images will change significantly with the number of training categories or samples per category. In this paper, we first analyze this phenomenon from two kinds of toy experiments and conclude that the amount of feature information contained in the GAN model decreases with reduced training data. Then we establish a structural causal model (SCM) of the data generation process and interpret the generated data as the counterfactuals. Based on this SCM, we theoretically prove that the quality of generated images is positively correlated with the amount of feature information. This provides insights for enriching the feature information learned by the GAN model during training. Consequently, we propose two innovative adjustment schemes, namely Uniformity Regularization (UR) and Entropy Regularization (ER), to increase the information learned by the GAN model at the distributional and sample levels, respectively. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our methods. Extensive experiments on three RS datasets and two natural datasets show that our methods outperform the well-established models on RS image generation tasks. The source code is available at https://github.com/rootSue/Causal-RSGAN."
Generative Model-Based Attack on Learnable Image Encryption for Privacy-Preserving Deep Learning,"In this paper, we propose a novel generative model-based attack on learnable image encryption methods proposed for privacy-preserving deep learning. Various learnable encryption methods have been studied to protect the sensitive visual information of plain images, and some of them have been investigated to be robust enough against all existing attacks. However, previous attacks on image encryption focus only on traditional cryptanalytic attacks or reverse translation models, so these attacks cannot recover any visual information if a block-scrambling encryption step, which effectively destroys global information, is applied. Accordingly, in this paper, generative models are explored to evaluate whether such models can restore sensitive visual information from encrypted images for the first time. We first point out that encrypted images have some similarity with plain images in the embedding space. By taking advantage of leaked information from encrypted images, we propose a guided generative model as an attack on learnable image encryption to recover personally identifiable visual information. We implement the proposed attack in two ways by utilizing two state-of-the-art generative models: a StyleGAN-based model and latent diffusion-based one. Experiments were carried out on the CelebA-HQ and ImageNet datasets. Results show that images reconstructed by the proposed method have perceptual similarities to plain images."
Multilevel Diffusion: Infinite Dimensional Score-Based Diffusion Models for Image Generation,"Score-based diffusion models (SBDM) have recently emerged as state-of-the-art approaches for image generation. Existing SBDMs are typically formulated in a finite-dimensional setting, where images are considered as tensors of a finite size. This papers develops SBDMs in the infinite-dimensional setting, that is, we model the training data as functions supported on a rectangular domain. Besides the quest for generating images at ever higher resolution our primary motivation is to create a well-posed infinite-dimensional learning problem so that we can discretize it consistently on multiple resolution levels. We thereby hope to obtain diffusion models that generalize across different resolution levels and improve the efficiency of the training process. We demonstrate how to overcome two shortcomings of current SBDM approaches in the infinite-dimensional setting. First, we modify the forward process to ensure that the latent distribution is well-defined in the infinite-dimensional setting using the notion of trace class operators. Second, we illustrate that approximating the score function with an operator network, in our case Fourier neural operators (FNOs), is beneficial for multilevel training. After deriving the forward process in the infinite-dimensional setting and reverse processes for finite approximations, we show their well-posedness, derive adequate discretizations, and investigate the role of the latent distributions. We provide first promising numerical results on two datasets, MNIST and material structures. In particular, we show that multilevel training is feasible within this framework."
Transformer-based Image Generation from Scene Graphs,"Graph-structured scene descriptions can be efficiently used in generative models to control the composition of the generated image. Previous approaches are based on the combination of graph convolutional networks and adversarial methods for layout prediction and image generation, respectively. In this work, we show how employing multi-head attention to encode the graph information, as well as using a transformer-based model in the latent space for image generation can improve the quality of the sampled data, without the need to employ adversarial models with the subsequent advantage in terms of training stability. The proposed approach, specifically, is entirely based on transformer architectures both for encoding scene graphs into intermediate object layouts and for decoding these layouts into images, passing through a lower dimensional space learned by a vector-quantized variational autoencoder. Our approach shows an improved image quality with respect to state-of-the-art methods as well as a higher degree of diversity among multiple generations from the same scene graph. We evaluate our approach on three public datasets: Visual Genome, COCO, and CLEVR. We achieve an Inception Score of 13.7 and 12.8, and an FID of 52.3 and 60.3, on COCO and Visual Genome, respectively. We perform ablation studies on our contributions to assess the impact of each component. Code is available at https://github.com/perceivelab/trf-sg2im"
A Prompt Log Analysis of Text-to-Image Generation Systems,"Recent developments in large language models (LLM) and generative AI have unleashed the astonishing capabilities of text-to-image generation systems to synthesize high-quality images that are faithful to a given reference text, known as a ""prompt"". These systems have immediately received lots of attention from researchers, creators, and common users. Despite the plenty of efforts to improve the generative models, there is limited work on understanding the information needs of the users of these systems at scale. We conduct the first comprehensive analysis of large-scale prompt logs collected from multiple text-to-image generation systems. Our work is analogous to analyzing the query logs of Web search engines, a line of work that has made critical contributions to the glory of the Web search industry and research. Compared with Web search queries, text-to-image prompts are significantly longer, often organized into special structures that consist of the subject, form, and intent of the generation tasks and present unique categories of information needs. Users make more edits within creation sessions, which present remarkable exploratory patterns. There is also a considerable gap between the user-input prompts and the captions of the images included in the open training data of the generative models. Our findings provide concrete implications on how to improve text-to-image generation systems for creation purposes."
New Audio Representations Image Gan Generation from BriVL,"Recently, researchers have gradually realized that in some cases, the self-supervised pre-training on large-scale Internet data is better than that of high-quality/manually labeled data sets, and multimodal/large models are better than single or bimodal/small models. In this paper, we propose a robust audio representation learning method WavBriVL based on Bridging-Vision-and-Language (BriVL). WavBriVL projects audio, image and text into a shared embedded space, so that multi-modal applications can be realized. We demonstrate the qualitative evaluation of the image generated from WavBriVL as a shared embedded space, with the main purposes of this paper: (1) Learning the correlation between audio and image; (2) Explore a new way of image generation, that is, use audio to generate pictures. Experimental results show that this method can effectively generate appropriate images from audio."
Lformer: Text-to-Image Generation with L-shape Block Parallel Decoding,"Generative transformers have shown their superiority in synthesizing high-fidelity and high-resolution images, such as good diversity and training stability. However, they suffer from the problem of slow generation since they need to generate a long token sequence autoregressively. To better accelerate the generative transformers while keeping good generation quality, we propose Lformer, a semi-autoregressive text-to-image generation model. Lformer firstly encodes an image into h{\times}h discrete tokens, then divides these tokens into h mirrored L-shape blocks from the top left to the bottom right and decodes the tokens in a block parallelly in each step. Lformer predicts the area adjacent to the previous context like autoregressive models thus it is more stable while accelerating. By leveraging the 2D structure of image tokens, Lformer achieves faster speed than the existing transformer-based methods while keeping good generation quality. Moreover, the pretrained Lformer can edit images without the requirement for finetuning. We can roll back to the early steps for regeneration or edit the image with a bounding box and a text prompt."
F2BEV: Bird's Eye View Generation from Surround-View Fisheye Camera Images for Automated Driving,"Bird's Eye View (BEV) representations are tremendously useful for perception-related automated driving tasks. However, generating BEVs from surround-view fisheye camera images is challenging due to the strong distortions introduced by such wide-angle lenses. We take the first step in addressing this challenge and introduce a baseline, F2BEV, to generate BEV height maps and semantic segmentation maps from fisheye images. F2BEV consists of a distortion-aware spatial cross attention module for querying and consolidating spatial information from fisheye image features in a transformer-style architecture followed by a task-specific head. We evaluate single-task and multi-task variants of F2BEV on our synthetic FB-SSEM dataset, all of which generate better BEV height and segmentation maps (in terms of the IoU) than a state-of-the-art BEV generation method operating on undistorted fisheye images. We also demonstrate height map generation from real-world fisheye images using F2BEV. An initial sample of our dataset is publicly available at https://tinyurl.com/58jvnscy"
Guided Image-to-Image Translation by Discriminator-Generator Communication,"The goal of Image-to-image (I2I) translation is to transfer an image from a source domain to a target domain, which has recently drawn increasing attention. One major branch of this research is to formulate I2I translation based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). As a zero-sum game, GAN can be reformulated as a Partially-observed Markov Decision Process (POMDP) for generators, where generators cannot access full state information of their environments. This formulation illustrates the information insufficiency in the GAN training. To mitigate this problem, we propose to add a communication channel between discriminators and generators. We explore multiple architecture designs to integrate the communication mechanism into the I2I translation framework. To validate the performance of the proposed approach, we have conducted extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets. The experimental results confirm the superiority of our proposed method."
MotionVideoGAN: A Novel Video Generator Based on the Motion Space Learned from Image Pairs,"Video generation has achieved rapid progress benefiting from high-quality renderings provided by powerful image generators. We regard the video synthesis task as generating a sequence of images sharing the same contents but varying in motions. However, most previous video synthesis frameworks based on pre-trained image generators treat content and motion generation separately, leading to unrealistic generated videos. Therefore, we design a novel framework to build the motion space, aiming to achieve content consistency and fast convergence for video generation. We present MotionVideoGAN, a novel video generator synthesizing videos based on the motion space learned by pre-trained image pair generators. Firstly, we propose an image pair generator named MotionStyleGAN to generate image pairs sharing the same contents and producing various motions. Then we manage to acquire motion codes to edit one image in the generated image pairs and keep the other unchanged. The motion codes help us edit images within the motion space since the edited image shares the same contents with the other unchanged one in image pairs. Finally, we introduce a latent code generator to produce latent code sequences using motion codes for video generation. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the most complex video dataset ever used for unconditional video generation evaluation, UCF101."
"Diffusion Models Generate Images Like Painters: an Analytical Theory of Outline First, Details Later","How do diffusion generative models convert pure noise into meaningful images? We argue that generation involves first committing to an outline, and then to finer and finer details. The corresponding reverse diffusion process can be modeled by dynamics on a (time-dependent) high-dimensional landscape full of Gaussian-like modes, which makes the following predictions: (i) individual trajectories tend to be very low-dimensional; (ii) scene elements that vary more within training data tend to emerge earlier; and (iii) early perturbations substantially change image content more often than late perturbations. We show that the behavior of a variety of trained unconditional and conditional diffusion models like Stable Diffusion is consistent with these predictions. Finally, we use our theory to search for the latent image manifold of diffusion models, and propose a new way to generate interpretable image variations. Our viewpoint suggests generation by GANs and diffusion models have unexpected similarities."
Few-Shot Defect Image Generation via Defect-Aware Feature Manipulation,"The performances of defect inspection have been severely hindered by insufficient defect images in industries, which can be alleviated by generating more samples as data augmentation. We propose the first defect image generation method in the challenging few-shot cases. Given just a handful of defect images and relatively more defect-free ones, our goal is to augment the dataset with new defect images. Our method consists of two training stages. First, we train a data-efficient StyleGAN2 on defect-free images as the backbone. Second, we attach defect-aware residual blocks to the backbone, which learn to produce reasonable defect masks and accordingly manipulate the features within the masked regions by training the added modules on limited defect images. Extensive experiments on MVTec AD dataset not only validate the effectiveness of our method in generating realistic and diverse defect images, but also manifest the benefits it brings to downstream defect inspection tasks. Codes are available at https://github.com/Ldhlwh/DFMGAN."
Retinal Image Restoration using Transformer and Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Network,"Medical imaging plays a significant role in detecting and treating various diseases. However, these images often happen to be of too poor quality, leading to decreased efficiency, extra expenses, and even incorrect diagnoses. Therefore, we propose a retinal image enhancement method using a vision transformer and convolutional neural network. It builds a cycle-consistent generative adversarial network that relies on unpaired datasets. It consists of two generators that translate images from one domain to another (e.g., low- to high-quality and vice versa), playing an adversarial game with two discriminators. Generators produce indistinguishable images for discriminators that predict the original images from generated ones. Generators are a combination of vision transformer (ViT) encoder and convolutional neural network (CNN) decoder. Discriminators include traditional CNN encoders. The resulting improved images have been tested quantitatively using such evaluation metrics as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index measure (SSIM), and qualitatively, i.e., vessel segmentation. The proposed method successfully reduces the adverse effects of blurring, noise, illumination disturbances, and color distortions while significantly preserving structural and color information. Experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method. Our testing PSNR is 31.138 dB for the first and 27.798 dB for the second dataset. Testing SSIM is 0.919 and 0.904, respectively."
X&Fuse: Fusing Visual Information in Text-to-Image Generation,"We introduce X&Fuse, a general approach for conditioning on visual information when generating images from text. We demonstrate the potential of X&Fuse in three different text-to-image generation scenarios. (i) When a bank of images is available, we retrieve and condition on a related image (Retrieve&Fuse), resulting in significant improvements on the MS-COCO benchmark, gaining a state-of-the-art FID score of 6.65 in zero-shot settings. (ii) When cropped-object images are at hand, we utilize them and perform subject-driven generation (Crop&Fuse), outperforming the textual inversion method while being more than x100 faster. (iii) Having oracle access to the image scene (Scene&Fuse), allows us to achieve an FID score of 5.03 on MS-COCO in zero-shot settings. Our experiments indicate that X&Fuse is an effective, easy-to-adapt, simple, and general approach for scenarios in which the model may benefit from additional visual information."
StraIT: Non-autoregressive Generation with Stratified Image Transformer,"We propose Stratified Image Transformer(StraIT), a pure non-autoregressive(NAR) generative model that demonstrates superiority in high-quality image synthesis over existing autoregressive(AR) and diffusion models(DMs). In contrast to the under-exploitation of visual characteristics in existing vision tokenizer, we leverage the hierarchical nature of images to encode visual tokens into stratified levels with emergent properties. Through the proposed image stratification that obtains an interlinked token pair, we alleviate the modeling difficulty and lift the generative power of NAR models. Our experiments demonstrate that StraIT significantly improves NAR generation and out-performs existing DMs and AR methods while being order-of-magnitude faster, achieving FID scores of 3.96 at 256*256 resolution on ImageNet without leveraging any guidance in sampling or auxiliary image classifiers. When equipped with classifier-free guidance, our method achieves an FID of 3.36 and IS of 259.3. In addition, we illustrate the decoupled modeling process of StraIT generation, showing its compelling properties on applications including domain transfer."
Level Up the Deepfake Detection: a Method to Effectively Discriminate Images Generated by GAN Architectures and Diffusion Models,"The image deepfake detection task has been greatly addressed by the scientific community to discriminate real images from those generated by Artificial Intelligence (AI) models: a binary classification task. In this work, the deepfake detection and recognition task was investigated by collecting a dedicated dataset of pristine images and fake ones generated by 9 different Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architectures and by 4 additional Diffusion Models (DM). A hierarchical multi-level approach was then introduced to solve three different deepfake detection and recognition tasks: (i) Real Vs AI generated; (ii) GANs Vs DMs; (iii) AI specific architecture recognition. Experimental results demonstrated, in each case, more than 97% classification accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art methods."
PixHt-Lab: Pixel Height Based Light Effect Generation for Image Compositing,"Lighting effects such as shadows or reflections are key in making synthetic images realistic and visually appealing. To generate such effects, traditional computer graphics uses a physically-based renderer along with 3D geometry. To compensate for the lack of geometry in 2D Image compositing, recent deep learning-based approaches introduced a pixel height representation to generate soft shadows and reflections. However, the lack of geometry limits the quality of the generated soft shadows and constrain reflections to pure specular ones. We introduce PixHt-Lab, a system leveraging an explicit mapping from pixel height representation to 3D space. Using this mapping, PixHt-Lab reconstructs both the cutout and background geometry and renders realistic, diverse, lighting effects for image compositing. Given a surface with physically-based materials, we can render reflections with varying glossiness. To generate more realistic soft shadows, we further propose to use 3D-aware buffer channels to guide a neural renderer. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that PixHt-Lab significantly improves soft shadow generation."
Global Context-Aware Person Image Generation,"We propose a data-driven approach for context-aware person image generation. Specifically, we attempt to generate a person image such that the synthesized instance can blend into a complex scene. In our method, the position, scale, and appearance of the generated person are semantically conditioned on the existing persons in the scene. The proposed technique is divided into three sequential steps. At first, we employ a Pix2PixHD model to infer a coarse semantic mask that represents the new person's spatial location, scale, and potential pose. Next, we use a data-centric approach to select the closest representation from a precomputed cluster of fine semantic masks. Finally, we adopt a multi-scale, attention-guided architecture to transfer the appearance attributes from an exemplar image. The proposed strategy enables us to synthesize semantically coherent realistic persons that can blend into an existing scene without altering the global context. We conclude our findings with relevant qualitative and quantitative evaluations."
Differentially Private Diffusion Models Generate Useful Synthetic Images,"The ability to generate privacy-preserving synthetic versions of sensitive image datasets could unlock numerous ML applications currently constrained by data availability. Due to their astonishing image generation quality, diffusion models are a prime candidate for generating high-quality synthetic data. However, recent studies have found that, by default, the outputs of some diffusion models do not preserve training data privacy. By privately fine-tuning ImageNet pre-trained diffusion models with more than 80M parameters, we obtain SOTA results on CIFAR-10 and Camelyon17 in terms of both FID and the accuracy of downstream classifiers trained on synthetic data. We decrease the SOTA FID on CIFAR-10 from 26.2 to 9.8, and increase the accuracy from 51.0% to 88.0%. On synthetic data from Camelyon17, we achieve a downstream accuracy of 91.1% which is close to the SOTA of 96.5% when training on the real data. We leverage the ability of generative models to create infinite amounts of data to maximise the downstream prediction performance, and further show how to use synthetic data for hyperparameter tuning. Our results demonstrate that diffusion models fine-tuned with differential privacy can produce useful and provably private synthetic data, even in applications with significant distribution shift between the pre-training and fine-tuning distributions."
ELITE: Encoding Visual Concepts into Textual Embeddings for Customized Text-to-Image Generation,"Despite unprecedented ability in imaginary creation, large text-to-image models are further expected to express customized concepts. Existing works generally learn such concepts in an optimization-based manner, yet bringing excessive computation or memory burden. In this paper, we instead propose a learning-based encoder for fast and accurate concept customization, which consists of global and local mapping networks. In specific, the global mapping network separately projects the hierarchical features of a given image into multiple ``new'' words in the textual word embedding space, i.e., one primary word for well-editable concept and other auxiliary words to exclude irrelevant disturbances (e.g., background). In the meantime, a local mapping network injects the encoded patch features into cross attention layers to provide omitted details, without sacrificing the editability of primary concepts. We compare our method with prior optimization-based approaches on a variety of user-defined concepts, and demonstrate that our method enables more high-fidelity inversion and robust editability with a significantly faster encoding process. Our code will be publicly available at https://github.com/csyxwei/ELITE."
"""An Adapt-or-Die Type of Situation"": Perception, Adoption, and Use of Text-To-Image-Generation AI by Game Industry Professionals","Text-to-image generation (TTIG) models, a recent addition to creative AI, can generate images based on a text description. These models have begun to rival the work of professional creatives, and sparked discussions on the future of creative work, loss of jobs, and copyright issues, amongst other important implications. To support the sustainable adoption of TTIG, we must provide rich, reliable and transparent insights into how professionals perceive, adopt and use TTIG. Crucially though, the public debate is shallow, narrow and lacking transparency, while academic work has focused on studying the use of TTIG in a general artist population, but not on the perceptions and attitudes of professionals in a specific industry. In this paper, we contribute a qualitative, exploratory interview study on TTIG in the Finnish videogame industry. Through a Template Analysis on semi-structured interviews with 14 game professionals, we reveal 12 overarching themes, structured into 49 sub-themes on professionals' perception, adoption and use of TTIG systems in games industry practice. Experiencing (yet another) change of roles and creative processes, our participants' reflections can inform discussions within the industry, be used by policymakers to inform urgently needed legislation, and support researchers in games, HCI and AI to support the sustainable, professional use of TTIG to benefit people and games as cultural artefacts."
Data fusion of satellite imagery for generation of daily cloud free images at high resolution level,"In this paper we discuss a new variational approach to the Date Fusion problem of multi-spectral satellite images from Sentinel-2 and MODIS that have been captured at different resolution level and, arguably, on different days. The crucial point of our approach that the MODIS image is cloud-free whereas the images from Sentinel-2 can be corrupted by clouds or noise."
Controlled and Conditional Text to Image Generation with Diffusion Prior,"Denoising Diffusion models have shown remarkable performance in generating diverse, high quality images from text. Numerous techniques have been proposed on top of or in alignment with models like Stable Diffusion and Imagen that generate images directly from text. A lesser explored approach is DALLE-2's two step process comprising a Diffusion Prior that generates a CLIP image embedding from text and a Diffusion Decoder that generates an image from a CLIP image embedding. We explore the capabilities of the Diffusion Prior and the advantages of an intermediate CLIP representation. We observe that Diffusion Prior can be used in a memory and compute efficient way to constrain the generation to a specific domain without altering the larger Diffusion Decoder. Moreover, we show that the Diffusion Prior can be trained with additional conditional information such as color histogram to further control the generation. We show quantitatively and qualitatively that the proposed approaches perform better than prompt engineering for domain specific generation and existing baselines for color conditioned generation. We believe that our observations and results will instigate further research into the diffusion prior and uncover more of its capabilities."
Fair Diffusion: Instructing Text-to-Image Generation Models on Fairness,"Generative AI models have recently achieved astonishing results in quality and are consequently employed in a fast-growing number of applications. However, since they are highly data-driven, relying on billion-sized datasets randomly scraped from the internet, they also suffer from degenerated and biased human behavior, as we demonstrate. In fact, they may even reinforce such biases. To not only uncover but also combat these undesired effects, we present a novel strategy, called Fair Diffusion, to attenuate biases after the deployment of generative text-to-image models. Specifically, we demonstrate shifting a bias, based on human instructions, in any direction yielding arbitrarily new proportions for, e.g., identity groups. As our empirical evaluation demonstrates, this introduced control enables instructing generative image models on fairness, with no data filtering and additional training required."
Towards Universal Fake Image Detectors that Generalize Across Generative Models,"With generative models proliferating at a rapid rate, there is a growing need for general purpose fake image detectors. In this work, we first show that the existing paradigm, which consists of training a deep network for real-vs-fake classification, fails to detect fake images from newer breeds of generative models when trained to detect GAN fake images. Upon analysis, we find that the resulting classifier is asymmetrically tuned to detect patterns that make an image fake. The real class becomes a sink class holding anything that is not fake, including generated images from models not accessible during training. Building upon this discovery, we propose to perform real-vs-fake classification without learning; i.e., using a feature space not explicitly trained to distinguish real from fake images. We use nearest neighbor and linear probing as instantiations of this idea. When given access to the feature space of a large pretrained vision-language model, the very simple baseline of nearest neighbor classification has surprisingly good generalization ability in detecting fake images from a wide variety of generative models; e.g., it improves upon the SoTA by +15.07 mAP and +25.90% acc when tested on unseen diffusion and autoregressive models."
Prompt Stealing Attacks Against Text-to-Image Generation Models,"Text-to-Image generation models have revolutionized the artwork design process and enabled anyone to create high-quality images by entering text descriptions called prompts. Creating a high-quality prompt that consists of a subject and several modifiers can be time-consuming and costly. In consequence, a trend of trading high-quality prompts on specialized marketplaces has emerged. In this paper, we propose a novel attack, namely prompt stealing attack, which aims to steal prompts from generated images by text-to-image generation models. Successful prompt stealing attacks direct violate the intellectual property and privacy of prompt engineers and also jeopardize the business model of prompt trading marketplaces. We first perform a large-scale analysis on a dataset collected by ourselves and show that a successful prompt stealing attack should consider a prompt's subject as well as its modifiers. We then propose the first learning-based prompt stealing attack, PromptStealer, and demonstrate its superiority over two baseline methods quantitatively and qualitatively. We also make some initial attempts to defend PromptStealer. In general, our study uncovers a new attack surface in the ecosystem created by the popular text-to-image generation models. We hope our results can help to mitigate the threat. To facilitate research in this field, we will share our dataset and code with the community."
Simple U-net Based Synthetic Polyp Image Generation: Polyp to Negative and Negative to Polyp,"Synthetic polyp generation is a good alternative to overcome the privacy problem of medical data and the lack of various polyp samples. In this study, we propose a deep learning-based polyp image generation framework that generates synthetic polyp images that are similar to real ones. We suggest a framework that converts a given polyp image into a negative image (image without a polyp) using a simple conditional GAN architecture and then converts the negative image into a new-looking polyp image using the same network. In addition, by using the controllable polyp masks, polyps with various characteristics can be generated from one input condition. The generated polyp images can be used directly as training images for polyp detection and segmentation without additional labeling. To quantitatively assess the quality of generated synthetic polyps, we use public polyp image and video datasets combined with the generated synthetic images to examine the performance improvement of several detection and segmentation models. Experimental results show that we obtain performance gains when the generated polyp images are added to the training set."
Affect-Conditioned Image Generation,"In creativity support and computational co-creativity contexts, the task of discovering appropriate prompts for use with text-to-image generative models remains difficult. In many cases the creator wishes to evoke a certain impression with the image, but the task of conferring that succinctly in a text prompt poses a challenge: affective language is nuanced, complex, and model-specific. In this work we introduce a method for generating images conditioned on desired affect, quantified using a psychometrically validated three-component approach, that can be combined with conditioning on text descriptions. We first train a neural network for estimating the affect content of text and images from semantic embeddings, and then demonstrate how this can be used to exert control over a variety of generative models. We show examples of how affect modifies the outputs, provide quantitative and qualitative analysis of its capabilities, and discuss possible extensions and use cases."
MedViT: A Robust Vision Transformer for Generalized Medical Image Classification,"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have advanced existing medical systems for automatic disease diagnosis. However, there are still concerns about the reliability of deep medical diagnosis systems against the potential threats of adversarial attacks since inaccurate diagnosis could lead to disastrous consequences in the safety realm. In this study, we propose a highly robust yet efficient CNN-Transformer hybrid model which is equipped with the locality of CNNs as well as the global connectivity of vision Transformers. To mitigate the high quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism while jointly attending to information in various representation subspaces, we construct our attention mechanism by means of an efficient convolution operation. Moreover, to alleviate the fragility of our Transformer model against adversarial attacks, we attempt to learn smoother decision boundaries. To this end, we augment the shape information of an image in the high-level feature space by permuting the feature mean and variance within mini-batches. With less computational complexity, our proposed hybrid model demonstrates its high robustness and generalization ability compared to the state-of-the-art studies on a large-scale collection of standardized MedMNIST-2D datasets."
LayoutDiffuse: Adapting Foundational Diffusion Models for Layout-to-Image Generation,"Layout-to-image generation refers to the task of synthesizing photo-realistic images based on semantic layouts. In this paper, we propose LayoutDiffuse that adapts a foundational diffusion model pretrained on large-scale image or text-image datasets for layout-to-image generation. By adopting a novel neural adaptor based on layout attention and task-aware prompts, our method trains efficiently, generates images with both high perceptual quality and layout alignment, and needs less data. Experiments on three datasets show that our method significantly outperforms other 10 generative models based on GANs, VQ-VAE, and diffusion models."
GPT4MIA: Utilizing Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT-3) as A Plug-and-Play Transductive Model for Medical Image Analysis,"In this paper, we propose a novel approach (called GPT4MIA) that utilizes Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) as a plug-and-play transductive inference tool for medical image analysis (MIA). We provide theoretical analysis on why a large pre-trained language model such as GPT-3 can be used as a plug-and-play transductive inference model for MIA. At the methodological level, we develop several technical treatments to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of GPT4MIA, including better prompt structure design, sample selection, and prompt ordering of representative samples/features. We present two concrete use cases (with workflow) of GPT4MIA: (1) detecting prediction errors and (2) improving prediction accuracy, working in conjecture with well-established vision-based models for image classification (e.g., ResNet). Experiments validate that our proposed method is effective for these two tasks. We further discuss the opportunities and challenges in utilizing Transformer-based large language models for broader MIA applications."
MultiDiffusion: Fusing Diffusion Paths for Controlled Image Generation,"Recent advances in text-to-image generation with diffusion models present transformative capabilities in image quality. However, user controllability of the generated image, and fast adaptation to new tasks still remains an open challenge, currently mostly addressed by costly and long re-training and fine-tuning or ad-hoc adaptations to specific image generation tasks. In this work, we present MultiDiffusion, a unified framework that enables versatile and controllable image generation, using a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model, without any further training or finetuning. At the center of our approach is a new generation process, based on an optimization task that binds together multiple diffusion generation processes with a shared set of parameters or constraints. We show that MultiDiffusion can be readily applied to generate high quality and diverse images that adhere to user-provided controls, such as desired aspect ratio (e.g., panorama), and spatial guiding signals, ranging from tight segmentation masks to bounding boxes.

TcGAN: Semantic-Aware and Structure-Preserved GANs with Individual Vision Transformer for Fast Arbitrary One-Shot Image Generation,"One-shot image generation (OSG) with generative adversarial networks that learn from the internal patches of a given image has attracted world wide attention. In recent studies, scholars have primarily focused on extracting features of images from probabilistically distributed inputs with pure convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, it is quite difficult for CNNs with limited receptive domain to extract and maintain the global structural information. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel structure-preserved method TcGAN with individual vision transformer to overcome the shortcomings of the existing one-shot image generation methods. Specifically, TcGAN preserves global structure of an image during training to be compatible with local details while maintaining the integrity of semantic-aware information by exploiting the powerful long-range dependencies modeling capability of the transformer. We also propose a new scaling formula having scale-invariance during the calculation period, which effectively improves the generated image quality of the OSG model on image super-resolution tasks. We present the design of the TcGAN converter framework, comprehensive experimental as well as ablation studies demonstrating the ability of TcGAN to achieve arbitrary image generation with the fastest running time. Lastly, TcGAN achieves the most excellent performance in terms of applying it to other image processing tasks, e.g., super-resolution as well as image harmonization, the results further prove its superiority."
Depth- and Semantics-aware Multi-modal Domain Translation: Generating 3D Panoramic Color Images from LiDAR Point Clouds,"This work presents a new depth- and semantics-aware conditional generative model, named TITAN-Next, for cross-domain image-to-image translation in a multi-modal setup between LiDAR and camera sensors. The proposed model leverages scene semantics as a mid-level representation and is able to translate raw LiDAR point clouds to RGB-D camera images by solely relying on semantic scene segments. We claim that this is the first framework of its kind and it has practical applications in autonomous vehicles such as providing a fail-safe mechanism and augmenting available data in the target image domain. The proposed model is evaluated on the large-scale and challenging Semantic-KITTI dataset, and experimental findings show that it considerably outperforms the original TITAN-Net and other strong baselines by 23.7\% margin in terms of IoU."
PolyFormer: Referring Image Segmentation as Sequential Polygon Generation,"In this work, instead of directly predicting the pixel-level segmentation masks, the problem of referring image segmentation is formulated as sequential polygon generation, and the predicted polygons can be later converted into segmentation masks. This is enabled by a new sequence-to-sequence framework, Polygon Transformer (PolyFormer), which takes a sequence of image patches and text query tokens as input, and outputs a sequence of polygon vertices autoregressively. For more accurate geometric localization, we propose a regression-based decoder, which predicts the precise floating-point coordinates directly, without any coordinate quantization error. In the experiments, PolyFormer outperforms the prior art by a clear margin, e.g., 5.40% and 4.52% absolute improvements on the challenging RefCOCO+ and RefCOCOg datasets. It also shows strong generalization ability when evaluated on the referring video segmentation task without fine-tuning, e.g., achieving competitive 61.5% J&F on the Ref-DAVIS17 dataset."
Between Generating Noise and Generating Images: Noise in the Correct Frequency Improves the Quality of Synthetic Histopathology Images for Digital Pathology,"Artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques have the promise to revolutionize the field of digital pathology. However, these models demand considerable amounts of data, while the availability of unbiased training data is limited. Synthetic images can augment existing datasets, to improve and validate AI algorithms. Yet, controlling the exact distribution of cellular features within them is still challenging. One of the solutions is harnessing conditional generative adversarial networks that take a semantic mask as an input rather than a random noise. Unlike other domains, outlining the exact cellular structure of tissues is hard, and most of the input masks depict regions of cell types. However, using polygon-based masks introduce inherent artifacts within the synthetic images - due to the mismatch between the polygon size and the single-cell size. In this work, we show that introducing random single-pixel noise with the appropriate spatial frequency into a polygon semantic mask can dramatically improve the quality of the synthetic images. We used our platform to generate synthetic images of immunohistochemistry-treated lung biopsies. We test the quality of the images using a three-fold validation procedure. First, we show that adding the appropriate noise frequency yields 87% of the similarity metrics improvement that is obtained by adding the actual single-cell features. Second, we show that the synthetic images pass the Turing test. Finally, we show that adding these synthetic images to the train set improves AI performance in terms of PD-L1 semantic segmentation performances. Our work suggests a simple and powerful approach for generating synthetic data on demand to unbias limited datasets to improve the algorithms' accuracy and validate their robustness."
NephroNet: A Novel Program for Identifying Renal Cell Carcinoma and Generating Synthetic Training Images with Convolutional Neural Networks and Diffusion Models,"Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a type of cancer that originates in the kidneys and is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults. It can be classified into several subtypes, including clear cell RCC, papillary RCC, and chromophobe RCC. In this study, an artificial intelligence model was developed and trained for classifying different subtypes of RCC using ResNet-18, a convolutional neural network that has been widely used for image classification tasks. The model was trained on a dataset of RCC histopathology images, which consisted of digital images of RCC surgical resection slides that were annotated with the corresponding subtype labels. The performance of the trained model was evaluated using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, and recall. Additionally, in this research, a novel synthetic image generation tool, NephroNet, is developed on diffusion models that are used to generate original images of RCC surgical resection slides. Diffusion models are a class of generative models capable of synthesizing high-quality images from noise. Several diffusers such as Stable Diffusion, Dreambooth Text-to-Image, and Textual Inversion were trained on a dataset of RCC images and were used to generate a series of original images that resembled RCC surgical resection slides, all within the span of fewer than four seconds. The generated images were visually realistic and could be used for creating new training datasets, testing the performance of image analysis algorithms, and training medical professionals. NephroNet is provided as an open-source software package and contains files for data preprocessing, training, and visualization. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of artificial intelligence and diffusion models for classifying and generating RCC images, respectively. These methods could be useful for improving the diagnosis and treatment of RCC and more."
A novel approach to generate datasets with XAI ground truth to evaluate image models,"With the increased usage of artificial intelligence (AI), it is imperative to understand how these models work internally. These needs have led to the development of a new field called eXplainable artificial intelligence (XAI). This field consists of on a set of techniques that allows us to theoretically determine the cause of the AI decisions. One unsolved question about XAI is how to measure the quality of explanations. In this study, we propose a new method to generate datasets with ground truth (GT). These datasets allow us to measure how faithful is a method without ad hoc solutions. We conducted a set of experiments that compared our GT with real model explanations and obtained excellent results confirming that our proposed method is correct."
MaskSketch: Unpaired Structure-guided Masked Image Generation,"Recent conditional image generation methods produce images of remarkable diversity, fidelity and realism. However, the majority of these methods allow conditioning only on labels or text prompts, which limits their level of control over the generation result. In this paper, we introduce MaskSketch, an image generation method that allows spatial conditioning of the generation result using a guiding sketch as an extra conditioning signal during sampling. MaskSketch utilizes a pre-trained masked generative transformer, requiring no model training or paired supervision, and works with input sketches of different levels of abstraction. We show that intermediate self-attention maps of a masked generative transformer encode important structural information of the input image, such as scene layout and object shape, and we propose a novel sampling method based on this observation to enable structure-guided generation. Our results show that MaskSketch achieves high image realism and fidelity to the guiding structure. Evaluated on standard benchmark datasets, MaskSketch outperforms state-of-the-art methods for sketch-to-image translation, as well as unpaired image-to-image translation approaches."
Mixture of Diffusers for scene composition and high resolution image generation,"Diffusion methods have been proven to be very effective to generate images while conditioning on a text prompt. However, and although the quality of the generated images is unprecedented, these methods seem to struggle when trying to generate specific image compositions. In this paper we present Mixture of Diffusers, an algorithm that builds over existing diffusion models to provide a more detailed control over composition. By harmonizing several diffusion processes acting on different regions of a canvas, it allows generating larger images, where the location of each object and style is controlled by a separate diffusion process."
Diffusion Model for Generative Image Denoising,"In supervised learning for image denoising, usually the paired clean images and noisy images are collected or synthesised to train a denoising model. L2 norm loss or other distance functions are used as the objective function for training. It often leads to an over-smooth result with less image details. In this paper, we regard the denoising task as a problem of estimating the posterior distribution of clean images conditioned on noisy images. We apply the idea of diffusion model to realize generative image denoising. According to the noise model in denoising tasks, we redefine the diffusion process such that it is different from the original one. Hence, the sampling of the posterior distribution is a reverse process of dozens of steps from the noisy image. We consider three types of noise model, Gaussian, Gamma and Poisson noise. With the guarantee of theory, we derive a unified strategy for model training. Our method is verified through experiments on three types of noise models and achieves excellent performance."
This Intestine Does Not Exist: Multiscale Residual Variational Autoencoder for Realistic Wireless Capsule Endoscopy Image Generation,"Medical image synthesis has emerged as a promising solution to address the limited availability of annotated medical data needed for training machine learning algorithms in the context of image-based Clinical Decision Support (CDS) systems. To this end, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been mainly applied to support the algorithm training process by generating synthetic images for data augmentation. However, in the field of Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE), the limited content diversity and size of existing publicly available annotated datasets, adversely affect both the training stability and synthesis performance of GANs. Aiming to a viable solution for WCE image synthesis, a novel Variational Autoencoder architecture is proposed, namely ""This Intestine Does not Exist"" (TIDE). The proposed architecture comprises multiscale feature extraction convolutional blocks and residual connections, which enable the generation of high-quality and diverse datasets even with a limited number of training images. Contrary to the current approaches, which are oriented towards the augmentation of the available datasets, this study demonstrates that using TIDE, real WCE datasets can be fully substituted by artificially generated ones, without compromising classification performance. Furthermore, qualitative and user evaluation studies by experienced WCE specialists, validate from a medical viewpoint that both the normal and abnormal WCE images synthesized by TIDE are sufficiently realistic."
"Simple, Effective and General: A New Backbone for Cross-view Image Geo-localization","In this work, we aim at an important but less explored problem of a simple yet effective backbone specific for cross-view geo-localization task. Existing methods for cross-view geo-localization tasks are frequently characterized by 1) complicated methodologies, 2) GPU-consuming computations, and 3) a stringent assumption that aerial and ground images are centrally or orientation aligned. To address the above three challenges for cross-view image matching, we propose a new backbone network, named Simple Attention-based Image Geo-localization network (SAIG). The proposed SAIG effectively represents long-range interactions among patches as well as cross-view correspondence with multi-head self-attention layers. The ""narrow-deep"" architecture of our SAIG improves the feature richness without degradation in performance, while its shallow and effective convolutional stem preserves the locality, eliminating the loss of patchify boundary information. Our SAIG achieves state-of-the-art results on cross-view geo-localization, while being far simpler than previous works. Furthermore, with only 15.9% of the model parameters and half of the output dimension compared to the state-of-the-art, the SAIG adapts well across multiple cross-view datasets without employing any well-designed feature aggregation modules or feature alignment algorithms. In addition, our SAIG attains competitive scores on image retrieval benchmarks, further demonstrating its generalizability. As a backbone network, our SAIG is both easy to follow and computationally lightweight, which is meaningful in practical scenario. Moreover, we propose a simple Spatial-Mixed feature aggregation moDule (SMD) that can mix and project spatial information into a low-dimensional space to generate feature descriptors...

SceneDreamer: Unbounded 3D Scene Generation from 2D Image Collections,"In this work, we present SceneDreamer, an unconditional generative model for unbounded 3D scenes, which synthesizes large-scale 3D landscapes from random noise. Our framework is learned from in-the-wild 2D image collections only, without any 3D annotations. At the core of SceneDreamer is a principled learning paradigm comprising 1) an efficient yet expressive 3D scene representation, 2) a generative scene parameterization, and 3) an effective renderer that can leverage the knowledge from 2D images. Our approach begins with an efficient bird's-eye-view (BEV) representation generated from simplex noise, which includes a height field for surface elevation and a semantic field for detailed scene semantics. This BEV scene representation enables 1) representing a 3D scene with quadratic complexity, 2) disentangled geometry and semantics, and 3) efficient training. Moreover, we propose a novel generative neural hash grid to parameterize the latent space based on 3D positions and scene semantics, aiming to encode generalizable features across various scenes. Lastly, a neural volumetric renderer, learned from 2D image collections through adversarial training, is employed to produce photorealistic images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SceneDreamer and superiority over state-of-the-art methods in generating vivid yet diverse unbounded 3D worlds."
Learning Generalized Zero-Shot Learners for Open-Domain Image Geolocalization,"Image geolocalization is the challenging task of predicting the geographic coordinates of origin for a given photo. It is an unsolved problem relying on the ability to combine visual clues with general knowledge about the world to make accurate predictions across geographies. We present \href{https://huggingface.co/geolocal/StreetCLIP}{\text{StreetCLIP}}, a robust, publicly available foundation model not only achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple open-domain image geolocalization benchmarks but also doing so in a zero-shot setting, outperforming supervised models trained on more than 4 million images. Our method introduces a meta-learning approach for generalized zero-shot learning by pretraining CLIP from synthetic captions, grounding CLIP in a domain of choice. We show that our method effectively transfers CLIP's generalized zero-shot capabilities to the domain of image geolocalization, improving in-domain generalized zero-shot performance without finetuning StreetCLIP on a fixed set of classes."
Stable Attribute Group Editing for Reliable Few-shot Image Generation,"Few-shot image generation aims to generate data of an unseen category based on only a few samples. Apart from basic content generation, a bunch of downstream applications hopefully benefit from this task, such as low-data detection and few-shot classification. To achieve this goal, the generated images should guarantee category retention for classification beyond the visual quality and diversity. In our preliminary work, we present an ``editing-based'' framework Attribute Group Editing (AGE) for reliable few-shot image generation, which largely improves the generation performance. Nevertheless, AGE's performance on downstream classification is not as satisfactory as expected. This paper investigates the class inconsistency problem and proposes Stable Attribute Group Editing (SAGE) for more stable class-relevant image generation. SAGE takes use of all given few-shot images and estimates a class center embedding based on the category-relevant attribute dictionary. Meanwhile, according to the projection weights on the category-relevant attribute dictionary, we can select category-irrelevant attributes from the similar seen categories. Consequently, SAGE injects the whole distribution of the novel class into StyleGAN's latent space, thus largely remains the category retention and stability of the generated images. Going one step further, we find that class inconsistency is a common problem in GAN-generated images for downstream classification. Even though the generated images look photo-realistic and requires no category-relevant editing, they are usually of limited help for downstream classification. We systematically discuss this issue from both the generative model and classification model perspectives, and propose to boost the downstream classification performance of SAGE by enhancing the pixel and frequency components."
NoiseTransfer: Image Noise Generation with Contrastive Embeddings,"Deep image denoising networks have achieved impressive success with the help of a considerably large number of synthetic train datasets. However, real-world denoising is a still challenging problem due to the dissimilarity between distributions of real and synthetic noisy datasets. Although several real-world noisy datasets have been presented, the number of train datasets (i.e., pairs of clean and real noisy images) is limited, and acquiring more real noise datasets is laborious and expensive. To mitigate this problem, numerous attempts to simulate real noise models using generative models have been studied. Nevertheless, previous works had to train multiple networks to handle multiple different noise distributions. By contrast, we propose a new generative model that can synthesize noisy images with multiple different noise distributions. Specifically, we adopt recent contrastive learning to learn distinguishable latent features of the noise. Moreover, our model can generate new noisy images by transferring the noise characteristics solely from a single reference noisy image. We demonstrate the accuracy and the effectiveness of our noise model for both known and unknown noise removal."
Learning Generalized Hybrid Proximity Representation for Image Recognition,"Recently, deep metric learning techniques received attention, as the learned distance representations are useful to capture the similarity relationship among samples and further improve the performance of various of supervised or unsupervised learning tasks. We propose a novel supervised metric learning method that can learn the distance metrics in both geometric and probabilistic space for image recognition. In contrast to the previous metric learning methods which usually focus on learning the distance metrics in Euclidean space, our proposed method is able to learn better distance representation in a hybrid approach. To achieve this, we proposed a Generalized Hybrid Metric Loss (GHM-Loss) to learn the general hybrid proximity features from the image data by controlling the trade-off between geometric proximity and probabilistic proximity. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we first provide theoretical derivations and proofs of the proposed loss function, then we perform extensive experiments on two public datasets to show the advantage of our method compared to other state-of-the-art metric learning methods."
GALIP: Generative Adversarial CLIPs for Text-to-Image Synthesis,"Synthesizing high-fidelity complex images from text is challenging. Based on large pretraining, the autoregressive and diffusion models can synthesize photo-realistic images. Although these large models have shown notable progress, there remain three flaws. 1) These models require tremendous training data and parameters to achieve good performance. 2) The multi-step generation design slows the image synthesis process heavily. 3) The synthesized visual features are difficult to control and require delicately designed prompts. To enable high-quality, efficient, fast, and controllable text-to-image synthesis, we propose Generative Adversarial CLIPs, namely GALIP. GALIP leverages the powerful pretrained CLIP model both in the discriminator and generator. Specifically, we propose a CLIP-based discriminator. The complex scene understanding ability of CLIP enables the discriminator to accurately assess the image quality. Furthermore, we propose a CLIP-empowered generator that induces the visual concepts from CLIP through bridge features and prompts. The CLIP-integrated generator and discriminator boost training efficiency, and as a result, our model only requires about 3% training data and 6% learnable parameters, achieving comparable results to large pretrained autoregressive and diffusion models. Moreover, our model achieves 120 times faster synthesis speed and inherits the smooth latent space from GAN. The extensive experimental results demonstrate the excellent performance of our GALIP. Code is available at https://github.com/tobran/GALIP."
Exploiting the Generative Adversarial Network Approach to Create a Synthetic Topography Corneal Image,"Corneal diseases are the most common eye disorders. Deep learning techniques are used to per-form automated diagnoses of cornea. Deep learning networks require large-scale annotated datasets, which is conceded as a weakness of deep learning. In this work, a method for synthesizing medical images using conditional generative adversarial networks (CGANs), is presented. It also illustrates how produced medical images may be utilized to enrich medical data, improve clinical decisions, and boost the performance of the conventional neural network (CNN) for medical image diagnosis. The study includes using corneal topography captured using a Pentacam device from patients with corneal diseases. The dataset contained 3448 different corneal images. Furthermore, it shows how an unbalanced dataset affects the performance of classifiers, where the data are balanced using the resampling approach. Finally, the results obtained from CNN networks trained on the balanced dataset are compared to those obtained from CNN networks trained on the imbalanced dataset. For performance, the system estimated the diagnosis accuracy, precision, and F1-score metrics. Lastly, some generated images were shown to an expert for evaluation and to see how well experts could identify the type of image and its condition. The expert recognized the image as useful for medical diagnosis and for determining the severity class according to the shape and values, by generating images based on real cases that could be used as new different stages of illness between healthy and unhealthy patients."
Dual Diffusion Architecture for Fisheye Image Rectification: Synthetic-to-Real Generalization,"Fisheye image rectification has a long-term unresolved issue with synthetic-to-real generalization. In most previous works, the model trained on the synthetic images obtains unsatisfactory performance on the real-world fisheye image. To this end, we propose a Dual Diffusion Architecture (DDA) for the fisheye rectification with a better generalization ability. The proposed DDA is simultaneously trained with paired synthetic fisheye images and unlabeled real fisheye images. By gradually introducing noises, the synthetic and real fisheye images can eventually develop into a consistent noise distribution, improving the generalization and achieving unlabeled real fisheye correction. The original image serves as the prior guidance in existing DDPMs (Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models). However, the non-negligible indeterminate relationship between the prior condition and the target affects the generation performance. Especially in the rectification task, the radial distortion can cause significant artifacts. Therefore, we provide an unsupervised one-pass network that produces a plausible new condition to strengthen guidance. This network can be regarded as an alternate scheme for fast producing reliable results without iterative inference. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our approach can reach superior performance in both synthetic and real fisheye image corrections."
CellMix: A General Instance Relationship based Method for Data Augmentation Towards Pathology Image Analysis,"Pathology image analysis crucially relies on the availability and quality of annotated pathological samples, which are very difficult to collect and need lots of human effort. To address this issue, beyond traditional preprocess data augmentation methods, mixing-based approaches are effective and practical. However, previous mixing-based data augmentation methods do not thoroughly explore the essential characteristics of pathology images, including the local specificity, global distribution, and inner/outer-sample instance relationship. To further understand the pathology characteristics and make up effective pseudo samples, we propose the CellMix framework with a novel distribution-based in-place shuffle strategy. We split the images into patches with respect to the granularity of pathology instances and do the shuffle process across the same batch. In this way, we generate new samples while keeping the absolute relationship of pathology instances intact. Furthermore, to deal with the perturbations and distribution-based noise, we devise a loss-drive strategy inspired by curriculum learning during the training process, making the model fit the augmented data adaptively. It is worth mentioning that we are the first to explore data augmentation techniques in the pathology image field. Experiments show SOTA results on 7 different datasets. We conclude that this novel instance relationship-based strategy can shed light on general data augmentation for pathology image analysis. The code is available at https://github.com/sagizty/CellMix."
Multimodal Event Transformer for Image-guided Story Ending Generation,"Image-guided story ending generation (IgSEG) is to generate a story ending based on given story plots and ending image. Existing methods focus on cross-modal feature fusion but overlook reasoning and mining implicit information from story plots and ending image. To tackle this drawback, we propose a multimodal event transformer, an event-based reasoning framework for IgSEG. Specifically, we construct visual and semantic event graphs from story plots and ending image, and leverage event-based reasoning to reason and mine implicit information in a single modality. Next, we connect visual and semantic event graphs and utilize cross-modal fusion to integrate different-modality features. In addition, we propose a multimodal injector to adaptive pass essential information to decoder. Besides, we present an incoherence detection to enhance the understanding context of a story plot and the robustness of graph modeling for our model. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance for the image-guided story ending generation."
Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models for Generation of Realistic Fully-Annotated Microscopy Image Data Sets,"Denoising diffusion probabilistic models have shown great potential in generating realistic image data. We show how those models can be used to generate realistic microscopy image data in 2D and 3D based on simulated sketches of cellular structures. Multiple data sets are used as an inspiration to simulate sketches of different cellular structures, allowing to generate fully-annotated image data sets without requiring human interactions. Those data sets are used to train segmentation approaches and demonstrate that annotation-free segmentation of cellular structures in fluorescence microscopy image data can be achieved, thereby leaping towards the ultimate goal of eliminating the necessity of human annotation efforts."
The stochastic digital human is now enrolling for in silico imaging trials -- Methods and tools for generating digital cohorts,"Randomized clinical trials, while often viewed as the highest evidentiary bar by which to judge the quality of a medical intervention, are far from perfect. In silico imaging trials are computational studies that seek to ascertain the performance of a medical device by collecting this information entirely via computer simulations. The benefits of in silico trials for evaluating new technology include significant resource and time savings, minimization of subject risk, the ability to study devices that are not achievable in the physical world, allow for the rapid and effective investigation of new technologies and ensure representation from all relevant subgroups. To conduct in silico trials, digital representations of humans are needed. We review the latest developments in methods and tools for obtaining digital humans for in silico imaging studies. First, we introduce terminology and a classification of digital human models. Second, we survey available methodologies for generating digital humans with healthy and diseased status and examine briefly the role of augmentation methods. Finally, we discuss the trade-offs of four approaches for sampling digital cohorts and the associated potential for study bias with selecting specific patient distributions."
Visual Writing Prompts: Character-Grounded Story Generation with Curated Image Sequences,"Current work on image-based story generation suffers from the fact that the existing image sequence collections do not have coherent plots behind them. We improve visual story generation by producing a new image-grounded dataset, Visual Writing Prompts (VWP). VWP contains almost 2K selected sequences of movie shots, each including 5-10 images. The image sequences are aligned with a total of 12K stories which were collected via crowdsourcing given the image sequences and a set of grounded characters from the corresponding image sequence. Our new image sequence collection and filtering process has allowed us to obtain stories that are more coherent and have more narrativity compared to previous work. We also propose a character-based story generation model driven by coherence as a strong baseline. Evaluations show that our generated stories are more coherent, visually grounded, and have more narrativity than stories generated with the current state-of-the-art model."
Leveraging generative adversarial networks to create realistic scanning transmission electron microscopy images,"The rise of automation and machine learning (ML) in electron microscopy has the potential to revolutionize materials research through autonomous data collection and processing. A significant challenge lies in developing ML models that rapidly generalize to large data sets under varying experimental conditions. We address this by employing a cycle generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) with a reciprocal space discriminator, which augments simulated data with realistic spatial frequency information. This allows the CycleGAN to generate images nearly indistinguishable from real data and provide labels for ML applications. We showcase our approach by training a fully convolutional network (FCN) to identify single atom defects in a 4.5 million atom data set, collected using automated acquisition in an aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM). Our method produces adaptable FCNs that can adjust to dynamically changing experimental variables with minimal intervention, marking a crucial step towards fully autonomous harnessing of microscopy big data."
Image Embedding for Denoising Generative Models,"Denoising Diffusion models are gaining increasing popularity in the field of generative modeling for several reasons, including the simple and stable training, the excellent generative quality, and the solid probabilistic foundation. In this article, we address the problem of {\em embedding} an image into the latent space of Denoising Diffusion Models, that is finding a suitable ``noisy'' image whose denoising results in the original image. We particularly focus on Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models due to the deterministic nature of their reverse diffusion process. As a side result of our investigation, we gain a deeper insight into the structure of the latent space of diffusion models, opening interesting perspectives on its exploration, the definition of semantic trajectories, and the manipulation/conditioning of encodings for editing purposes. A particularly interesting property highlighted by our research, which is also characteristic of this class of generative models, is the independence of the latent representation from the networks implementing the reverse diffusion process. In other words, a common seed passed to different networks (each trained on the same dataset), eventually results in identical images."
GLIGEN: Open-Set Grounded Text-to-Image Generation,"Large-scale text-to-image diffusion models have made amazing advances. However, the status quo is to use text input alone, which can impede controllability. In this work, we propose GLIGEN, Grounded-Language-to-Image Generation, a novel approach that builds upon and extends the functionality of existing pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models by enabling them to also be conditioned on grounding inputs. To preserve the vast concept knowledge of the pre-trained model, we freeze all of its weights and inject the grounding information into new trainable layers via a gated mechanism. Our model achieves open-world grounded text2img generation with caption and bounding box condition inputs, and the grounding ability generalizes well to novel spatial configurations and concepts. GLIGEN's zero-shot performance on COCO and LVIS outperforms that of existing supervised layout-to-image baselines by a large margin."
Linguistic Query-Guided Mask Generation for Referring Image Segmentation,"Referring image segmentation aims to segment the image region of interest according to the given language expression, which is a typical multi-modal task. Existing methods either adopt the pixel classification-based or the learnable query-based framework for mask generation, both of which are insufficient to deal with various text-image pairs with a fix number of parametric prototypes. In this work, we propose an end-to-end framework built on transformer to perform Linguistic query-Guided mask generation, dubbed LGFormer. It views the linguistic features as query to generate a specialized prototype for arbitrary input image-text pair, thus generating more consistent segmentation results. Moreover, we design several cross-modal interaction modules (\eg, vision-language bidirectional attention module, VLBA) in both encoder and decoder to achieve better cross-modal alignment."
Inpainting borehole images using Generative Adversarial Networks,"In this paper, we propose a GAN-based approach for gap filling in borehole images created by wireline microresistivity imaging tools. The proposed method utilizes a generator, global discriminator, and local discriminator to inpaint the missing regions of the image. The generator is based on an auto-encoder architecture with skip-connections, and the loss function used is the Wasserstein GAN loss. Our experiments on a dataset of borehole images demonstrate that the proposed model can effectively deal with large-scale missing pixels and generate realistic completion results. This approach can improve the quantitative evaluation of reservoirs and provide an essential basis for interpreting geological phenomena and reservoir parameters."
Explicit Temporal Embedding in Deep Generative Latent Models for Longitudinal Medical Image Synthesis,"Medical imaging plays a vital role in modern diagnostics and treatment. The temporal nature of disease or treatment progression often results in longitudinal data. Due to the cost and potential harm, acquiring large medical datasets necessary for deep learning can be difficult. Medical image synthesis could help mitigate this problem. However, until now, the availability of GANs capable of synthesizing longitudinal volumetric data has been limited. To address this, we use the recent advances in latent space-based image editing to propose a novel joint learning scheme to explicitly embed temporal dependencies in the latent space of GANs. This, in contrast to previous methods, allows us to synthesize continuous, smooth, and high-quality longitudinal volumetric data with limited supervision. We show the effectiveness of our approach on three datasets containing different longitudinal dependencies. Namely, modeling a simple image transformation, breathing motion, and tumor regression, all while showing minimal disentanglement. The implementation is made available online at https://github.com/julschoen/Temp-GAN."
Domain Expansion of Image Generators,"Can one inject new concepts into an already trained generative model, while respecting its existing structure and knowledge? We propose a new task - domain expansion - to address this. Given a pretrained generator and novel (but related) domains, we expand the generator to jointly model all domains, old and new, harmoniously. First, we note the generator contains a meaningful, pretrained latent space. Is it possible to minimally perturb this hard-earned representation, while maximally representing the new domains? Interestingly, we find that the latent space offers unused, ""dormant"" directions, which do not affect the output. This provides an opportunity: By ""repurposing"" these directions, we can represent new domains without perturbing the original representation. In fact, we find that pretrained generators have the capacity to add several - even hundreds - of new domains! Using our expansion method, one ""expanded"" model can supersede numerous domain-specific models, without expanding the model size. Additionally, a single expanded generator natively supports smooth transitions between domains, as well as composition of domains. Code and project page available at https://yotamnitzan.github.io/domain-expansion/."
Guiding Text-to-Image Diffusion Model Towards Grounded Generation,"The goal of this paper is to augment a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model with the ability of open-vocabulary objects grounding, i.e., simultaneously generating images and segmentation masks for the corresponding visual entities described in the text prompt. We make the following contributions: (i) we insert a grounding module into the existing diffusion model, that can be trained to align the visual and textual embedding space of the diffusion model with only a small number of object categories; (ii) we propose an automatic pipeline for constructing a dataset, that consists of {image, segmentation mask, text prompt} triplets, to train the proposed grounding module; (iii) we evaluate the performance of open-vocabulary grounding on images generated from the text-to-image diffusion model and show that the module can well segment the objects of categories beyond seen ones at training time; (iv) we adopt the guided diffusion model to build a synthetic semantic segmentation dataset, and show that training a standard segmentation model on such dataset demonstrates competitive performance on zero-shot segmentation(ZS3) benchmark, which opens up new opportunities for adopting the powerful diffusion model for discriminative tasks."
Street-View Image Generation from a Bird's-Eye View Layout,"Bird's-Eye View (BEV) Perception has received increasing attention in recent years as it provides a concise and unified spatial representation across views and benefits a diverse set of downstream driving applications. While the focus has been placed on discriminative tasks such as BEV segmentation, the dual generative task of creating street-view images from a BEV layout has rarely been explored. The ability to generate realistic street-view images that align with a given HD map and traffic layout is critical for visualizing complex traffic scenarios and developing robust perception models for autonomous driving. In this paper, we propose BEVGen, a conditional generative model that synthesizes a set of realistic and spatially consistent surrounding images that match the BEV layout of a traffic scenario. BEVGen incorporates a novel cross-view transformation and spatial attention design which learn the relationship between cameras and map views to ensure their consistency. Our model can accurately render road and lane lines, as well as generate traffic scenes under different weather conditions and times of day. The code will be made publicly available."
Large Scale Qualitative Evaluation of Generative Image Model Outputs,"Evaluating generative image models remains a difficult problem. This is due to the high dimensionality of the outputs, the challenging task of representing but not replicating training data, and the lack of metrics that fully correspond to human perception and capture all the properties we want these models to exhibit. Therefore, qualitative evaluation of model outputs is an important part of model development and research publication practice. Quantitative evaluation is currently under-served by existing tools, which do not easily facilitate structured exploration of a large number of examples across the latent space of the model. To address this issue, we present Ravel, a visual analytics system that enables qualitative evaluation of model outputs on the order of hundreds of thousands of images. Ravel allows users to discover phenomena such as mode collapse, and find areas of training data that the model has failed to capture. It allows users to evaluate both quality and diversity of generated images in comparison to real images or to the output of another model that serves as a baseline. Our paper describes three case studies demonstrating the key insights made possible with Ravel, supported by a domain expert user study."
Generating corneal panoramic images from contact specular microscope images,"The contact specular microscope has a wider angle of view than that of the non-contact specular microscope but still cannot capture an image of the entire cornea. To obtain such an image, it is necessary to prepare film on the parts of the image captured sequentially and combine them to create a complete image. This study proposes a framework to automatically generate an entire corneal image from videos captured using a contact specular microscope. Relatively focused images were extracted from the videos and panoramic compositing was performed. If an entire image can be generated, it is possible to detect guttae from the image and examine the extent of their presence. The system was implemented and the effectiveness of the proposed framework was examined. The system was implemented using custom-made composite software, Image Composite Software (ICS, K.I. Technology Co., Ltd., Japan, internal algorithms not disclosed), and a supervised learning model using U-Net was used for guttae detection. Several images were correctly synthesized when the constructed system was applied to 94 different corneal videos obtained from Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) mouse model. The implementation and application of the method to the data in this study confirmed its effectiveness. Owing to the minimal quantitative evaluation performed, such as accuracy with implementation, it may pose some limitations for future investigations."
Accuracy and Fidelity Comparison of Luna and DALL-E 2 Diffusion-Based Image Generation Systems,"We qualitatively examine the accuracy and fidelity between two diffusion-based image generation systems, namely DALL-E 2 and Luna, which have massive differences in training datasets, algorithmic approaches, prompt resolvement, and output upscaling. The methodology used is a qualitative benchmark created by Saharia et al. and in our research we conclude that DALL-E 2 significantly edges Luna in both alignment and fidelity comparisons."
Attribute-Centric Compositional Text-to-Image Generation,"Despite the recent impressive breakthroughs in text-to-image generation, generative models have difficulty in capturing the data distribution of underrepresented attribute compositions while over-memorizing overrepresented attribute compositions, which raises public concerns about their robustness and fairness. To tackle this challenge, we propose ACTIG, an attribute-centric compositional text-to-image generation framework. We present an attribute-centric feature augmentation and a novel image-free training scheme, which greatly improves model's ability to generate images with underrepresented attributes. We further propose an attribute-centric contrastive loss to avoid overfitting to overrepresented attribute compositions. We validate our framework on the CelebA-HQ and CUB datasets. Extensive experiments show that the compositional generalization of ACTIG is outstanding, and our framework outperforms previous works in terms of image quality and text-image consistency."
Muse: Text-To-Image Generation via Masked Generative Transformers,"We present Muse, a text-to-image Transformer model that achieves state-of-the-art image generation performance while being significantly more efficient than diffusion or autoregressive models. Muse is trained on a masked modeling task in discrete token space: given the text embedding extracted from a pre-trained large language model (LLM), Muse is trained to predict randomly masked image tokens. Compared to pixel-space diffusion models, such as Imagen and DALL-E 2, Muse is significantly more efficient due to the use of discrete tokens and requiring fewer sampling iterations; compared to autoregressive models, such as Parti, Muse is more efficient due to the use of parallel decoding. The use of a pre-trained LLM enables fine-grained language understanding, translating to high-fidelity image generation and the understanding of visual concepts such as objects, their spatial relationships, pose, cardinality etc. Our 900M parameter model achieves a new SOTA on CC3M, with an FID score of 6.06. The Muse 3B parameter model achieves an FID of 7.88 on zero-shot COCO evaluation, along with a CLIP score of 0.32. Muse also directly enables a number of image editing applications without the need to fine-tune or invert the model: inpainting, outpainting, and mask-free editing. More results are available at https://muse-model.github.io"
An Experience-based Direct Generation approach to Automatic Image Cropping,"Automatic Image Cropping is a challenging task with many practical downstream applications. The task is often divided into sub-problems - generating cropping candidates, finding the visually important regions, and determining aesthetics to select the most appealing candidate. Prior approaches model one or more of these sub-problems separately, and often combine them sequentially. We propose a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) based method to crop images directly, without explicitly modeling image aesthetics, evaluating multiple crop candidates, or detecting visually salient regions. Our model is trained on a large dataset of images cropped by experienced editors and can simultaneously predict bounding boxes for multiple fixed aspect ratios. We consider the aspect ratio of the cropped image to be a critical factor that influences aesthetics. Prior approaches for automatic image cropping, did not enforce the aspect ratio of the outputs, likely due to a lack of datasets for this task. We, therefore, benchmark our method on public datasets for two related tasks - first, aesthetic image cropping without regard to aspect ratio, and second, thumbnail generation that requires fixed aspect ratio outputs, but where aesthetics are not crucial. We show that our strategy is competitive with or performs better than existing methods in both these tasks. Furthermore, our one-stage model is easier to train and significantly faster than existing two-stage or end-to-end methods for inference. We present a qualitative evaluation study, and find that our model is able to generalize to diverse images from unseen datasets and often retains compositional properties of the original images after cropping. Our results demonstrate that explicitly modeling image aesthetics or visual attention regions is not necessarily required to build a competitive image cropping algorithm."
Zero-Shot Object Segmentation through Concept Distillation from Generative Image Foundation Models,"Curating datasets for object segmentation is a difficult task. With the advent of large-scale pre-trained generative models, conditional image generation has been given a significant boost in result quality and ease of use. In this paper, we present a novel method that enables the generation of general foreground-background segmentation models from simple textual descriptions, without requiring segmentation labels. We leverage and explore pre-trained latent diffusion models, to automatically generate weak segmentation masks for concepts and objects. The masks are then used to fine-tune the diffusion model on an inpainting task, which enables fine-grained removal of the object, while at the same time providing a synthetic foreground and background dataset. We demonstrate that using this method beats previous methods in both discriminative and generative performance and closes the gap with fully supervised training while requiring no pixel-wise object labels. We show results on the task of segmenting four different objects (humans, dogs, cars, birds)."
OrthoGAN:High-Precision Image Generation for Teeth Orthodontic Visualization,"Patients take care of what their teeth will be like after the orthodontics. Orthodontists usually describe the expectation movement based on the original smile images, which is unconvincing. The growth of deep-learning generative models change this situation. It can visualize the outcome of orthodontic treatment and help patients foresee their future teeth and facial appearance. While previous studies mainly focus on 2D or 3D virtual treatment outcome (VTO) at a profile level, the problem of simulating treatment outcome at a frontal facial image is poorly explored. In this paper, we build an efficient and accurate system for simulating virtual teeth alignment effects in a frontal facial image. Our system takes a frontal face image of a patient with visible malpositioned teeth and the patient's 3D scanned teeth model as input, and progressively generates the visual results of the patient's teeth given the specific orthodontics planning steps from the doctor (i.e., the specification of translations and rotations of individual tooth). We design a multi-modal encoder-decoder based generative model to synthesize identity-preserving frontal facial images with aligned teeth. In addition, the original image color information is used to optimize the orthodontic outcomes, making the results more natural. We conduct extensive qualitative and clinical experiments and also a pilot study to validate our method."
Multi-Realism Image Compression with a Conditional Generator,"By optimizing the rate-distortion-realism trade-off, generative compression approaches produce detailed, realistic images, even at low bit rates, instead of the blurry reconstructions produced by rate-distortion optimized models. However, previous methods do not explicitly control how much detail is synthesized, which results in a common criticism of these methods: users might be worried that a misleading reconstruction far from the input image is generated. In this work, we alleviate these concerns by training a decoder that can bridge the two regimes and navigate the distortion-realism trade-off. From a single compressed representation, the receiver can decide to either reconstruct a low mean squared error reconstruction that is close to the input, a realistic reconstruction with high perceptual quality, or anything in between. With our method, we set a new state-of-the-art in distortion-realism, pushing the frontier of achievable distortion-realism pairs, i.e., our method achieves better distortions at high realism and better realism at low distortion than ever before."
General GAN-generated image detection by data augmentation in fingerprint domain,"In this work, we investigate improving the generalizability of GAN-generated image detectors by performing data augmentation in the fingerprint domain. Specifically, we first separate the fingerprints and contents of the GAN-generated images using an autoencoder based GAN fingerprint extractor, followed by random perturbations of the fingerprints. Then the original fingerprints are substituted with the perturbed fingerprints and added to the original contents, to produce images that are visually invariant but with distinct fingerprints. The perturbed images can successfully imitate images generated by different GANs to improve the generalization of the detectors, which is demonstrated by the spectra visualization. To our knowledge, we are the first to conduct data augmentation in the fingerprint domain. Our work explores a novel prospect that is distinct from previous works on spatial and frequency domain augmentation. Extensive cross-GAN experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to the state-of-the-art methods in detecting fake images generated by unknown GANs."
Hybrid Quantum-Classical Generative Adversarial Network for High Resolution Image Generation,"Quantum machine learning (QML) has received increasing attention due to its potential to outperform classical machine learning methods in problems pertaining classification and identification tasks. A subclass of QML methods is quantum generative adversarial networks (QGANs) which have been studied as a quantum counterpart of classical GANs widely used in image manipulation and generation tasks. The existing work on QGANs is still limited to small-scale proof-of-concept examples based on images with significant downscaling. Here we integrate classical and quantum techniques to propose a new hybrid quantum-classical GAN framework. We demonstrate its superior learning capabilities by generating 28 \times 28 pixels grey-scale images without dimensionality reduction or classical pre/post-processing on multiple classes of the standard MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets, which achieves comparable results to classical frameworks with three orders of magnitude less trainable generator parameters. To gain further insight into the working of our hybrid approach, we systematically explore the impact of its parameter space by varying the number of qubits, the size of image patches, the number of layers in the generator, the shape of the patches and the choice of prior distribution. Our results show that increasing the quantum generator size generally improves the learning capability of the network. The developed framework provides a foundation for future design of QGANs with optimal parameter set tailored for complex image generation tasks."
Tune-A-Video: One-Shot Tuning of Image Diffusion Models for Text-to-Video Generation,"To replicate the success of text-to-image (T2I) generation, recent works employ large-scale video datasets to train a text-to-video (T2V) generator. Despite their promising results, such paradigm is computationally expensive. In this work, we propose a new T2V generation setting\unicode{x2014}One-Shot Video Tuning, where only one text-video pair is presented. Our model is built on state-of-the-art T2I diffusion models pre-trained on massive image data. We make two key observations: 1) T2I models can generate still images that represent verb terms; 2) extending T2I models to generate multiple images concurrently exhibits surprisingly good content consistency. To further learn continuous motion, we introduce Tune-A-Video, which involves a tailored spatio-temporal attention mechanism and an efficient one-shot tuning strategy. At inference, we employ DDIM inversion to provide structure guidance for sampling. Extensive qualitative and numerical experiments demonstrate the remarkable ability of our method across various applications."
SPIRiT-Diffusion: SPIRiT-driven Score-Based Generative Modeling for Vessel Wall imaging,"Diffusion model is the most advanced method in image generation and has been successfully applied to MRI reconstruction. However, the existing methods do not consider the characteristics of multi-coil acquisition of MRI data. Therefore, we give a new diffusion model, called SPIRiT-Diffusion, based on the SPIRiT iterative reconstruction algorithm. Specifically, SPIRiT-Diffusion characterizes the prior distribution of coil-by-coil images by score matching and characterizes the k-space redundant prior between coils based on self-consistency. With sufficient prior constraint utilized, we achieve superior reconstruction results on the joint Intracranial and Carotid Vessel Wall imaging dataset."
"Generalized Decoding for Pixel, Image, and Language","We present X-Decoder, a generalized decoding model that can predict pixel-level segmentation and language tokens seamlessly. X-Decodert takes as input two types of queries: (i) generic non-semantic queries and (ii) semantic queries induced from text inputs, to decode different pixel-level and token-level outputs in the same semantic space. With such a novel design, X-Decoder is the first work that provides a unified way to support all types of image segmentation and a variety of vision-language (VL) tasks. Further, our design enables seamless interactions across tasks at different granularities and brings mutual benefits by learning a common and rich pixel-level visual-semantic understanding space, without any pseudo-labeling. After pretraining on a mixed set of a limited amount of segmentation data and millions of image-text pairs, X-Decoder exhibits strong transferability to a wide range of downstream tasks in both zero-shot and finetuning settings. Notably, it achieves (1) state-of-the-art results on open-vocabulary segmentation and referring segmentation on eight datasets; (2) better or competitive finetuned performance to other generalist and specialist models on segmentation and VL tasks; and (3) flexibility for efficient finetuning and novel task composition (e.g., referring captioning and image editing). Code, demo, video, and visualization are available at https://x-decoder-vl.github.io."
Not Just Pretty Pictures: Text-to-Image Generators Enable Interpretable Interventions for Robust Representations,"Neural image classifiers are known to undergo severe performance degradation when exposed to input that exhibits covariate shift with respect to the training distribution. In this paper, we show that recent Text-to-Image (T2I) generators' ability to edit images to approximate interventions via natural-language prompts is a promising technology to train more robust classifiers. Using current open-source models, we find that a variety of prompting strategies are effective for producing augmented training datasets sufficient to achieve state-of-the-art performance (1) in widely adopted Single-Domain Generalization benchmarks, (2) in reducing classifiers' dependency on spurious features and (3) facilitating the application of Multi-Domain Generalization techniques when fewer training domains are available."
Local Differential Privacy Image Generation Using Flow-based Deep Generative Models,"Diagnostic radiologists need artificial intelligence (AI) for medical imaging, but access to medical images required for training in AI has become increasingly restrictive. To release and use medical images, we need an algorithm that can simultaneously protect privacy and preserve pathologies in medical images. To develop such an algorithm, here, we propose DP-GLOW, a hybrid of a local differential privacy (LDP) algorithm and one of the flow-based deep generative models (GLOW). By applying a GLOW model, we disentangle the pixelwise correlation of images, which makes it difficult to protect privacy with straightforward LDP algorithms for images. Specifically, we map images onto the latent vector of the GLOW model, each element of which follows an independent normal distribution, and we apply the Laplace mechanism to the latent vector. Moreover, we applied DP-GLOW to chest X-ray images to generate LDP images while preserving pathologies."
Benchmarking Spatial Relationships in Text-to-Image Generation,"Spatial understanding is a fundamental aspect of computer vision and integral for human-level reasoning about images, making it an important component for grounded language understanding. While recent large-scale text-to-image synthesis (T2I) models have shown unprecedented improvements in photorealism, it is unclear whether they have reliable spatial understanding capabilities. We investigate the ability of T2I models to generate correct spatial relationships among objects and present VISOR, an evaluation metric that captures how accurately the spatial relationship described in text is generated in the image. To benchmark existing models, we introduce a large-scale challenge dataset SR2D that contains sentences describing two objects and the spatial relationship between them. We construct and harness an automated evaluation pipeline that employs computer vision to recognize objects and their spatial relationships, and we employ it in a large-scale evaluation of T2I models. Our experiments reveal a surprising finding that, although recent state-of-the-art T2I models exhibit high image quality, they are severely limited in their ability to generate multiple objects or the specified spatial relations such as left/right/above/below. Our analyses demonstrate several biases and artifacts of T2I models such as the difficulty with generating multiple objects, a bias towards generating the first object mentioned, spatially inconsistent outputs for equivalent relationships, and a correlation between object co-occurrence and spatial understanding capabilities. We conduct a human study that shows the alignment between VISOR and human judgment about spatial understanding. We offer the SR2D dataset and the VISOR metric to the community in support of T2I spatial reasoning research."
Conditioned Generative Transformers for Histopathology Image Synthetic Augmentation,"Deep learning networks have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on medical image analysis tasks. However, the majority of the works rely heavily on abundantly labeled data, which necessitates extensive involvement of domain experts. Vision transformer (ViT) based generative adversarial networks (GANs) recently demonstrated superior potential in general image synthesis, yet are less explored for histopathology images. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a pure ViT-based conditional GAN model for histopathology image synthetic augmentation. To alleviate training instability and improve generation robustness, we first introduce a conditioned class projection method to facilitate class separation. We then implement a multi-loss weighing function to dynamically balance the losses between classification tasks. We further propose a selective augmentation mechanism to actively choose the appropriate generated images and bring additional performance improvements. Extensive experiments on the histopathology datasets show that leveraging our synthetic augmentation framework results in significant and consistent improvements in classification performance."
Optimizing Prompts for Text-to-Image Generation,"Well-designed prompts can guide text-to-image models to generate amazing images. However, the performant prompts are often model-specific and misaligned with user input. Instead of laborious human engineering, we propose prompt adaptation, a general framework that automatically adapts original user input to model-preferred prompts. Specifically, we first perform supervised fine-tuning with a pretrained language model on a small collection of manually engineered prompts. Then we use reinforcement learning to explore better prompts. We define a reward function that encourages the policy to generate more aesthetically pleasing images while preserving the original user intentions. Experimental results on Stable Diffusion show that our method outperforms manual prompt engineering in terms of both automatic metrics and human preference ratings. Moreover, reinforcement learning further boosts performance, especially on out-of-domain prompts. The pretrained checkpoints are available at https://aka.ms/promptist. The demo can be found at https://aka.ms/promptist-demo."
A Framework for Generalizing Critical Heat Flux Detection Models Using Unsupervised Image-to-Image Translation,"The detection of critical heat flux (CHF) is crucial in heat boiling applications as failure to do so can cause rapid temperature ramp leading to device failures. Many machine learning models exist to detect CHF, but their performance reduces significantly when tested on data from different domains. To deal with datasets from new domains a model needs to be trained from scratch. Moreover, the dataset needs to be annotated by a domain expert. To address this issue, we propose a new framework to support the generalizability and adaptability of trained CHF detection models in an unsupervised manner. This approach uses an unsupervised Image-to-Image (UI2I) translation model to transform images in the target dataset to look like they were obtained from the same domain the model previously trained on. Unlike other frameworks dealing with domain shift, our framework does not require retraining or fine-tuning of the trained classification model nor does it require synthesized datasets in the training process of either the classification model or the UI2I model. The framework was tested on three boiling datasets from different domains, and we show that the CHF detection model trained on one dataset was able to generalize to the other two previously unseen datasets with high accuracy. Overall, the framework enables CHF detection models to adapt to data generated from different domains without requiring additional annotation effort or retraining of the model."
Human Image Generation: A Comprehensive Survey,"Image and video synthesis has become a blooming topic in computer vision and machine learning communities along with the developments of deep generative models, due to its great academic and application value. Many researchers have been devoted to synthesizing high-fidelity human images as one of the most commonly seen object categories in daily lives, where a large number of studies are performed based on various deep generative models, task settings and applications. Thus, it is necessary to give a comprehensive overview on these variant methods on human image generation. In this paper, we divide human image generation techniques into three paradigms, i.e., data-driven methods, knowledge-guided methods and hybrid methods. For each route, the most representative models and the corresponding variants are presented, where the advantages and characteristics of different methods are summarized in terms of model architectures and input/output requirements. Besides, the main public human image datasets and evaluation metrics in the literature are also summarized. Furthermore, due to the wide application potentials, two typical downstream usages of synthesized human images are covered, i.e., data augmentation for person recognition tasks and virtual try-on for fashion customers. Finally, we discuss the challenges and potential directions of human image generation to shed light on future research."
SADM: Sequence-Aware Diffusion Model for Longitudinal Medical Image Generation,"Human organs constantly undergo anatomical changes due to a complex mix of short-term (e.g., heartbeat) and long-term (e.g., aging) factors. Evidently, prior knowledge of these factors will be beneficial when modeling their future state, i.e., via image generation. However, most of the medical image generation tasks only rely on the input from a single image, thus ignoring the sequential dependency even when longitudinal data is available. Sequence-aware deep generative models, where model input is a sequence of ordered and timestamped images, are still underexplored in the medical imaging domain that is featured by several unique challenges: 1) Sequences with various lengths; 2) Missing data or frame, and 3) High dimensionality. To this end, we propose a sequence-aware diffusion model (SADM) for the generation of longitudinal medical images. Recently, diffusion models have shown promising results in high-fidelity image generation. Our method extends this new technique by introducing a sequence-aware transformer as the conditional module in a diffusion model. The novel design enables learning longitudinal dependency even with missing data during training and allows autoregressive generation of a sequence of images during inference. Our extensive experiments on 3D longitudinal medical images demonstrate the effectiveness of SADM compared with baselines and alternative methods. The code is available at https://github.com/ubc-tea/SADM-Longitudinal-Medical-Image-Generation."
Universal Generative Modeling in Dual-domain for Dynamic MR Imaging,"Dynamic magnetic resonance image reconstruction from incomplete k-space data has generated great research interest due to its capability to reduce scan time. Never-theless, the reconstruction problem is still challenging due to its ill-posed nature. Recently, diffusion models espe-cially score-based generative models have exhibited great potential in algorithm robustness and usage flexi-bility. Moreover, the unified framework through the variance exploding stochastic differential equation (VE-SDE) is proposed to enable new sampling methods and further extend the capabilities of score-based gener-ative models. Therefore, by taking advantage of the uni-fied framework, we proposed a k-space and image Du-al-Domain collaborative Universal Generative Model (DD-UGM) which combines the score-based prior with low-rank regularization penalty to reconstruct highly under-sampled measurements. More precisely, we extract prior components from both image and k-space domains via a universal generative model and adaptively handle these prior components for faster processing while maintaining good generation quality. Experimental comparisons demonstrated the noise reduction and detail preservation abilities of the proposed method. Much more than that, DD-UGM can reconstruct data of differ-ent frames by only training a single frame image, which reflects the flexibility of the proposed model."
The Infinite Index: Information Retrieval on Generative Text-To-Image Models,"Conditional generative models such as DALL-E and Stable Diffusion generate images based on a user-defined text, the prompt. Finding and refining prompts that produce a desired image has become the art of prompt engineering. Generative models do not provide a built-in retrieval model for a user's information need expressed through prompts. In light of an extensive literature review, we reframe prompt engineering for generative models as interactive text-based retrieval on a novel kind of ""infinite index"". We apply these insights for the first time in a case study on image generation for game design with an expert. Finally, we envision how active learning may help to guide the retrieval of generated images."
3DHumanGAN: Towards Photo-Realistic 3D-Aware Human Image Generation,"We present 3DHumanGAN, a 3D-aware generative adversarial network (GAN) that synthesizes images of full-body humans with consistent appearances under different view-angles and body-poses. To tackle the representational and computational challenges in synthesizing the articulated structure of human bodies, we propose a novel generator architecture in which a 2D convolutional backbone is modulated by a 3D pose mapping network. The 3D pose mapping network is formulated as a renderable implicit function conditioned on a posed 3D human mesh. This design has several merits: i) it allows us to harness the power of 2D GANs to generate photo-realistic images; ii) it generates consistent images under varying view-angles and specifiable poses; iii) the model can benefit from the 3D human prior. Our model is adversarially learned from a collection of web images needless of manual annotation."
Low-rank Tensor Assisted K-space Generative Model for Parallel Imaging Reconstruction,"Although recent deep learning methods, especially generative models, have shown good performance in fast magnetic resonance imaging, there is still much room for improvement in high-dimensional generation. Considering that internal dimensions in score-based generative models have a critical impact on estimating the gradient of the data distribution, we present a new idea, low-rank tensor assisted k-space generative model (LR-KGM), for parallel imaging reconstruction. This means that we transform original prior information into high-dimensional prior information for learning. More specifically, the multi-channel data is constructed into a large Hankel matrix and the matrix is subsequently folded into tensor for prior learning. In the testing phase, the low-rank rotation strategy is utilized to impose low-rank constraints on tensor output of the generative network. Furthermore, we alternately use traditional generative iterations and low-rank high-dimensional tensor iterations for reconstruction. Experimental comparisons with the state-of-the-arts demonstrated that the proposed LR-KGM method achieved better performance."
Album cover art image generation with Generative Adversarial Networks,"Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) were introduced by Goodfellow in 2014, and since then have become popular for constructing generative artificial intelligence models. However, the drawbacks of such networks are numerous, like their longer training times, their sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning, several types of loss and optimization functions and other difficulties like mode collapse. Current applications of GANs include generating photo-realistic human faces, animals and objects. However, I wanted to explore the artistic ability of GANs in more detail, by using existing models and learning from them. This dissertation covers the basics of neural networks and works its way up to the particular aspects of GANs, together with experimentation and modification of existing available models, from least complex to most. The intention is to see if state of the art GANs (specifically StyleGAN2) can generate album art covers and if it is possible to tailor them by genre. This was attempted by first familiarizing myself with 3 existing GANs architectures, including the state of the art StyleGAN2. The StyleGAN2 code was used to train a model with a dataset containing 80K album cover images, then used to style images by picking curated images and mixing their styles."
Diffusion Guided Domain Adaptation of Image Generators,"Can a text-to-image diffusion model be used as a training objective for adapting a GAN generator to another domain? In this paper, we show that the classifier-free guidance can be leveraged as a critic and enable generators to distill knowledge from large-scale text-to-image diffusion models. Generators can be efficiently shifted into new domains indicated by text prompts without access to groundtruth samples from target domains. We demonstrate the effectiveness and controllability of our method through extensive experiments. Although not trained to minimize CLIP loss, our model achieves equally high CLIP scores and significantly lower FID than prior work on short prompts, and outperforms the baseline qualitatively and quantitatively on long and complicated prompts. To our best knowledge, the proposed method is the first attempt at incorporating large-scale pre-trained diffusion models and distillation sampling for text-driven image generator domain adaptation and gives a quality previously beyond possible. Moreover, we extend our work to 3D-aware style-based generators and DreamBooth guidance."
FSID: Fully Synthetic Image Denoising via Procedural Scene Generation,"For low-level computer vision and image processing ML tasks, training on large datasets is critical for generalization. However, the standard practice of relying on real-world images primarily from the Internet comes with image quality, scalability, and privacy issues, especially in commercial contexts. To address this, we have developed a procedural synthetic data generation pipeline and dataset tailored to low-level vision tasks. Our Unreal engine-based synthetic data pipeline populates large scenes algorithmically with a combination of random 3D objects, materials, and geometric transformations. Then, we calibrate the camera noise profiles to synthesize the noisy images. From this pipeline, we generated a fully synthetic image denoising dataset (FSID) which consists of 175,000 noisy/clean image pairs. We then trained and validated a CNN-based denoising model, and demonstrated that the model trained on this synthetic data alone can achieve competitive denoising results when evaluated on real-world noisy images captured with smartphone cameras."
"Judge, Localize, and Edit: Ensuring Visual Commonsense Morality for Text-to-Image Generation","Text-to-image generation methods produce high-resolution and high-quality images, but these methods should not produce immoral images that may contain inappropriate content from the commonsense morality perspective. Conventional approaches often neglect these ethical concerns, and existing solutions are limited in avoiding immoral image generation. In this paper, we aim to automatically judge the immorality of synthesized images and manipulate these images into a moral alternative. To this end, we build a model that has the three main primitives: (1) our model recognizes the visual commonsense immorality of a given image, (2) our model localizes or highlights immoral visual (and textual) attributes that make the image immoral, and (3) our model manipulates a given immoral image into a morally-qualifying alternative. We experiment with the state-of-the-art Stable Diffusion text-to-image generation model and show the effectiveness of our ethical image manipulation. Our human study confirms that ours is indeed able to generate morally-satisfying images from immoral ones. Our implementation will be publicly available upon publication to be widely used as a new safety checker for text-to-image generation models."
NeRDi: Single-View NeRF Synthesis with Language-Guided Diffusion as General Image Priors,"2D-to-3D reconstruction is an ill-posed problem, yet humans are good at solving this problem due to their prior knowledge of the 3D world developed over years. Driven by this observation, we propose NeRDi, a single-view NeRF synthesis framework with general image priors from 2D diffusion models. Formulating single-view reconstruction as an image-conditioned 3D generation problem, we optimize the NeRF representations by minimizing a diffusion loss on its arbitrary view renderings with a pretrained image diffusion model under the input-view constraint. We leverage off-the-shelf vision-language models and introduce a two-section language guidance as conditioning inputs to the diffusion model. This is essentially helpful for improving multiview content coherence as it narrows down the general image prior conditioned on the semantic and visual features of the single-view input image. Additionally, we introduce a geometric loss based on estimated depth maps to regularize the underlying 3D geometry of the NeRF. Experimental results on the DTU MVS dataset show that our method can synthesize novel views with higher quality even compared to existing methods trained on this dataset. We also demonstrate our generalizability in zero-shot NeRF synthesis for in-the-wild images."
Domain Adaptation and Generalization on Functional Medical Images: A Systematic Survey,"Machine learning algorithms have revolutionized different fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, signal processing, and medical data processing. Despite the excellent capabilities of machine learning algorithms in various tasks and areas, the performance of these models mainly deteriorates when there is a shift in the test and training data distributions. This gap occurs due to the violation of the fundamental assumption that the training and test data are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d). In real-world scenarios where collecting data from all possible domains for training is costly and even impossible, the i.i.d assumption can hardly be satisfied. The problem is even more severe in the case of medical images and signals because it requires either expensive equipment or a meticulous experimentation setup to collect data, even for a single domain. Additionally, the decrease in performance may have severe consequences in the analysis of medical records. As a result of such problems, the ability to generalize and adapt under distribution shifts (domain generalization (DG) and domain adaptation (DA)) is essential for the analysis of medical data. This paper provides the first systematic review of DG and DA on functional brain signals to fill the gap of the absence of a comprehensive study in this era. We provide detailed explanations and categorizations of datasets, approaches, and architectures used in DG and DA on functional brain images. We further address the attention-worthy future tracks in this field."
A Robust Image Steganographic Scheme against General Scaling Attacks,"Conventional covert image communication is assumed to transmit the message, in the securest way possible for a given payload, over lossless channels, and the associated steganographic schemes are generally vulnerable to active attacks, e.g., JPEG re-compression, scaling, as seen on social networks. Although considerable progress has been made on robust steganography against JPEG re-compression, there exist few steganographic schemes capable of resisting to scaling attacks due to the tricky inverse interpolations involved in algorithm design. To tackle this issue, a framework for robust image steganography resisting to scaling with general interpolations either in standard form with fixed interpolation block, or pre-filtering based anti-aliasing implementation with variable block, is proposed in this paper. And the task of robust steganography can be formulated as one of constrained integer programming aiming at perfectly recover the secret message from stego image while minimizing the difference between cover and stego images. By introducing a metric - the degree of pixel involvement (dPI) to identify the modifiable pixels in cover image, the optimization problem above could be effectively solved using branch and bound algorithm (B\&B). In addition, a customized distortion function for scaled stego images is adopted to further boost the security performance. Extensive experiments are carried out which demonstrate that the proposed scheme could not only outperform the prior art in terms of security by a clear margin, but also be applicable to resisting the scaling attacks with various interpolation techniques at arbitrary scaling factors (SFs)."
I2MVFormer: Large Language Model Generated Multi-View Document Supervision for Zero-Shot Image Classification,"Recent works have shown that unstructured text (documents) from online sources can serve as useful auxiliary information for zero-shot image classification. However, these methods require access to a high-quality source like Wikipedia and are limited to a single source of information. Large Language Models (LLM) trained on web-scale text show impressive abilities to repurpose their learned knowledge for a multitude of tasks. In this work, we provide a novel perspective on using an LLM to provide text supervision for a zero-shot image classification model. The LLM is provided with a few text descriptions from different annotators as examples. The LLM is conditioned on these examples to generate multiple text descriptions for each class(referred to as views). Our proposed model, I2MVFormer, learns multi-view semantic embeddings for zero-shot image classification with these class views. We show that each text view of a class provides complementary information allowing a model to learn a highly discriminative class embedding. Moreover, we show that I2MVFormer is better at consuming the multi-view text supervision from LLM compared to baseline models. I2MVFormer establishes a new state-of-the-art on three public benchmark datasets for zero-shot image classification with unsupervised semantic embeddings."
Rethinking Generative Methods for Image Restoration in Physics-based Vision: A Theoretical Analysis from the Perspective of Information,"End-to-end generative methods are considered a more promising solution for image restoration in physics-based vision compared with the traditional deconstructive methods based on handcrafted composition models. However, existing generative methods still have plenty of room for improvement in quantitative performance. More crucially, these methods are considered black boxes due to weak interpretability and there is rarely a theory trying to explain their mechanism and learning process. In this study, we try to re-interpret these generative methods for image restoration tasks using information theory. Different from conventional understanding, we analyzed the information flow of these methods and identified three sources of information (extracted high-level information, retained low-level information, and external information that is absent from the source inputs) are involved and optimized respectively in generating the restoration results. We further derived their learning behaviors, optimization objectives, and the corresponding information boundaries by extending the information bottleneck principle. Based on this theoretic framework, we found that many existing generative methods tend to be direct applications of the general models designed for conventional generation tasks, which may suffer from problems including over-invested abstraction processes, inherent details loss, and vanishing gradients or imbalance in training. We analyzed these issues with both intuitive and theoretical explanations and proved them with empirical evidence respectively. Ultimately, we proposed general solutions or ideas to address the above issue and validated these approaches with performance boosts on six datasets of three different image restoration tasks."
Generative Reasoning Integrated Label Noise Robust Deep Image Representation Learning in Remote Sensing,"The development of deep learning based image representation learning (IRL) methods has attracted great attention in the context of remote sensing (RS) image understanding. Most of these methods require the availability of a high quantity and quality of annotated training images, which can be time-consuming and costly to gather. To reduce labeling costs, publicly available thematic maps, automatic labeling procedures or crowdsourced data can be used. However, such approaches increase the risk of including label noise in training data. It may result in overfitting on noisy labels when discriminative reasoning is employed as in most of the existing methods. This leads to sub-optimal learning procedures, and thus inaccurate characterization of RS images. In this paper, as a first time in RS, we introduce a generative reasoning integrated label noise robust representation learning (GRID) approach. GRID aims to model the complementary characteristics of discriminative and generative reasoning for IRL under noisy labels. To this end, we first integrate generative reasoning into discriminative reasoning through a variational autoencoder. This allows our approach to automatically detect training samples with noisy labels. Then, through our label noise robust hybrid representation learning strategy, GRID adjusts the whole learning procedure for IRL of these samples through generative reasoning and that of the other samples through discriminative reasoning. Our approach learns discriminative image representations while preventing interference of noisy labels during training independently from the IRL method. Thus, unlike the existing methods, GRID does not depend on the type of annotation, label noise, neural network, loss or learning task, and thus can be utilized for various RS image understanding problems. Experimental results show the effectiveness of GRID compared to state-of-the-art methods."
QC-StyleGAN -- Quality Controllable Image Generation and Manipulation,"The introduction of high-quality image generation models, particularly the StyleGAN family, provides a powerful tool to synthesize and manipulate images. However, existing models are built upon high-quality (HQ) data as desired outputs, making them unfit for in-the-wild low-quality (LQ) images, which are common inputs for manipulation. In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing a novel GAN structure that allows for generating images with controllable quality. The network can synthesize various image degradation and restore the sharp image via a quality control code. Our proposed QC-StyleGAN can directly edit LQ images without altering their quality by applying GAN inversion and manipulation techniques. It also provides for free an image restoration solution that can handle various degradations, including noise, blur, compression artifacts, and their mixtures. Finally, we demonstrate numerous other applications such as image degradation synthesis, transfer, and interpolation. The code is available at https://github.com/VinAIResearch/QC-StyleGAN."
Learning to Generate Text-grounded Mask for Open-world Semantic Segmentation from Only Image-Text Pairs,"We tackle open-world semantic segmentation, which aims at learning to segment arbitrary visual concepts in images, by using only image-text pairs without dense annotations. Existing open-world segmentation methods have shown impressive advances by employing contrastive learning (CL) to learn diverse visual concepts and transferring the learned image-level understanding to the segmentation task. However, these CL-based methods suffer from a train-test discrepancy, since it only considers image-text alignment during training, whereas segmentation requires region-text alignment during testing. In this paper, we proposed a novel Text-grounded Contrastive Learning (TCL) framework that enables a model to directly learn region-text alignment. Our method generates a segmentation mask for a given text, extracts text-grounded image embedding from the masked region, and aligns it with text embedding via TCL. By learning region-text alignment directly, our framework encourages a model to directly improve the quality of generated segmentation masks. In addition, for a rigorous and fair comparison, we present a unified evaluation protocol with widely used 8 semantic segmentation datasets. TCL achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot segmentation performances with large margins in all datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/kakaobrain/tcl."
MrSARP: A Hierarchical Deep Generative Prior for SAR Image Super-resolution,"Generative models learned from training using deep learning methods can be used as priors in inverse under-determined inverse problems, including imaging from sparse set of measurements. In this paper, we present a novel hierarchical deep-generative model MrSARP for SAR imagery that can synthesize SAR images of a target at different resolutions jointly. MrSARP is trained in conjunction with a critic that scores multi resolution images jointly to decide if they are realistic images of a target at different resolutions. We show how this deep generative model can be used to retrieve the high spatial resolution image from low resolution images of the same target. The cost function of the generator is modified to improve its capability to retrieve the input parameters for a given set of resolution images. We evaluate the model's performance using the three standard error metrics used for evaluating super-resolution performance on simulated data and compare it to upsampling and sparsity based image sharpening approaches."
DATID-3D: Diversity-Preserved Domain Adaptation Using Text-to-Image Diffusion for 3D Generative Model,"Recent 3D generative models have achieved remarkable performance in synthesizing high resolution photorealistic images with view consistency and detailed 3D shapes, but training them for diverse domains is challenging since it requires massive training images and their camera distribution information. Text-guided domain adaptation methods have shown impressive performance on converting the 2D generative model on one domain into the models on other domains with different styles by leveraging the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training), rather than collecting massive datasets for those domains. However, one drawback of them is that the sample diversity in the original generative model is not well-preserved in the domain-adapted generative models due to the deterministic nature of the CLIP text encoder. Text-guided domain adaptation will be even more challenging for 3D generative models not only because of catastrophic diversity loss, but also because of inferior text-image correspondence and poor image quality. Here we propose DATID-3D, a domain adaptation method tailored for 3D generative models using text-to-image diffusion models that can synthesize diverse images per text prompt without collecting additional images and camera information for the target domain. Unlike 3D extensions of prior text-guided domain adaptation methods, our novel pipeline was able to fine-tune the state-of-the-art 3D generator of the source domain to synthesize high resolution, multi-view consistent images in text-guided targeted domains without additional data, outperforming the existing text-guided domain adaptation methods in diversity and text-image correspondence. Furthermore, we propose and demonstrate diverse 3D image manipulations such as one-shot instance-selected adaptation and single-view manipulated 3D reconstruction to fully enjoy diversity in text."
Wavelet Diffusion Models are fast and scalable Image Generators,"Diffusion models are rising as a powerful solution for high-fidelity image generation, which exceeds GANs in quality in many circumstances. However, their slow training and inference speed is a huge bottleneck, blocking them from being used in real-time applications. A recent DiffusionGAN method significantly decreases the models' running time by reducing the number of sampling steps from thousands to several, but their speeds still largely lag behind the GAN counterparts. This paper aims to reduce the speed gap by proposing a novel wavelet-based diffusion scheme. We extract low-and-high frequency components from both image and feature levels via wavelet decomposition and adaptively handle these components for faster processing while maintaining good generation quality. Furthermore, we propose to use a reconstruction term, which effectively boosts the model training convergence. Experimental results on CelebA-HQ, CIFAR-10, LSUN-Church, and STL-10 datasets prove our solution is a stepping-stone to offering real-time and high-fidelity diffusion models. Our code and pre-trained checkpoints are available at \url{https://github.com/VinAIResearch/WaveDiff.git}."
Three-stage binarization of color document images based on discrete wavelet transform and generative adversarial networks,"The efficient segmentation of foreground text information from the background in degraded color document images is a hot research topic. Due to the imperfect preservation of ancient documents over a long period of time, various types of degradation, including staining, yellowing, and ink seepage, have seriously affected the results of image binarization. In this paper, a three-stage method is proposed for image enhancement and binarization of degraded color document images by using discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and generative adversarial network (GAN). In Stage-1, we use DWT and retain the LL subband images to achieve the image enhancement. In Stage-2, the original input image is split into four (Red, Green, Blue and Gray) single-channel images, each of which trains the independent adversarial networks. The trained adversarial network models are used to extract the color foreground information from the images. In Stage-3, in order to combine global and local features, the output image from Stage-2 and the original input image are used to train the independent adversarial networks for document binarization. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms many classical and state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on the Document Image Binarization Contest (DIBCO) dataset. We release our implementation code at https://github.com/abcpp12383/ThreeStageBinarization."
Using a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network to Control the Statistical Characteristics of Generated Images for IACT Data Analysis,"Generative adversarial networks are a promising tool for image generation in the astronomy domain. Of particular interest are conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs), which allow you to divide images into several classes according to the value of some property of the image, and then specify the required class when generating new images. In the case of images from Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs), an important property is the total brightness of all image pixels (image size), which is in direct correlation with the energy of primary particles. We used a cGAN technique to generate images similar to whose obtained in the TAIGA-IACT experiment. As a training set, we used a set of two-dimensional images generated using the TAIGA Monte Carlo simulation software. We artificiallly divided the training set into 10 classes, sorting images by size and defining the boundaries of the classes so that the same number of images fall into each class. These classes were used while training our network. The paper shows that for each class, the size distribution of the generated images is close to normal with the mean value located approximately in the middle of the corresponding class. We also show that for the generated images, the total image size distribution obtained by summing the distributions over all classes is close to the original distribution of the training set. The results obtained will be useful for more accurate generation of realistic synthetic images similar to the ones taken by IACTs."
Hand-Object Interaction Image Generation,"In this work, we are dedicated to a new task, i.e., hand-object interaction image generation, which aims to conditionally generate the hand-object image under the given hand, object and their interaction status. This task is challenging and research-worthy in many potential application scenarios, such as AR/VR games and online shopping, etc. To address this problem, we propose a novel HOGAN framework, which utilizes the expressive model-aware hand-object representation and leverages its inherent topology to build the unified surface space. In this space, we explicitly consider the complex self- and mutual occlusion during interaction. During final image synthesis, we consider different characteristics of hand and object and generate the target image in a split-and-combine manner. For evaluation, we build a comprehensive protocol to access both the fidelity and structure preservation of the generated image. Extensive experiments on two large-scale datasets, i.e., HO3Dv3 and DexYCB, demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our framework both quantitatively and qualitatively. The project page is available at https://play-with-hoi-generation.github.io/."
ReCo: Region-Controlled Text-to-Image Generation,"Recently, large-scale text-to-image (T2I) models have shown impressive performance in generating high-fidelity images, but with limited controllability, e.g., precisely specifying the content in a specific region with a free-form text description. In this paper, we propose an effective technique for such regional control in T2I generation. We augment T2I models' inputs with an extra set of position tokens, which represent the quantized spatial coordinates. Each region is specified by four position tokens to represent the top-left and bottom-right corners, followed by an open-ended natural language regional description. Then, we fine-tune a pre-trained T2I model with such new input interface. Our model, dubbed as ReCo (Region-Controlled T2I), enables the region control for arbitrary objects described by open-ended regional texts rather than by object labels from a constrained category set. Empirically, ReCo achieves better image quality than the T2I model strengthened by positional words (FID: 8.82->7.36, SceneFID: 15.54->6.51 on COCO), together with objects being more accurately placed, amounting to a 20.40% region classification accuracy improvement on COCO. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ReCo can better control the object count, spatial relationship, and region attributes such as color/size, with the free-form regional description. Human evaluation on PaintSkill shows that ReCo is +19.28% and +17.21% more accurate in generating images with correct object count and spatial relationship than the T2I model."
Shifted Diffusion for Text-to-image Generation,"We present Corgi, a novel method for text-to-image generation. Corgi is based on our proposed shifted diffusion model, which achieves better image embedding generation from input text. Unlike the baseline diffusion model used in DALL-E 2, our method seamlessly encodes prior knowledge of the pre-trained CLIP model in its diffusion process by designing a new initialization distribution and a new transition step of the diffusion. Compared to the strong DALL-E 2 baseline, our method performs better in generating image embedding from the text in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness, resulting in better text-to-image generation. Extensive large-scale experiments are conducted and evaluated in terms of both quantitative measures and human evaluation, indicating a stronger generation ability of our method compared to existing ones. Furthermore, our model enables semi-supervised and language-free training for text-to-image generation, where only part or none of the images in the training dataset have an associated caption. Trained with only 1.7% of the images being captioned, our semi-supervised model obtains FID results comparable to DALL-E 2 on zero-shot text-to-image generation evaluated on MS-COCO. Corgi also achieves new state-of-the-art results across different datasets on downstream language-free text-to-image generation tasks, outperforming the previous method, Lafite, by a large margin."
Conditional Progressive Generative Adversarial Network for satellite image generation,"Image generation and image completion are rapidly evolving fields, thanks to machine learning algorithms that are able to realistically replace missing pixels. However, generating large high resolution images, with a large level of details, presents important computational challenges. In this work, we formulate the image generation task as completion of an image where one out of three corners is missing. We then extend this approach to iteratively build larger images with the same level of detail. Our goal is to obtain a scalable methodology to generate high resolution samples typically found in satellite imagery data sets. We introduce a conditional progressive Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), that generates the missing tile in an image, using as input three initial adjacent tiles encoded in a latent vector by a Wasserstein auto-encoder. We focus on a set of images used by the United Nations Satellite Centre (UNOSAT) to train flood detection tools, and validate the quality of synthetic images in a realistic setup."
3inGAN: Learning a 3D Generative Model from Images of a Self-similar Scene,"We introduce 3inGAN, an unconditional 3D generative model trained from 2D images of a single self-similar 3D scene. Such a model can be used to produce 3D ""remixes"" of a given scene, by mapping spatial latent codes into a 3D volumetric representation, which can subsequently be rendered from arbitrary views using physically based volume rendering. By construction, the generated scenes remain view-consistent across arbitrary camera configurations, without any flickering or spatio-temporal artifacts. During training, we employ a combination of 2D, obtained through differentiable volume tracing, and 3D Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) losses, across multiple scales, enforcing realism on both its 3D structure and the 2D renderings. We show results on semi-stochastic scenes of varying scale and complexity, obtained from real and synthetic sources. We demonstrate, for the first time, the feasibility of learning plausible view-consistent 3D scene variations from a single exemplar scene and provide qualitative and quantitative comparisons against recent related methods."
Rethinking Data Augmentation for Single-source Domain Generalization in Medical Image Segmentation,"Single-source domain generalization (SDG) in medical image segmentation is a challenging yet essential task as domain shifts are quite common among clinical image datasets. Previous attempts most conduct global-only/random augmentation. Their augmented samples are usually insufficient in diversity and informativeness, thus failing to cover the possible target domain distribution. In this paper, we rethink the data augmentation strategy for SDG in medical image segmentation. Motivated by the class-level representation invariance and style mutability of medical images, we hypothesize that unseen target data can be sampled from a linear combination of C (the class number) random variables, where each variable follows a location-scale distribution at the class level. Accordingly, data augmented can be readily made by sampling the random variables through a general form. On the empirical front, we implement such strategy with constrained B\acute{\rm e}zier transformation on both global and local (i.e. class-level) regions, which can largely increase the augmentation diversity. A Saliency-balancing Fusion mechanism is further proposed to enrich the informativeness by engaging the gradient information, guiding augmentation with proper orientation and magnitude. As an important contribution, we prove theoretically that our proposed augmentation can lead to an upper bound of the generalization risk on the unseen target domain, thus confirming our hypothesis. Combining the two strategies, our Saliency-balancing Location-scale Augmentation (SLAug) exceeds the state-of-the-art works by a large margin in two challenging SDG tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/Kaiseem/SLAug ."
Deep Curvilinear Editing: Commutative and Nonlinear Image Manipulation for Pretrained Deep Generative Model,"Semantic editing of images is the fundamental goal of computer vision. Although deep learning methods, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), are capable of producing high-quality images, they often do not have an inherent way of editing generated images semantically. Recent studies have investigated a way of manipulating the latent variable to determine the images to be generated. However, methods that assume linear semantic arithmetic have certain limitations in terms of the quality of image editing, whereas methods that discover nonlinear semantic pathways provide non-commutative editing, which is inconsistent when applied in different orders. This study proposes a novel method called deep curvilinear editing (DeCurvEd) to determine semantic commuting vector fields on the latent space. We theoretically demonstrate that owing to commutativity, the editing of multiple attributes depends only on the quantities and not on the order. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate that compared to previous methods, the nonlinear and commutative nature of DeCurvEd facilitates the disentanglement of image attributes and provides higher-quality editing."
SpaText: Spatio-Textual Representation for Controllable Image Generation,"Recent text-to-image diffusion models are able to generate convincing results of unprecedented quality. However, it is nearly impossible to control the shapes of different regions/objects or their layout in a fine-grained fashion. Previous attempts to provide such controls were hindered by their reliance on a fixed set of labels. To this end, we present SpaText - a new method for text-to-image generation using open-vocabulary scene control. In addition to a global text prompt that describes the entire scene, the user provides a segmentation map where each region of interest is annotated by a free-form natural language description. Due to lack of large-scale datasets that have a detailed textual description for each region in the image, we choose to leverage the current large-scale text-to-image datasets and base our approach on a novel CLIP-based spatio-textual representation, and show its effectiveness on two state-of-the-art diffusion models: pixel-based and latent-based. In addition, we show how to extend the classifier-free guidance method in diffusion models to the multi-conditional case and present an alternative accelerated inference algorithm. Finally, we offer several automatic evaluation metrics and use them, in addition to FID scores and a user study, to evaluate our method and show that it achieves state-of-the-art results on image generation with free-form textual scene control."
Generative Modeling in Structural-Hankel Domain for Color Image Inpainting,"In recent years, some researchers focused on using a single image to obtain a large number of samples through multi-scale features. This study intends to a brand-new idea that requires only ten or even fewer samples to construct the low-rank structural-Hankel matrices-assisted score-based generative model (SHGM) for color image inpainting task. During the prior learning process, a certain amount of internal-middle patches are firstly extracted from several images and then the structural-Hankel matrices are constructed from these patches. To better apply the score-based generative model to learn the internal statistical distribution within patches, the large-scale Hankel matrices are finally folded into the higher dimensional tensors for prior learning. During the iterative inpainting process, SHGM views the inpainting problem as a conditional generation procedure in low-rank environment. As a result, the intermediate restored image is acquired by alternatively performing the stochastic differential equation solver, alternating direction method of multipliers, and data consistency steps. Experimental results demonstrated the remarkable performance and diversity of SHGM."
Detecting Anomalies using Generative Adversarial Networks on Images,"Automatic detection of anomalies such as weapons or threat objects in baggage security, or detecting impaired items in industrial production is an important computer vision task demanding high efficiency and accuracy. Most of the available data in the anomaly detection task is imbalanced as the number of positive/anomalous instances is sparse. Inadequate availability of the data makes training of a deep neural network architecture for anomaly detection challenging. This paper proposes a novel Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based model for anomaly detection. It uses normal (non-anomalous) images to learn about the normality based on which it detects if an input image contains an anomalous/threat object. The proposed model uses a generator with an encoder-decoder network having dense convolutional skip connections for enhanced reconstruction and to capture the data distribution. A self-attention augmented discriminator is used having the ability to check the consistency of detailed features even in distant portions. We use spectral normalisation to facilitate stable and improved training of the GAN. Experiments are performed on three datasets, viz. CIFAR-10, MVTec AD (for industrial applications) and SIXray (for X-ray baggage security). On the MVTec AD and SIXray datasets, our model achieves an improvement of upto 21% and 4.6%, respectively"
Generative Joint Source-Channel Coding for Semantic Image Transmission,"Recent works have shown that joint source-channel coding (JSCC) schemes using deep neural networks (DNNs), called DeepJSCC, provide promising results in wireless image transmission. However, these methods mostly focus on the distortion of the reconstructed signals with respect to the input image, rather than their perception by humans. However, focusing on traditional distortion metrics alone does not necessarily result in high perceptual quality, especially in extreme physical conditions, such as very low bandwidth compression ratio (BCR) and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. In this work, we propose two novel JSCC schemes that leverage the perceptual quality of deep generative models (DGMs) for wireless image transmission, namely InverseJSCC and GenerativeJSCC. While the former is an inverse problem approach to DeepJSCC, the latter is an end-to-end optimized JSCC scheme. In both, we optimize a weighted sum of mean squared error (MSE) and learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS) losses, which capture more semantic similarities than other distortion metrics. InverseJSCC performs denoising on the distorted reconstructions of a DeepJSCC model by solving an inverse optimization problem using style-based generative adversarial network (StyleGAN). Our simulation results show that InverseJSCC significantly improves the state-of-the-art (SotA) DeepJSCC in terms of perceptual quality in edge cases. In GenerativeJSCC, we carry out end-to-end training of an encoder and a StyleGAN-based decoder, and show that GenerativeJSCC significantly outperforms DeepJSCC both in terms of distortion and perceptual quality."
On the Importance of Image Encoding in Automated Chest X-Ray Report Generation,"Chest X-ray is one of the most popular medical imaging modalities due to its accessibility and effectiveness. However, there is a chronic shortage of well-trained radiologists who can interpret these images and diagnose the patient's condition. Therefore, automated radiology report generation can be a very helpful tool in clinical practice. A typical report generation workflow consists of two main steps: (i) encoding the image into a latent space and (ii) generating the text of the report based on the latent image embedding. Many existing report generation techniques use a standard convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for image encoding followed by a Transformer-based decoder for medical text generation. In most cases, CNN and the decoder are trained jointly in an end-to-end fashion. In this work, we primarily focus on understanding the relative importance of encoder and decoder components. Towards this end, we analyze four different image encoding approaches: direct, fine-grained, CLIP-based, and Cluster-CLIP-based encodings in conjunction with three different decoders on the large-scale MIMIC-CXR dataset. Among these encoders, the cluster CLIP visual encoder is a novel approach that aims to generate more discriminative and explainable representations. CLIP-based encoders produce comparable results to traditional CNN-based encoders in terms of NLP metrics, while fine-grained encoding outperforms all other encoders both in terms of NLP and clinical accuracy metrics, thereby validating the importance of image encoder to effectively extract semantic information.

Improving dermatology classifiers across populations using images generated by large diffusion models,"Dermatological classification algorithms developed without sufficiently diverse training data may generalize poorly across populations. While intentional data collection and annotation offer the best means for improving representation, new computational approaches for generating training data may also aid in mitigating the effects of sampling bias. In this paper, we show that DALL\cdotE 2, a large-scale text-to-image diffusion model, can produce photorealistic images of skin disease across skin types. Using the Fitzpatrick 17k dataset as a benchmark, we demonstrate that augmenting training data with DALL\cdotE 2-generated synthetic images improves classification of skin disease overall and especially for underrepresented groups."
Generalization of Artificial Intelligence Models in Medical Imaging: A Case-Based Review,"The discussions around Artificial Intelligence (AI) and medical imaging are centered around the success of deep learning algorithms. As new algorithms enter the market, it is important for practicing radiologists to understand the pitfalls of various AI algorithms. This entails having a basic understanding of how algorithms are developed, the kind of data they are trained on, and the settings in which they will be deployed. As with all new technologies, use of AI should be preceded by a fundamental understanding of the risks and benefits to those it is intended to help. This case-based review is intended to point out specific factors practicing radiologists who intend to use AI should consider."
Using conditional variational autoencoders to generate images from atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes,"High-energy particles hitting the upper atmosphere of the Earth produce extensive air showers that can be detected from the ground level using imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes. The images recorded by Cherenkov telescopes can be analyzed to separate gamma-ray events from the background hadron events. Many of the methods of analysis require simulation of massive amounts of events and the corresponding images by the Monte Carlo method. However, Monte Carlo simulation is computationally expensive. The data simulated by the Monte Carlo method can be augmented by images generated using faster machine learning methods such as generative adversarial networks or conditional variational autoencoders. We use a conditional variational autoencoder to generate images of gamma events from a Cherenkov telescope of the TAIGA experiment. The variational autoencoder is trained on a set of Monte Carlo events with the image size, or the sum of the amplitudes of the pixels, used as the conditional parameter. We used the trained variational autoencoder to generate new images with the same distribution of the conditional parameter as the size distribution of the Monte Carlo-simulated images of gamma events. The generated images are similar to the Monte Carlo images: a classifier neural network trained on gamma and proton events assigns them the average gamma score 0.984, with less than 3% of the events being assigned the gamma score below 0.999. At the same time, the sizes of the generated images do not match the conditional parameter used in their generation, with the average error 0.33."
Is the Elephant Flying? Resolving Ambiguities in Text-to-Image Generative Models,"Natural language often contains ambiguities that can lead to misinterpretation and miscommunication. While humans can handle ambiguities effectively by asking clarifying questions and/or relying on contextual cues and common-sense knowledge, resolving ambiguities can be notoriously hard for machines. In this work, we study ambiguities that arise in text-to-image generative models. We curate a benchmark dataset covering different types of ambiguities that occur in these systems. We then propose a framework to mitigate ambiguities in the prompts given to the systems by soliciting clarifications from the user. Through automatic and human evaluations, we show the effectiveness of our framework in generating more faithful images aligned with human intention in the presence of ambiguities."
The Euclidean Space is Evil: Hyperbolic Attribute Editing for Few-shot Image Generation,"Few-shot image generation is a challenging task since it aims to generate diverse new images for an unseen category with only a few images. Existing methods suffer from the trade-off between the quality and diversity of generated images. To tackle this problem, we propose Hyperbolic Attribute Editing (HAE), a simple yet effective method. Unlike other methods that work in Euclidean space, HAE captures the hierarchy among images using data from seen categories in hyperbolic space. Given a well-trained HAE, images of unseen categories can be generated by moving the latent code of a given image toward any meaningful directions in the Poincaré disk with a fixing radius. Most importantly, the hyperbolic space allows us to control the semantic diversity of the generated images by setting different radii in the disk. Extensive experiments and visualizations demonstrate that HAE is capable of not only generating images with promising quality and diversity using limited data but achieving a highly controllable and interpretable editing process."
Convolutional Neural Generative Coding: Scaling Predictive Coding to Natural Images,"In this work, we develop convolutional neural generative coding (Conv-NGC), a generalization of predictive coding to the case of convolution/deconvolution-based computation. Specifically, we concretely implement a flexible neurobiologically-motivated algorithm that progressively refines latent state feature maps in order to dynamically form a more accurate internal representation/reconstruction model of natural images. The performance of the resulting sensory processing system is evaluated on complex datasets such as Color-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Street House View Numbers (SVHN). We study the effectiveness of our brain-inspired model on the tasks of reconstruction and image denoising and find that it is competitive with convolutional auto-encoding systems trained by backpropagation of errors and outperforms them with respect to out-of-distribution reconstruction (including the full 90k CINIC-10 test set)."
Layered-Garment Net: Generating Multiple Implicit Garment Layers from a Single Image,"Recent research works have focused on generating human models and garments from their 2D images. However, state-of-the-art researches focus either on only a single layer of the garment on a human model or on generating multiple garment layers without any guarantee of the intersection-free geometric relationship between them. In reality, people wear multiple layers of garments in their daily life, where an inner layer of garment could be partially covered by an outer one. In this paper, we try to address this multi-layer modeling problem and propose the Layered-Garment Net (LGN) that is capable of generating intersection-free multiple layers of garments defined by implicit function fields over the body surface, given the person's near front-view image. With a special design of garment indication fields (GIF), we can enforce an implicit covering relationship between the signed distance fields (SDF) of different layers to avoid self-intersections among different garment surfaces and the human body. Experiments demonstrate the strength of our proposed LGN framework in generating multi-layer garments as compared to state-of-the-art methods. To the best of our knowledge, LGN is the first research work to generate intersection-free multiple layers of garments on the human body from a single image."
DreamArtist: Towards Controllable One-Shot Text-to-Image Generation via Positive-Negative Prompt-Tuning,"Large-scale text-to-image generation models have achieved remarkable progress in synthesizing high-quality, feature-rich images with high resolution guided by texts. However, these models often struggle with novel concepts, eg, new styles, object entities, etc. Although recent attempts have employed fine-tuning or prompt-tuning strategies to teach the pre-trained diffusion model novel concepts from a reference image set,they have the drawback of overfitting to the given reference images, particularly in one-shot applications, which is harmful to generate diverse and high-quality images while maintaining generation controllability.  To tackle this challenge, we present a simple yet effective method called DreamArtist, which employs a positive-negative prompt-tuning learning strategy. Specifically, DreamArtist incorporates both positive and negative embeddings and jointly trains them. The positive embedding aggressively captures the salient characteristics of the reference image to drive diversified generation and the negative embedding rectifies inadequacies from the positive embedding. It learns not only what is correct, but also what can be avoided or improved. We have conducted extensive experiments and evaluated the proposed method from image similarity and diversity, generation controllability, and style cloning. And our DreamArtist has achieved a superior generation performance over existing methods. Besides, our additional evaluation on extended tasks, including concept compositions and prompt-guided image editing, demonstrates its effectiveness for more applications."
Diffusion-Based Scene Graph to Image Generation with Masked Contrastive Pre-Training,"Generating images from graph-structured inputs, such as scene graphs, is uniquely challenging due to the difficulty of aligning nodes and connections in graphs with objects and their relations in images. Most existing methods address this challenge by using scene layouts, which are image-like representations of scene graphs designed to capture the coarse structures of scene images. Because scene layouts are manually crafted, the alignment with images may not be fully optimized, causing suboptimal compliance between the generated images and the original scene graphs. To tackle this issue, we propose to learn scene graph embeddings by directly optimizing their alignment with images. Specifically, we pre-train an encoder to extract both global and local information from scene graphs that are predictive of the corresponding images, relying on two loss functions: masked autoencoding loss and contrastive loss. The former trains embeddings by reconstructing randomly masked image regions, while the latter trains embeddings to discriminate between compliant and non-compliant images according to the scene graph. Given these embeddings, we build a latent diffusion model to generate images from scene graphs. The resulting method, called SGDiff, allows for the semantic manipulation of generated images by modifying scene graph nodes and connections. On the Visual Genome and COCO-Stuff datasets, we demonstrate that SGDiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods, as measured by both the Inception Score and Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) metrics. We will release our source code and trained models at https://github.com/YangLing0818/SGDiff."
"Deep Composite Face Image Attacks: Generation, Vulnerability and Detection","Face manipulation attacks have drawn the attention of biometric researchers because of their vulnerability to Face Recognition Systems (FRS). This paper proposes a novel scheme to generate Composite Face Image Attacks (CFIA) based on facial attributes using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Given the face images corresponding to two unique data subjects, the proposed CFIA method will independently generate the segmented facial attributes, then blend them using transparent masks to generate the CFIA samples. We generate 526 unique CFIA combinations of facial attributes for each pair of contributory data subjects. Extensive experiments are carried out on our newly generated CFIA dataset consisting of 1000 unique identities with 2000 bona fide samples and 526000 CFIA samples, thus resulting in an overall 528000 face image samples. {We present a sequence of experiments to benchmark the attack potential of CFIA samples using four different automatic FRS}. We introduced a new metric named Generalized Morphing Attack Potential (G-MAP) to benchmark the vulnerability of generated attacks on FRS effectively. Additional experiments are performed on the representative subset of the CFIA dataset to benchmark both perceptual quality and human observer response. Finally, the CFIA detection performance is benchmarked using three different single image based face Morphing Attack Detection (MAD) algorithms. The source code of the proposed method together with CFIA dataset will be made publicly available: \url{https://github.com/jagmohaniiit/LatentCompositionCode}"
How to Describe Images in a More Funny Way? Towards a Modular Approach to Cross-Modal Sarcasm Generation,"Sarcasm generation has been investigated in previous studies by considering it as a text-to-text generation problem, i.e., generating a sarcastic sentence for an input sentence. In this paper, we study a new problem of cross-modal sarcasm generation (CMSG), i.e., generating a sarcastic description for a given image. CMSG is challenging as models need to satisfy the characteristics of sarcasm, as well as the correlation between different modalities. In addition, there should be some inconsistency between the two modalities, which requires imagination. Moreover, high-quality training data is insufficient. To address these problems, we take a step toward generating sarcastic descriptions from images without paired training data and propose an Extraction-Generation-Ranking based Modular method (EGRM) for cross-model sarcasm generation. Specifically, EGRM first extracts diverse information from an image at different levels and uses the obtained image tags, sentimental descriptive caption, and commonsense-based consequence to generate candidate sarcastic texts. Then, a comprehensive ranking algorithm, which considers image-text relation, sarcasticness, and grammaticality, is proposed to select a final text from the candidate texts. Human evaluation at five criteria on a total of 1200 generated image-text pairs from eight systems and auxiliary automatic evaluation show the superiority of our method."
IC3D: Image-Conditioned 3D Diffusion for Shape Generation,"In the last years, Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) obtained state-of-the-art results in many generative tasks, outperforming GANs and other classes of generative models. In particular, they reached impressive results in various image generation sub-tasks, among which conditional generation tasks such as text-guided image synthesis. Given the success of DDPMs in 2D generation, they have more recently been applied to 3D shape generation, outperforming previous approaches and reaching state-of-the-art results. However, these existing 3D DDPM works make little or no use of guidance, mainly being unconditional or class-conditional. In this work, we present IC3D, an Image-Conditioned 3D Diffusion model that generates 3D shapes by image guidance. To guide our DDPM, we introduce CISP (Contrastive Image-Shape Pre-training), a model jointly embedding images and shapes by contrastive pre-training, inspired by the literature on text-to-image DDPMs. Our generative diffusion model outperforms the state-of-the-art in 3D generation quality and diversity. Furthermore, despite IC3D generative nature, we show that its generated shapes are preferred by human evaluators to a SoTA single-view 3D reconstruction model in terms of quality and coherence to the query image by running a side-by-side human evaluation. Ablation studies show the importance of CISP for learning structural integrity properties, crucial for realistic generation. Such biases yield a regular embedding space and allow for interpolation and conditioning on out-of-distribution images, while also making IC3D capable of generating coherent but diverse completions of occluded views and enabling its adoption in controlled real-life applications."
Learning to Generate Image Embeddings with User-level Differential Privacy,"Small on-device models have been successfully trained with user-level differential privacy (DP) for next word prediction and image classification tasks in the past. However, existing methods can fail when directly applied to learn embedding models using supervised training data with a large class space. To achieve user-level DP for large image-to-embedding feature extractors, we propose DP-FedEmb, a variant of federated learning algorithms with per-user sensitivity control and noise addition, to train from user-partitioned data centralized in the datacenter. DP-FedEmb combines virtual clients, partial aggregation, private local fine-tuning, and public pretraining to achieve strong privacy utility trade-offs. We apply DP-FedEmb to train image embedding models for faces, landmarks and natural species, and demonstrate its superior utility under same privacy budget on benchmark datasets DigiFace, EMNIST, GLD and iNaturalist. We further illustrate it is possible to achieve strong user-level DP guarantees of ε<4 while controlling the utility drop within 5%, when millions of users can participate in training."
Real-World Image Super Resolution via Unsupervised Bi-directional Cycle Domain Transfer Learning based Generative Adversarial Network,"Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) have exhibited impressive performance on image super-resolution tasks. However, these deep learning-based super-resolution methods perform poorly in real-world super-resolution tasks, where the paired high-resolution and low-resolution images are unavailable and the low-resolution images are degraded by complicated and unknown kernels. To break these limitations, we propose the Unsupervised Bi-directional Cycle Domain Transfer Learning-based Generative Adversarial Network (UBCDTL-GAN), which consists of an Unsupervised Bi-directional Cycle Domain Transfer Network (UBCDTN) and the Semantic Encoder guided Super Resolution Network (SESRN). First, the UBCDTN is able to produce an approximated real-like LR image through transferring the LR image from an artificially degraded domain to the real-world LR image domain. Second, the SESRN has the ability to super-resolve the approximated real-like LR image to a photo-realistic HR image. Extensive experiments on unpaired real-world image benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods."
DGD-cGAN: A Dual Generator for Image Dewatering and Restoration,"Underwater images are usually covered with a blue-greenish colour cast, making them distorted, blurry or low in contrast. This phenomenon occurs due to the light attenuation given by the scattering and absorption in the water column. In this paper, we present an image enhancement approach for dewatering which employs a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) with two generators. Our Dual Generator Dewatering cGAN (DGD-cGAN) removes the haze and colour cast induced by the water column and restores the true colours of underwater scenes whereby the effects of various attenuation and scattering phenomena that occur in underwater images are tackled by the two generators. The first generator takes at input the underwater image and predicts the dewatered scene, while the second generator learns the underwater image formation process by implementing a custom loss function based upon the transmission and the veiling light components of the image formation model. Our experiments show that DGD-cGAN consistently delivers a margin of improvement as compared with the state-of-the-art methods on several widely available datasets."
"RenderDiffusion: Image Diffusion for 3D Reconstruction, Inpainting and Generation","Diffusion models currently achieve state-of-the-art performance for both conditional and unconditional image generation. However, so far, image diffusion models do not support tasks required for 3D understanding, such as view-consistent 3D generation or single-view object reconstruction. In this paper, we present RenderDiffusion, the first diffusion model for 3D generation and inference, trained using only monocular 2D supervision. Central to our method is a novel image denoising architecture that generates and renders an intermediate three-dimensional representation of a scene in each denoising step. This enforces a strong inductive structure within the diffusion process, providing a 3D consistent representation while only requiring 2D supervision. The resulting 3D representation can be rendered from any view. We evaluate RenderDiffusion on FFHQ, AFHQ, ShapeNet and CLEVR datasets, showing competitive performance for generation of 3D scenes and inference of 3D scenes from 2D images. Additionally, our diffusion-based approach allows us to use 2D inpainting to edit 3D scenes."
A Survey on Evaluation Metrics for Synthetic Material Micro-Structure Images from Generative Models,"The evaluation of synthetic micro-structure images is an emerging problem as machine learning and materials science research have evolved together. Typical state of the art methods in evaluating synthetic images from generative models have relied on the Fréchet Inception Distance. However, this and other similar methods, are limited in the materials domain due to both the unique features that characterize physically accurate micro-structures and limited dataset sizes. In this study we evaluate a variety of methods on scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of graphene-reinforced polyurethane foams. The primary objective of this paper is to report our findings with regards to the shortcomings of existing methods so as to encourage the machine learning community to consider enhancements in metrics for assessing quality of synthetic images in the material science domain."
MAGE: MAsked Generative Encoder to Unify Representation Learning and Image Synthesis,"Generative modeling and representation learning are two key tasks in computer vision. However, these models are typically trained independently, which ignores the potential for each task to help the other, and leads to training and model maintenance overheads. In this work, we propose MAsked Generative Encoder (MAGE), the first framework to unify SOTA image generation and self-supervised representation learning. Our key insight is that using variable masking ratios in masked image modeling pre-training can allow generative training (very high masking ratio) and representation learning (lower masking ratio) under the same training framework. Inspired by previous generative models, MAGE uses semantic tokens learned by a vector-quantized GAN at inputs and outputs, combining this with masking. We can further improve the representation by adding a contrastive loss to the encoder output. We extensively evaluate the generation and representation learning capabilities of MAGE. On ImageNet-1K, a single MAGE ViT-L model obtains 9.10 FID in the task of class-unconditional image generation and 78.9% top-1 accuracy for linear probing, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both image generation and representation learning. Code is available at https://github.com/LTH14/mage."
A Creative Industry Image Generation Dataset Based on Captions,"Most image generation methods are difficult to precisely control the properties of the generated images, such as structure, scale, shape, etc., which limits its large-scale application in creative industries such as conceptual design and graphic design, and so on. Using the prompt and the sketch is a practical solution for controllability. Existing datasets lack either prompt or sketch and are not designed for the creative industry. Here is the main contribution of our work. a) This is the first dataset that covers the 4 most important areas of creative industry domains and is labeled with prompt and sketch. b) We provide multiple reference images in the test set and fine-grained scores for each reference which are useful for measurement. c) We apply two state-of-the-art models to our dataset and then find some shortcomings, such as the prompt is more highly valued than the sketch."
Cyclic Generative Adversarial Networks With Congruent Image-Report Generation For Explainable Medical Image Analysis,"We present a novel framework for explainable labeling and interpretation of medical images. Medical images require specialized professionals for interpretation, and are explained (typically) via elaborate textual reports. Different from prior methods that focus on medical report generation from images or vice-versa, we novelly generate congruent image--report pairs employing a cyclic-Generative Adversarial Network (cycleGAN); thereby, the generated report will adequately explain a medical image, while a report-generated image that effectively characterizes the text visually should (sufficiently) resemble the original. The aim of the work is to generate trustworthy and faithful explanations for the outputs of a model diagnosing chest x-ray images by pointing a human user to similar cases in support of a diagnostic decision. Apart from enabling transparent medical image labeling and interpretation, we achieve report and image-based labeling comparable to prior methods, including state-of-the-art performance in some cases as evidenced by experiments on the Indiana Chest X-ray dataset"
Extreme Generative Image Compression by Learning Text Embedding from Diffusion Models,"Transferring large amount of high resolution images over limited bandwidth is an important but very challenging task. Compressing images using extremely low bitrates (<0.1 bpp) has been studied but it often results in low quality images of heavy artifacts due to the strong constraint in the number of bits available for the compressed data. It is often said that a picture is worth a thousand words but on the other hand, language is very powerful in capturing the essence of an image using short descriptions. With the recent success of diffusion models for text-to-image generation, we propose a generative image compression method that demonstrates the potential of saving an image as a short text embedding which in turn can be used to generate high-fidelity images which is equivalent to the original one perceptually. For a given image, its corresponding text embedding is learned using the same optimization process as the text-to-image diffusion model itself, using a learnable text embedding as input after bypassing the original transformer. The optimization is applied together with a learning compression model to achieve extreme compression of low bitrates <0.1 bpp. Based on our experiments measured by a comprehensive set of image quality metrics, our method outperforms the other state-of-the-art deep learning methods in terms of both perceptual quality and diversity."
Arbitrary Style Guidance for Enhanced Diffusion-Based Text-to-Image Generation,"Diffusion-based text-to-image generation models like GLIDE and DALLE-2 have gained wide success recently for their superior performance in turning complex text inputs into images of high quality and wide diversity. In particular, they are proven to be very powerful in creating graphic arts of various formats and styles. Although current models supported specifying style formats like oil painting or pencil drawing, fine-grained style features like color distributions and brush strokes are hard to specify as they are randomly picked from a conditional distribution based on the given text input. Here we propose a novel style guidance method to support generating images using arbitrary style guided by a reference image. The generation method does not require a separate style transfer model to generate desired styles while maintaining image quality in generated content as controlled by the text input. Additionally, the guidance method can be applied without a style reference, denoted as self style guidance, to generate images of more diverse styles. Comprehensive experiments prove that the proposed method remains robust and effective in a wide range of conditions, including diverse graphic art forms, image content types and diffusion models."
Multi-VQG: Generating Engaging Questions for Multiple Images,"Generating engaging content has drawn much recent attention in the NLP community. Asking questions is a natural way to respond to photos and promote awareness. However, most answers to questions in traditional question-answering (QA) datasets are factoids, which reduce individuals' willingness to answer. Furthermore, traditional visual question generation (VQG) confines the source data for question generation to single images, resulting in a limited ability to comprehend time-series information of the underlying event. In this paper, we propose generating engaging questions from multiple images. We present MVQG, a new dataset, and establish a series of baselines, including both end-to-end and dual-stage architectures. Results show that building stories behind the image sequence enables models to generate engaging questions, which confirms our assumption that people typically construct a picture of the event in their minds before asking questions. These results open up an exciting challenge for visual-and-language models to implicitly construct a story behind a series of photos to allow for creativity and experience sharing and hence draw attention to downstream applications."
Towards Generalization on Real Domain for Single Image Dehazing via Meta-Learning,"Learning-based image dehazing methods are essential to assist autonomous systems in enhancing reliability. Due to the domain gap between synthetic and real domains, the internal information learned from synthesized images is usually sub-optimal in real domains, leading to severe performance drop of dehaizing models. Driven by the ability on exploring internal information from a few unseen-domain samples, meta-learning is commonly adopted to address this issue via test-time training, which is hyperparameter-sensitive and time-consuming. In contrast, we present a domain generalization framework based on meta-learning to dig out representative and discriminative internal properties of real hazy domains without test-time training. To obtain representative domain-specific information, we attach two entities termed adaptation network and distance-aware aggregator to our dehazing network. The adaptation network assists in distilling domain-relevant information from a few hazy samples and caching it into a collection of features. The distance-aware aggregator strives to summarize the generated features and filter out misleading information for more representative internal properties. To enhance the discrimination of distilled internal information, we present a novel loss function called domain-relevant contrastive regularization, which encourages the internal features generated from the same domain more similar and that from diverse domains more distinct. The generated representative and discriminative features are regarded as some external variables of our dehazing network to regress a particular and powerful function for a given domain. The extensive experiments on real hazy datasets, such as RTTS and URHI, validate that our proposed method has superior generalization ability than the state-of-the-art competitors."
HumanDiffusion: a Coarse-to-Fine Alignment Diffusion Framework for Controllable Text-Driven Person Image Generation,"Text-driven person image generation is an emerging and challenging task in cross-modality image generation. Controllable person image generation promotes a wide range of applications such as digital human interaction and virtual try-on. However, previous methods mostly employ single-modality information as the prior condition (e.g. pose-guided person image generation), or utilize the preset words for text-driven human synthesis. Introducing a sentence composed of free words with an editable semantic pose map to describe person appearance is a more user-friendly way. In this paper, we propose HumanDiffusion, a coarse-to-fine alignment diffusion framework, for text-driven person image generation. Specifically, two collaborative modules are proposed, the Stylized Memory Retrieval (SMR) module for fine-grained feature distillation in data processing and the Multi-scale Cross-modality Alignment (MCA) module for coarse-to-fine feature alignment in diffusion. These two modules guarantee the alignment quality of the text and image, from image-level to feature-level, from low-resolution to high-resolution. As a result, HumanDiffusion realizes open-vocabulary person image generation with desired semantic poses. Extensive experiments conducted on DeepFashion demonstrate the superiority of our method compared with previous approaches. Moreover, better results could be obtained for complicated person images with various details and uncommon poses."
SETGen: Scalable and Efficient Template Generation Framework for Groupwise Medical Image Registration,"Template generation is a crucial step of groupwise image registration which deforms a group of subjects into a common space. Existing traditional and deep learning-based methods can generate high-quality template images. However, they suffer from substantial time costs or limited application scenarios like fixed group size. In this paper, we propose an efficient groupwise template generative framework based on variational autoencoder models utilizing the arithmetic property of latent representation of input images. We acquire the latent vectors of each input and use the average vector to construct the template through the decoder. Therefore, the method can be applied to groups of any scale. Secondly, we explore a siamese training scheme that feeds two images to the shared-weight twin networks and compares the distances between inputs and the generated template to prompt the template to be close to the implicit center. We conduct experiments on 3D brain MRI scans of groups of different sizes. Results show that our framework can achieve comparable and even better performance to baselines, with runtime decreased to seconds."
Generating Clear Images From Images With Distortions Caused by Adverse Weather Using Generative Adversarial Networks,"We presented a method for improving computer vision tasks on images affected by adverse weather conditions, including distortions caused by adherent raindrops. Overcoming the challenge of applying computer vision to images affected by adverse weather conditions is essential for autonomous vehicles utilizing RGB cameras. For this purpose, we trained an appropriate generative adversarial network and showed that it was effective at removing the effect of the distortions, in the context of image reconstruction and computer vision tasks. We showed that object recognition, a vital task for autonomous driving vehicles, is completely impaired by the distortions and occlusions caused by adherent raindrops and that performance can be restored by our de-raining model. The approach described in this paper could be applied to all adverse weather conditions."
Easily Accessible Text-to-Image Generation Amplifies Demographic Stereotypes at Large Scale,"Machine learning models are now able to convert user-written text descriptions into naturalistic images. These models are available to anyone online and are being used to generate millions of images a day. We investigate these models and find that they amplify dangerous and complex stereotypes. Moreover, we find that the amplified stereotypes are difficult to predict and not easily mitigated by users or model owners. The extent to which these image-generation models perpetuate and amplify stereotypes and their mass deployment is cause for serious concern."
Underwater Image Super-Resolution using Generative Adversarial Network-based Model,"Single image super-resolution (SISR) methods can enhance the resolution and quality of underwater images. Enhancing the resolution of underwater images leads to better performance of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). In this work, we fine-tune the Real-Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (Real-ESRGAN) model to increase the resolution of underwater images. In our proposed approach, the pre-trained generator and discriminator networks of the Real-ESRGAN model are fine-tuned using underwater image datasets. We used USR-248 and UFO-120 datasets to fine-tune the Real-ESRGAN model. Our fine-tuned model produces images with better resolution and quality compared to the original model."
Black-Box Attack against GAN-Generated Image Detector with Contrastive Perturbation,"Visually realistic GAN-generated facial images raise obvious concerns on potential misuse. Many effective forensic algorithms have been developed to detect such synthetic images in recent years. It is significant to assess the vulnerability of such forensic detectors against adversarial attacks. In this paper, we propose a new black-box attack method against GAN-generated image detectors. A novel contrastive learning strategy is adopted to train the encoder-decoder network based anti-forensic model under a contrastive loss function. GAN images and their simulated real counterparts are constructed as positive and negative samples, respectively. Leveraging on the trained attack model, imperceptible contrastive perturbation could be applied to input synthetic images for removing GAN fingerprint to some extent. As such, existing GAN-generated image detectors are expected to be deceived. Extensive experimental results verify that the proposed attack effectively reduces the accuracy of three state-of-the-art detectors on six popular GANs. High visual quality of the attacked images is also achieved. The source code will be available at https://github.com/ZXMMD/BAttGAND."
Medical Diffusion: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models for 3D Medical Image Generation,"Recent advances in computer vision have shown promising results in image generation. Diffusion probabilistic models in particular have generated realistic images from textual input, as demonstrated by DALL-E 2, Imagen and Stable Diffusion. However, their use in medicine, where image data typically comprises three-dimensional volumes, has not been systematically evaluated. Synthetic images may play a crucial role in privacy preserving artificial intelligence and can also be used to augment small datasets. Here we show that diffusion probabilistic models can synthesize high quality medical imaging data, which we show for Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) and Computed Tomography (CT) images. We provide quantitative measurements of their performance through a reader study with two medical experts who rated the quality of the synthesized images in three categories: Realistic image appearance, anatomical correctness and consistency between slices. Furthermore, we demonstrate that synthetic images can be used in a self-supervised pre-training and improve the performance of breast segmentation models when data is scarce (dice score 0.91 vs. 0.95 without vs. with synthetic data). The code is publicly available on GitHub: https://github.com/FirasGit/medicaldiffusion."
Few-shot Image Generation with Diffusion Models,"Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have been proven capable of synthesizing high-quality images with remarkable diversity when trained on large amounts of data. However, to our knowledge, few-shot image generation tasks have yet to be studied with DDPM-based approaches. Modern approaches are mainly built on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and adapt models pre-trained on large source domains to target domains using a few available samples. In this paper, we make the first attempt to study when do DDPMs overfit and suffer severe diversity degradation as training data become scarce. Then we fine-tune DDPMs pre-trained on large source domains to solve the overfitting problem when training data is limited. Although the directly fine-tuned models accelerate convergence and improve generation quality and diversity compared with training from scratch, they still fail to retain some diverse features and can only produce coarse images. Therefore, we design a DDPM pairwise adaptation (DDPM-PA) approach to optimize few-shot DDPM domain adaptation. DDPM-PA efficiently preserves information learned from source domains by keeping the relative pairwise distances between generated samples during adaptation. Besides, DDPM-PA enhances the learning of high-frequency details from source models and limited training data. DDPM-PA further improves generation quality and diversity and achieves results better than current state-of-the-art GAN-based approaches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a series of few-shot image generation tasks qualitatively and quantitatively."
I Hear Your True Colors: Image Guided Audio Generation,"We propose Im2Wav, an image guided open-domain audio generation system. Given an input image or a sequence of images, Im2Wav generates a semantically relevant sound. Im2Wav is based on two Transformer language models, that operate over a hierarchical discrete audio representation obtained from a VQ-VAE based model. We first produce a low-level audio representation using a language model. Then, we upsample the audio tokens using an additional language model to generate a high-fidelity audio sample. We use the rich semantics of a pre-trained CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) embedding as a visual representation to condition the language model. In addition, to steer the generation process towards the conditioning image, we apply the classifier-free guidance method. Results suggest that Im2Wav significantly outperforms the evaluated baselines in both fidelity and relevance evaluation metrics. Additionally, we provide an ablation study to better assess the impact of each of the method components on overall performance. Lastly, to better evaluate image-to-audio models, we propose an out-of-domain image dataset, denoted as ImageHear. ImageHear can be used as a benchmark for evaluating future image-to-audio models. Samples and code can be found inside the manuscript."
Analysing the effectiveness of a generative model for semi-supervised medical image segmentation,"Image segmentation is important in medical imaging, providing valuable, quantitative information for clinical decision-making in diagnosis, therapy, and intervention. The state-of-the-art in automated segmentation remains supervised learning, employing discriminative models such as U-Net. However, training these models requires access to large amounts of manually labelled data which is often difficult to obtain in real medical applications. In such settings, semi-supervised learning (SSL) attempts to leverage the abundance of unlabelled data to obtain more robust and reliable models. Recently, generative models have been proposed for semantic segmentation, as they make an attractive choice for SSL. Their ability to capture the joint distribution over input images and output label maps provides a natural way to incorporate information from unlabelled images. This paper analyses whether deep generative models such as the SemanticGAN are truly viable alternatives to tackle challenging medical image segmentation problems. To that end, we thoroughly evaluate the segmentation performance, robustness, and potential subgroup disparities of discriminative and generative segmentation methods when applied to large-scale, publicly available chest X-ray datasets."
Evaluating a Synthetic Image Dataset Generated with Stable Diffusion,"We generate synthetic images with the ""Stable Diffusion"" image generation model using the Wordnet taxonomy and the definitions of concepts it contains. This synthetic image database can be used as training data for data augmentation in machine learning applications, and it is used to investigate the capabilities of the Stable Diffusion model.  Analyses show that Stable Diffusion can produce correct images for a large number of concepts, but also a large variety of different representations. The results show differences depending on the test concepts considered and problems with very specific concepts. These evaluations were performed using a vision transformer model for image classification."
Spot the fake lungs: Generating Synthetic Medical Images using Neural Diffusion Models,"Generative models are becoming popular for the synthesis of medical images. Recently, neural diffusion models have demonstrated the potential to generate photo-realistic images of objects. However, their potential to generate medical images is not explored yet. In this work, we explore the possibilities of synthesis of medical images using neural diffusion models. First, we use a pre-trained DALLE2 model to generate lungs X-Ray and CT images from an input text prompt. Second, we train a stable diffusion model with 3165 X-Ray images and generate synthetic images. We evaluate the synthetic image data through a qualitative analysis where two independent radiologists label randomly chosen samples from the generated data as real, fake, or unsure. Results demonstrate that images generated with the diffusion model can translate characteristics that are otherwise very specific to certain medical conditions in chest X-Ray or CT images. Careful tuning of the model can be very promising. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to generate lungs X-Ray and CT images using neural diffusion models. This work aims to introduce a new dimension in artificial intelligence for medical imaging. Given that this is a new topic, the paper will serve as an introduction and motivation for the research community to explore the potential of diffusion models for medical image synthesis. We have released the synthetic images on https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hazrat/awesomelungs."
On the detection of synthetic images generated by diffusion models,"Over the past decade, there has been tremendous progress in creating synthetic media, mainly thanks to the development of powerful methods based on generative adversarial networks (GAN). Very recently, methods based on diffusion models (DM) have been gaining the spotlight. In addition to providing an impressive level of photorealism, they enable the creation of text-based visual content, opening up new and exciting opportunities in many different application fields, from arts to video games. On the other hand, this property is an additional asset in the hands of malicious users, who can generate and distribute fake media perfectly adapted to their attacks, posing new challenges to the media forensic community. With this work, we seek to understand how difficult it is to distinguish synthetic images generated by diffusion models from pristine ones and whether current state-of-the-art detectors are suitable for the task. To this end, first we expose the forensics traces left by diffusion models, then study how current detectors, developed for GAN-generated images, perform on these new synthetic images, especially in challenging social-networks scenarios involving image compression and resizing. Datasets and code are available at github.com/grip-unina/DMimageDetection."
Fine-tuned Generative Adversarial Network-based Model for Medical Images Super-Resolution,"In medical image analysis, low-resolution images negatively affect the performance of medical image interpretation and may cause misdiagnosis. Single image super-resolution (SISR) methods can improve the resolution and quality of medical images. Currently, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) based super-resolution models have shown very good performance. Real-Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (Real-ESRGAN) is one of the practical GAN-based models which is widely used in the field of general image super-resolution. One of the challenges in the field of medical image super-resolution is that, unlike natural images, medical images do not have high spatial resolution. To solve this problem, we can use transfer learning technique and fine-tune the model that has been trained on external datasets (often natural datasets). In our proposed approach, the pre-trained generator and discriminator networks of the Real-ESRGAN model are fine-tuned using medical image datasets. In this paper, we worked on chest X-ray and retinal images and used the STARE dataset of retinal images and Tuberculosis Chest X-rays (Shenzhen) dataset for fine-tuning. The proposed model produces more accurate and natural textures, and its outputs have better details and resolution compared to the original Real-ESRGAN outputs."
Synthetic ID Card Image Generation for Improving Presentation Attack Detection,"Currently, it is ever more common to access online services for activities which formerly required physical attendance. From banking operations to visa applications, a significant number of processes have been digitised, especially since the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, requiring remote biometric authentication of the user. On the downside, some subjects intend to interfere with the normal operation of remote systems for personal profit by using fake identity documents, such as passports and ID cards. Deep learning solutions to detect such frauds have been presented in the literature. However, due to privacy concerns and the sensitive nature of personal identity documents, developing a dataset with the necessary number of examples for training deep neural networks is challenging. This work explores three methods for synthetically generating ID card images to increase the amount of data while training fraud-detection networks. These methods include computer vision algorithms and Generative Adversarial Networks. Our results indicate that databases can be supplemented with synthetic images without any loss in performance for the print/scan Presentation Attack Instrument Species (PAIS) and a loss in performance of 1% for the screen capture PAIS."
Rethinking Generalization: The Impact of Annotation Style on Medical Image Segmentation,"Generalization is an important attribute of machine learning models, particularly for those that are to be deployed in a medical context, where unreliable predictions can have real world consequences. While the failure of models to generalize across datasets is typically attributed to a mismatch in the data distributions, performance gaps are often a consequence of biases in the 'ground-truth' label annotations. This is particularly important in the context of medical image segmentation of pathological structures (e.g. lesions), where the annotation process is much more subjective, and affected by a number underlying factors, including the annotation protocol, rater education/experience, and clinical aims, among others. In this paper, we show that modeling annotation biases, rather than ignoring them, poses a promising way of accounting for differences in annotation style across datasets. To this end, we propose a generalized conditioning framework to (1) learn and account for different annotation styles across multiple datasets using a single model, (2) identify similar annotation styles across different datasets in order to permit their effective aggregation, and (3) fine-tune a fully trained model to a new annotation style with just a few samples. Next, we present an image-conditioning approach to model annotation styles that correlate with specific image features, potentially enabling detection biases to be more easily identified."
Improving Multi-generation Robustness of Learned Image Compression,"Benefit from flexible network designs and end-to-end joint optimization approach, learned image compression (LIC) has demonstrated excellent coding performance and practical feasibility in recent years. However, existing compression models suffer from serious multi-generation loss, which always occurs during image editing and transcoding. During the process of repeatedly encoding and decoding, the quality of the image will rapidly degrade, resulting in various types of distortion, which significantly limits the practical application of LIC. In this paper, a thorough analysis is carried out to determine the source of generative loss in successive image compression (SIC). We point out and solve the quantization drift problem that affects SIC, reversibility loss function as well as channel relaxation method are proposed to further reduce the generation loss. Experiments show that by using our proposed solutions, LIC can achieve comparable performance to the first compression of BPG even after 50 times reencoding without any change of the network structure."
Image-free Domain Generalization via CLIP for 3D Hand Pose Estimation,"RGB-based 3D hand pose estimation has been successful for decades thanks to large-scale databases and deep learning. However, the hand pose estimation network does not operate well for hand pose images whose characteristics are far different from the training data. This is caused by various factors such as illuminations, camera angles, diverse backgrounds in the input images, etc. Many existing methods tried to solve it by supplying additional large-scale unconstrained/target domain images to augment data space; however collecting such large-scale images takes a lot of labors. In this paper, we present a simple image-free domain generalization approach for the hand pose estimation framework that uses only source domain data. We try to manipulate the image features of the hand pose estimation network by adding the features from text descriptions using the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) model. The manipulated image features are then exploited to train the hand pose estimation network via the contrastive learning framework. In experiments with STB and RHD datasets, our algorithm shows improved performance over the state-of-the-art domain generalization approaches."
Few-shot Image Generation via Adaptation-Aware Kernel Modulation,"Few-shot image generation (FSIG) aims to learn to generate new and diverse samples given an extremely limited number of samples from a domain, e.g., 10 training samples. Recent work has addressed the problem using transfer learning approach, leveraging a GAN pretrained on a large-scale source domain dataset and adapting that model to the target domain based on very limited target domain samples. Central to recent FSIG methods are knowledge preserving criteria, which aim to select a subset of source model's knowledge to be preserved into the adapted model. However, a major limitation of existing methods is that their knowledge preserving criteria consider only source domain/source task, and they fail to consider target domain/adaptation task in selecting source model's knowledge, casting doubt on their suitability for setups of different proximity between source and target domain. Our work makes two contributions. As our first contribution, we re-visit recent FSIG works and their experiments. Our important finding is that, under setups which assumption of close proximity between source and target domains is relaxed, existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods which consider only source domain/source task in knowledge preserving perform no better than a baseline fine-tuning method. To address the limitation of existing methods, as our second contribution, we propose Adaptation-Aware kernel Modulation (AdAM) to address general FSIG of different source-target domain proximity. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method consistently achieves SOTA performance across source/target domains of different proximity, including challenging setups when source and target domains are more apart.

UPainting: Unified Text-to-Image Diffusion Generation with Cross-modal Guidance,"Diffusion generative models have recently greatly improved the power of text-conditioned image generation. Existing image generation models mainly include text conditional diffusion model and cross-modal guided diffusion model, which are good at small scene image generation and complex scene image generation respectively. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective approach, namely UPainting, to unify simple and complex scene image generation, as shown in Figure 1. Based on architecture improvements and diverse guidance schedules, UPainting effectively integrates cross-modal guidance from a pretrained image-text matching model into a text conditional diffusion model that utilizes a pretrained Transformer language model as the text encoder. Our key findings is that combining the power of large-scale Transformer language model in understanding language and image-text matching model in capturing cross-modal semantics and style, is effective to improve sample fidelity and image-text alignment of image generation. In this way, UPainting has a more general image generation capability, which can generate images of both simple and complex scenes more effectively. To comprehensively compare text-to-image models, we further create a more general benchmark, UniBench, with well-written Chinese and English prompts in both simple and complex scenes. We compare UPainting with recent models and find that UPainting greatly outperforms other models in terms of caption similarity and image fidelity in both simple and complex scenes.

Single-Image HDR Reconstruction by Multi-Exposure Generation,"High dynamic range (HDR) imaging is an indispensable technique in modern photography. Traditional methods focus on HDR reconstruction from multiple images, solving the core problems of image alignment, fusion, and tone mapping, yet having a perfect solution due to ghosting and other visual artifacts in the reconstruction. Recent attempts at single-image HDR reconstruction show a promising alternative: by learning to map pixel values to their irradiance using a neural network, one can bypass the align-and-merge pipeline completely yet still obtain a high-quality HDR image. In this work, we propose a weakly supervised learning method that inverts the physical image formation process for HDR reconstruction via learning to generate multiple exposures from a single image. Our neural network can invert the camera response to reconstruct pixel irradiance before synthesizing multiple exposures and hallucinating details in under- and over-exposed regions from a single input image. To train the network, we propose a representation loss, a reconstruction loss, and a perceptual loss applied on pairs of under- and over-exposure images and thus do not require HDR images for training. Our experiments show that our proposed model can effectively reconstruct HDR images. Our qualitative and quantitative results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DrTMO dataset. Our code is available at https://github.com/VinAIResearch/single_image_hdr."
SSD: Towards Better Text-Image Consistency Metric in Text-to-Image Generation,"Generating consistent and high-quality images from given texts is essential for visual-language understanding. Although impressive results have been achieved in generating high-quality images, text-image consistency is still a major concern in existing GAN-based methods. Particularly, the most popular metric R-precision may not accurately reflect the text-image consistency, often resulting in very misleading semantics in the generated images. Albeit its significance, how to design a better text-image consistency metric surprisingly remains under-explored in the community. In this paper, we make a further step forward to develop a novel CLIP-based metric termed as Semantic Similarity Distance (SSD), which is both theoretically founded from a distributional viewpoint and empirically verified on benchmark datasets. Benefiting from the proposed metric, we further design the Parallel Deep Fusion Generative Adversarial Networks (PDF-GAN) that aims at improving text-image consistency by fusing semantic information at different granularities and capturing accurate semantics. Equipped with two novel plug-and-play components: Hard-Negative Sentence Constructor and Semantic Projection, the proposed PDF-GAN can mitigate inconsistent semantics and bridge the text-image semantic gap. A series of experiments show that, as opposed to current state-of-the-art methods, our PDF-GAN can lead to significantly better text-image consistency while maintaining decent image quality on the CUB and COCO datasets."
How well can Text-to-Image Generative Models understand Ethical Natural Language Interventions?,"Text-to-image generative models have achieved unprecedented success in generating high-quality images based on natural language descriptions. However, it is shown that these models tend to favor specific social groups when prompted with neutral text descriptions (e.g., 'a photo of a lawyer'). Following Zhao et al. (2021), we study the effect on the diversity of the generated images when adding ethical intervention that supports equitable judgment (e.g., 'if all individuals can be a lawyer irrespective of their gender') in the input prompts. To this end, we introduce an Ethical NaTural Language Interventions in Text-to-Image GENeration (ENTIGEN) benchmark dataset to evaluate the change in image generations conditional on ethical interventions across three social axes -- gender, skin color, and culture. Through ENTIGEN framework, we find that the generations from minDALL.E, DALL.E-mini and Stable Diffusion cover diverse social groups while preserving the image quality. Preliminary studies indicate that a large change in the model predictions is triggered by certain phrases such as 'irrespective of gender' in the context of gender bias in the ethical interventions. We release code and annotated data at https://github.com/Hritikbansal/entigen_emnlp."
Few-shot Image Generation via Masked Discrimination,"Few-shot image generation aims to generate images of high quality and great diversity with limited data. However, it is difficult for modern GANs to avoid overfitting when trained on only a few images. The discriminator can easily remember all the training samples and guide the generator to replicate them, leading to severe diversity degradation. Several methods have been proposed to relieve overfitting by adapting GANs pre-trained on large source domains to target domains using limited real samples. This work presents a novel approach to realize few-shot GAN adaptation via masked discrimination. Random masks are applied to features extracted by the discriminator from input images. We aim to encourage the discriminator to judge various images which share partially common features with training samples as realistic. Correspondingly, the generator is guided to generate diverse images instead of replicating training samples. In addition, we employ a cross-domain consistency loss for the discriminator to keep relative distances between generated samples in its feature space. It strengthens global image discrimination and guides adapted GANs to preserve more information learned from source domains for higher image quality. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated both qualitatively and quantitatively with higher quality and greater diversity on a series of few-shot image generation tasks than prior methods."
DiffusionDB: A Large-scale Prompt Gallery Dataset for Text-to-Image Generative Models,"With recent advancements in diffusion models, users can generate high-quality images by writing text prompts in natural language. However, generating images with desired details requires proper prompts, and it is often unclear how a model reacts to different prompts or what the best prompts are. To help researchers tackle these critical challenges, we introduce DiffusionDB, the first large-scale text-to-image prompt dataset totaling 6.5TB, containing 14 million images generated by Stable Diffusion, 1.8 million unique prompts, and hyperparameters specified by real users. We analyze the syntactic and semantic characteristics of prompts. We pinpoint specific hyperparameter values and prompt styles that can lead to model errors and present evidence of potentially harmful model usage, such as the generation of misinformation. The unprecedented scale and diversity of this human-actuated dataset provide exciting research opportunities in understanding the interplay between prompts and generative models, detecting deepfakes, and designing human-AI interaction tools to help users more easily use these models. DiffusionDB is publicly available at: https://poloclub.github.io/diffusiondb."
NAS-PRNet: Neural Architecture Search generated Phase Retrieval Net for Off-axis Quantitative Phase Imaging,"Single neural networks have achieved simultaneous phase retrieval with aberration compensation and phase unwrapping in off-axis Quantitative Phase Imaging (QPI). However, when designing the phase retrieval neural network architecture, the trade-off between computation latency and accuracy has been largely neglected. Here, we propose Neural Architecture Search (NAS) generated Phase Retrieval Net (NAS-PRNet), which is an encoder-decoder style neural network, automatically found from a large neural network architecture search space. The NAS scheme in NAS-PRNet is modified from SparseMask, in which the learning of skip connections between the encoder and the decoder is formulated as a differentiable NAS problem, and the gradient decent is applied to efficiently search the optimal skip connections. Using MobileNet-v2 as the encoder and a synthesized loss that incorporates phase reconstruction and network sparsity losses, NAS-PRNet has realized fast and accurate phase retrieval of biological cells. When tested on a cell dataset, NAS-PRNet has achieved a Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 36.1 dB, outperforming the widely used U-Net and original SparseMask-generated neural network. Notably, the computation latency of NAS-PRNet is only 31 ms which is 12 times less than U-Net. Moreover, the connectivity scheme in NAS-PRNet, identified from one off-axis QPI system, can be well fitted to another with different fringe patterns."
Lafite2: Few-shot Text-to-Image Generation,"Text-to-image generation models have progressed considerably in recent years, which can now generate impressive realistic images from arbitrary text. Most of such models are trained on web-scale image-text paired datasets, which may not be affordable for many researchers. In this paper, we propose a novel method for pre-training text-to-image generation model on image-only datasets. It considers a retrieval-then-optimization procedure to synthesize pseudo text features: for a given image, relevant pseudo text features are first retrieved, then optimized for better alignment. The low requirement of the proposed method yields high flexibility and usability: it can be beneficial to a wide range of settings, including the few-shot, semi-supervised and fully-supervised learning; it can be applied on different models including generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models. Extensive experiments illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. On MS-COCO dataset, our GAN model obtains Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) of 6.78 which is the new state-of-the-art (SoTA) of GANs under fully-supervised setting. Our diffusion model obtains FID of 8.42 and 4.28 on zero-shot and supervised setting respectively, which are competitive to SoTA diffusion models with a much smaller model size."
Generative Range Imaging for Learning Scene Priors of 3D LiDAR Data,"3D LiDAR sensors are indispensable for the robust vision of autonomous mobile robots. However, deploying LiDAR-based perception algorithms often fails due to a domain gap from the training environment, such as inconsistent angular resolution and missing properties. Existing studies have tackled the issue by learning inter-domain mapping, while the transferability is constrained by the training configuration and the training is susceptible to peculiar lossy noises called ray-drop. To address the issue, this paper proposes a generative model of LiDAR range images applicable to the data-level domain transfer. Motivated by the fact that LiDAR measurement is based on point-by-point range imaging, we train an implicit image representation-based generative adversarial networks along with a differentiable ray-drop effect. We demonstrate the fidelity and diversity of our model in comparison with the point-based and image-based state-of-the-art generative models. We also showcase upsampling and restoration applications. Furthermore, we introduce a Sim2Real application for LiDAR semantic segmentation. We demonstrate that our method is effective as a realistic ray-drop simulator and outperforms state-of-the-art methods."
G2NetPL: Generic Game-Theoretic Network for Partial-Label Image Classification,"Multi-label image classification aims to predict all possible labels in an image. It is usually formulated as a partial-label learning problem, since it could be expensive in practice to annotate all the labels in every training image. Existing works on partial-label learning focus on the case where each training image is labeled with only a subset of its positive/negative labels. To effectively address partial-label classification, this paper proposes an end-to-end Generic Game-theoretic Network (G2NetPL) for partial-label learning, which can be applied to most partial-label settings, including a very challenging, but annotation-efficient case where only a subset of the training images are labeled, each with only one positive label, while the rest of the training images remain unlabeled. In G2NetPL, each unobserved label is associated with a soft pseudo label, which, together with the network, formulates a two-player non-zero-sum non-cooperative game. The objective of the network is to minimize the loss function with given pseudo labels, while the pseudo labels will seek convergence to 1 (positive) or 0 (negative) with a penalty of deviating from the predicted labels determined by the network. In addition, we introduce a confidence-aware scheduler into the loss of the network to adaptively perform easy-to-hard learning for different labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed G2NetPL outperforms many state-of-the-art multi-label classification methods under various partial-label settings on three different datasets."
Image Semantic Relation Generation,"Scene graphs provide structured semantic understanding beyond images. For downstream tasks, such as image retrieval, visual question answering, visual relationship detection, and even autonomous vehicle technology, scene graphs can not only distil complex image information but also correct the bias of visual models using semantic-level relations, which has broad application prospects. However, the heavy labour cost of constructing graph annotations may hinder the application of PSG in practical scenarios. Inspired by the observation that people usually identify the subject and object first and then determine the relationship between them, we proposed to decouple the scene graphs generation task into two sub-tasks: 1) an image segmentation task to pick up the qualified objects. 2) a restricted auto-regressive text generation task to generate the relation between given objects. Therefore, in this work, we introduce image semantic relation generation (ISRG), a simple but effective image-to-text model, which achieved 31 points on the OpenPSG dataset and outperforms strong baselines respectively by 16 points (ResNet-50) and 5 points (CLIP)."
OCR-VQGAN: Taming Text-within-Image Generation,"Synthetic image generation has recently experienced significant improvements in domains such as natural image or art generation. However, the problem of figure and diagram generation remains unexplored. A challenging aspect of generating figures and diagrams is effectively rendering readable texts within the images. To alleviate this problem, we present OCR-VQGAN, an image encoder, and decoder that leverages OCR pre-trained features to optimize a text perceptual loss, encouraging the architecture to preserve high-fidelity text and diagram structure. To explore our approach, we introduce the Paper2Fig100k dataset, with over 100k images of figures and texts from research papers. The figures show architecture diagrams and methodologies of articles available at arXiv.org from fields like artificial intelligence and computer vision. Figures usually include text and discrete objects, e.g., boxes in a diagram, with lines and arrows that connect them. We demonstrate the effectiveness of OCR-VQGAN by conducting several experiments on the task of figure reconstruction. Additionally, we explore the qualitative and quantitative impact of weighting different perceptual metrics in the overall loss function. We release code, models, and dataset at https://github.com/joanrod/ocr-vqgan."
PalGAN: Image Colorization with Palette Generative Adversarial Networks,"Multimodal ambiguity and color bleeding remain challenging in colorization. To tackle these problems, we propose a new GAN-based colorization approach PalGAN, integrated with palette estimation and chromatic attention. To circumvent the multimodality issue, we present a new colorization formulation that estimates a probabilistic palette from the input gray image first, then conducts color assignment conditioned on the palette through a generative model. Further, we handle color bleeding with chromatic attention. It studies color affinities by considering both semantic and intensity correlation. In extensive experiments, PalGAN outperforms state-of-the-arts in quantitative evaluation and visual comparison, delivering notable diverse, contrastive, and edge-preserving appearances. With the palette design, our method enables color transfer between images even with irrelevant contexts."
General Image Descriptors for Open World Image Retrieval using ViT CLIP,"The Google Universal Image Embedding (GUIE) Challenge is one of the first competitions in multi-domain image representations in the wild, covering a wide distribution of objects: landmarks, artwork, food, etc. This is a fundamental computer vision problem with notable applications in image retrieval, search engines and e-commerce. In this work, we explain our 4th place solution to the GUIE Challenge, and our ""bag of tricks"" to fine-tune zero-shot Vision Transformers (ViT) pre-trained using CLIP."
Visual Spatial Description: Controlled Spatial-Oriented Image-to-Text Generation,"Image-to-text tasks, such as open-ended image captioning and controllable image description, have received extensive attention for decades. Here, we further advance this line of work by presenting Visual Spatial Description (VSD), a new perspective for image-to-text toward spatial semantics. Given an image and two objects inside it, VSD aims to produce one description focusing on the spatial perspective between the two objects. Accordingly, we manually annotate a dataset to facilitate the investigation of the newly-introduced task and build several benchmark encoder-decoder models by using VL-BART and VL-T5 as backbones. In addition, we investigate pipeline and joint end-to-end architectures for incorporating visual spatial relationship classification (VSRC) information into our model. Finally, we conduct experiments on our benchmark dataset to evaluate all our models. Results show that our models are impressive, providing accurate and human-like spatial-oriented text descriptions. Meanwhile, VSRC has great potential for VSD, and the joint end-to-end architecture is the better choice for their integration. We make the dataset and codes public for research purposes."
An Attention-Guided and Wavelet-Constrained Generative Adversarial Network for Infrared and Visible Image Fusion,"The GAN-based infrared and visible image fusion methods have gained ever-increasing attention due to its effectiveness and superiority. However, the existing methods adopt the global pixel distribution of source images as the basis for discrimination, which fails to focus on the key modality information. Moreover, the dual-discriminator based methods suffer from the confrontation between the discriminators. To this end, we propose an attention-guided and wavelet-constrained GAN for infrared and visible image fusion (AWFGAN). In this method, two unique discrimination strategies are designed to improve the fusion performance. Specifically, we introduce the spatial attention modules (SAM) into the generator to obtain the spatial attention maps, and then the attention maps are utilized to force the discrimination of infrared images to focus on the target regions. In addition, we extend the discrimination range of visible information to the wavelet subspace, which can force the generator to restore the high-frequency details of visible images. Ablation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in eliminating the confrontation between discriminators. And the comparison experiments on public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method."
Backdoor Attack and Defense in Federated Generative Adversarial Network-based Medical Image Synthesis,"Deep Learning-based image synthesis techniques have been applied in healthcare research for generating medical images to support open research and augment medical datasets. Training generative adversarial neural networks (GANs) usually require large amounts of training data. Federated learning (FL) provides a way of training a central model using distributed data while keeping raw data locally. However, given that the FL server cannot access the raw data, it is vulnerable to backdoor attacks, an adversarial by poisoning training data. Most backdoor attack strategies focus on classification models and centralized domains. It is still an open question if the existing backdoor attacks can affect GAN training and, if so, how to defend against the attack in the FL setting. In this work, we investigate the overlooked issue of backdoor attacks in federated GANs (FedGANs). The success of this attack is subsequently determined to be the result of some local discriminators overfitting the poisoned data and corrupting the local GAN equilibrium, which then further contaminates other clients when averaging the generator's parameters and yields high generator loss. Therefore, we proposed FedDetect, an efficient and effective way of defending against the backdoor attack in the FL setting, which allows the server to detect the client's adversarial behavior based on their losses and block the malicious clients. Our extensive experiments on two medical datasets with different modalities demonstrate the backdoor attack on FedGANs can result in synthetic images with low fidelity. After detecting and suppressing the detected malicious clients using the proposed defense strategy, we show that FedGANs can synthesize high-quality medical datasets (with labels) for data augmentation to improve classification models' performance."
p^3VAE: a physics-integrated generative model. Application to the semantic segmentation of optical remote sensing images,"The combination of machine learning models with physical models is a recent research path to learn robust data representations. In this paper, we introduce p^3VAE, a generative model that integrates a perfect physical model which partially explains the true underlying factors of variation in the data. To fully leverage our hybrid design, we propose a semi-supervised optimization procedure and an inference scheme that comes along meaningful uncertainty estimates. We apply p^3VAE to the semantic segmentation of high-resolution hyperspectral remote sensing images. Our experiments on a simulated data set demonstrated the benefits of our hybrid model against conventional machine learning models in terms of extrapolation capabilities and interpretability. In particular, we show that p^3VAE naturally has high disentanglement capabilities. Our code and data have been made publicly available at https://github.com/Romain3Ch216/p3VAE."
Swinv2-Imagen: Hierarchical Vision Transformer Diffusion Models for Text-to-Image Generation,"Recently, diffusion models have been proven to perform remarkably well in text-to-image synthesis tasks in a number of studies, immediately presenting new study opportunities for image generation. Google's Imagen follows this research trend and outperforms DALLE2 as the best model for text-to-image generation. However, Imagen merely uses a T5 language model for text processing, which cannot ensure learning the semantic information of the text. Furthermore, the Efficient UNet leveraged by Imagen is not the best choice in image processing. To address these issues, we propose the Swinv2-Imagen, a novel text-to-image diffusion model based on a Hierarchical Visual Transformer and a Scene Graph incorporating a semantic layout. In the proposed model, the feature vectors of entities and relationships are extracted and involved in the diffusion model, effectively improving the quality of generated images. On top of that, we also introduce a Swin-Transformer-based UNet architecture, called Swinv2-Unet, which can address the problems stemming from the CNN convolution operations. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed model by using three real-world datasets, i.e., MSCOCO, CUB and MM-CelebA-HQ. The experimental results show that the proposed Swinv2-Imagen model outperforms several popular state-of-the-art methods."
UniTune: Text-Driven Image Editing by Fine Tuning an Image Generation Model on a Single Image,"We present UniTune, a simple and novel method for general text-driven image editing. UniTune gets as input an arbitrary image and a textual edit description, and carries out the edit while maintaining high semantic and visual fidelity to the input image. UniTune uses text, an intuitive interface for art-direction, and does not require additional inputs, like masks or sketches. At the core of our method is the observation that with the right choice of parameters, we can fine-tune a large text-to-image diffusion model on a single image, encouraging the model to maintain fidelity to the input image while still allowing expressive manipulations. We used Imagen as our text-to-image model, but we expect UniTune to work with other large-scale models as well. We test our method in a range of different use cases, and demonstrate its wide applicability."
Sparse Kronecker Product Decomposition: A General Framework of Signal Region Detection in Image Regression,"This paper aims to present the first Frequentist framework on signal region detection in high-resolution and high-order image regression problems. Image data and scalar-on-image regression are intensively studied in recent years. However, most existing studies on such topics focused on outcome prediction, while the research on image region detection is rather limited, even though the latter is often more important. In this paper, we develop a general framework named Sparse Kronecker Product Decomposition (SKPD) to tackle this issue. The SKPD framework is general in the sense that it works for both matrices (e.g., 2D grayscale images) and (high-order) tensors (e.g., 2D colored images, brain MRI/fMRI data) represented image data. Moreover, unlike many Bayesian approaches, our framework is computationally scalable for high-resolution image problems. Specifically, our framework includes: 1) the one-term SKPD; 2) the multi-term SKPD; and 3) the nonlinear SKPD. We propose nonconvex optimization problems to estimate the one-term and multi-term SKPDs and develop path-following algorithms for the nonconvex optimization. The computed solutions of the path-following algorithm are guaranteed to converge to the truth with a particularly chosen initialization even though the optimization is nonconvex. Moreover, the region detection consistency could also be guaranteed by the one-term and multi-term SKPD. The nonlinear SKPD is highly connected to shallow convolutional neural networks (CNN), particular to CNN with one convolutional layer and one fully connected layer. Effectiveness of SKPDs is validated by real brain imaging data in the UK Biobank database."
DiffGAR: Model-Agnostic Restoration from Generative Artifacts Using Image-to-Image Diffusion Models,"Recent generative models show impressive results in photo-realistic image generation. However, artifacts often inevitably appear in the generated results, leading to downgraded user experience and reduced performance in downstream tasks. This work aims to develop a plugin post-processing module for diverse generative models, which can faithfully restore images from diverse generative artifacts. This is challenging because: (1) Unlike traditional degradation patterns, generative artifacts are non-linear and the transformation function is highly complex. (2) There are no readily available artifact-image pairs. (3) Different from model-specific anti-artifact methods, a model-agnostic framework views the generator as a black-box machine and has no access to the architecture details. In this work, we first design a group of mechanisms to simulate generative artifacts of popular generators (i.e., GANs, autoregressive models, and diffusion models), given real images. Second, we implement the model-agnostic anti-artifact framework as an image-to-image diffusion model, due to its advantage in generation quality and capacity. Finally, we design a conditioning scheme for the diffusion model to enable both blind and non-blind image restoration. A guidance parameter is also introduced to allow for a trade-off between restoration accuracy and image quality. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly outperforms previous approaches on the proposed datasets and real-world artifact images."
Large-scale Text-to-Image Generation Models for Visual Artists' Creative Works,"Large-scale Text-to-image Generation Models (LTGMs) (e.g., DALL-E), self-supervised deep learning models trained on a huge dataset, have demonstrated the capacity for generating high-quality open-domain images from multi-modal input. Although they can even produce anthropomorphized versions of objects and animals, combine irrelevant concepts in reasonable ways, and give variation to any user-provided images, we witnessed such rapid technological advancement left many visual artists disoriented in leveraging LTGMs more actively in their creative works. Our goal in this work is to understand how visual artists would adopt LTGMs to support their creative works. To this end, we conducted an interview study as well as a systematic literature review of 72 system/application papers for a thorough examination. A total of 28 visual artists covering 35 distinct visual art domains acknowledged LTGMs' versatile roles with high usability to support creative works in automating the creation process (i.e., automation), expanding their ideas (i.e., exploration), and facilitating or arbitrating in communication (i.e., mediation). We conclude by providing four design guidelines that future researchers can refer to in making intelligent user interfaces using LTGMs."
LAION-5B: An open large-scale dataset for training next generation image-text models,"Groundbreaking language-vision architectures like CLIP and DALL-E proved the utility of training on large amounts of noisy image-text data, without relying on expensive accurate labels used in standard vision unimodal supervised learning. The resulting models showed capabilities of strong text-guided image generation and transfer to downstream tasks, while performing remarkably at zero-shot classification with noteworthy out-of-distribution robustness. Since then, large-scale language-vision models like ALIGN, BASIC, GLIDE, Flamingo and Imagen made further improvements. Studying the training and capabilities of such models requires datasets containing billions of image-text pairs. Until now, no datasets of this size have been made openly available for the broader research community. To address this problem and democratize research on large-scale multi-modal models, we present LAION-5B - a dataset consisting of 5.85 billion CLIP-filtered image-text pairs, of which 2.32B contain English language. We show successful replication and fine-tuning of foundational models like CLIP, GLIDE and Stable Diffusion using the dataset, and discuss further experiments enabled with an openly available dataset of this scale. Additionally we provide several nearest neighbor indices, an improved web-interface for dataset exploration and subset generation, and detection scores for watermark, NSFW, and toxic content detection.

Is synthetic data from generative models ready for image recognition?,"Recent text-to-image generation models have shown promising results in generating high-fidelity photo-realistic images. Though the results are astonishing to human eyes, how applicable these generated images are for recognition tasks remains under-explored. In this work, we extensively study whether and how synthetic images generated from state-of-the-art text-to-image generation models can be used for image recognition tasks, and focus on two perspectives: synthetic data for improving classification models in data-scarce settings (i.e. zero-shot and few-shot), and synthetic data for large-scale model pre-training for transfer learning. We showcase the powerfulness and shortcomings of synthetic data from existing generative models, and propose strategies for better applying synthetic data for recognition tasks.

DE-FAKE: Detection and Attribution of Fake Images Generated by Text-to-Image Generation Models,"Text-to-image generation models that generate images based on prompt descriptions have attracted an increasing amount of attention during the past few months. Despite their encouraging performance, these models raise concerns about the misuse of their generated fake images. To tackle this problem, we pioneer a systematic study on the detection and attribution of fake images generated by text-to-image generation models. Concretely, we first build a machine learning classifier to detect the fake images generated by various text-to-image generation models. We then attribute these fake images to their source models, such that model owners can be held responsible for their models' misuse. We further investigate how prompts that generate fake images affect detection and attribution. We conduct extensive experiments on four popular text-to-image generation models, including DALL\cdotE 2, Stable Diffusion, GLIDE, and Latent Diffusion, and two benchmark prompt-image datasets. Empirical results show that (1) fake images generated by various models can be distinguished from real ones, as there exists a common artifact shared by fake images from different models; (2) fake images can be effectively attributed to their source models, as different models leave unique fingerprints in their generated images; (3) prompts with the ``person'' topic or a length between 25 and 75 enable models to generate fake images with higher authenticity. All findings contribute to the community's insight into the threats caused by text-to-image generation models. We appeal to the community's consideration of the counterpart solutions, like ours, against the rapidly-evolving fake image generation."
Attention-Based Generative Neural Image Compression on Solar Dynamics Observatory,"NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) mission gathers 1.4 terabytes of data each day from its geosynchronous orbit in space. SDO data includes images of the Sun captured at different wavelengths, with the primary scientific goal of understanding the dynamic processes governing the Sun. Recently, end-to-end optimized artificial neural networks (ANN) have shown great potential in performing image compression. ANN-based compression schemes have outperformed conventional hand-engineered algorithms for lossy and lossless image compression. We have designed an ad-hoc ANN-based image compression scheme to reduce the amount of data needed to be stored and retrieved on space missions studying solar dynamics. In this work, we propose an attention module to make use of both local and non-local attention mechanisms in an adversarially trained neural image compression network. We have also demonstrated the superior perceptual quality of this neural image compressor. Our proposed algorithm for compressing images downloaded from the SDO spacecraft performs better in rate-distortion trade-off than the popular currently-in-use image compression codecs such as JPEG and JPEG2000. In addition we have shown that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the art lossy transform coding compression codec, i.e., BPG."
AniFaceGAN: Animatable 3D-Aware Face Image Generation for Video Avatars,"Although 2D generative models have made great progress in face image generation and animation, they often suffer from undesirable artifacts such as 3D inconsistency when rendering images from different camera viewpoints. This prevents them from synthesizing video animations indistinguishable from real ones. Recently, 3D-aware GANs extend 2D GANs for explicit disentanglement of camera pose by leveraging 3D scene representations. These methods can well preserve the 3D consistency of the generated images across different views, yet they cannot achieve fine-grained control over other attributes, among which facial expression control is arguably the most useful and desirable for face animation. In this paper, we propose an animatable 3D-aware GAN for multiview consistent face animation generation. The key idea is to decompose the 3D representation of the 3D-aware GAN into a template field and a deformation field, where the former represents different identities with a canonical expression, and the latter characterizes expression variations of each identity. To achieve meaningful control over facial expressions via deformation, we propose a 3D-level imitative learning scheme between the generator and a parametric 3D face model during adversarial training of the 3D-aware GAN. This helps our method achieve high-quality animatable face image generation with strong visual 3D consistency, even though trained with only unstructured 2D images. Extensive experiments demonstrate our superior performance over prior works. Project page: https://yuewuhkust.github.io/AniFaceGAN"
What can we learn about a generated image corrupting its latent representation?,"Generative adversarial networks (GANs) offer an effective solution to the image-to-image translation problem, thereby allowing for new possibilities in medical imaging. They can translate images from one imaging modality to another at a low cost. For unpaired datasets, they rely mostly on cycle loss. Despite its effectiveness in learning the underlying data distribution, it can lead to a discrepancy between input and output data. The purpose of this work is to investigate the hypothesis that we can predict image quality based on its latent representation in the GANs bottleneck. We achieve this by corrupting the latent representation with noise and generating multiple outputs. The degree of differences between them is interpreted as the strength of the representation: the more robust the latent representation, the fewer changes in the output image the corruption causes. Our results demonstrate that our proposed method has the ability to i) predict uncertain parts of synthesized images, and ii) identify samples that may not be reliable for downstream tasks, e.g., liver segmentation task."
Images as Weight Matrices: Sequential Image Generation Through Synaptic Learning Rules,"Work on fast weight programmers has demonstrated the effectiveness of key/value outer product-based learning rules for sequentially generating a weight matrix (WM) of a neural net (NN) by another NN or itself. However, the weight generation steps are typically not visually interpretable by humans, because the contents stored in the WM of an NN are not. Here we apply the same principle to generate natural images. The resulting fast weight painters (FPAs) learn to execute sequences of delta learning rules to sequentially generate images as sums of outer products of self-invented keys and values, one rank at a time, as if each image was a WM of an NN. We train our FPAs in the generative adversarial networks framework, and evaluate on various image datasets. We show how these generic learning rules can generate images with respectable visual quality without any explicit inductive bias for images. While the performance largely lags behind the one of specialised state-of-the-art image generators, our approach allows for visualising how synaptic learning rules iteratively produce complex connection patterns, yielding human-interpretable meaningful images. Finally, we also show that an additional convolutional U-Net (now popular in diffusion models) at the output of an FPA can learn one-step ""denoising"" of FPA-generated images to enhance their quality. Our code is public."
EVA3D: Compositional 3D Human Generation from 2D Image Collections,"Inverse graphics aims to recover 3D models from 2D observations. Utilizing differentiable rendering, recent 3D-aware generative models have shown impressive results of rigid object generation using 2D images. However, it remains challenging to generate articulated objects, like human bodies, due to their complexity and diversity in poses and appearances. In this work, we propose, EVA3D, an unconditional 3D human generative model learned from 2D image collections only. EVA3D can sample 3D humans with detailed geometry and render high-quality images (up to 512x256) without bells and whistles (e.g. super resolution). At the core of EVA3D is a compositional human NeRF representation, which divides the human body into local parts. Each part is represented by an individual volume. This compositional representation enables 1) inherent human priors, 2) adaptive allocation of network parameters, 3) efficient training and rendering. Moreover, to accommodate for the characteristics of sparse 2D human image collections (e.g. imbalanced pose distribution), we propose a pose-guided sampling strategy for better GAN learning. Extensive experiments validate that EVA3D achieves state-of-the-art 3D human generation performance regarding both geometry and texture quality. Notably, EVA3D demonstrates great potential and scalability to ""inverse-graphics"" diverse human bodies with a clean framework."
Generating image captions with external encyclopedic knowledge,"Accurately reporting what objects are depicted in an image is largely a solved problem in automatic caption generation. The next big challenge on the way to truly humanlike captioning is being able to incorporate the context of the image and related real world knowledge. We tackle this challenge by creating an end-to-end caption generation system that makes extensive use of image-specific encyclopedic data. Our approach includes a novel way of using image location to identify relevant open-domain facts in an external knowledge base, with their subsequent integration into the captioning pipeline at both the encoding and decoding stages. Our system is trained and tested on a new dataset with naturally produced knowledge-rich captions, and achieves significant improvements over multiple baselines. We empirically demonstrate that our approach is effective for generating contextualized captions with encyclopedic knowledge that is both factually accurate and relevant to the image."
CoopHash: Cooperative Learning of Multipurpose Descriptor and Contrastive Pair Generator via Variational MCMC Teaching for Supervised Image Hashing,"Leveraging supervised information can lead to superior retrieval performance in the image hashing domain but the performance degrades significantly without enough labeled data. One effective solution to boost the performance is to employ generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), to generate synthetic data in an image hashing model. However, GAN-based methods are difficult to train and suffer from mode collapse issue, which prevents the hashing approaches from jointly training the generative models and the hash functions. This limitation results in sub-optimal retrieval performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel framework, the generative cooperative hashing network (CoopHash), which is based on the energy-based cooperative learning. CoopHash jointly learns a powerful generative representation of the data and a robust hash function. CoopHash has two components: a top-down contrastive pair generator that synthesizes contrastive images and a bottom-up multipurpose descriptor that simultaneously represents the images from multiple perspectives, including probability density, hash code, latent code, and category. The two components are jointly learned via a novel likelihood-based cooperative learning scheme. We conduct experiments on several real-world datasets and show that the proposed method outperforms the competing hashing supervised methods, achieving up to 10% relative improvement over the current state-of-the-art supervised hashing methods, and exhibits a significantly better performance in out-of-distribution retrieval."
Dual Pyramid Generative Adversarial Networks for Semantic Image Synthesis,"The goal of semantic image synthesis is to generate photo-realistic images from semantic label maps. It is highly relevant for tasks like content generation and image editing. Current state-of-the-art approaches, however, still struggle to generate realistic objects in images at various scales. In particular, small objects tend to fade away and large objects are often generated as collages of patches. In order to address this issue, we propose a Dual Pyramid Generative Adversarial Network (DP-GAN) that learns the conditioning of spatially-adaptive normalization blocks at all scales jointly, such that scale information is bi-directionally used, and it unifies supervision at different scales. Our qualitative and quantitative results show that the proposed approach generates images where small and large objects look more realistic compared to images generated by state-of-the-art methods."
Flow-based GAN for 3D Point Cloud Generation from a Single Image,"Generating a 3D point cloud from a single 2D image is of great importance for 3D scene understanding applications. To reconstruct the whole 3D shape of the object shown in the image, the existing deep learning based approaches use either explicit or implicit generative modeling of point clouds, which, however, suffer from limited quality. In this work, we aim to alleviate this issue by introducing a hybrid explicit-implicit generative modeling scheme, which inherits the flow-based explicit generative models for sampling point clouds with arbitrary resolutions while improving the detailed 3D structures of point clouds by leveraging the implicit generative adversarial networks (GANs). We evaluate on the large-scale synthetic dataset ShapeNet, with the experimental results demonstrating the superior performance of the proposed method. In addition, the generalization ability of our method is demonstrated by performing on cross-category synthetic images as well as by testing on real images from PASCAL3D+ dataset."
T2CI-GAN: Text to Compressed Image generation using Generative Adversarial Network,"The problem of generating textual descriptions for the visual data has gained research attention in the recent years. In contrast to that the problem of generating visual data from textual descriptions is still very challenging, because it requires the combination of both Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision techniques. The existing methods utilize the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and generate the uncompressed images from textual description. However, in practice, most of the visual data are processed and transmitted in the compressed representation. Hence, the proposed work attempts to generate the visual data directly in the compressed representation form using Deep Convolutional GANs (DCGANs) to achieve the storage and computational efficiency. We propose GAN models for compressed image generation from text. The first model is directly trained with JPEG compressed DCT images (compressed domain) to generate the compressed images from text descriptions. The second model is trained with RGB images (pixel domain) to generate JPEG compressed DCT representation from text descriptions. The proposed models are tested on an open source benchmark dataset Oxford-102 Flower images using both RGB and JPEG compressed versions, and accomplished the state-of-the-art performance in the JPEG compressed domain. The code will be publicly released at GitHub after acceptance of paper."
GENHOP: An Image Generation Method Based on Successive Subspace Learning,"Being different from deep-learning-based (DL-based) image generation methods, a new image generative model built upon successive subspace learning principle is proposed and named GenHop (an acronym of Generative PixelHop) in this work. GenHop consists of three modules: 1) high-to-low dimension reduction, 2) seed image generation, and 3) low-to-high dimension expansion. In the first module, it builds a sequence of high-to-low dimensional subspaces through a sequence of whitening processes, each of which contains samples of joint-spatial-spectral representation. In the second module, it generates samples in the lowest dimensional subspace. In the third module, it finds a proper high-dimensional sample for a seed image by adding details back via locally linear embedding (LLE) and a sequence of coloring processes. Experiments show that GenHop can generate visually pleasant images whose FID scores are comparable or even better than those of DL-based generative models for MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and CelebA datasets."
MuRAG: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generator for Open Question Answering over Images and Text,"While language Models store a massive amount of world knowledge implicitly in their parameters, even very large models often fail to encode information about rare entities and events, while incurring huge computational costs. Recently, retrieval-augmented models, such as REALM, RAG, and RETRO, have incorporated world knowledge into language generation by leveraging an external non-parametric index and have demonstrated impressive performance with constrained model sizes. However, these methods are restricted to retrieving only textual knowledge, neglecting the ubiquitous amount of knowledge in other modalities like images -- much of which contains information not covered by any text. To address this limitation, we propose the first Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Transformer (MuRAG), which accesses an external non-parametric multimodal memory to augment language generation. MuRAG is pre-trained with a mixture of large-scale image-text and text-only corpora using a joint contrastive and generative loss. We perform experiments on two different datasets that require retrieving and reasoning over both images and text to answer a given query: WebQA, and MultimodalQA. Our results show that MuRAG achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, outperforming existing models by 10-20\% absolute on both datasets and under both distractor and full-wiki settings."
Bayesian Prompt Learning for Image-Language Model Generalization,"Foundational image-language models have generated considerable interest due to their efficient adaptation to downstream tasks by prompt learning. Prompt learning treats part of the language model input as trainable while freezing the rest, and optimizes an Empirical Risk Minimization objective. However, Empirical Risk Minimization is known to suffer from distributional shifts which hurt generalizability to prompts unseen during training. By leveraging the regularization ability of Bayesian methods, we frame prompt learning from the Bayesian perspective and formulate it as a variational inference problem. Our approach regularizes the prompt space, reduces overfitting to the seen prompts and improves the prompt generalization on unseen prompts. Our framework is implemented by modeling the input prompt space in a probabilistic manner, as an a priori distribution which makes our proposal compatible with prompt learning approaches that are unconditional or conditional on the image. We demonstrate empirically on 15 benchmarks that Bayesian prompt learning provides an appropriate coverage of the prompt space, prevents learning spurious features, and exploits transferable invariant features. This results in better generalization of unseen prompts, even across different datasets and domains."
Progressive Text-to-Image Generation,"Recently, Vector Quantized AutoRegressive (VQ-AR) models have shown remarkable results in text-to-image synthesis by equally predicting discrete image tokens from the top left to bottom right in the latent space. Although the simple generative process surprisingly works well, is this the best way to generate the image? For instance, human creation is more inclined to the outline-to-fine of an image, while VQ-AR models themselves do not consider any relative importance of image patches. In this paper, we present a progressive model for high-fidelity text-to-image generation. The proposed method takes effect by creating new image tokens from coarse to fine based on the existing context in a parallel manner, and this procedure is recursively applied with the proposed error revision mechanism until an image sequence is completed. The resulting coarse-to-fine hierarchy makes the image generation process intuitive and interpretable. Extensive experiments in MS COCO benchmark demonstrate that the progressive model produces significantly better results compared with the previous VQ-AR method in FID score across a wide variety of categories and aspects. Moreover, the design of parallel generation in each step allows more than \times 13 inference acceleration with slight performance loss."
LDEdit: Towards Generalized Text Guided Image Manipulation via Latent Diffusion Models,"Research in vision-language models has seen rapid developments off-late, enabling natural language-based interfaces for image generation and manipulation. Many existing text guided manipulation techniques are restricted to specific classes of images, and often require fine-tuning to transfer to a different style or domain. Nevertheless, generic image manipulation using a single model with flexible text inputs is highly desirable. Recent work addresses this task by guiding generative models trained on the generic image datasets using pretrained vision-language encoders. While promising, this approach requires expensive optimization for each input. In this work, we propose an optimization-free method for the task of generic image manipulation from text prompts. Our approach exploits recent Latent Diffusion Models (LDM) for text to image generation to achieve zero-shot text guided manipulation. We employ a deterministic forward diffusion in a lower dimensional latent space, and the desired manipulation is achieved by simply providing the target text to condition the reverse diffusion process. We refer to our approach as LDEdit. We demonstrate the applicability of our method on semantic image manipulation and artistic style transfer. Our method can accomplish image manipulation on diverse domains and enables editing multiple attributes in a straightforward fashion. Extensive experiments demonstrate the benefit of our approach over competing baselines."
Cross-Geography Generalization of Machine Learning Methods for Classification of Flooded Regions in Aerial Images,"Identification of regions affected by floods is a crucial piece of information required for better planning and management of post-disaster relief and rescue efforts. Traditionally, remote sensing images are analysed to identify the extent of damage caused by flooding. The data acquired from sensors onboard earth observation satellites are analyzed to detect the flooded regions, which can be affected by low spatial and temporal resolution. However, in recent years, the images acquired from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have also been utilized to assess post-disaster damage. Indeed, a UAV based platform can be rapidly deployed with a customized flight plan and minimum dependence on the ground infrastructure. This work proposes two approaches for identifying flooded regions in UAV aerial images. The first approach utilizes texture-based unsupervised segmentation to detect flooded areas, while the second uses an artificial neural network on the texture features to classify images as flooded and non-flooded. Unlike the existing works where the models are trained and tested on images of the same geographical regions, this work studies the performance of the proposed model in identifying flooded regions across geographical regions. An F1-score of 0.89 is obtained using the proposed segmentation-based approach which is higher than existing classifiers. The robustness of the proposed approach demonstrates that it can be utilized to identify flooded regions of any region with minimum or no user intervention."
How Image Generation Helps Visible-to-Infrared Person Re-Identification?,"Compared to visible-to-visible (V2V) person re-identification (ReID), the visible-to-infrared (V2I) person ReID task is more challenging due to the lack of sufficient training samples and the large cross-modality discrepancy.  To this end, we propose Flow2Flow, a unified framework that could jointly achieve training sample expansion and cross-modality image generation for V2I person ReID.  Specifically, Flow2Flow learns bijective transformations from both the visible image domain and the infrared domain to a shared isotropic Gaussian domain with an invertible visible flow-based generator and an infrared one, respectively.  With Flow2Flow, we are able to generate pseudo training samples by the transformation from latent Gaussian noises to visible or infrared images, and generate cross-modality images by transformations from existing-modality images to latent Gaussian noises to missing-modality images.  For the purpose of identity alignment and modality alignment of generated images, we develop adversarial training strategies to train Flow2Flow.  Specifically, we design an image encoder and a modality discriminator for each modality.  The image encoder encourages the generated images to be similar to real images of the same identity via identity adversarial training, and the modality discriminator makes the generated images modal-indistinguishable from real images via modality adversarial training.  Experimental results on SYSU-MM01 and RegDB demonstrate that both training sample expansion and cross-modality image generation can significantly improve V2I ReID accuracy."
Distance Based Image Classification: A solution to generative classification's conundrum?,"Most classifiers rely on discriminative boundaries that separate instances of each class from everything else. We argue that discriminative boundaries are counter-intuitive as they define semantics by what-they-are-not; and should be replaced by generative classifiers which define semantics by what-they-are. Unfortunately, generative classifiers are significantly less accurate. This may be caused by the tendency of generative models to focus on easy to model semantic generative factors and ignore non-semantic factors that are important but difficult to model. We propose a new generative model in which semantic factors are accommodated by shell theory's hierarchical generative process and non-semantic factors by an instance specific noise term. We use the model to develop a classification scheme which suppresses the impact of noise while preserving semantic cues. The result is a surprisingly accurate generative classifier, that takes the form of a modified nearest-neighbor algorithm; we term it distance classification. Unlike discriminative classifiers, a distance classifier: defines semantics by what-they-are; is amenable to incremental updates; and scales well with the number of classes."
Membership Inference Attacks Against Text-to-image Generation Models,"Text-to-image generation models have recently attracted unprecedented attention as they unlatch imaginative applications in all areas of life. However, developing such models requires huge amounts of data that might contain privacy-sensitive information, e.g., face identity. While privacy risks have been extensively demonstrated in the image classification and GAN generation domains, privacy risks in the text-to-image generation domain are largely unexplored. In this paper, we perform the first privacy analysis of text-to-image generation models through the lens of membership inference. Specifically, we propose three key intuitions about membership information and design four attack methodologies accordingly. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on two mainstream text-to-image generation models including sequence-to-sequence modeling and diffusion-based modeling. The empirical results show that all of the proposed attacks can achieve significant performance, in some cases even close to an accuracy of 1, and thus the corresponding risk is much more severe than that shown by existing membership inference attacks. We further conduct an extensive ablation study to analyze the factors that may affect the attack performance, which can guide developers and researchers to be alert to vulnerabilities in text-to-image generation models. All these findings indicate that our proposed attacks pose a realistic privacy threat to the text-to-image generation models."
Federated Domain Generalization for Image Recognition via Cross-Client Style Transfer,"Domain generalization (DG) has been a hot topic in image recognition, with a goal to train a general model that can perform well on unseen domains. Recently, federated learning (FL), an emerging machine learning paradigm to train a global model from multiple decentralized clients without compromising data privacy, brings new challenges, also new possibilities, to DG. In the FL scenario, many existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) DG methods become ineffective, because they require the centralization of data from different domains during training. In this paper, we propose a novel domain generalization method for image recognition under federated learning through cross-client style transfer (CCST) without exchanging data samples. Our CCST method can lead to more uniform distributions of source clients, and thus make each local model learn to fit the image styles of all the clients to avoid the different model biases. Two types of style (single image style and overall domain style) with corresponding mechanisms are proposed to be chosen according to different scenarios. Our style representation is exceptionally lightweight and can hardly be used for the reconstruction of the dataset. The level of diversity is also flexible to be controlled with a hyper-parameter. Our method outperforms recent SOTA DG methods on two DG benchmarks (PACS, OfficeHome) and a large-scale medical image dataset (Camelyon17) in the FL setting. Last but not least, our method is orthogonal to many classic DG methods, achieving additive performance by combined utilization."
Semi-Supervised Domain Generalization for Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Image Segmentation with High Quality Pseudo Labels,"Developing a deep learning method for medical segmentation tasks heavily relies on a large amount of labeled data. However, the annotations require professional knowledge and are limited in number. Recently, semi-supervised learning has demonstrated great potential in medical segmentation tasks. Most existing methods related to cardiac magnetic resonance images only focus on regular images with similar domains and high image quality. A semi-supervised domain generalization method was developed in [2], which enhances the quality of pseudo labels on varied datasets. In this paper, we follow the strategy in [2] and present a domain generalization method for semi-supervised medical segmentation. Our main goal is to improve the quality of pseudo labels under extreme MRI Analysis with various domains. We perform Fourier transformation on input images to learn low-level statistics and cross-domain information. Then we feed the augmented images as input to the double cross pseudo supervision networks to calculate the variance among pseudo labels. We evaluate our method on the CMRxMotion dataset [1]. With only partially labeled data and without domain labels, our approach consistently generates accurate segmentation results of cardiac magnetic resonance images with different respiratory motions. Code will be available after the conference."
Compressed Gastric Image Generation Based on Soft-Label Dataset Distillation for Medical Data Sharing,"Background and objective: Sharing of medical data is required to enable the cross-agency flow of healthcare information and construct high-accuracy computer-aided diagnosis systems. However, the large sizes of medical datasets, the massive amount of memory of saved deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) models, and patients' privacy protection are problems that can lead to inefficient medical data sharing. Therefore, this study proposes a novel soft-label dataset distillation method for medical data sharing.  Methods: The proposed method distills valid information of medical image data and generates several compressed images with different data distributions for anonymous medical data sharing. Furthermore, our method can extract essential weights of DCNN models to reduce the memory required to save trained models for efficient medical data sharing.  Results: The proposed method can compress tens of thousands of images into several soft-label images and reduce the size of a trained model to a few hundredths of its original size. The compressed images obtained after distillation have been visually anonymized; therefore, they do not contain the private information of the patients. Furthermore, we can realize high-detection performance with a small number of compressed images.  Conclusions: The experimental results show that the proposed method can improve the efficiency and security of medical data sharing."
Re-Imagen: Retrieval-Augmented Text-to-Image Generator,"Research on text-to-image generation has witnessed significant progress in generating diverse and photo-realistic images, driven by diffusion and auto-regressive models trained on large-scale image-text data. Though state-of-the-art models can generate high-quality images of common entities, they often have difficulty generating images of uncommon entities, such as `Chortai (dog)' or `Picarones (food)'. To tackle this issue, we present the Retrieval-Augmented Text-to-Image Generator (Re-Imagen), a generative model that uses retrieved information to produce high-fidelity and faithful images, even for rare or unseen entities. Given a text prompt, Re-Imagen accesses an external multi-modal knowledge base to retrieve relevant (image, text) pairs and uses them as references to generate the image. With this retrieval step, Re-Imagen is augmented with the knowledge of high-level semantics and low-level visual details of the mentioned entities, and thus improves its accuracy in generating the entities' visual appearances. We train Re-Imagen on a constructed dataset containing (image, text, retrieval) triples to teach the model to ground on both text prompt and retrieval. Furthermore, we develop a new sampling strategy to interleave the classifier-free guidance for text and retrieval conditions to balance the text and retrieval alignment. Re-Imagen achieves significant gain on FID score over COCO and WikiImage. To further evaluate the capabilities of the model, we introduce EntityDrawBench, a new benchmark that evaluates image generation for diverse entities, from frequent to rare, across multiple object categories including dogs, foods, landmarks, birds, and characters. Human evaluation on EntityDrawBench shows that Re-Imagen can significantly improve the fidelity of generated images, especially on less frequent entities."
medigan: a Python library of pretrained generative models for medical image synthesis,"Synthetic data generated by generative models can enhance the performance and capabilities of data-hungry deep learning models in medical imaging. However, there is (1) limited availability of (synthetic) datasets and (2) generative models are complex to train, which hinders their adoption in research and clinical applications. To reduce this entry barrier, we propose medigan, a one-stop shop for pretrained generative models implemented as an open-source framework-agnostic Python library. medigan allows researchers and developers to create, increase, and domain-adapt their training data in just a few lines of code. Guided by design decisions based on gathered end-user requirements, we implement medigan based on modular components for generative model (i) execution, (ii) visualisation, (iii) search & ranking, and (iv) contribution. The library's scalability and design is demonstrated by its growing number of integrated and readily-usable pretrained generative models consisting of 21 models utilising 9 different Generative Adversarial Network architectures trained on 11 datasets from 4 domains, namely, mammography, endoscopy, x-ray, and MRI. Furthermore, 3 applications of medigan are analysed in this work, which include (a) enabling community-wide sharing of restricted data, (b) investigating generative model evaluation metrics, and (c) improving clinical downstream tasks. In (b), extending on common medical image synthesis assessment and reporting standards, we show Fréchet Inception Distance variability based on image normalisation and radiology-specific feature extraction."
Data Augmentation using Feature Generation for Volumetric Medical Images,"Medical image classification is one of the most critical problems in the image recognition area. One of the major challenges in this field is the scarcity of labelled training data. Additionally, there is often class imbalance in datasets as some cases are very rare to happen. As a result, accuracy in classification task is normally low. Deep Learning models, in particular, show promising results on image segmentation and classification problems, but they require very large datasets for training. Therefore, there is a need to generate more of synthetic samples from the same distribution. Previous work has shown that feature generation is more efficient and leads to better performance than corresponding image generation. We apply this idea in the Medical Imaging domain. We use transfer learning to train a segmentation model for the small dataset for which gold-standard class annotations are available. We extracted the learnt features and use them to generate synthetic features conditioned on class labels, using Auxiliary Classifier GAN (ACGAN). We test the quality of the generated features in a downstream classification task for brain tumors according to their severity level. Experimental results show a promising result regarding the validity of these generated features and their overall contribution to balancing the data and improving the classification class-wise accuracy."
Adma-GAN: Attribute-Driven Memory Augmented GANs for Text-to-Image Generation,"As a challenging task, text-to-image generation aims to generate photo-realistic and semantically consistent images according to the given text descriptions. Existing methods mainly extract the text information from only one sentence to represent an image and the text representation effects the quality of the generated image well. However, directly utilizing the limited information in one sentence misses some key attribute descriptions, which are the crucial factors to describe an image accurately. To alleviate the above problem, we propose an effective text representation method with the complements of attribute information. Firstly, we construct an attribute memory to jointly control the text-to-image generation with sentence input. Secondly, we explore two update mechanisms, sample-aware and sample-joint mechanisms, to dynamically optimize a generalized attribute memory. Furthermore, we design an attribute-sentence-joint conditional generator learning scheme to align the feature embeddings among multiple representations, which promotes the cross-modal network training. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed method obtains substantial performance improvements on both the CUB (FID from 14.81 to 8.57) and COCO (FID from 21.42 to 12.39) datasets."
Medical Image Captioning via Generative Pretrained Transformers,"The automatic clinical caption generation problem is referred to as proposed model combining the analysis of frontal chest X-Ray scans with structured patient information from the radiology records. We combine two language models, the Show-Attend-Tell and the GPT-3, to generate comprehensive and descriptive radiology records. The proposed combination of these models generates a textual summary with the essential information about pathologies found, their location, and the 2D heatmaps localizing each pathology on the original X-Ray scans. The proposed model is tested on two medical datasets, the Open-I, MIMIC-CXR, and the general-purpose MS-COCO. The results measured with the natural language assessment metrics prove their efficient applicability to the chest X-Ray image captioning."
Clustering-Induced Generative Incomplete Image-Text Clustering (CIGIT-C),"The target of image-text clustering (ITC) is to find correct clusters by integrating complementary and consistent information of multi-modalities for these heterogeneous samples. However, the majority of current studies analyse ITC on the ideal premise that the samples in every modality are complete. This presumption, however, is not always valid in real-world situations. The missing data issue degenerates the image-text feature learning performance and will finally affect the generalization abilities in ITC tasks. Although a series of methods have been proposed to address this incomplete image text clustering issue (IITC), the following problems still exist: 1) most existing methods hardly consider the distinct gap between heterogeneous feature domains. 2) For missing data, the representations generated by existing methods are rarely guaranteed to suit clustering tasks. 3) Existing methods do not tap into the latent connections both inter and intra modalities. In this paper, we propose a Clustering-Induced Generative Incomplete Image-Text Clustering(CIGIT-C) network to address the challenges above. More specifically, we first use modality-specific encoders to map original features to more distinctive subspaces. The latent connections between intra and inter-modalities are thoroughly explored by using the adversarial generating network to produce one modality conditional on the other modality. Finally, we update the corresponding modalityspecific encoders using two KL divergence losses. Experiment results on public image-text datasets demonstrated that the suggested method outperforms and is more effective in the IITC job."
Recent trends and analysis of Generative Adversarial Networks in Cervical Cancer Imaging,"Cervical cancer is one of the most common types of cancer found in females. It contributes to 6-29% of all cancers in women. It is caused by the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV). The 5-year survival chances of cervical cancer range from 17%-92% depending upon the stage at which it is detected. Early detection of this disease helps in better treatment and survival rate of the patient. Many deep learning algorithms are being used for the detection of cervical cancer these days. A special category of deep learning techniques known as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are catching up with speed in the screening, detection, and classification of cervical cancer. In this work, we present a detailed analysis of the recent trends relating to the use of various GAN models, their applications, and the evaluation metrics used for their performance evaluation in the field of cervical cancer imaging."
Personalizing Text-to-Image Generation via Aesthetic Gradients,"This work proposes aesthetic gradients, a method to personalize a CLIP-conditioned diffusion model by guiding the generative process towards custom aesthetics defined by the user from a set of images. The approach is validated with qualitative and quantitative experiments, using the recent stable diffusion model and several aesthetically-filtered datasets. Code is released at https://github.com/vicgalle/stable-diffusion-aesthetic-gradients"
Self-supervised Image Clustering from Multiple Incomplete Views via Constrastive Complementary Generation,"Incomplete Multi-View Clustering aims to enhance clustering performance by using data from multiple modalities. Despite the fact that several approaches for studying this issue have been proposed, the following drawbacks still persist: 1) It's difficult to learn latent representations that account for complementarity yet consistency without using label information; 2) and thus fails to take full advantage of the hidden information in incomplete data results in suboptimal clustering performance when complete data is scarce. In this paper, we propose Contrastive Incomplete Multi-View Image Clustering with Generative Adversarial Networks (CIMIC-GAN), which uses GAN to fill in incomplete data and uses double contrastive learning to learn consistency on complete and incomplete data. More specifically, considering diversity and complementary information among multiple modalities, we incorporate autoencoding representation of complete and incomplete data into double contrastive learning to achieve learning consistency. Integrating GANs into the autoencoding process can not only take full advantage of new features of incomplete data, but also better generalize the model in the presence of high data missing rates. Experiments conducted on \textcolor{black}{four} extensively-used datasets show that CIMIC-GAN outperforms state-of-the-art incomplete multi-View clustering methods."
GET3D: A Generative Model of High Quality 3D Textured Shapes Learned from Images,"As several industries are moving towards modeling massive 3D virtual worlds, the need for content creation tools that can scale in terms of the quantity, quality, and diversity of 3D content is becoming evident. In our work, we aim to train performant 3D generative models that synthesize textured meshes which can be directly consumed by 3D rendering engines, thus immediately usable in downstream applications. Prior works on 3D generative modeling either lack geometric details, are limited in the mesh topology they can produce, typically do not support textures, or utilize neural renderers in the synthesis process, which makes their use in common 3D software non-trivial. In this work, we introduce GET3D, a Generative model that directly generates Explicit Textured 3D meshes with complex topology, rich geometric details, and high-fidelity textures. We bridge recent success in the differentiable surface modeling, differentiable rendering as well as 2D Generative Adversarial Networks to train our model from 2D image collections. GET3D is able to generate high-quality 3D textured meshes, ranging from cars, chairs, animals, motorbikes and human characters to buildings, achieving significant improvements over previous methods."
Implementing and Experimenting with Diffusion Models for Text-to-Image Generation,"Taking advantage of the many recent advances in deep learning, text-to-image generative models currently have the merit of attracting the general public attention. Two of these models, DALL-E 2 and Imagen, have demonstrated that highly photorealistic images could be generated from a simple textual description of an image. Based on a novel approach for image generation called diffusion models, text-to-image models enable the production of many different types of high resolution images, where human imagination is the only limit.  However, these models require exceptionally large amounts of computational resources to train, as well as handling huge datasets collected from the internet. In addition, neither the codebase nor the models have been released. It consequently prevents the AI community from experimenting with these cutting-edge models, making the reproduction of their results complicated, if not impossible.  In this thesis, we aim to contribute by firstly reviewing the different approaches and techniques used by these models, and then by proposing our own implementation of a text-to-image model. Highly based on DALL-E 2, we introduce several slight modifications to tackle the high computational cost induced. We thus have the opportunity to experiment in order to understand what these models are capable of, especially in a low resource regime. In particular, we provide additional and analyses deeper than the ones performed by the authors of DALL-E 2, including ablation studies.  Besides, diffusion models use so-called guidance methods to help the generating process. We introduce a new guidance method which can be used in conjunction with other guidance methods to improve image quality. Finally, the images generated by our model are of reasonably good quality, without having to sustain the significant training costs of state-of-the-art text-to-image models."
Superpixel Generation and Clustering for Weakly Supervised Brain Tumor Segmentation in MR Images,"Training Machine Learning (ML) models to segment tumors and other anomalies in medical images is an increasingly popular area of research but generally requires manually annotated ground truth segmentations which necessitates significant time and resources to create. This work proposes a pipeline of ML models that utilize binary classification labels, which can be easily acquired, to segment ROIs without requiring ground truth annotations. We used 2D slices of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) brain scans from the Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge (BraTS) 2020 dataset and labels indicating the presence of high-grade glioma (HGG) tumors to train the pipeline. Our pipeline also introduces a novel variation of deep learning-based superpixel generation, which enables training guided by clustered superpixels and simultaneously trains a superpixel clustering model. On our test set, our pipeline's segmentations achieved a Dice coefficient of 61.7%, which is a substantial improvement over the 42.8% Dice coefficient acquired when the popular Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) method was used."
MoVQ: Modulating Quantized Vectors for High-Fidelity Image Generation,"Although two-stage Vector Quantized (VQ) generative models allow for synthesizing high-fidelity and high-resolution images, their quantization operator encodes similar patches within an image into the same index, resulting in a repeated artifact for similar adjacent regions using existing decoder architectures. To address this issue, we propose to incorporate the spatially conditional normalization to modulate the quantized vectors so as to insert spatially variant information to the embedded index maps, encouraging the decoder to generate more photorealistic images. Moreover, we use multichannel quantization to increase the recombination capability of the discrete codes without increasing the cost of model and codebook. Additionally, to generate discrete tokens at the second stage, we adopt a Masked Generative Image Transformer (MaskGIT) to learn an underlying prior distribution in the compressed latent space, which is much faster than the conventional autoregressive model. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed modulated VQGAN is able to greatly improve the reconstructed image quality as well as provide high-fidelity image generation."
An Overview on the Generation and Detection of Synthetic and Manipulated Satellite Images,"Due to the reduction of technological costs and the increase of satellites launches, satellite images are becoming more popular and easier to obtain. Besides serving benevolent purposes, satellite data can also be used for malicious reasons such as misinformation. As a matter of fact, satellite images can be easily manipulated relying on general image editing tools. Moreover, with the surge of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) that can generate realistic synthetic imagery belonging to various domains, additional threats related to the diffusion of synthetically generated satellite images are emerging. In this paper, we review the State of the Art (SOTA) on the generation and manipulation of satellite images. In particular, we focus on both the generation of synthetic satellite imagery from scratch, and the semantic manipulation of satellite images by means of image-transfer technologies, including the transformation of images obtained from one type of sensor to another one. We also describe forensic detection techniques that have been researched so far to classify and detect synthetic image forgeries. While we focus mostly on forensic techniques explicitly tailored to the detection of AI-generated synthetic contents, we also review some methods designed for general splicing detection, which can in principle also be used to spot AI manipulate images"
Brain Imaging Generation with Latent Diffusion Models,"Deep neural networks have brought remarkable breakthroughs in medical image analysis. However, due to their data-hungry nature, the modest dataset sizes in medical imaging projects might be hindering their full potential. Generating synthetic data provides a promising alternative, allowing to complement training datasets and conducting medical image research at a larger scale. Diffusion models recently have caught the attention of the computer vision community by producing photorealistic synthetic images. In this study, we explore using Latent Diffusion Models to generate synthetic images from high-resolution 3D brain images. We used T1w MRI images from the UK Biobank dataset (N=31,740) to train our models to learn about the probabilistic distribution of brain images, conditioned on covariables, such as age, sex, and brain structure volumes. We found that our models created realistic data, and we could use the conditioning variables to control the data generation effectively. Besides that, we created a synthetic dataset with 100,000 brain images and made it openly available to the scientific community."
HARP: Autoregressive Latent Video Prediction with High-Fidelity Image Generator,"Video prediction is an important yet challenging problem; burdened with the tasks of generating future frames and learning environment dynamics. Recently, autoregressive latent video models have proved to be a powerful video prediction tool, by separating the video prediction into two sub-problems: pre-training an image generator model, followed by learning an autoregressive prediction model in the latent space of the image generator. However, successfully generating high-fidelity and high-resolution videos has yet to be seen. In this work, we investigate how to train an autoregressive latent video prediction model capable of predicting high-fidelity future frames with minimal modification to existing models, and produce high-resolution (256x256) videos. Specifically, we scale up prior models by employing a high-fidelity image generator (VQ-GAN) with a causal transformer model, and introduce additional techniques of top-k sampling and data augmentation to further improve video prediction quality. Despite the simplicity, the proposed method achieves competitive performance to state-of-the-art approaches on standard video prediction benchmarks with fewer parameters, and enables high-resolution video prediction on complex and large-scale datasets. Videos are available at https://sites.google.com/view/harp-videos/home."
Weakly-Supervised Stitching Network for Real-World Panoramic Image Generation,"Recently, there has been growing attention on an end-to-end deep learning-based stitching model. However, the most challenging point in deep learning-based stitching is to obtain pairs of input images with a narrow field of view and ground truth images with a wide field of view captured from real-world scenes. To overcome this difficulty, we develop a weakly-supervised learning mechanism to train the stitching model without requiring genuine ground truth images. In addition, we propose a stitching model that takes multiple real-world fisheye images as inputs and creates a 360 output image in an equirectangular projection format. In particular, our model consists of color consistency corrections, warping, and blending, and is trained by perceptual and SSIM losses. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified on two real-world stitching datasets."
Document Image Binarization in JPEG Compressed Domain using Dual Discriminator Generative Adversarial Networks,"Image binarization techniques are being popularly used in enhancement of noisy and/or degraded images catering different Document Image Anlaysis (DIA) applications like word spotting, document retrieval, and OCR. Most of the existing techniques focus on feeding pixel images into the Convolution Neural Networks to accomplish document binarization, which may not produce effective results when working with compressed images that need to be processed without full decompression. Therefore in this research paper, the idea of document image binarization directly using JPEG compressed stream of document images is proposed by employing Dual Discriminator Generative Adversarial Networks (DD-GANs). Here the two discriminator networks - Global and Local work on different image ratios and use focal loss as generator loss. The proposed model has been thoroughly tested with different versions of DIBCO dataset having challenges like holes, erased or smudged ink, dust, and misplaced fibres. The model proved to be highly robust, efficient both in terms of time and space complexities, and also resulted in state-of-the-art performance in JPEG compressed domain."
Deep Feature Statistics Mapping for Generalized Screen Content Image Quality Assessment,"The statistical regularities of natural images, referred to as natural scene statistics, play an important role in no-reference image quality assessment. However, it has been widely acknowledged that screen content images (SCIs), which are typically computer generated, do not hold such statistics. Here we make the first attempt to learn the statistics of SCIs, based upon which the quality of SCIs can be effectively determined. The underlying mechanism of the proposed approach is based upon the wild assumption that the SCIs, which are not physically acquired, still obey certain statistics that could be understood in a learning fashion. We empirically show that the statistics deviation could be effectively leveraged in quality assessment, and the proposed method is superior when evaluated in different settings. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the Deep Feature Statistics based SCI Quality Assessment (DFSS-IQA) model delivers promising performance compared with existing NR-IQA models and shows a high generalization capability in the cross-dataset settings. The implementation of our method is publicly available at https://github.com/Baoliang93/DFSS-IQA."
Improved Masked Image Generation with Token-Critic,"Non-autoregressive generative transformers recently demonstrated impressive image generation performance, and orders of magnitude faster sampling than their autoregressive counterparts. However, optimal parallel sampling from the true joint distribution of visual tokens remains an open challenge. In this paper we introduce Token-Critic, an auxiliary model to guide the sampling of a non-autoregressive generative transformer. Given a masked-and-reconstructed real image, the Token-Critic model is trained to distinguish which visual tokens belong to the original image and which were sampled by the generative transformer. During non-autoregressive iterative sampling, Token-Critic is used to select which tokens to accept and which to reject and resample. Coupled with Token-Critic, a state-of-the-art generative transformer significantly improves its performance, and outperforms recent diffusion models and GANs in terms of the trade-off between generated image quality and diversity, in the challenging class-conditional ImageNet generation."
Talking Head from Speech Audio using a Pre-trained Image Generator,"We propose a novel method for generating high-resolution videos of talking-heads from speech audio and a single 'identity' image. Our method is based on a convolutional neural network model that incorporates a pre-trained StyleGAN generator. We model each frame as a point in the latent space of StyleGAN so that a video corresponds to a trajectory through the latent space. Training the network is in two stages. The first stage is to model trajectories in the latent space conditioned on speech utterances. To do this, we use an existing encoder to invert the generator, mapping from each video frame into the latent space. We train a recurrent neural network to map from speech utterances to displacements in the latent space of the image generator. These displacements are relative to the back-projection into the latent space of an identity image chosen from the individuals depicted in the training dataset. In the second stage, we improve the visual quality of the generated videos by tuning the image generator on a single image or a short video of any chosen identity. We evaluate our model on standard measures (PSNR, SSIM, FID and LMD) and show that it significantly outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods on one of two commonly used datasets and gives comparable performance on the other. Finally, we report on ablation experiments that validate the components of the model. The code and videos from experiments can be found at https://mohammedalghamdi.github.io/talking-heads-acm-mm"
Generative Deformable Radiance Fields for Disentangled Image Synthesis of Topology-Varying Objects,"3D-aware generative models have demonstrated their superb performance to generate 3D neural radiance fields (NeRF) from a collection of monocular 2D images even for topology-varying object categories. However, these methods still lack the capability to separately control the shape and appearance of the objects in the generated radiance fields. In this paper, we propose a generative model for synthesizing radiance fields of topology-varying objects with disentangled shape and appearance variations. Our method generates deformable radiance fields, which builds the dense correspondence between the density fields of the objects and encodes their appearances in a shared template field. Our disentanglement is achieved in an unsupervised manner without introducing extra labels to previous 3D-aware GAN training. We also develop an effective image inversion scheme for reconstructing the radiance field of an object in a real monocular image and manipulating its shape and appearance. Experiments show that our method can successfully learn the generative model from unstructured monocular images and well disentangle the shape and appearance for objects (e.g., chairs) with large topological variance. The model trained on synthetic data can faithfully reconstruct the real object in a given single image and achieve high-quality texture and shape editing results."
ISS: Image as Stepping Stone for Text-Guided 3D Shape Generation,"Text-guided 3D shape generation remains challenging due to the absence of large paired text-shape data, the substantial semantic gap between these two modalities, and the structural complexity of 3D shapes. This paper presents a new framework called Image as Stepping Stone (ISS) for the task by introducing 2D image as a stepping stone to connect the two modalities and to eliminate the need for paired text-shape data. Our key contribution is a two-stage feature-space-alignment approach that maps CLIP features to shapes by harnessing a pre-trained single-view reconstruction (SVR) model with multi-view supervisions: first map the CLIP image feature to the detail-rich shape space in the SVR model, then map the CLIP text feature to the shape space and optimize the mapping by encouraging CLIP consistency between the input text and the rendered images. Further, we formulate a text-guided shape stylization module to dress up the output shapes with novel textures. Beyond existing works on 3D shape generation from text, our new approach is general for creating shapes in a broad range of categories, without requiring paired text-shape data. Experimental results manifest that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-arts and our baselines in terms of fidelity and consistency with text. Further, our approach can stylize the generated shapes with both realistic and fantasy structures and textures."
Learned Image Compression with Generalized Octave Convolution and Cross-Resolution Parameter Estimation,"The application of the context-adaptive entropy model significantly improves the rate-distortion (R-D) performance, in which hyperpriors and autoregressive models are jointly utilized to effectively capture the spatial redundancy of the latent representations. However, the latent representations still contain some spatial correlations. In addition, these methods based on the context-adaptive entropy model cannot be accelerated in the decoding process by parallel computing devices, e.g. FPGA or GPU. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a learned multi-resolution image compression framework, which exploits the recently developed octave convolutions to factorize the latent representations into the high-resolution (HR) and low-resolution (LR) parts, similar to wavelet transform, which further improves the R-D performance. To speed up the decoding, our scheme does not use context-adaptive entropy model. Instead, we exploit an additional hyper layer including hyper encoder and hyper decoder to further remove the spatial redundancy of the latent representation. Moreover, the cross-resolution parameter estimation (CRPE) is introduced into the proposed framework to enhance the flow of information and further improve the rate-distortion performance. An additional information-fidelity loss is proposed to the total loss function to adjust the contribution of the LR part to the final bit stream. Experimental results show that our method separately reduces the decoding time by approximately 73.35 % and 93.44 % compared with that of state-of-the-art learned image compression methods, and the R-D performance is still better than H.266/VVC(4:2:0) and some learning-based methods on both PSNR and MS-SSIM metrics across a wide bit rates."
Joint Learning of Deep Texture and High-Frequency Features for Computer-Generated Image Detection,"Distinguishing between computer-generated (CG) and natural photographic (PG) images is of great importance to verify the authenticity and originality of digital images. However, the recent cutting-edge generation methods enable high qualities of synthesis in CG images, which makes this challenging task even trickier. To address this issue, a joint learning strategy with deep texture and high-frequency features for CG image detection is proposed. We first formulate and deeply analyze the different acquisition processes of CG and PG images. Based on the finding that multiple different modules in image acquisition will lead to different sensitivity inconsistencies to the convolutional neural network (CNN)-based rendering in images, we propose a deep texture rendering module for texture difference enhancement and discriminative texture representation. Specifically, the semantic segmentation map is generated to guide the affine transformation operation, which is used to recover the texture in different regions of the input image. Then, the combination of the original image and the high-frequency components of the original and rendered images are fed into a multi-branch neural network equipped with attention mechanisms, which refines intermediate features and facilitates trace exploration in spatial and channel dimensions respectively. Extensive experiments on two public datasets and a newly constructed dataset with more realistic and diverse images show that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods in the field by a clear margin. Besides, results also demonstrate the detection robustness and generalization ability of the proposed approach to postprocessing operations and generative adversarial network (GAN) generated images."
What does a platypus look like? Generating customized prompts for zero-shot image classification,"Open vocabulary models are a promising new paradigm for image classification. Unlike traditional classification models, open vocabulary models classify among any arbitrary set of categories specified with natural language during inference. This natural language, called ""prompts"", typically consists of a set of hand-written templates (e.g., ""a photo of a {}"") which are completed with each of the category names. This work introduces a simple method to generate higher accuracy prompts, without using explicit knowledge of the image domain and with far fewer hand-constructed sentences. To achieve this, we combine open vocabulary models with large language models (LLMs) to create Customized Prompts via Language models (CuPL, pronounced ""couple""). In particular, we leverage the knowledge contained in LLMs in order to generate many descriptive sentences that are customized for each object category. We find that this straightforward and general approach improves accuracy on a range of zero-shot image classification benchmarks, including over one percentage point gain on ImageNet. Finally, this method requires no additional training and remains completely zero-shot. Code is available at https://github.com/sarahpratt/CuPL."
AI Illustrator: Translating Raw Descriptions into Images by Prompt-based Cross-Modal Generation,"AI illustrator aims to automatically design visually appealing images for books to provoke rich thoughts and emotions. To achieve this goal, we propose a framework for translating raw descriptions with complex semantics into semantically corresponding images. The main challenge lies in the complexity of the semantics of raw descriptions, which may be hard to be visualized (e.g., ""gloomy"" or ""Asian""). It usually poses challenges for existing methods to handle such descriptions. To address this issue, we propose a Prompt-based Cross-Modal Generation Framework (PCM-Frame) to leverage two powerful pre-trained models, including CLIP and StyleGAN. Our framework consists of two components: a projection module from Text Embeddings to Image Embeddings based on prompts, and an adapted image generation module built on StyleGAN which takes Image Embeddings as inputs and is trained by combined semantic consistency losses. To bridge the gap between realistic images and illustration designs, we further adopt a stylization model as post-processing in our framework for better visual effects. Benefiting from the pre-trained models, our method can handle complex descriptions and does not require external paired data for training. Furthermore, we have built a benchmark that consists of 200 raw descriptions. We conduct a user study to demonstrate our superiority over the competing methods with complicated texts. We release our code at https://github.com/researchmm/AI_Illustrator."
Language-aware Domain Generalization Network for Cross-Scene Hyperspectral Image Classification,"Text information including extensive prior knowledge about land cover classes has been ignored in hyperspectral image classification (HSI) tasks. It is necessary to explore the effectiveness of linguistic mode in assisting HSI classification. In addition, the large-scale pre-training image-text foundation models have demonstrated great performance in a variety of downstream applications, including zero-shot transfer. However, most domain generalization methods have never addressed mining linguistic modal knowledge to improve the generalization performance of model. To compensate for the inadequacies listed above, a Language-aware Domain Generalization Network (LDGnet) is proposed to learn cross-domain invariant representation from cross-domain shared prior knowledge. The proposed method only trains on the source domain (SD) and then transfers the model to the target domain (TD). The dual-stream architecture including image encoder and text encoder is used to extract visual and linguistic features, in which coarse-grained and fine-grained text representations are designed to extract two levels of linguistic features. Furthermore, linguistic features are used as cross-domain shared semantic space, and visual-linguistic alignment is completed by supervised contrastive learning in semantic space. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method when compared with state-of-the-art techniques."
Domain Generalization for Prostate Segmentation in Transrectal Ultrasound Images: A Multi-center Study,"Prostate biopsy and image-guided treatment procedures are often performed under the guidance of ultrasound fused with magnetic resonance images (MRI). Accurate image fusion relies on accurate segmentation of the prostate on ultrasound images. Yet, the reduced signal-to-noise ratio and artifacts (e.g., speckle and shadowing) in ultrasound images limit the performance of automated prostate segmentation techniques and generalizing these methods to new image domains is inherently difficult. In this study, we address these challenges by introducing a novel 2.5D deep neural network for prostate segmentation on ultrasound images. Our approach addresses the limitations of transfer learning and finetuning methods (i.e., drop in performance on the original training data when the model weights are updated) by combining a supervised domain adaptation technique and a knowledge distillation loss. The knowledge distillation loss allows the preservation of previously learned knowledge and reduces the performance drop after model finetuning on new datasets. Furthermore, our approach relies on an attention module that considers model feature positioning information to improve the segmentation accuracy. We trained our model on 764 subjects from one institution and finetuned our model using only ten subjects from subsequent institutions. We analyzed the performance of our method on three large datasets encompassing 2067 subjects from three different institutions. Our method achieved an average Dice Similarity Coefficient (Dice) of 94.0\pm0.03 and Hausdorff Distance (HD95) of 2.28 mm in an independent set of subjects from the first institution. Moreover, our model generalized well in the studies from the other two institutions (Dice: 91.0\pm0.03; HD95: 3.7mm and Dice: 82.0\pm0.03; HD95: 7.1 mm)."
Every picture tells a story: Image-grounded controllable stylistic story generation,"Generating a short story out of an image is arduous. Unlike image captioning, story generation from an image poses multiple challenges: preserving the story coherence, appropriately assessing the quality of the story, steering the generated story into a certain style, and addressing the scarcity of image-story pair reference datasets limiting supervision during training. In this work, we introduce Plug-and-Play Story Teller (PPST) and improve image-to-story generation by: 1) alleviating the data scarcity problem by incorporating large pre-trained models, namely CLIP and GPT-2, to facilitate a fluent image-to-text generation with minimal supervision, and 2) enabling a more style-relevant generation by incorporating stylistic adapters to control the story generation. We conduct image-to-story generation experiments with non-styled, romance-styled, and action-styled PPST approaches and compare our generated stories with those of previous work over three aspects, i.e., story coherence, image-story relevance, and style fitness, using both automatic and human evaluation. The results show that PPST improves story coherence and has better image-story relevance, but has yet to be adequately stylistic."
Representative Image Feature Extraction via Contrastive Learning Pretraining for Chest X-ray Report Generation,"Medical report generation is a challenging task since it is time-consuming and requires expertise from experienced radiologists. The goal of medical report generation is to accurately capture and describe the image findings. Previous works pretrain their visual encoding neural networks with large datasets in different domains, which cannot learn general visual representation in the specific medical domain. In this work, we propose a medical report generation framework that uses a contrastive learning approach to pretrain the visual encoder and requires no additional meta information. In addition, we adopt lung segmentation as an augmentation method in the contrastive learning framework. This segmentation guides the network to focus on encoding the visual feature within the lung region. Experimental results show that the proposed framework improves the performance and the quality of the generated medical reports both quantitatively and qualitatively."
DSE-GAN: Dynamic Semantic Evolution Generative Adversarial Network for Text-to-Image Generation,"Text-to-image generation aims at generating realistic images which are semantically consistent with the given text. Previous works mainly adopt the multi-stage architecture by stacking generator-discriminator pairs to engage multiple adversarial training, where the text semantics used to provide generation guidance remain static across all stages. This work argues that text features at each stage should be adaptively re-composed conditioned on the status of the historical stage (i.e., historical stage's text and image features) to provide diversified and accurate semantic guidance during the coarse-to-fine generation process. We thereby propose a novel Dynamical Semantic Evolution GAN (DSE-GAN) to re-compose each stage's text features under a novel single adversarial multi-stage architecture. Specifically, we design (1) Dynamic Semantic Evolution (DSE) module, which first aggregates historical image features to summarize the generative feedback, and then dynamically selects words required to be re-composed at each stage as well as re-composed them by dynamically enhancing or suppressing different granularity subspace's semantics. (2) Single Adversarial Multi-stage Architecture (SAMA), which extends the previous structure by eliminating complicated multiple adversarial training requirements and therefore allows more stages of text-image interactions, and finally facilitates the DSE module. We conduct comprehensive experiments and show that DSE-GAN achieves 7.48\% and 37.8\% relative FID improvement on two widely used benchmarks, i.e., CUB-200 and MSCOCO, respectively."
Geometry Aligned Variational Transformer for Image-conditioned Layout Generation,"Layout generation is a novel task in computer vision, which combines the challenges in both object localization and aesthetic appraisal, widely used in advertisements, posters, and slides design. An accurate and pleasant layout should consider both the intra-domain relationship within layout elements and the inter-domain relationship between layout elements and the image. However, most previous methods simply focus on image-content-agnostic layout generation, without leveraging the complex visual information from the image. To this end, we explore a novel paradigm entitled image-conditioned layout generation, which aims to add text overlays to an image in a semantically coherent manner. Specifically, we propose an Image-Conditioned Variational Transformer (ICVT) that autoregressively generates various layouts in an image. First, self-attention mechanism is adopted to model the contextual relationship within layout elements, while cross-attention mechanism is used to fuse the visual information of conditional images. Subsequently, we take them as building blocks of conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE), which demonstrates appealing diversity. Second, in order to alleviate the gap between layout elements domain and visual domain, we design a Geometry Alignment module, in which the geometric information of the image is aligned with the layout representation. In addition, we construct a large-scale advertisement poster layout designing dataset with delicate layout and saliency map annotations. Experimental results show that our model can adaptively generate layouts in the non-intrusive area of the image, resulting in a harmonious layout design."
LogicRank: Logic Induced Reranking for Generative Text-to-Image Systems,"Text-to-image models have recently achieved remarkable success with seemingly accurate samples in photo-realistic quality. However as state-of-the-art language models still struggle evaluating precise statements consistently, so do language model based image generation processes. In this work we showcase problems of state-of-the-art text-to-image models like DALL-E with generating accurate samples from statements related to the draw bench benchmark. Furthermore we show that CLIP is not able to rerank those generated samples consistently. To this end we propose LogicRank, a neuro-symbolic reasoning framework that can result in a more accurate ranking-system for such precision-demanding settings. LogicRank integrates smoothly into the generation process of text-to-image models and moreover can be used to further fine-tune towards a more logical precise model."
AutoQML: Automatic Generation and Training of Robust Quantum-Inspired Classifiers by Using Genetic Algorithms on Grayscale Images,"We propose a new hybrid system for automatically generating and training quantum-inspired classifiers on grayscale images by using multiobjective genetic algorithms. We define a dynamic fitness function to obtain the smallest possible circuit and highest accuracy on unseen data, ensuring that the proposed technique is generalizable and robust. We minimize the complexity of the generated circuits in terms of the number of entanglement gates by penalizing their appearance. We reduce the size of the images with two dimensionality reduction approaches: principal component analysis (PCA), which is encoded in the individual for optimization purpose, and a small convolutional autoencoder (CAE). These two methods are compared with one another and with a classical nonlinear approach to understand their behaviors and to ensure that the classification ability is due to the quantum circuit and not the preprocessing technique used for dimensionality reduction."
Generative Modelling of the Ageing Heart with Cross-Sectional Imaging and Clinical Data,"Cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death globally, is an age-related disease. Understanding the morphological and functional changes of the heart during ageing is a key scientific question, the answer to which will help us define important risk factors of cardiovascular disease and monitor disease progression. In this work, we propose a novel conditional generative model to describe the changes of 3D anatomy of the heart during ageing. The proposed model is flexible and allows integration of multiple clinical factors (e.g. age, gender) into the generating process. We train the model on a large-scale cross-sectional dataset of cardiac anatomies and evaluate on both cross-sectional and longitudinal datasets. The model demonstrates excellent performance in predicting the longitudinal evolution of the ageing heart and modelling its data distribution. The codes are available at https://github.com/MengyunQ/AgeHeart."
T-Person-GAN: Text-to-Person Image Generation with Identity-Consistency and Manifold Mix-Up,"In this paper, we present an end-to-end approach to generate high-resolution person images conditioned on texts only. State-of-the-art text-to-image generation models are mainly designed for center-object generation, e.g., flowers and birds. Unlike center-placed objects with similar shapes and orientation, person image generation is a more challenging task, for which we observe the followings: 1) the generated images for the same person exhibit visual details with identity-consistency, e.g., identity-related textures/clothes/shoes across the images, and 2) those images should be discriminant for being robust against the inter-person variations caused by visual ambiguities. To address the above challenges, we develop an effective generative model to produce person images with two novel mechanisms. In particular, our first mechanism (called T-Person-GAN-ID) is to integrate the one-stream generator with an identity-preserving network such that the representations of generated data are regularized in their feature space to ensure the identity-consistency. The second mechanism (called T-Person-GAN-ID-MM) is based on the manifold mix-up to produce mixed images via the linear interpolation across generated images from different manifold identities, and we further enforce such interpolated images to be linearly classified in the feature space. This amounts to learning a linear classification boundary that can perfectly separate images from two identities. Our proposed method is empirically validated to achieve a remarkable improvement in text-to-person image generation. Our architecture is orthogonal to StackGAN++ , and focuses on person image generation, with all of them together to enrich the spectrum of GANs for the image generation task. Codes are available on \url{https://github.com/linwu-github/Person-Image-Generation.git}."
Adaptively-Realistic Image Generation from Stroke and Sketch with Diffusion Model,"Generating images from hand-drawings is a crucial and fundamental task in content creation. The translation is difficult as there exist infinite possibilities and the different users usually expect different outcomes. Therefore, we propose a unified framework supporting a three-dimensional control over the image synthesis from sketches and strokes based on diffusion models. Users can not only decide the level of faithfulness to the input strokes and sketches, but also the degree of realism, as the user inputs are usually not consistent with the real images. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance while providing flexibility in generating customized images with control over shape, color, and realism. Moreover, our method unleashes applications such as editing on real images, generation with partial sketches and strokes, and multi-domain multi-modal synthesis."
DreamBooth: Fine Tuning Text-to-Image Diffusion Models for Subject-Driven Generation,"Large text-to-image models achieved a remarkable leap in the evolution of AI, enabling high-quality and diverse synthesis of images from a given text prompt. However, these models lack the ability to mimic the appearance of subjects in a given reference set and synthesize novel renditions of them in different contexts. In this work, we present a new approach for ""personalization"" of text-to-image diffusion models. Given as input just a few images of a subject, we fine-tune a pretrained text-to-image model such that it learns to bind a unique identifier with that specific subject. Once the subject is embedded in the output domain of the model, the unique identifier can be used to synthesize novel photorealistic images of the subject contextualized in different scenes. By leveraging the semantic prior embedded in the model with a new autogenous class-specific prior preservation loss, our technique enables synthesizing the subject in diverse scenes, poses, views and lighting conditions that do not appear in the reference images. We apply our technique to several previously-unassailable tasks, including subject recontextualization, text-guided view synthesis, and artistic rendering, all while preserving the subject's key features. We also provide a new dataset and evaluation protocol for this new task of subject-driven generation. Project page: https://dreambooth.github.io/"
Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based Image-Deblurring,"This thesis analyzes the challenging problem of Image Deblurring based on classical theorems and state-of-art methods proposed in recent years. By spectral analysis we mathematically show the effective of spectral regularization methods, and point out the linking between the spectral filtering result and the solution of the regularization optimization objective. For ill-posed problems like image deblurring, the optimization objective contains a regularization term (also called the regularization functional) that encodes our prior knowledge into the solution. We demonstrate how to craft a regularization term by hand using the idea of maximum a posterior estimation. Then, we point out the limitations of such regularization-based methods, and step into the neural-network based methods.  Based on the idea of Wasserstein generative adversarial models, we can train a CNN to learn the regularization functional. Such data-driven approaches are able to capture the complexity, which may not be analytically modellable. Besides, in recent years with the improvement of architectures, the network has been able to output an image closely approximating the ground truth given the blurry observation. The Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) works on this Image-to-Image translation idea. We analyze the DeblurGAN-v2 method proposed by Orest Kupyn et al. [14] in 2019 based on numerical tests. And, based on the experimental results and our knowledge, we put forward some suggestions for improvement on this method."
Discovering Transferable Forensic Features for CNN-generated Images Detection,"Visual counterfeits are increasingly causing an existential conundrum in mainstream media with rapid evolution in neural image synthesis methods. Though detection of such counterfeits has been a taxing problem in the image forensics community, a recent class of forensic detectors -- universal detectors -- are able to surprisingly spot counterfeit images regardless of generator architectures, loss functions, training datasets, and resolutions. This intriguing property suggests the possible existence of transferable forensic features (T-FF) in universal detectors. In this work, we conduct the first analytical study to discover and understand T-FF in universal detectors. Our contributions are 2-fold: 1) We propose a novel forensic feature relevance statistic (FF-RS) to quantify and discover T-FF in universal detectors and, 2) Our qualitative and quantitative investigations uncover an unexpected finding: color is a critical T-FF in universal detectors. Code and models are available at https://keshik6.github.io/transferable-forensic-features/"
How good are deep models in understanding the generated images?,"My goal in this paper is twofold: to study how well deep models can understand the images generated by DALL-E 2 and Midjourney, and to quantitatively evaluate these generative models. Two sets of generated images are collected for object recognition and visual question answering (VQA) tasks. On object recognition, the best model, out of 10 state-of-the-art object recognition models, achieves about 60\% and 80\% top-1 and top-5 accuracy, respectively. These numbers are much lower than the best accuracy on the ImageNet dataset (91\% and 99\%). On VQA, the OFA model scores 77.3\% on answering 241 binary questions across 50 images. This model scores 94.7\% on the binary VQA-v2 dataset. Humans are able to recognize the generated images and answer questions on them easily. We conclude that a) deep models struggle to understand the generated content, and may do better after fine-tuning, and b) there is a large distribution shift between the generated images and the real photographs. The distribution shift appears to be category-dependent. Data is available at: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n2nCiaXtYJRRF2R73-LNE3zggeU_HeH0/view?usp=sharing."
Vision-Language Matching for Text-to-Image Synthesis via Generative Adversarial Networks,"Text-to-image synthesis aims to generate a photo-realistic and semantic consistent image from a specific text description. The images synthesized by off-the-shelf models usually contain limited components compared with the corresponding image and text description, which decreases the image quality and the textual-visual consistency. To address this issue, we propose a novel Vision-Language Matching strategy for text-to-image synthesis, named VLMGAN*, which introduces a dual vision-language matching mechanism to strengthen the image quality and semantic consistency. The dual vision-language matching mechanism considers textual-visual matching between the generated image and the corresponding text description, and visual-visual consistent constraints between the synthesized image and the real image. Given a specific text description, VLMGAN* firstly encodes it into textual features and then feeds them to a dual vision-language matching-based generative model to synthesize a photo-realistic and textual semantic consistent image. Besides, the popular evaluation metrics for text-to-image synthesis are borrowed from simple image generation, which mainly evaluates the reality and diversity of the synthesized images. Therefore, we introduce a metric named Vision-Language Matching Score (VLMS) to evaluate the performance of text-to-image synthesis which can consider both the image quality and the semantic consistency between synthesized image and the description. The proposed dual multi-level vision-language matching strategy can be applied to other text-to-image synthesis methods. We implement this strategy on two popular baselines, which are marked with {\text{VLMGAN}_{+\text{AttnGAN}}} and {\text{VLMGAN}_{+\text{DFGAN}}}. The experimental results on two widely-used datasets show that the model achieves significant improvements over other state-of-the-art methods."
Wildfire Forecasting with Satellite Images and Deep Generative Model,"Wildfire forecasting has been one of the most critical tasks that humanities want to thrive. It plays a vital role in protecting human life. Wildfire prediction, on the other hand, is difficult because of its stochastic and chaotic properties. We tackled the problem by interpreting a series of wildfire images as a video and used it to anticipate how the fire would behave in the future. However, creating video prediction models that account for the inherent uncertainty of the future is challenging. The bulk of published attempts is based on stochastic image-autoregressive recurrent networks, which raises various performance and application difficulties, such as computational cost and limited efficiency on massive datasets. Another possibility is to use entirely latent temporal models that combine frame synthesis and temporal dynamics. However, due to design and training issues, no such model for stochastic video prediction has yet been proposed in the literature. This paper addresses these issues by introducing a novel stochastic temporal model whose dynamics are driven in a latent space. It naturally predicts video dynamics by allowing our lighter, more interpretable latent model to beat previous state-of-the-art approaches on the GOES-16 dataset. Results will be compared towards various benchmarking models."
Text to Image Generation: Leaving no Language Behind,"One of the latest applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is to generate images from natural language descriptions. These generators are now becoming available and achieve impressive results that have been used for example in the front cover of magazines. As the input to the generators is in the form of a natural language text, a question that arises immediately is how these models behave when the input is written in different languages. In this paper we perform an initial exploration of how the performance of three popular text-to-image generators depends on the language. The results show that there is a significant performance degradation when using languages other than English, especially for languages that are not widely used. This observation leads us to discuss different alternatives on how text-to-image generators can be improved so that performance is consistent across different languages. This is fundamental to ensure that this new technology can be used by non-native English speakers and to preserve linguistic diversity."
Discovering Bugs in Vision Models using Off-the-shelf Image Generation and Captioning,"Automatically discovering failures in vision models under real-world settings remains an open challenge. This work demonstrates how off-the-shelf, large-scale, image-to-text and text-to-image models, trained on vast amounts of data, can be leveraged to automatically find such failures. In essence, a conditional text-to-image generative model is used to generate large amounts of synthetic, yet realistic, inputs given a ground-truth label. Misclassified inputs are clustered and a captioning model is used to describe each cluster. Each cluster's description is used in turn to generate more inputs and assess whether specific clusters induce more failures than expected. We use this pipeline to demonstrate that we can effectively interrogate classifiers trained on ImageNet to find specific failure cases and discover spurious correlations. We also show that we can scale the approach to generate adversarial datasets targeting specific classifier architectures. This work serves as a proof-of-concept demonstrating the utility of large-scale generative models to automatically discover bugs in vision models in an open-ended manner. We also describe a number of limitations and pitfalls related to this approach."
Text-to-Image Generation via Implicit Visual Guidance and Hypernetwork,"We develop an approach for text-to-image generation that embraces additional retrieval images, driven by a combination of implicit visual guidance loss and generative objectives. Unlike most existing text-to-image generation methods which merely take the text as input, our method dynamically feeds cross-modal search results into a unified training stage, hence improving the quality, controllability and diversity of generation results. We propose a novel hypernetwork modulated visual-text encoding scheme to predict the weight update of the encoding layer, enabling effective transfer from visual information (e.g. layout, content) into the corresponding latent domain. Experimental results show that our model guided with additional retrieval visual data outperforms existing GAN-based models. On COCO dataset, we achieve better FID of 9.13 with up to 3.5 \times fewer generator parameters, compared with the state-of-the-art method."
ParaColorizer: Realistic Image Colorization using Parallel Generative Networks,"Grayscale image colorization is a fascinating application of AI for information restoration. The inherently ill-posed nature of the problem makes it even more challenging since the outputs could be multi-modal. The learning-based methods currently in use produce acceptable results for straightforward cases but usually fail to restore the contextual information in the absence of clear figure-ground separation. Also, the images suffer from color bleeding and desaturated backgrounds since a single model trained on full image features is insufficient for learning the diverse data modes. To address these issues, we present a parallel GAN-based colorization framework. In our approach, each separately tailored GAN pipeline colorizes the foreground (using object-level features) or the background (using full-image features). The foreground pipeline employs a Residual-UNet with self-attention as its generator trained using the full-image features and the corresponding object-level features from the COCO dataset. The background pipeline relies on full-image features and additional training examples from the Places dataset. We design a DenseFuse-based fusion network to obtain the final colorized image by feature-based fusion of the parallelly generated outputs. We show the shortcomings of the non-perceptual evaluation metrics commonly used to assess multi-modal problems like image colorization and perform extensive performance evaluation of our framework using multiple perceptual metrics. Our approach outperforms most of the existing learning-based methods and produces results comparable to the state-of-the-art. Further, we performed a runtime analysis and obtained an average inference time of 24ms per image."
One-shot Generative Prior in Hankel-k-space for Parallel Imaging Reconstruction,"Magnetic resonance imaging serves as an essential tool for clinical diagnosis. However, it suffers from a long acquisition time. The utilization of deep learning, especially the deep generative models, offers aggressive acceleration and better reconstruction in magnetic resonance imaging. Nevertheless, learning the data distribution as prior knowledge and reconstructing the image from limited data remains challenging. In this work, we propose a novel Hankel-k-space generative model (HKGM), which can generate samples from a training set of as little as one k-space data. At the prior learning stage, we first construct a large Hankel matrix from k-space data, then extract multiple structured k-space patches from the large Hankel matrix to capture the internal distribution among different patches. Extracting patches from a Hankel matrix enables the generative model to be learned from redundant and low-rank data space. At the iterative reconstruction stage, it is observed that the desired solution obeys the learned prior knowledge. The intermediate reconstruction solution is updated by taking it as the input of the generative model. The updated result is then alternatively operated by imposing low-rank penalty on its Hankel matrix and data consistency con-strain on the measurement data. Experimental results confirmed that the internal statistics of patches within a single k-space data carry enough information for learning a powerful generative model and provide state-of-the-art reconstruction."
Memory-Driven Text-to-Image Generation,"We introduce a memory-driven semi-parametric approach to text-to-image generation, which is based on both parametric and non-parametric techniques. The non-parametric component is a memory bank of image features constructed from a training set of images. The parametric component is a generative adversarial network. Given a new text description at inference time, the memory bank is used to selectively retrieve image features that are provided as basic information of target images, which enables the generator to produce realistic synthetic results. We also incorporate the content information into the discriminator, together with semantic features, allowing the discriminator to make a more reliable prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed memory-driven semi-parametric approach produces more realistic images than purely parametric approaches, in terms of both visual fidelity and text-image semantic consistency."
Facial Expression Recognition and Image Description Generation in Vietnamese,"This paper discusses a facial expression recognition model and a description generation model to build descriptive sentences for images and facial expressions of people in images. Our study shows that YOLOv5 achieves better results than a traditional CNN for all emotions on the KDEF dataset. In particular, the accuracies of the CNN and YOLOv5 models for emotion recognition are 0.853 and 0.938, respectively. A model for generating descriptions for images based on a merged architecture is proposed using VGG16 with the descriptions encoded over an LSTM model. YOLOv5 is also used to recognize dominant colors of objects in the images and correct the color words in the descriptions generated if it is necessary. If the description contains words referring to a person, we recognize the emotion of the person in the image. Finally, we combine the results of all models to create sentences that describe the visual content and the human emotions in the images. Experimental results on the Flickr8k dataset in Vietnamese achieve BLEU-1, BLEU-2, BLEU-3, BLEU-4 scores of 0.628; 0.425; 0.280; and 0.174, respectively."
Generative Transfer Learning: Covid-19 Classification with a few Chest X-ray Images,"Detection of diseases through medical imaging is preferred due to its non-invasive nature. Medical imaging supports multiple modalities of data that enable a thorough and quick look inside a human body. However, interpreting imaging data is often time-consuming and requires a great deal of human expertise. Deep learning models can expedite interpretation and alleviate the work of human experts. However, these models are data-intensive and require significant labeled images for training. During novel disease outbreaks such as Covid-19, we often do not have the required labeled imaging data, especially at the start of the epidemic. Deep Transfer Learning addresses this problem by using a pretrained model in the public domain, e.g. any variant of either VGGNet, ResNet, Inception, DenseNet, etc., as a feature learner to quickly adapt the target task from fewer samples. Most pretrained models are deep with complex architectures. They are trained with large multi-class datasets such as ImageNet, with significant human efforts in architecture design and hyper parameters tuning. We presented 1 a simpler generative source model, pretrained on a single but related concept, can perform as effectively as existing larger pretrained models. We demonstrate the usefulness of generative transfer learning that requires less compute and training data, for Few Shot Learning (FSL) with a Covid-19 binary classification use case. We compare classic deep transfer learning with our approach and also report FSL results with three settings of 84, 20, and 10 training samples. The model implementation of generative FSL for Covid-19 classification is available publicly at https://github.com/suvarnak/GenerativeFSLCovid.git."
Longitudinal Prediction of Postnatal Brain Magnetic Resonance Images via a Metamorphic Generative Adversarial Network,"Missing scans are inevitable in longitudinal studies due to either subject dropouts or failed scans. In this paper, we propose a deep learning framework to predict missing scans from acquired scans, catering to longitudinal infant studies. Prediction of infant brain MRI is challenging owing to the rapid contrast and structural changes particularly during the first year of life. We introduce a trustworthy metamorphic generative adversarial network (MGAN) for translating infant brain MRI from one time-point to another. MGAN has three key features: (i) Image translation leveraging spatial and frequency information for detail-preserving mapping; (ii) Quality-guided learning strategy that focuses attention on challenging regions. (iii) Multi-scale hybrid loss function that improves translation of tissue contrast and structural details. Experimental results indicate that MGAN outperforms existing GANs by accurately predicting both contrast and anatomical details."
Aesthetic Language Guidance Generation of Images Using Attribute Comparison,"With the vigorous development of mobile photography technology, major mobile phone manufacturers are scrambling to improve the shooting ability of equipments and the photo beautification algorithm of software. However, the improvement of intelligent equipments and algorithms cannot replace human subjective photography technology. In this paper, we propose the aesthetic language guidance of image (ALG). We divide ALG into ALG-T and ALG-I according to whether the guiding rules are based on photography templates or guidance images. Whether it is ALG-T or ALG-I, we guide photography from three attributes of color, lighting and composition of the images. The differences of the three attributes between the input images and the photography templates or the guidance images are described in natural language, which is aesthetic natural language guidance (ALG). Also, because of the differences in lighting and composition between landscape images and portrait images, we divide the input images into landscape images and portrait images. Both ALG-T and ALG-I conduct aesthetic language guidance respectively for the two types of input images (landscape images and portrait images)."
Generative models-based data labeling for deep networks regression: application to seed maturity estimation from UAV multispectral images,"Monitoring seed maturity is an increasing challenge in agriculture due to climate change and more restrictive practices. Seeds monitoring in the field is essential to optimize the farming process and to guarantee yield quality through high germination. Traditional methods are based on limited sampling in the field and analysis in laboratory. Moreover, they are time consuming and only allow monitoring sub-sections of the crop field. This leads to a lack of accuracy on the condition of the crop as a whole due to intra-field heterogeneities. Multispectral imagery by UAV allows uniform scan of fields and better capture of crop maturity information. On the other hand, deep learning methods have shown tremendous potential in estimating agronomic parameters, especially maturity. However, they require large labeled datasets. Although large sets of aerial images are available, labeling them with ground truth is a tedious, if not impossible task. In this paper, we propose a method for estimating parsley seed maturity using multispectral UAV imagery, with a new approach for automatic data labeling. This approach is based on parametric and non-parametric models to provide weak labels. We also consider the data acquisition protocol and the performance evaluation of the different steps of the method. Results show good performance, and the non-parametric kernel density estimator model can improve neural network generalization when used as a labeling method, leading to more robust and better performing deep neural models."
Hierarchical Residual Learning Based Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder for Image Reconstruction and Generation,"We propose a multi-layer variational autoencoder method, we call HR-VQVAE, that learns hierarchical discrete representations of the data. By utilizing a novel objective function, each layer in HR-VQVAE learns a discrete representation of the residual from previous layers through a vector quantized encoder. Furthermore, the representations at each layer are hierarchically linked to those at previous layers. We evaluate our method on the tasks of image reconstruction and generation. Experimental results demonstrate that the discrete representations learned by HR-VQVAE enable the decoder to reconstruct high-quality images with less distortion than the baseline methods, namely VQVAE and VQVAE-2. HR-VQVAE can also generate high-quality and diverse images that outperform state-of-the-art generative models, providing further verification of the efficiency of the learned representations. The hierarchical nature of HR-VQVAE i) reduces the decoding search time, making the method particularly suitable for high-load tasks and ii) allows to increase the codebook size without incurring the codebook collapse problem."
Txt2Img-MHN: Remote Sensing Image Generation from Text Using Modern Hopfield Networks,"The synthesis of high-resolution remote sensing images based on text descriptions has great potential in many practical application scenarios. Although deep neural networks have achieved great success in many important remote sensing tasks, generating realistic remote sensing images from text descriptions is still very difficult. To address this challenge, we propose a novel text-to-image modern Hopfield network (Txt2Img-MHN). The main idea of Txt2Img-MHN is to conduct hierarchical prototype learning on both text and image embeddings with modern Hopfield layers. Instead of directly learning concrete but highly diverse text-image joint feature representations for different semantics, Txt2Img-MHN aims to learn the most representative prototypes from text-image embeddings, achieving a coarse-to-fine learning strategy. These learned prototypes can then be utilized to represent more complex semantics in the text-to-image generation task. To better evaluate the realism and semantic consistency of the generated images, we further conduct zero-shot classification on real remote sensing data using the classification model trained on synthesized images. Despite its simplicity, we find that the overall accuracy in the zero-shot classification may serve as a good metric to evaluate the ability to generate an image from text. Extensive experiments on the benchmark remote sensing text-image dataset demonstrate that the proposed Txt2Img-MHN can generate more realistic remote sensing images than existing methods. Code and pre-trained models are available online (https://github.com/YonghaoXu/Txt2Img-MHN)."
Style Transfer of Black and White Silhouette Images using CycleGAN and a Randomly Generated Dataset,"CycleGAN can be used to transfer an artistic style to an image. It does not require pairs of source and stylized images to train a model. Taking this advantage, we propose using randomly generated data to train a machine learning model that can transfer traditional art style to a black and white silhouette image. The result is noticeably better than the previous neural style transfer methods. However, there are some areas for improvement, such as removing artifacts and spikes from the transformed image."
Adversarial Attacks on Image Generation With Made-Up Words,"Text-guided image generation models can be prompted to generate images using nonce words adversarially designed to robustly evoke specific visual concepts. Two approaches for such generation are introduced: macaronic prompting, which involves designing cryptic hybrid words by concatenating subword units from different languages; and evocative prompting, which involves designing nonce words whose broad morphological features are similar enough to that of existing words to trigger robust visual associations. The two methods can also be combined to generate images associated with more specific visual concepts. The implications of these techniques for the circumvention of existing approaches to content moderation, and particularly the generation of offensive or harmful images, are discussed."
Inflating 2D Convolution Weights for Efficient Generation of 3D Medical Images,"The generation of three-dimensional (3D) medical images can have great application potential since it takes into account the 3D anatomical structure. There are two problems, however, that prevent effective training of a 3D medical generative model: (1) 3D medical images are very expensive to acquire and annotate, resulting in an insufficient number of training images, (2) a large number of parameters are involved in 3D convolution. To address both problems, we propose a novel GAN model called 3D Split&Shuffle-GAN. In order to address the 3D data scarcity issue, we first pre-train a two-dimensional (2D) GAN model using abundant image slices and inflate the 2D convolution weights to improve initialization of the 3D GAN. Novel 3D network architectures are proposed for both the generator and discriminator of the GAN model to significantly reduce the number of parameters while maintaining the quality of image generation. A number of weight inflation strategies and parameter-efficient 3D architectures are investigated. Experiments on both heart (Stanford AIMI Coronary Calcium) and brain (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach leads to improved 3D images generation quality with significantly fewer parameters."
Expanding Language-Image Pretrained Models for General Video Recognition,"Contrastive language-image pretraining has shown great success in learning visual-textual joint representation from web-scale data, demonstrating remarkable ""zero-shot"" generalization ability for various image tasks. However, how to effectively expand such new language-image pretraining methods to video domains is still an open problem. In this work, we present a simple yet effective approach that adapts the pretrained language-image models to video recognition directly, instead of pretraining a new model from scratch. More concretely, to capture the long-range dependencies of frames along the temporal dimension, we propose a cross-frame attention mechanism that explicitly exchanges information across frames. Such module is lightweight and can be plugged into pretrained language-image models seamlessly. Moreover, we propose a video-specific prompting scheme, which leverages video content information for generating discriminative textual prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach is effective and can be generalized to different video recognition scenarios. In particular, under fully-supervised settings, our approach achieves a top-1 accuracy of 87.1% on Kinectics-400, while using 12 times fewer FLOPs compared with Swin-L and ViViT-H. In zero-shot experiments, our approach surpasses the current state-of-the-art methods by +7.6% and +14.9% in terms of top-1 accuracy under two popular protocols. In few-shot scenarios, our approach outperforms previous best methods by +32.1% and +23.1% when the labeled data is extremely limited. Code and models are available at https://aka.ms/X-CLIP"
Subject-Specific Lesion Generation and Pseudo-Healthy Synthesis for Multiple Sclerosis Brain Images,"Understanding the intensity characteristics of brain lesions is key for defining image-based biomarkers in neurological studies and for predicting disease burden and outcome. In this work, we present a novel foreground-based generative method for modelling the local lesion characteristics that can both generate synthetic lesions on healthy images and synthesize subject-specific pseudo-healthy images from pathological images. Furthermore, the proposed method can be used as a data augmentation module to generate synthetic images for training brain image segmentation networks. Experiments on multiple sclerosis (MS) brain images acquired on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrate that the proposed method can generate highly realistic pseudo-healthy and pseudo-pathological brain images. Data augmentation using the synthetic images improves the brain image segmentation performance compared to traditional data augmentation methods as well as a recent lesion-aware data augmentation technique, CarveMix. The code will be released at https://github.com/dogabasaran/lesion-synthesis."
An Image is Worth One Word: Personalizing Text-to-Image Generation using Textual Inversion,"Text-to-image models offer unprecedented freedom to guide creation through natural language. Yet, it is unclear how such freedom can be exercised to generate images of specific unique concepts, modify their appearance, or compose them in new roles and novel scenes. In other words, we ask: how can we use language-guided models to turn our cat into a painting, or imagine a new product based on our favorite toy? Here we present a simple approach that allows such creative freedom. Using only 3-5 images of a user-provided concept, like an object or a style, we learn to represent it through new ""words"" in the embedding space of a frozen text-to-image model. These ""words"" can be composed into natural language sentences, guiding personalized creation in an intuitive way. Notably, we find evidence that a single word embedding is sufficient for capturing unique and varied concepts. We compare our approach to a wide range of baselines, and demonstrate that it can more faithfully portray the concepts across a range of applications and tasks.

A Feasibility Study on Image Inpainting for Non-cleft Lip Generation from Patients with Cleft Lip,"A Cleft lip is a congenital abnormality requiring surgical repair by a specialist. The surgeon must have extensive experience and theoretical knowledge to perform surgery, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) method has been proposed to guide surgeons in improving surgical outcomes. If AI can be used to predict what a repaired cleft lip would look like, surgeons could use it as an adjunct to adjust their surgical technique and improve results. To explore the feasibility of this idea while protecting patient privacy, we propose a deep learning-based image inpainting method that is capable of covering a cleft lip and generating a lip and nose without a cleft. Our experiments are conducted on two real-world cleft lip datasets and are assessed by expert cleft lip surgeons to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method."
Testing Relational Understanding in Text-Guided Image Generation,"Relations are basic building blocks of human cognition. Classic and recent work suggests that many relations are early developing, and quickly perceived. Machine models that aspire to human-level perception and reasoning should reflect the ability to recognize and reason generatively about relations. We report a systematic empirical examination of a recent text-guided image generation model (DALL-E 2), using a set of 15 basic physical and social relations studied or proposed in the literature, and judgements from human participants (N = 169). Overall, we find that only ~22% of images matched basic relation prompts. Based on a quantitative examination of people's judgments, we suggest that current image generation models do not yet have a grasp of even basic relations involving simple objects and agents. We examine reasons for model successes and failures, and suggest possible improvements based on computations observed in biological intelligence."
GLEAN: Generative Latent Bank for Image Super-Resolution and Beyond,"We show that pre-trained Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) such as StyleGAN and BigGAN can be used as a latent bank to improve the performance of image super-resolution. While most existing perceptual-oriented approaches attempt to generate realistic outputs through learning with adversarial loss, our method, Generative LatEnt bANk (GLEAN), goes beyond existing practices by directly leveraging rich and diverse priors encapsulated in a pre-trained GAN. But unlike prevalent GAN inversion methods that require expensive image-specific optimization at runtime, our approach only needs a single forward pass for restoration. GLEAN can be easily incorporated in a simple encoder-bank-decoder architecture with multi-resolution skip connections. Employing priors from different generative models allows GLEAN to be applied to diverse categories (\eg~human faces, cats, buildings, and cars). We further present a lightweight version of GLEAN, named LightGLEAN, which retains only the critical components in GLEAN. Notably, LightGLEAN consists of only 21% of parameters and 35% of FLOPs while achieving comparable image quality. We extend our method to different tasks including image colorization and blind image restoration, and extensive experiments show that our proposed models perform favorably in comparison to existing methods. Codes and models are available at https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmediting."
"Conservative Generator, Progressive Discriminator: Coordination of Adversaries in Few-shot Incremental Image Synthesis","The capacity to learn incrementally from an online stream of data is an envied trait of human learners, as deep neural networks typically suffer from catastrophic forgetting and stability-plasticity dilemma. Several works have previously explored incremental few-shot learning, a task with greater challenges due to data constraint, mostly in classification setting with mild success. In this work, we study the underrepresented task of generative incremental few-shot learning. To effectively handle the inherent challenges of incremental learning and few-shot learning, we propose a novel framework named ConPro that leverages the two-player nature of GANs. Specifically, we design a conservative generator that preserves past knowledge in parameter and compute efficient manner, and a progressive discriminator that learns to reason semantic distances between past and present task samples, minimizing overfitting with few data points and pursuing good forward transfer. We present experiments to validate the effectiveness of ConPro."
3D Cartoon Face Generation with Controllable Expressions from a Single GAN Image,"In this paper, we investigate an open research task of generating 3D cartoon face shapes from single 2D GAN generated human faces and without 3D supervision, where we can also manipulate the facial expressions of the 3D shapes. To this end, we discover the semantic meanings of StyleGAN latent space, such that we are able to produce face images of various expressions, poses, and lighting by controlling the latent codes. Specifically, we first finetune the pretrained StyleGAN face model on the cartoon datasets. By feeding the same latent codes to face and cartoon generation models, we aim to realize the translation from 2D human face images to cartoon styled avatars. We then discover semantic directions of the GAN latent space, in an attempt to change the facial expressions while preserving the original identity. As we do not have any 3D annotations for cartoon faces, we manipulate the latent codes to generate images with different poses and lighting, such that we can reconstruct the 3D cartoon face shapes. We validate the efficacy of our method on three cartoon datasets qualitatively and quantitatively."
AADG: Automatic Augmentation for Domain Generalization on Retinal Image Segmentation,"Convolutional neural networks have been widely applied to medical image segmentation and have achieved considerable performance. However, the performance may be significantly affected by the domain gap between training data (source domain) and testing data (target domain). To address this issue, we propose a data manipulation based domain generalization method, called Automated Augmentation for Domain Generalization (AADG). Our AADG framework can effectively sample data augmentation policies that generate novel domains and diversify the training set from an appropriate search space. Specifically, we introduce a novel proxy task maximizing the diversity among multiple augmented novel domains as measured by the Sinkhorn distance in a unit sphere space, making automated augmentation tractable. Adversarial training and deep reinforcement learning are employed to efficiently search the objectives. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on 11 publicly-accessible fundus image datasets (four for retinal vessel segmentation, four for optic disc and cup (OD/OC) segmentation and three for retinal lesion segmentation) are comprehensively performed. Two OCTA datasets for retinal vasculature segmentation are further involved to validate cross-modality generalization. Our proposed AADG exhibits state-of-the-art generalization performance and outperforms existing approaches by considerable margins on retinal vessel, OD/OC and lesion segmentation tasks. The learned policies are empirically validated to be model-agnostic and can transfer well to other models. The source code is available at https://github.com/CRazorback/AADG."
Generalized Probabilistic U-Net for medical image segementation,"We propose the Generalized Probabilistic U-Net, which extends the Probabilistic U-Net by allowing more general forms of the Gaussian distribution as the latent space distribution that can better approximate the uncertainty in the reference segmentations. We study the effect the choice of latent space distribution has on capturing the uncertainty in the reference segmentations using the LIDC-IDRI dataset. We show that the choice of distribution affects the sample diversity of the predictions and their overlap with respect to the reference segmentations. For the LIDC-IDRI dataset, we show that using a mixture of Gaussians results in a statistically significant improvement in the generalized energy distance (GED) metric with respect to the standard Probabilistic U-Net. We have made our implementation available at https://github.com/ishaanb92/GeneralizedProbabilisticUNet"
Cross-Modal Contrastive Representation Learning for Audio-to-Image Generation,"Multiple modalities for certain information provide a variety of perspectives on that information, which can improve the understanding of the information. Thus, it may be crucial to generate data of different modality from the existing data to enhance the understanding. In this paper, we investigate the cross-modal audio-to-image generation problem and propose Cross-Modal Contrastive Representation Learning (CMCRL) to extract useful features from audios and use it in the generation phase. Experimental results show that CMCRL enhances quality of images generated than previous research."
Defining an action of SO(d)-rotations on images generated by projections of d-dimensional objects: Applications to pose inference with Geometric VAEs,"Recent advances in variational autoencoders (VAEs) have enabled learning latent manifolds as compact Lie groups, such as SO(d). Since this approach assumes that data lies on a subspace that is homeomorphic to the Lie group itself, we here investigate how this assumption holds in the context of images that are generated by projecting a d-dimensional volume with unknown pose in SO(d). Upon examining different theoretical candidates for the group and image space, we show that the attempt to define a group action on the data space generally fails, as it requires more specific geometric constraints on the volume. Using geometric VAEs, our experiments confirm that this constraint is key to proper pose inference, and we discuss the potential of these results for applications and future work."
Accelerated and Quantitative 3D Semisolid MT/CEST Imaging using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN-CEST),"Purpose: To substantially shorten the acquisition time required for quantitative 3D chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) and semisolid magnetization transfer (MT) imaging and allow for rapid chemical exchange parameter map reconstruction. Methods: Three-dimensional CEST and MT magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) datasets of L-arginine phantoms, whole-brains, and calf muscles from healthy volunteers, cancer patients, and cardiac patients were acquired using 3T clinical scanners at 3 different sites, using 3 different scanner models and coils. A generative adversarial network supervised framework (GAN-CEST) was then designed and trained to learn the mapping from a reduced input data space to the quantitative exchange parameter space, while preserving perceptual and quantitative content. Results: The GAN-CEST 3D acquisition time was 42-52 seconds, 70% shorter than CEST-MRF. The quantitative reconstruction of the entire brain took 0.8 seconds. An excellent agreement was observed between the ground truth and GAN-based L-arginine concentration and pH values (Pearson's r > 0.97, NRMSE < 1.5%). GAN-CEST images from a brain-tumor subject yielded a semi-solid volume fraction and exchange rate NRMSE of 3.8\pm1.3% and 4.6\pm1.3%, respectively, and SSIM of 96.3\pm1.6% and 95.0\pm2.4%, respectively. The mapping of the calf-muscle exchange parameters in a cardiac patient, yielded NRMSE < 7% and SSIM > 94% for the semi-solid exchange parameters. In regions with large susceptibility artifacts, GAN-CEST has demonstrated improved performance and reduced noise compared to MRF. Conclusion: GAN-CEST can substantially reduce the acquisition time for quantitative semisolid MT/CEST mapping, while retaining performance even when facing pathologies and scanner models that were not available during training."
FewGAN: Generating from the Joint Distribution of a Few Images,"We introduce FewGAN, a generative model for generating novel, high-quality and diverse images whose patch distribution lies in the joint patch distribution of a small number of N>1 training samples. The method is, in essence, a hierarchical patch-GAN that applies quantization at the first coarse scale, in a similar fashion to VQ-GAN, followed by a pyramid of residual fully convolutional GANs at finer scales. Our key idea is to first use quantization to learn a fixed set of patch embeddings for training images. We then use a separate set of side images to model the structure of generated images using an autoregressive model trained on the learned patch embeddings of training images. Using quantization at the coarsest scale allows the model to generate both conditional and unconditional novel images. Subsequently, a patch-GAN renders the fine details, resulting in high-quality images. In an extensive set of experiments, it is shown that FewGAN outperforms baselines both quantitatively and qualitatively."
InfiniteNature-Zero: Learning Perpetual View Generation of Natural Scenes from Single Images,"We present a method for learning to generate unbounded flythrough videos of natural scenes starting from a single view, where this capability is learned from a collection of single photographs, without requiring camera poses or even multiple views of each scene. To achieve this, we propose a novel self-supervised view generation training paradigm, where we sample and rendering virtual camera trajectories, including cyclic ones, allowing our model to learn stable view generation from a collection of single views. At test time, despite never seeing a video during training, our approach can take a single image and generate long camera trajectories comprised of hundreds of new views with realistic and diverse content. We compare our approach with recent state-of-the-art supervised view generation methods that require posed multi-view videos and demonstrate superior performance and synthesis quality."
Learning Generalized Non-Rigid Multimodal Biomedical Image Registration from Generic Point Set Data,"Free Point Transformer (FPT) has been proposed as a data-driven, non-rigid point set registration approach using deep neural networks. As FPT does not assume constraints based on point vicinity or correspondence, it may be trained simply and in a flexible manner by minimizing an unsupervised loss based on the Chamfer Distance. This makes FPT amenable to real-world medical imaging applications where ground-truth deformations may be infeasible to obtain, or in scenarios where only a varying degree of completeness in the point sets to be aligned is available. To test the limit of the correspondence finding ability of FPT and its dependency on training data sets, this work explores the generalizability of the FPT from well-curated non-medical data sets to medical imaging data sets. First, we train FPT on the ModelNet40 dataset to demonstrate its effectiveness and the superior registration performance of FPT over iterative and learning-based point set registration methods. Second, we demonstrate superior performance in rigid and non-rigid registration and robustness to missing data. Last, we highlight the interesting generalizability of the ModelNet-trained FPT by registering reconstructed freehand ultrasound scans of the spine and generic spine models without additional training, whereby the average difference to the ground truth curvatures is 1.3 degrees, across 13 patients."
Few-shot Image Generation Using Discrete Content Representation,"Few-shot image generation and few-shot image translation are two related tasks, both of which aim to generate new images for an unseen category with only a few images. In this work, we make the first attempt to adapt few-shot image translation method to few-shot image generation task. Few-shot image translation disentangles an image into style vector and content map. An unseen style vector can be combined with different seen content maps to produce different images. However, it needs to store seen images to provide content maps and the unseen style vector may be incompatible with seen content maps. To adapt it to few-shot image generation task, we learn a compact dictionary of local content vectors via quantizing continuous content maps into discrete content maps instead of storing seen images. Furthermore, we model the autoregressive distribution of discrete content map conditioned on style vector, which can alleviate the incompatibility between content map and style vector. Qualitative and quantitative results on three real datasets demonstrate that our model can produce images of higher diversity and fidelity for unseen categories than previous methods."
Generative Multiplane Images: Making a 2D GAN 3D-Aware,"What is really needed to make an existing 2D GAN 3D-aware? To answer this question, we modify a classical GAN, i.e., StyleGANv2, as little as possible. We find that only two modifications are absolutely necessary: 1) a multiplane image style generator branch which produces a set of alpha maps conditioned on their depth; 2) a pose-conditioned discriminator. We refer to the generated output as a 'generative multiplane image' (GMPI) and emphasize that its renderings are not only high-quality but also guaranteed to be view-consistent, which makes GMPIs different from many prior works. Importantly, the number of alpha maps can be dynamically adjusted and can differ between training and inference, alleviating memory concerns and enabling fast training of GMPIs in less than half a day at a resolution of 1024^2. Our findings are consistent across three challenging and common high-resolution datasets, including FFHQ, AFHQv2, and MetFaces."
A Survey on Leveraging Pre-trained Generative Adversarial Networks for Image Editing and Restoration,"Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have drawn enormous attention due to the simple yet effective training mechanism and superior image generation quality. With the ability to generate photo-realistic high-resolution (e.g., 1024\times1024) images, recent GAN models have greatly narrowed the gaps between the generated images and the real ones. Therefore, many recent works show emerging interest to take advantage of pre-trained GAN models by exploiting the well-disentangled latent space and the learned GAN priors. In this paper, we briefly review recent progress on leveraging pre-trained large-scale GAN models from three aspects, i.e., 1) the training of large-scale generative adversarial networks, 2) exploring and understanding the pre-trained GAN models, and 3) leveraging these models for subsequent tasks like image restoration and editing. More information about relevant methods and repositories can be found at https://github.com/csmliu/pretrained-GANs."
Image Generation Network for Covert Transmission in Online Social Network,"Online social networks have stimulated communications over the Internet more than ever, making it possible for secret message transmission over such noisy channels. In this paper, we propose a Coverless Image Steganography Network, called CIS-Net, that synthesizes a high-quality image directly conditioned on the secret message to transfer. CIS-Net is composed of four modules, namely, the Generation, Adversarial, Extraction, and Noise Module. The receiver can extract the hidden message without any loss even the images have been distorted by JPEG compression attacks. To disguise the behaviour of steganography, we collected images in the context of profile photos and stickers and train our network accordingly. As such, the generated images are more inclined to escape from malicious detection and attack. The distinctions from previous image steganography methods are majorly the robustness and losslessness against diverse attacks. Experiments over diverse public datasets have manifested the superior ability of anti-steganalysis."
DeltaGAN: Towards Diverse Few-shot Image Generation with Sample-Specific Delta,"Learning to generate new images for a novel category based on only a few images, named as few-shot image generation, has attracted increasing research interest. Several state-of-the-art works have yielded impressive results, but the diversity is still limited. In this work, we propose a novel Delta Generative Adversarial Network (DeltaGAN), which consists of a reconstruction subnetwork and a generation subnetwork. The reconstruction subnetwork captures intra-category transformation, i.e., delta, between same-category pairs. The generation subnetwork generates sample-specific delta for an input image, which is combined with this input image to generate a new image within the same category. Besides, an adversarial delta matching loss is designed to link the above two subnetworks together. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our code is available at https://github.com/bcmi/DeltaGAN-Few-Shot-Image-Generation."
Interpreting Latent Spaces of Generative Models for Medical Images using Unsupervised Methods,"Generative models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) play an increasingly important role in medical image analysis. The latent spaces of these models often show semantically meaningful directions corresponding to human-interpretable image transformations. However, until now, their exploration for medical images has been limited due to the requirement of supervised data. Several methods for unsupervised discovery of interpretable directions in GAN latent spaces have shown interesting results on natural images. This work explores the potential of applying these techniques on medical images by training a GAN and a VAE on thoracic CT scans and using an unsupervised method to discover interpretable directions in the resulting latent space. We find several directions corresponding to non-trivial image transformations, such as rotation or breast size. Furthermore, the directions show that the generative models capture 3D structure despite being presented only with 2D data. The results show that unsupervised methods to discover interpretable directions in GANs generalize to VAEs and can be applied to medical images. This opens a wide array of future work using these methods in medical image analysis."
BigColor: Colorization using a Generative Color Prior for Natural Images,"For realistic and vivid colorization, generative priors have recently been exploited. However, such generative priors often fail for in-the-wild complex images due to their limited representation space. In this paper, we propose BigColor, a novel colorization approach that provides vivid colorization for diverse in-the-wild images with complex structures. While previous generative priors are trained to synthesize both image structures and colors, we learn a generative color prior to focus on color synthesis given the spatial structure of an image. In this way, we reduce the burden of synthesizing image structures from the generative prior and expand its representation space to cover diverse images. To this end, we propose a BigGAN-inspired encoder-generator network that uses a spatial feature map instead of a spatially-flattened BigGAN latent code, resulting in an enlarged representation space. Our method enables robust colorization for diverse inputs in a single forward pass, supports arbitrary input resolutions, and provides multi-modal colorization results. We demonstrate that BigColor significantly outperforms existing methods especially on in-the-wild images with complex structures."
Global-Local Stepwise Generative Network for Ultra High-Resolution Image Restoration,"While the research on image background restoration from regular size of degraded images has achieved remarkable progress, restoring ultra high-resolution (e.g., 4K) images remains an extremely challenging task due to the explosion of computational complexity and memory usage, as well as the deficiency of annotated data. In this paper we present a novel model for ultra high-resolution image restoration, referred to as the Global-Local Stepwise Generative Network (GLSGN), which employs a stepwise restoring strategy involving four restoring pathways: three local pathways and one global pathway. The local pathways focus on conducting image restoration in a fine-grained manner over local but high-resolution image patches, while the global pathway performs image restoration coarsely on the scale-down but intact image to provide cues for the local pathways in a global view including semantics and noise patterns. To smooth the mutual collaboration between these four pathways, our GLSGN is designed to ensure the inter-pathway consistency in four aspects in terms of low-level content, perceptual attention, restoring intensity and high-level semantics, respectively. As another major contribution of this work, we also introduce the first ultra high-resolution dataset to date for both reflection removal and rain streak removal, comprising 4,670 real-world and synthetic images. Extensive experiments across three typical tasks for image background restoration, including image reflection removal, image rain streak removal and image dehazing, show that our GLSGN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods."
Effect of Instance Normalization on Fine-Grained Control for Sketch-Based Face Image Generation,"Sketching is an intuitive and effective way for content creation. While significant progress has been made for photorealistic image generation by using generative adversarial networks, it remains challenging to take a fine-grained control on synthetic content. The instance normalization layer, which is widely adopted in existing image translation networks, washes away details in the input sketch and leads to loss of precise control on the desired shape of the generated face images. In this paper, we comprehensively investigate the effect of instance normalization on generating photorealistic face images from hand-drawn sketches. We first introduce a visualization approach to analyze the feature embedding for sketches with a group of specific changes. Based on the visual analysis, we modify the instance normalization layers in the baseline image translation model. We elaborate a new set of hand-drawn sketches with 11 categories of specially designed changes and conduct extensive experimental analysis. The results and user studies demonstrate that our method markedly improve the quality of synthesized images and the conformance with user intention."
Single MR Image Super-Resolution using Generative Adversarial Network,"Spatial resolution of medical images can be improved using super-resolution methods. Real Enhanced Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (Real-ESRGAN) is one of the recent effective approaches utilized to produce higher resolution images, given input images of lower resolution. In this paper, we apply this method to enhance the spatial resolution of 2D MR images. In our proposed approach, we slightly modify the structure of the Real-ESRGAN to train 2D Magnetic Resonance images (MRI) taken from the Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge (BraTS) 2018 dataset. The obtained results are validated qualitatively and quantitatively by computing SSIM (Structural Similarity Index Measure), NRMSE (Normalized Root Mean Square Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), and VIF (Visual Information Fidelity) values."
Structural Prior Guided Generative Adversarial Transformers for Low-Light Image Enhancement,"We propose an effective Structural Prior guided Generative Adversarial Transformer (SPGAT) to solve low-light image enhancement. Our SPGAT mainly contains a generator with two discriminators and a structural prior estimator (SPE). The generator is based on a U-shaped Transformer which is used to explore non-local information for better clear image restoration. The SPE is used to explore useful structures from images to guide the generator for better structural detail estimation. To generate more realistic images, we develop a new structural prior guided adversarial learning method by building the skip connections between the generator and discriminators so that the discriminators can better discriminate between real and fake features. Finally, we propose a parallel windows-based Swin Transformer block to aggregate different level hierarchical features for high-quality image restoration. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SPGAT performs favorably against recent state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets."
WaveGAN: Frequency-aware GAN for High-Fidelity Few-shot Image Generation,"Existing few-shot image generation approaches typically employ fusion-based strategies, either on the image or the feature level, to produce new images. However, previous approaches struggle to synthesize high-frequency signals with fine details, deteriorating the synthesis quality. To address this, we propose WaveGAN, a frequency-aware model for few-shot image generation. Concretely, we disentangle encoded features into multiple frequency components and perform low-frequency skip connections to preserve outline and structural information. Then we alleviate the generator's struggles of synthesizing fine details by employing high-frequency skip connections, thus providing informative frequency information to the generator. Moreover, we utilize a frequency L1-loss on the generated and real images to further impede frequency information loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and advancement of our method on three datasets. Noticeably, we achieve new state-of-the-art with FID 42.17, LPIPS 0.3868, FID 30.35, LPIPS 0.5076, and FID 4.96, LPIPS 0.3822 respectively on Flower, Animal Faces, and VGGFace.

Accurate Ground-Truth Depth Image Generation via Overfit Training of Point Cloud Registration using Local Frame Sets,"Accurate three-dimensional perception is a fundamental task in several computer vision applications. Recently, commercial RGB-depth (RGB-D) cameras have been widely adopted as single-view depth-sensing devices owing to their efficient depth-sensing abilities. However, the depth quality of most RGB-D sensors remains insufficient owing to the inherent noise from a single-view environment. Recently, several studies have focused on the single-view depth enhancement of RGB-D cameras. Recent research has proposed deep-learning-based approaches that typically train networks using high-quality supervised depth datasets, which indicates that the quality of the ground-truth (GT) depth dataset is a top-most important factor for accurate system; however, such high-quality GT datasets are difficult to obtain. In this study, we developed a novel method for high-quality GT depth generation based on an RGB-D stream dataset. First, we defined consecutive depth frames in a local spatial region as a local frame set. Then, the depth frames were aligned to a certain frame in the local frame set using an unsupervised point cloud registration scheme. The registration parameters were trained based on an overfit-training scheme, which was primarily used to construct a single GT depth image for each frame set. The final GT depth dataset was constructed using several local frame sets, and each local frame set was trained independently. The primary advantage of this study is that a high-quality GT depth dataset can be constructed under various scanning environments using only the RGB-D stream dataset. Moreover, our proposed method can be used as a new benchmark GT dataset for accurate performance evaluations. We evaluated our GT dataset on previously benchmarked GT depth datasets and demonstrated that our method is superior to state-of-the-art depth enhancement frameworks."
A General Framework for Partial to Full Image Registration,"Image registration is a research field in which images must be compared and aligned independently of the point of view or camera characteristics. In some applications (such as forensic biometrics, satellite photography or outdoor scene identification) classical image registration systems fail due to one of the images compared represents a tiny piece of the other image. For instance, in forensics palmprint recognition, it is usual to find only a small piece of the palmprint, but in the database, the whole palmprint has been enrolled. The main reason of the poor behaviour of classical image registration methods is the gap between the amounts of salient points of both images, which is related to the number of points to be considered as outliers. Usually, the difficulty of finding a good match increases when the image that represents the tiny part of the scene has been drastically rotated. Again, in the case of palmprint forensics, it is difficult to decide a priori the orientation of the found tiny palmprint image. We present a rotation invariant registration method that explicitly considers that the image to be matched is a small piece of a larger image. We have experimentally validated our method in two different scenarios; palmprint identification and outdoor image registration."
DynaST: Dynamic Sparse Transformer for Exemplar-Guided Image Generation,"One key challenge of exemplar-guided image generation lies in establishing fine-grained correspondences between input and guided images. Prior approaches, despite the promising results, have relied on either estimating dense attention to compute per-point matching, which is limited to only coarse scales due to the quadratic memory cost, or fixing the number of correspondences to achieve linear complexity, which lacks flexibility. In this paper, we propose a dynamic sparse attention based Transformer model, termed Dynamic Sparse Transformer (DynaST), to achieve fine-level matching with favorable efficiency. The heart of our approach is a novel dynamic-attention unit, dedicated to covering the variation on the optimal number of tokens one position should focus on. Specifically, DynaST leverages the multi-layer nature of Transformer structure, and performs the dynamic attention scheme in a cascaded manner to refine matching results and synthesize visually-pleasing outputs. In addition, we introduce a unified training objective for DynaST, making it a versatile reference-based image translation framework for both supervised and unsupervised scenarios. Extensive experiments on three applications, pose-guided person image generation, edge-based face synthesis, and undistorted image style transfer, demonstrate that DynaST achieves superior performance in local details, outperforming the state of the art while reducing the computational cost significantly. Our code is available at https://github.com/Huage001/DynaST"
GANzzle: Reframing jigsaw puzzle solving as a retrieval task using a generative mental image,"Puzzle solving is a combinatorial challenge due to the difficulty of matching adjacent pieces. Instead, we infer a mental image from all pieces, which a given piece can then be matched against avoiding the combinatorial explosion. Exploiting advancements in Generative Adversarial methods, we learn how to reconstruct the image given a set of unordered pieces, allowing the model to learn a joint embedding space to match an encoding of each piece to the cropped layer of the generator. Therefore we frame the problem as a R@1 retrieval task, and then solve the linear assignment using differentiable Hungarian attention, making the process end-to-end. In doing so our model is puzzle size agnostic, in contrast to prior deep learning methods which are single size. We evaluate on two new large-scale datasets, where our model is on par with deep learning methods, while generalizing to multiple puzzle sizes."
Hyper-Universal Policy Approximation: Learning to Generate Actions from a Single Image using Hypernets,"Inspired by Gibson's notion of object affordances in human vision, we ask the question: how can an agent learn to predict an entire action policy for a novel object or environment given only a single glimpse? To tackle this problem, we introduce the concept of Universal Policy Functions (UPFs) which are state-to-action mappings that generalize not only to new goals but most importantly to novel, unseen environments. Specifically, we consider the problem of efficiently learning such policies for agents with limited computational and communication capacity, constraints that are frequently encountered in edge devices. We propose the Hyper-Universal Policy Approximator (HUPA), a hypernetwork-based model to generate small task- and environment-conditional policy networks from a single image, with good generalization properties. Our results show that HUPAs significantly outperform an embedding-based alternative for generated policies that are size-constrained. Although this work is restricted to a simple map-based navigation task, future work includes applying the principles behind HUPAs to learning more general affordances for objects and environments."
A Novel Unified Conditional Score-based Generative Framework for Multi-modal Medical Image Completion,"Multi-modal medical image completion has been extensively applied to alleviate the missing modality issue in a wealth of multi-modal diagnostic tasks. However, for most existing synthesis methods, their inferences of missing modalities can collapse into a deterministic mapping from the available ones, ignoring the uncertainties inherent in the cross-modal relationships. Here, we propose the Unified Multi-Modal Conditional Score-based Generative Model (UMM-CSGM) to take advantage of Score-based Generative Model (SGM) in modeling and stochastically sampling a target probability distribution, and further extend SGM to cross-modal conditional synthesis for various missing-modality configurations in a unified framework. Specifically, UMM-CSGM employs a novel multi-in multi-out Conditional Score Network (mm-CSN) to learn a comprehensive set of cross-modal conditional distributions via conditional diffusion and reverse generation in the complete modality space. In this way, the generation process can be accurately conditioned by all available information, and can fit all possible configurations of missing modalities in a single network. Experiments on BraTS19 dataset show that the UMM-CSGM can more reliably synthesize the heterogeneous enhancement and irregular area in tumor-induced lesions for any missing modalities."
A simple normalization technique using window statistics to improve the out-of-distribution generalization on medical images,"Since data scarcity and data heterogeneity are prevailing for medical images, well-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using previous normalization methods may perform poorly when deployed to a new site. However, a reliable model for real-world clinical applications should be able to generalize well both on in-distribution (IND) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data (e.g., the new site data). In this study, we present a novel normalization technique called window normalization (WIN) to improve the model generalization on heterogeneous medical images, which is a simple yet effective alternative to existing normalization methods. Specifically, WIN perturbs the normalizing statistics with the local statistics computed on the window of features. This feature-level augmentation technique regularizes the models well and improves their OOD generalization significantly. Taking its advantage, we propose a novel self-distillation method called WIN-WIN for classification tasks. WIN-WIN is easily implemented with twice forward passes and a consistency constraint, which can be a simple extension for existing methods. Extensive experimental results on various tasks (6 tasks) and datasets (24 datasets) demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of our methods."
Text to Image Synthesis using Stacked Conditional Variational Autoencoders and Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks,"Synthesizing a realistic image from textual description is a major challenge in computer vision. Current text to image synthesis approaches falls short of producing a highresolution image that represent a text descriptor. Most existing studies rely either on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or Variational Auto Encoders (VAEs). GANs has the capability to produce sharper images but lacks the diversity of outputs, whereas VAEs are good at producing a diverse range of outputs, but the images generated are often blurred. Taking into account the relative advantages of both GANs and VAEs, we proposed a new stacked Conditional VAE (CVAE) and Conditional GAN (CGAN) network architecture for synthesizing images conditioned on a text description. This study uses Conditional VAEs as an initial generator to produce a high-level sketch of the text descriptor. This high-level sketch output from first stage and a text descriptor is used as an input to the conditional GAN network. The second stage GAN produces a 256x256 high resolution image. The proposed architecture benefits from a conditioning augmentation and a residual block on the Conditional GAN network to achieve the results. Multiple experiments were conducted using CUB and Oxford-102 dataset and the result of the proposed approach is compared against state-ofthe-art techniques such as StackGAN. The experiments illustrate that the proposed method generates a high-resolution image conditioned on text descriptions and yield competitive results based on Inception and Frechet Inception Score using both datasets"
Dual Stream Computer-Generated Image Detection Network Based On Channel Joint And Softpool,"With the development of computer graphics technology, the images synthesized by computer software become more and more closer to the photographs. While computer graphics technology brings us a grand visual feast in the field of games and movies, it may also be utilized by someone with bad intentions to guide public opinions and cause political crisis or social unrest. Therefore, how to distinguish the computer-generated graphics (CG) from the photographs (PG) has become an important topic in the field of digital image forensics. This paper proposes a dual stream convolutional neural network based on channel joint and softpool. The proposed network architecture includes a residual module for extracting image noise information and a joint channel information extraction module for capturing the shallow semantic information of image. In addition, we also design a residual structure to enhance feature extraction and reduce the loss of information in residual flow. The joint channel information extraction module can obtain the shallow semantic information of the input image which can be used as the information supplement block of the residual module. The whole network uses SoftPool to reduce the information loss of down-sampling for image. Finally, we fuse the two flows to get the classification results. Experiments on SPL2018 and DsTok show that the proposed method outperforms existing methods, especially on the DsTok dataset. For example, the performance of our model surpasses the state-of-the-art by a large margin of 3%."
Improving Few-Shot Image Classification Using Machine- and User-Generated Natural Language Descriptions,"Humans can obtain the knowledge of novel visual concepts from language descriptions, and we thus use the few-shot image classification task to investigate whether a machine learning model can have this capability. Our proposed model, LIDE (Learning from Image and DEscription), has a text decoder to generate the descriptions and a text encoder to obtain the text representations of machine- or user-generated descriptions. We confirmed that LIDE with machine-generated descriptions outperformed baseline models. Moreover, the performance was improved further with high-quality user-generated descriptions. The generated descriptions can be viewed as the explanations of the model's predictions, and we observed that such explanations were consistent with prediction results. We also investigated why the language description improved the few-shot image classification performance by comparing the image representations and the text representations in the feature spaces."
Exploring Generative Adversarial Networks for Text-to-Image Generation with Evolution Strategies,"In the context of generative models, text-to-image generation achieved impressive results in recent years. Models using different approaches were proposed and trained in huge datasets of pairs of texts and images. However, some methods rely on pre-trained models such as Generative Adversarial Networks, searching through the latent space of the generative model by using a gradient-based approach to update the latent vector, relying on loss functions such as the cosine similarity. In this work, we follow a different direction by proposing the use of Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy to explore the latent space of Generative Adversarial Networks. We compare this approach to the one using Adam and a hybrid strategy. We design an experimental study to compare the three approaches using different text inputs for image generation by adapting an evaluation method based on the projection of the resulting samples into a two-dimensional grid to inspect the diversity of the distributions. The results evidence that the evolutionary method achieves more diversity in the generation of samples, exploring different regions of the resulting grids. Besides, we show that the hybrid method combines the explored areas of the gradient-based and evolutionary approaches, leveraging the quality of the results."
Latents2Segments: Disentangling the Latent Space of Generative Models for Semantic Segmentation of Face Images,"With the advent of an increasing number of Augmented and Virtual Reality applications that aim to perform meaningful and controlled style edits on images of human faces, the impetus for the task of parsing face images to produce accurate and fine-grained semantic segmentation maps is more than ever before. Few State of the Art (SOTA) methods which solve this problem, do so by incorporating priors with respect to facial structure or other face attributes such as expression and pose in their deep classifier architecture. Our endeavour in this work is to do away with the priors and complex pre-processing operations required by SOTA multi-class face segmentation models by reframing this operation as a downstream task post infusion of disentanglement with respect to facial semantic regions of interest (ROIs) in the latent space of a Generative Autoencoder model. We present results for our model's performance on the CelebAMask-HQ and HELEN datasets. The encoded latent space of our model achieves significantly higher disentanglement with respect to semantic ROIs than that of other SOTA works. Moreover, it achieves a 13% faster inference rate and comparable accuracy with respect to the publicly available SOTA for the downstream task of semantic segmentation of face images."
ReMix: A General and Efficient Framework for Multiple Instance Learning based Whole Slide Image Classification,"Whole slide image (WSI) classification often relies on deep weakly supervised multiple instance learning (MIL) methods to handle gigapixel resolution images and slide-level labels. Yet the decent performance of deep learning comes from harnessing massive datasets and diverse samples, urging the need for efficient training pipelines for scaling to large datasets and data augmentation techniques for diversifying samples. However, current MIL-based WSI classification pipelines are memory-expensive and computation-inefficient since they usually assemble tens of thousands of patches as bags for computation. On the other hand, despite their popularity in other tasks, data augmentations are unexplored for WSI MIL frameworks. To address them, we propose ReMix, a general and efficient framework for MIL based WSI classification. It comprises two steps: reduce and mix. First, it reduces the number of instances in WSI bags by substituting instances with instance prototypes, i.e., patch cluster centroids. Then, we propose a ``Mix-the-bag'' augmentation that contains four online, stochastic and flexible latent space augmentations. It brings diverse and reliable class-identity-preserving semantic changes in the latent space while enforcing semantic-perturbation invariance. We evaluate ReMix on two public datasets with two state-of-the-art MIL methods. In our experiments, consistent improvements in precision, accuracy, and recall have been achieved but with orders of magnitude reduced training time and memory consumption, demonstrating ReMix's effectiveness and efficiency. Code is available."
SKIPP'D: a SKy Images and Photovoltaic Power Generation Dataset for Short-term Solar Forecasting,"Large-scale integration of photovoltaics (PV) into electricity grids is challenged by the intermittent nature of solar power. Sky-image-based solar forecasting using deep learning has been recognized as a promising approach to predicting the short-term fluctuations. However, there are few publicly available standardized benchmark datasets for image-based solar forecasting, which limits the comparison of different forecasting models and the exploration of forecasting methods. To fill these gaps, we introduce SKIPP'D -- a SKy Images and Photovoltaic Power Generation Dataset. The dataset contains three years (2017-2019) of quality-controlled down-sampled sky images and PV power generation data that is ready-to-use for short-term solar forecasting using deep learning. In addition, to support the flexibility in research, we provide the high resolution, high frequency sky images and PV power generation data as well as the concurrent sky video footage. We also include a code base containing data processing scripts and baseline model implementations for researchers to reproduce our previous work and accelerate their research in solar forecasting."
Transforming Image Generation from Scene Graphs,"Generating images from semantic visual knowledge is a challenging task, that can be useful to condition the synthesis process in complex, subtle, and unambiguous ways, compared to alternatives such as class labels or text descriptions. Although generative methods conditioned by semantic representations exist, they do not provide a way to control the generation process aside from the specification of constraints between objects. As an example, the possibility to iteratively generate or modify images by manually adding specific items is a desired property that, to our knowledge, has not been fully investigated in the literature. In this work we propose a transformer-based approach conditioned by scene graphs that, conversely to recent transformer-based methods, also employs a decoder to autoregressively compose images, making the synthesis process more effective and controllable. The proposed architecture is composed by three modules: 1) a graph convolutional network, to encode the relationships of the input graph; 2) an encoder-decoder transformer, which autoregressively composes the output image; 3) an auto-encoder, employed to generate representations used as input/output of each generation step by the transformer. Results obtained on CIFAR10 and MNIST images show that our model is able to satisfy semantic constraints defined by a scene graph and to model relations between visual objects in the scene by taking into account a user-provided partial rendering of the desired target."
Generative Adversarial Networks and Image-Based Malware Classification,"For efficient malware removal, determination of malware threat levels, and damage estimation, malware family classification plays a critical role. In this paper, we extract features from malware executable files and represent them as images using various approaches. We then focus on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for multiclass classification and compare our GAN results to other popular machine learning techniques, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), XGBoost, and Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM). We find that the AC-GAN discriminator is generally competitive with other machine learning techniques. We also evaluate the utility of the GAN generative model for adversarial attacks on image-based malware detection. While AC-GAN generated images are visually impressive, we find that they are easily distinguished from real malware images using any of several learning techniques. This result indicates that our GAN generated images would be of little value in adversarial attacks."
MultiEarth 2022 -- The Champion Solution for Image-to-Image Translation Challenge via Generation Models,"The MultiEarth 2022 Image-to-Image Translation challenge provides a well-constrained test bed for generating the corresponding RGB Sentinel-2 imagery with the given Sentinel-1 VV & VH imagery. In this challenge, we designed various generation models and found the SPADE [1] and pix2pixHD [2] models could perform our best results. In our self-evaluation, the SPADE-2 model with L1-loss can achieve 0.02194 MAE score and 31.092 PSNR dB. In our final submission, the best model can achieve 0.02795 MAE score ranked No.1 on the leader board."
Single-domain Generalization in Medical Image Segmentation via Test-time Adaptation from Shape Dictionary,"Domain generalization typically requires data from multiple source domains for model learning. However, such strong assumption may not always hold in practice, especially in medical field where the data sharing is highly concerned and sometimes prohibitive due to privacy issue. This paper studies the important yet challenging single domain generalization problem, in which a model is learned under the worst-case scenario with only one source domain to directly generalize to different unseen target domains. We present a novel approach to address this problem in medical image segmentation, which extracts and integrates the semantic shape prior information of segmentation that are invariant across domains and can be well-captured even from single domain data to facilitate segmentation under distribution shifts. Besides, a test-time adaptation strategy with dual-consistency regularization is further devised to promote dynamic incorporation of these shape priors under each unseen domain to improve model generalizability. Extensive experiments on two medical image segmentation tasks demonstrate the consistent improvements of our method across various unseen domains, as well as its superiority over state-of-the-art approaches in addressing domain generalization under the worst-case scenario."
Adversarial Consistency for Single Domain Generalization in Medical Image Segmentation,"An organ segmentation method that can generalize to unseen contrasts and scanner settings can significantly reduce the need for retraining of deep learning models. Domain Generalization (DG) aims to achieve this goal. However, most DG methods for segmentation require training data from multiple domains during training. We propose a novel adversarial domain generalization method for organ segmentation trained on data from a \emph{single} domain. We synthesize the new domains via learning an adversarial domain synthesizer (ADS) and presume that the synthetic domains cover a large enough area of plausible distributions so that unseen domains can be interpolated from synthetic domains. We propose a mutual information regularizer to enforce the semantic consistency between images from the synthetic domains, which can be estimated by patch-level contrastive learning. We evaluate our method for various organ segmentation for unseen modalities, scanning protocols, and scanner sites."
Mushroom image recognition and distance generation based on attention-mechanism model and genetic information,"The species identification of Macrofungi, i.e. mushrooms, has always been a challenging task. There are still a large number of poisonous mushrooms that have not been found, which poses a risk to people's life. However, the traditional identification method requires a large number of experts with knowledge in the field of taxonomy for manual identification, it is not only inefficient but also consumes a lot of manpower and capital costs. In this paper, we propose a new model based on attention-mechanism, MushroomNet, which applies the lightweight network MobileNetV3 as the backbone model, combined with the attention structure proposed by us, and has achieved excellent performance in the mushroom recognition task. On the public dataset, the test accuracy of the MushroomNet model has reached 83.9%, and on the local dataset, the test accuracy has reached 77.4%. The proposed attention mechanisms well focused attention on the bodies of mushroom image for mixed channel attention and the attention heat maps visualized by Grad-CAM. Further, in this study, genetic distance was added to the mushroom image recognition task, the genetic distance was used as the representation space, and the genetic distance between each pair of mushroom species in the dataset was used as the embedding of the genetic distance representation space, so as to predict the image distance and species. identify. We found that using the MES activation function can predict the genetic distance of mushrooms very well, but the accuracy is lower than that of SoftMax. The proposed MushroomNet was demonstrated it shows great potential for automatic and online mushroom image and the proposed automatic procedure would assist and be a reference to traditional mushroom classification."
Diffusion Deformable Model for 4D Temporal Medical Image Generation,"Temporal volume images with 3D+t (4D) information are often used in medical imaging to statistically analyze temporal dynamics or capture disease progression. Although deep-learning-based generative models for natural images have been extensively studied, approaches for temporal medical image generation such as 4D cardiac volume data are limited. In this work, we present a novel deep learning model that generates intermediate temporal volumes between source and target volumes. Specifically, we propose a diffusion deformable model (DDM) by adapting the denoising diffusion probabilistic model that has recently been widely investigated for realistic image generation. Our proposed DDM is composed of the diffusion and the deformation modules so that DDM can learn spatial deformation information between the source and target volumes and provide a latent code for generating intermediate frames along a geodesic path. Once our model is trained, the latent code estimated from the diffusion module is simply interpolated and fed into the deformation module, which enables DDM to generate temporal frames along the continuous trajectory while preserving the topology of the source image. We demonstrate the proposed method with the 4D cardiac MR image generation between the diastolic and systolic phases for each subject. Compared to the existing deformation methods, our DDM achieves high performance on temporal volume generation."
Automatic Generation of Product-Image Sequence in E-commerce,"Product images are essential for providing desirable user experience in an e-commerce platform. For a platform with billions of products, it is extremely time-costly and labor-expensive to manually pick and organize qualified images. Furthermore, there are the numerous and complicated image rules that a product image needs to comply in order to be generated/selected. To address these challenges, in this paper, we present a new learning framework in order to achieve Automatic Generation of Product-Image Sequence (AGPIS) in e-commerce. To this end, we propose a Multi-modality Unified Image-sequence Classifier (MUIsC), which is able to simultaneously detect all categories of rule violations through learning. MUIsC leverages textual review feedback as the additional training target and utilizes product textual description to provide extra semantic information. Based on offline evaluations, we show that the proposed MUIsC significantly outperforms various baselines. Besides MUIsC, we also integrate some other important modules in the proposed framework, such as primary image selection, noncompliant content detection, and image deduplication. With all these modules, our framework works effectively and efficiently in JD.com recommendation platform. By Dec 2021, our AGPIS framework has generated high-standard images for about 1.5 million products and achieves 13.6% in reject rate."
Megapixel Image Generation with Step-Unrolled Denoising Autoencoders,"An ongoing trend in generative modelling research has been to push sample resolutions higher whilst simultaneously reducing computational requirements for training and sampling. We aim to push this trend further via the combination of techniques - each component representing the current pinnacle of efficiency in their respective areas. These include vector-quantized GAN (VQ-GAN), a vector-quantization (VQ) model capable of high levels of lossy - but perceptually insignificant - compression; hourglass transformers, a highly scaleable self-attention model; and step-unrolled denoising autoencoders (SUNDAE), a non-autoregressive (NAR) text generative model. Unexpectedly, our method highlights weaknesses in the original formulation of hourglass transformers when applied to multidimensional data. In light of this, we propose modifications to the resampling mechanism, applicable in any task applying hierarchical transformers to multidimensional data. Additionally, we demonstrate the scalability of SUNDAE to long sequence lengths - four times longer than prior work. Our proposed framework scales to high-resolutions (1024 \times 1024) and trains quickly (2-4 days). Crucially, the trained model produces diverse and realistic megapixel samples in approximately 2 seconds on a consumer-grade GPU (GTX 1080Ti). In general, the framework is flexible: supporting an arbitrary number of sampling steps, sample-wise self-stopping, self-correction capabilities, conditional generation, and a NAR formulation that allows for arbitrary inpainting masks. We obtain FID scores of 10.56 on FFHQ256 - close to the original VQ-GAN in less than half the sampling steps - and 21.85 on FFHQ1024 in only 100 sampling steps."
Scaling Autoregressive Models for Content-Rich Text-to-Image Generation,"We present the Pathways Autoregressive Text-to-Image (Parti) model, which generates high-fidelity photorealistic images and supports content-rich synthesis involving complex compositions and world knowledge. Parti treats text-to-image generation as a sequence-to-sequence modeling problem, akin to machine translation, with sequences of image tokens as the target outputs rather than text tokens in another language. This strategy can naturally tap into the rich body of prior work on large language models, which have seen continued advances in capabilities and performance through scaling data and model sizes. Our approach is simple: First, Parti uses a Transformer-based image tokenizer, ViT-VQGAN, to encode images as sequences of discrete tokens. Second, we achieve consistent quality improvements by scaling the encoder-decoder Transformer model up to 20B parameters, with a new state-of-the-art zero-shot FID score of 7.23 and finetuned FID score of 3.22 on MS-COCO. Our detailed analysis on Localized Narratives as well as PartiPrompts (P2), a new holistic benchmark of over 1600 English prompts, demonstrate the effectiveness of Parti across a wide variety of categories and difficulty aspects. We also explore and highlight limitations of our models in order to define and exemplify key areas of focus for further improvements. See https://parti.research.google/ for high-resolution images."
Test-time image-to-image translation ensembling improves out-of-distribution generalization in histopathology,"Histopathology whole slide images (WSIs) can reveal significant inter-hospital variability such as illumination, color or optical artifacts. These variations, caused by the use of different scanning protocols across medical centers (staining, scanner), can strongly harm algorithms generalization on unseen protocols. This motivates development of new methods to limit such drop of performances. In this paper, to enhance robustness on unseen target protocols, we propose a new test-time data augmentation based on multi domain image-to-image translation. It allows to project images from unseen protocol into each source domain before classifying them and ensembling the predictions. This test-time augmentation method results in a significant boost of performances for domain generalization. To demonstrate its effectiveness, our method has been evaluated on 2 different histopathology tasks where it outperforms conventional domain generalization, standard H&E specific color augmentation/normalization and standard test-time augmentation techniques. Our code is publicly available at https://gitlab.com/vitadx/articles/test-time-i2i-translation-ensembling."
Multi-Modality Image Inpainting using Generative Adversarial Networks,"Deep learning techniques, especially Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have significantly improved image inpainting and image-to-image translation tasks over the past few years. To the best of our knowledge, the problem of combining the image inpainting task with the multi-modality image-to-image translation remains intact. In this paper, we propose a model to address this problem. The model will be evaluated on combined night-to-day image translation and inpainting, along with promising qualitative and quantitative results."
Multi-Modality Image Super-Resolution using Generative Adversarial Networks,"Over the past few years deep learning-based techniques such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have significantly improved solutions to image super-resolution and image-to-image translation problems. In this paper, we propose a solution to the joint problem of image super-resolution and multi-modality image-to-image translation. The problem can be stated as the recovery of a high-resolution image in a modality, given a low-resolution observation of the same image in an alternative modality. Our paper offers two models to address this problem and will be evaluated on the recovery of high-resolution day images given low-resolution night images of the same scene. Promising qualitative and quantitative results will be presented for each model."
Replacing Labeled Real-image Datasets with Auto-generated Contours,"In the present work, we show that the performance of formula-driven supervised learning (FDSL) can match or even exceed that of ImageNet-21k without the use of real images, human-, and self-supervision during the pre-training of Vision Transformers (ViTs). For example, ViT-Base pre-trained on ImageNet-21k shows 81.8% top-1 accuracy when fine-tuned on ImageNet-1k and FDSL shows 82.7% top-1 accuracy when pre-trained under the same conditions (number of images, hyperparameters, and number of epochs). Images generated by formulas avoid the privacy/copyright issues, labeling cost and errors, and biases that real images suffer from, and thus have tremendous potential for pre-training general models. To understand the performance of the synthetic images, we tested two hypotheses, namely (i) object contours are what matter in FDSL datasets and (ii) increased number of parameters to create labels affects performance improvement in FDSL pre-training. To test the former hypothesis, we constructed a dataset that consisted of simple object contour combinations. We found that this dataset can match the performance of fractals. For the latter hypothesis, we found that increasing the difficulty of the pre-training task generally leads to better fine-tuning accuracy."
Minimum Noticeable Difference based Adversarial Privacy Preserving Image Generation,"Deep learning models are found to be vulnerable to adversarial examples, as wrong predictions can be caused by small perturbation in input for deep learning models. Most of the existing works of adversarial image generation try to achieve attacks for most models, while few of them make efforts on guaranteeing the perceptual quality of the adversarial examples. High quality adversarial examples matter for many applications, especially for the privacy preserving. In this work, we develop a framework based on the Minimum Noticeable Difference (MND) concept to generate adversarial privacy preserving images that have minimum perceptual difference from the clean ones but are able to attack deep learning models. To achieve this, an adversarial loss is firstly proposed to make the deep learning models attacked by the adversarial images successfully. Then, a perceptual quality-preserving loss is developed by taking the magnitude of perturbation and perturbation-caused structural and gradient changes into account, which aims to preserve high perceptual quality for adversarial image generation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on exploring quality-preserving adversarial image generation based on the MND concept for privacy preserving. To evaluate its performance in terms of perceptual quality, the deep models on image classification and face recognition are tested with the proposed method and several anchor methods in this work. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MND framework is capable of generating adversarial images with remarkably improved performance metrics (e.g., PSNR, SSIM, and MOS) than that generated with the anchor methods."
U-PET: MRI-based Dementia Detection with Joint Generation of Synthetic FDG-PET Images,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. An early detection is crucial for slowing down the disease and mitigating risks related to the progression. While the combination of MRI and FDG-PET is the best image-based tool for diagnosis, FDG-PET is not always available. The reliable detection of Alzheimer's disease with only MRI could be beneficial, especially in regions where FDG-PET might not be affordable for all patients. To this end, we propose a multi-task method based on U-Net that takes T1-weighted MR images as an input to generate synthetic FDG-PET images and classifies the dementia progression of the patient into cognitive normal (CN), cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD. The attention gates used in both task heads can visualize the most relevant parts of the brain, guiding the examiner and adding interpretability. Results show the successful generation of synthetic FDG-PET images and a performance increase in disease classification over the naive single-task baseline."
Discrete Contrastive Diffusion for Cross-Modal Music and Image Generation,"Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have become a popular approach to conditional generation, due to their promising results and support for cross-modal synthesis. A key desideratum in conditional synthesis is to achieve high correspondence between the conditioning input and generated output. Most existing methods learn such relationships implicitly, by incorporating the prior into the variational lower bound. In this work, we take a different route -- we explicitly enhance input-output connections by maximizing their mutual information. To this end, we introduce a Conditional Discrete Contrastive Diffusion (CDCD) loss and design two contrastive diffusion mechanisms to effectively incorporate it into the denoising process, combining the diffusion training and contrastive learning for the first time by connecting it with the conventional variational objectives. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in evaluations with diverse multimodal conditional synthesis tasks: dance-to-music generation, text-to-image synthesis, as well as class-conditioned image synthesis. On each, we enhance the input-output correspondence and achieve higher or competitive general synthesis quality. Furthermore, the proposed approach improves the convergence of diffusion models, reducing the number of required diffusion steps by more than 35% on two benchmarks, significantly increasing the inference speed."
GRAM-HD: 3D-Consistent Image Generation at High Resolution with Generative Radiance Manifolds,"Recent works have shown that 3D-aware GANs trained on unstructured single image collections can generate multiview images of novel instances. The key underpinnings to achieve this are a 3D radiance field generator and a volume rendering process. However, existing methods either cannot generate high-resolution images (e.g., up to 256X256) due to the high computation cost of neural volume rendering, or rely on 2D CNNs for image-space upsampling which jeopardizes the 3D consistency across different views. This paper proposes a novel 3D-aware GAN that can generate high resolution images (up to 1024X1024) while keeping strict 3D consistency as in volume rendering. Our motivation is to achieve super-resolution directly in the 3D space to preserve 3D consistency. We avoid the otherwise prohibitively-expensive computation cost by applying 2D convolutions on a set of 2D radiance manifolds defined in the recent generative radiance manifold (GRAM) approach, and apply dedicated loss functions for effective GAN training at high resolution. Experiments on FFHQ and AFHQv2 datasets show that our method can produce high-quality 3D-consistent results that significantly outperform existing methods."
"Vascular fluid-structure interaction: unified continuum formulation, image-based mesh generation pipeline, and scalable fully implicit solver technology","We propose a computational framework for vascular fluid-structure interaction (FSI), focusing on biomechanical modeling, geometric modeling, and solver technology. The biomechanical model is constructed based on the unified continuum formulation. We highlight that the chosen time integration scheme differs from existing implicit FSI integration methods in that it is indeed second-order accurate, does not suffer from the overshoot phenomenon, and optimally dissipates high-frequency modes in both subproblems. We propose a pipeline for generating subject-specific meshes for FSI analysis for anatomically realistic geometric modeling. Unlike most existing methodologies that operate directly on the wall surface mesh, our pipeline starts from the image segmentation stage. With high-quality surface meshes obtained, the volumetric meshes are then generated, guaranteeing a boundary-layered mesh in the fluid subdomain and a matching mesh across the fluid-solid interface. In the last, we propose a combined suite of nonlinear and linear solver technologies. Invoking a segregated algorithm within the Newton-Raphson iteration, the problem reduces to solving two linear systems in the multi-corrector stage. The first linear system can be addressed by the algebraic multigrid (AMG) method. The matrix related to the balance equations presents a two-by-two block structure in both subproblems. Using the Schur complement reduction (SCR) technique reduces the problem to solving matrices of smaller sizes of the elliptic type, and the AMG method again becomes a natural candidate. The benefit of the unified formulation is demonstrated in parallelizing the solution algorithms as the number of unknowns matches in both subdomains. We use the Greenshields-Weller benchmark as well as a patient-specific vascular model to demonstrate the robustness, efficiency, and scalability of the overall FSI solver technology."
Explaining Image Classifiers Using Contrastive Counterfactuals in Generative Latent Spaces,"Despite their high accuracies, modern complex image classifiers cannot be trusted for sensitive tasks due to their unknown decision-making process and potential biases. Counterfactual explanations are very effective in providing transparency for these black-box algorithms. Nevertheless, generating counterfactuals that can have a consistent impact on classifier outputs and yet expose interpretable feature changes is a very challenging task. We introduce a novel method to generate causal and yet interpretable counterfactual explanations for image classifiers using pretrained generative models without any re-training or conditioning. The generative models in this technique are not bound to be trained on the same data as the target classifier. We use this framework to obtain contrastive and causal sufficiency and necessity scores as global explanations for black-box classifiers. On the task of face attribute classification, we show how different attributes influence the classifier output by providing both causal and contrastive feature attributions, and the corresponding counterfactual images."
Denoising Generalized Expectation-Consistent Approximation for MR Image Recovery,"To solve inverse problems, plug-and-play (PnP) methods replace the proximal step in a convex optimization algorithm with a call to an application-specific denoiser, often implemented using a deep neural network (DNN). Although such methods yield accurate solutions, they can be improved. For example, denoisers are usually designed/trained to remove white Gaussian noise, but the denoiser input error in PnP algorithms is usually far from white or Gaussian. Approximate message passing (AMP) methods provide white and Gaussian denoiser input error, but only when the forward operator is sufficiently random. In this work, for Fourier-based forward operators, we propose a PnP algorithm based on generalized expectation-consistent (GEC) approximation -- a close cousin of AMP -- that offers predictable error statistics at each iteration, as well as a new DNN denoiser that leverages those statistics. We apply our approach to magnetic resonance (MR) image recovery and demonstrate its advantages over existing PnP and AMP methods."
Image Generation with Multimodal Priors using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models,"Image synthesis under multi-modal priors is a useful and challenging task that has received increasing attention in recent years. A major challenge in using generative models to accomplish this task is the lack of paired data containing all modalities (i.e. priors) and corresponding outputs. In recent work, a variational auto-encoder (VAE) model was trained in a weakly supervised manner to address this challenge. Since the generative power of VAEs is usually limited, it is difficult for this method to synthesize images belonging to complex distributions. To this end, we propose a solution based on a denoising diffusion probabilistic models to synthesise images under multi-model priors. Based on the fact that the distribution over each time step in the diffusion model is Gaussian, in this work we show that there exists a closed-form expression to the generate the image corresponds to the given modalities. The proposed solution does not require explicit retraining for all modalities and can leverage the outputs of individual modalities to generate realistic images according to different constraints. We conduct studies on two real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach"
Subjective Quality Assessment for Images Generated by Computer Graphics,"With the development of rendering techniques, computer graphics generated images (CGIs) have been widely used in practical application scenarios such as architecture design, video games, simulators, movies, etc. Different from natural scene images (NSIs), the distortions of CGIs are usually caused by poor rending settings and limited computation resources. What's more, some CGIs may also suffer from compression distortions in transmission systems like cloud gaming and stream media. However, limited work has been put forward to tackle the problem of computer graphics generated images' quality assessment (CG-IQA). Therefore, in this paper, we establish a large-scale subjective CG-IQA database to deal with the challenge of CG-IQA tasks. We collect 25,454 in-the-wild CGIs through previous databases and personal collection. After data cleaning, we carefully select 1,200 CGIs to conduct the subjective experiment. Several popular no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) methods are tested on our database. The experimental results show that the handcrafted-based methods achieve low correlation with subjective judgment and deep learning based methods obtain relatively better performance, which demonstrates that the current NR-IQA models are not suitable for CG-IQA tasks and more effective models are urgently needed."
Draft-and-Revise: Effective Image Generation with Contextual RQ-Transformer,"Although autoregressive models have achieved promising results on image generation, their unidirectional generation process prevents the resultant images from fully reflecting global contexts. To address the issue, we propose an effective image generation framework of Draft-and-Revise with Contextual RQ-transformer to consider global contexts during the generation process. As a generalized VQ-VAE, RQ-VAE first represents a high-resolution image as a sequence of discrete code stacks. After code stacks in the sequence are randomly masked, Contextual RQ-Transformer is trained to infill the masked code stacks based on the unmasked contexts of the image. Then, Contextual RQ-Transformer uses our two-phase decoding, Draft-and-Revise, and generates an image, while exploiting the global contexts of the image during the generation process. Specifically. in the draft phase, our model first focuses on generating diverse images despite rather low quality. Then, in the revise phase, the model iteratively improves the quality of images, while preserving the global contexts of generated images. In experiments, our method achieves state-of-the-art results on conditional image generation. We also validate that the Draft-and-Revise decoding can achieve high performance by effectively controlling the quality-diversity trade-off in image generation."
Accelerating Score-based Generative Models for High-Resolution Image Synthesis,"Score-based generative models (SGMs) have recently emerged as a promising class of generative models. The key idea is to produce high-quality images by recurrently adding Gaussian noises and gradients to a Gaussian sample until converging to the target distribution, a.k.a. the diffusion sampling. To ensure stability of convergence in sampling and generation quality, however, this sequential sampling process has to take a small step size and many sampling iterations (e.g., 2000). Several acceleration methods have been proposed with focus on low-resolution generation. In this work, we consider the acceleration of high-resolution generation with SGMs, a more challenging yet more important problem. We prove theoretically that this slow convergence drawback is primarily due to the ignorance of the target distribution. Further, we introduce a novel Target Distribution Aware Sampling (TDAS) method by leveraging the structural priors in space and frequency domains. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CelebA, LSUN, and FFHQ datasets validate that TDAS can consistently accelerate state-of-the-art SGMs, particularly on more challenging high resolution (1024x1024) image generation tasks by up to 18.4x, whilst largely maintaining the synthesis quality. With fewer sampling iterations, TDAS can still generate good quality images. In contrast, the existing methods degrade drastically or even fails completely"
Patch-based image Super Resolution using generalized Gaussian mixture model,Single Image Super Resolution (SISR) methods aim to recover the clean images in high resolution from low resolution observations.A family of patch-based approaches have received considerable attention and development. The minimum mean square error (MMSE) methodis a powerful image restoration method that uses a probability model on the patches of images. This paper proposes an algorithm to learn a jointgeneralized Gaussian mixture model (GGMM) from a pair of the low resolution patches and the corresponding high resolution patches fromthe reference data. We then reconstruct the high resolution image based on the MMSE method. Our numerical evaluations indicate that theMMSE-GGMM method competes with other state of the art methods.
The Creativity of Text-to-Image Generation,"Text-guided synthesis of images has made a giant leap towards becoming a mainstream phenomenon. With text-to-image generation systems, anybody can create digital images and artworks. This provokes the question of whether text-to-image generation is creative. This paper expounds on the nature of human creativity involved in text-to-image art (so-called ""AI art"") with a specific focus on the practice of prompt engineering. The paper argues that the current product-centered view of creativity falls short in the context of text-to-image generation. A case exemplifying this shortcoming is provided and the importance of online communities for the creative ecosystem of text-to-image art is highlighted. The paper provides a high-level summary of this online ecosystem drawing on Rhodes' conceptual four P model of creativity. Challenges for evaluating the creativity of text-to-image generation and opportunities for research on text-to-image generation in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) are discussed."
Scene Aware Person Image Generation through Global Contextual Conditioning,"Person image generation is an intriguing yet challenging problem. However, this task becomes even more difficult under constrained situations. In this work, we propose a novel pipeline to generate and insert contextually relevant person images into an existing scene while preserving the global semantics. More specifically, we aim to insert a person such that the location, pose, and scale of the person being inserted blends in with the existing persons in the scene. Our method uses three individual networks in a sequential pipeline. At first, we predict the potential location and the skeletal structure of the new person by conditioning a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) on the existing human skeletons present in the scene. Next, the predicted skeleton is refined through a shallow linear network to achieve higher structural accuracy in the generated image. Finally, the target image is generated from the refined skeleton using another generative network conditioned on a given image of the target person. In our experiments, we achieve high-resolution photo-realistic generation results while preserving the general context of the scene. We conclude our paper with multiple qualitative and quantitative benchmarks on the results."
Computer Vision-based Characterization of Large-scale Jet Flames using a Synthetic Infrared Image Generation Approach,"Among the different kinds of fire accidents that can occur during industrial activities that involve hazardous materials, jet fires are one of the lesser-known types. This is because they are often involved in a process that generates a sequence of other accidents of greater magnitude, known as domino effect. Flame impingement usually causes domino effects, and jet fires present specific features that can significantly increase the probability of this happening. These features become relevant from a risk analysis perspective, making their proper characterization a crucial task. Deep Learning approaches have become extensively used for tasks such as jet fire characterization; however, these methods are heavily dependent on the amount of data and the quality of the labels. Data acquisition of jet fires involve expensive experiments, especially so if infrared imagery is used. Therefore, this paper proposes the use of Generative Adversarial Networks to produce plausible infrared images from visible ones, making experiments less expensive and allowing for other potential applications. The results suggest that it is possible to realistically replicate the results for experiments carried out using both visible and infrared cameras. The obtained results are compared with some previous experiments, and it is shown that similar results were obtained."
Orthogonal Transform based Generative Adversarial Network for Image Dehazing,"Image dehazing has become one of the crucial preprocessing steps for any computer vision task. Most of the dehazing methods try to estimate the transmission map along with the atmospheric light to get the dehazed image in the image domain. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end architecture that directly estimates dehazed image in Krawtchouk transform domain. For this a customized Krawtchouk Convolution Layer (KCL) in the architecture is added. KCL is constructed using Krawtchouk basis functions which converts the image from the spatial domain to the Krawtchouk transform domain. Another convolution layer is added at the end of the architecture named as Inverse Krawtchouk Convolution Layer (IKCL) which converts the image back to the spatial domain from the transform domain. It has been observed that the haze is mainly present in lower frequencies of hazy images, wherein the Krawtchouk transform helps to analyze the high and low frequencies of the images separately. We have divided our architecture into two branches, the upper branch deals with the higher frequencies while the lower branch deals with the lower frequencies of the image. The lower branch is made deeper in terms of the layers as compared to the upper branch to address the haze present in the lower frequencies. Using the proposed Orthogonal Transform based Generative Adversarial Network (OTGAN) architecture for image dehazing, we were able to achieve competitive results when compared to the present state-of-the-art methods."
Modeling Image Composition for Complex Scene Generation,"We present a method that achieves state-of-the-art results on challenging (few-shot) layout-to-image generation tasks by accurately modeling textures, structures and relationships contained in a complex scene. After compressing RGB images into patch tokens, we propose the Transformer with Focal Attention (TwFA) for exploring dependencies of object-to-object, object-to-patch and patch-to-patch. Compared to existing CNN-based and Transformer-based generation models that entangled modeling on pixel-level&patch-level and object-level&patch-level respectively, the proposed focal attention predicts the current patch token by only focusing on its highly-related tokens that specified by the spatial layout, thereby achieving disambiguation during training. Furthermore, the proposed TwFA largely increases the data efficiency during training, therefore we propose the first few-shot complex scene generation strategy based on the well-trained TwFA. Comprehensive experiments show the superiority of our method, which significantly increases both quantitative metrics and qualitative visual realism with respect to state-of-the-art CNN-based and transformer-based methods. Code is available at https://github.com/JohnDreamer/TwFA."
PAGER: Progressive Attribute-Guided Extendable Robust Image Generation,"This work presents a generative modeling approach based on successive subspace learning (SSL). Unlike most generative models in the literature, our method does not utilize neural networks to analyze the underlying source distribution and synthesize images. The resulting method, called the progressive attribute-guided extendable robust image generative (PAGER) model, has advantages in mathematical transparency, progressive content generation, lower training time, robust performance with fewer training samples, and extendibility to conditional image generation. PAGER consists of three modules: core generator, resolution enhancer, and quality booster. The core generator learns the distribution of low-resolution images and performs unconditional image generation. The resolution enhancer increases image resolution via conditional generation. Finally, the quality booster adds finer details to generated images. Extensive experiments on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CelebA datasets are conducted to demonstrate generative performance of PAGER."
Text2Human: Text-Driven Controllable Human Image Generation,"Generating high-quality and diverse human images is an important yet challenging task in vision and graphics. However, existing generative models often fall short under the high diversity of clothing shapes and textures. Furthermore, the generation process is even desired to be intuitively controllable for layman users. In this work, we present a text-driven controllable framework, Text2Human, for a high-quality and diverse human generation. We synthesize full-body human images starting from a given human pose with two dedicated steps. 1) With some texts describing the shapes of clothes, the given human pose is first translated to a human parsing map. 2) The final human image is then generated by providing the system with more attributes about the textures of clothes. Specifically, to model the diversity of clothing textures, we build a hierarchical texture-aware codebook that stores multi-scale neural representations for each type of texture. The codebook at the coarse level includes the structural representations of textures, while the codebook at the fine level focuses on the details of textures. To make use of the learned hierarchical codebook to synthesize desired images, a diffusion-based transformer sampler with mixture of experts is firstly employed to sample indices from the coarsest level of the codebook, which then is used to predict the indices of the codebook at finer levels. The predicted indices at different levels are translated to human images by the decoder learned accompanied with hierarchical codebooks. The use of mixture-of-experts allows for the generated image conditioned on the fine-grained text input. The prediction for finer level indices refines the quality of clothing textures. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that our proposed framework can generate more diverse and realistic human images compared to state-of-the-art methods."
Generative Aging of Brain Images with Diffeomorphic Registration,"Analyzing and predicting brain aging is essential for early prognosis and accurate diagnosis of cognitive diseases. The technique of neuroimaging, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), provides a noninvasive means of observing the aging process within the brain. With longitudinal image data collection, data-intensive Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms have been used to examine brain aging. However, existing state-of-the-art algorithms tend to be restricted to group-level predictions and suffer from unreal predictions. This paper proposes a methodology for generating longitudinal MRI scans that capture subject-specific neurodegeneration and retain anatomical plausibility in aging. The proposed methodology is developed within the framework of diffeomorphic registration and relies on three key novel technological advances to generate subject-level anatomically plausible predictions: i) a computationally efficient and individualized generative framework based on registration; ii) an aging generative module based on biological linear aging progression; iii) a quality control module to fit registration for generation task. Our methodology was evaluated on 2662 T1-weighted (T1-w) MRI scans from 796 participants from three different cohorts. First, we applied 6 commonly used criteria to demonstrate the aging simulation ability of the proposed methodology; Secondly, we evaluated the quality of the synthetic images using quantitative measurements and qualitative assessment by a neuroradiologist. Overall, the experimental results show that the proposed method can produce anatomically plausible predictions that can be used to enhance longitudinal datasets, in turn enabling data-hungry AI-driven healthcare tools."
Segmentation Consistency Training: Out-of-Distribution Generalization for Medical Image Segmentation,"Generalizability is seen as one of the major challenges in deep learning, in particular in the domain of medical imaging, where a change of hospital or in imaging routines can lead to a complete failure of a model. To tackle this, we introduce Consistency Training, a training procedure and alternative to data augmentation based on maximizing models' prediction consistency across augmented and unaugmented data in order to facilitate better out-of-distribution generalization. To this end, we develop a novel region-based segmentation loss function called Segmentation Inconsistency Loss (SIL), which considers the differences between pairs of augmented and unaugmented predictions and labels. We demonstrate that Consistency Training outperforms conventional data augmentation on several out-of-distribution datasets on polyp segmentation, a popular medical task."
PolypConnect: Image inpainting for generating realistic gastrointestinal tract images with polyps,"Early identification of a polyp in the lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract can lead to prevention of life-threatening colorectal cancer. Developing computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems to detect polyps can improve detection accuracy and efficiency and save the time of the domain experts called endoscopists. Lack of annotated data is a common challenge when building CAD systems. Generating synthetic medical data is an active research area to overcome the problem of having relatively few true positive cases in the medical domain. To be able to efficiently train machine learning (ML) models, which are the core of CAD systems, a considerable amount of data should be used. In this respect, we propose the PolypConnect pipeline, which can convert non-polyp images into polyp images to increase the size of training datasets for training. We present the whole pipeline with quantitative and qualitative evaluations involving endoscopists. The polyp segmentation model trained using synthetic data, and real data shows a 5.1% improvement of mean intersection over union (mIOU), compared to the model trained only using real data. The codes of all the experiments are available on GitHub to reproduce the results."
Data Generation for Satellite Image Classification Using Self-Supervised Representation Learning,"Supervised deep neural networks are the-state-of-the-art for many tasks in the remote sensing domain, against the fact that such techniques require the dataset consisting of pairs of input and label, which are rare and expensive to collect in term of both manpower and resources. On the other hand, there are abundance of raw satellite images available both for commercial and academic purposes. Hence, in this work, we tackle the insufficient labeled data problem in satellite image classification task by introducing the process based on the self-supervised learning technique to create the synthetic labels for satellite image patches. These synthetic labels can be used as the training dataset for the existing supervised learning techniques. In our experiments, we show that the models trained on the synthetic labels give similar performance to the models trained on the real labels. And in the process of creating the synthetic labels, we also obtain the visual representation vectors that are versatile and knowledge transferable."
MolScribe: Robust Molecular Structure Recognition with Image-To-Graph Generation,"Molecular structure recognition is the task of translating a molecular image into its graph structure. Significant variation in drawing styles and conventions exhibited in chemical literature poses a significant challenge for automating this task. In this paper, we propose MolScribe, a novel image-to-graph generation model that explicitly predicts atoms and bonds, along with their geometric layouts, to construct the molecular structure. Our model flexibly incorporates symbolic chemistry constraints to recognize chirality and expand abbreviated structures. We further develop data augmentation strategies to enhance the model robustness against domain shifts. In experiments on both synthetic and realistic molecular images, MolScribe significantly outperforms previous models, achieving 76-93% accuracy on public benchmarks. Chemists can also easily verify MolScribe's prediction, informed by its confidence estimation and atom-level alignment with the input image. MolScribe is publicly available through Python and web interfaces: https://github.com/thomas0809/MolScribe."
GIT: A Generative Image-to-text Transformer for Vision and Language,"In this paper, we design and train a Generative Image-to-text Transformer, GIT, to unify vision-language tasks such as image/video captioning and question answering. While generative models provide a consistent network architecture between pre-training and fine-tuning, existing work typically contains complex structures (uni/multi-modal encoder/decoder) and depends on external modules such as object detectors/taggers and optical character recognition (OCR). In GIT, we simplify the architecture as one image encoder and one text decoder under a single language modeling task. We also scale up the pre-training data and the model size to boost the model performance. Without bells and whistles, our GIT establishes new state of the arts on 12 challenging benchmarks with a large margin. For instance, our model surpasses the human performance for the first time on TextCaps (138.2 vs. 125.5 in CIDEr). Furthermore, we present a new scheme of generation-based image classification and scene text recognition, achieving decent performance on standard benchmarks. Codes are released at \url{https://github.com/microsoft/GenerativeImage2Text}."
HIRL: A General Framework for Hierarchical Image Representation Learning,"Learning self-supervised image representations has been broadly studied to boost various visual understanding tasks. Existing methods typically learn a single level of image semantics like pairwise semantic similarity or image clustering patterns. However, these methods can hardly capture multiple levels of semantic information that naturally exists in an image dataset, e.g., the semantic hierarchy of ""Persian cat to cat to mammal"" encoded in an image database for species. It is thus unknown whether an arbitrary image self-supervised learning (SSL) approach can benefit from learning such hierarchical semantics. To answer this question, we propose a general framework for Hierarchical Image Representation Learning (HIRL). This framework aims to learn multiple semantic representations for each image, and these representations are structured to encode image semantics from fine-grained to coarse-grained. Based on a probabilistic factorization, HIRL learns the most fine-grained semantics by an off-the-shelf image SSL approach and learns multiple coarse-grained semantics by a novel semantic path discrimination scheme. We adopt six representative image SSL methods as baselines and study how they perform under HIRL. By rigorous fair comparison, performance gain is observed on all the six methods for diverse downstream tasks, which, for the first time, verifies the general effectiveness of learning hierarchical image semantics. All source code and model weights are available at https://github.com/hirl-team/HIRL"
DH-GAN: A Physics-driven Untrained Generative Adversarial Network for 3D Microscopic Imaging using Digital Holography,"Digital holography is a 3D imaging technique by emitting a laser beam with a plane wavefront to an object and measuring the intensity of the diffracted waveform, called holograms. The object's 3D shape can be obtained by numerical analysis of the captured holograms and recovering the incurred phase. Recently, deep learning (DL) methods have been used for more accurate holographic processing. However, most supervised methods require large datasets to train the model, which is rarely available in most DH applications due to the scarcity of samples or privacy concerns. A few one-shot DL-based recovery methods exist with no reliance on large datasets of paired images. Still, most of these methods often neglect the underlying physics law that governs wave propagation. These methods offer a black-box operation, which is not explainable, generalizable, and transferrable to other samples and applications. In this work, we propose a new DL architecture based on generative adversarial networks that uses a discriminative network for realizing a semantic measure for reconstruction quality while using a generative network as a function approximator to model the inverse of hologram formation. We impose smoothness on the background part of the recovered image using a progressive masking module powered by simulated annealing to enhance the reconstruction quality. The proposed method is one of its kind that exhibits high transferability to similar samples, which facilitates its fast deployment in time-sensitive applications without the need for retraining the network. The results show a considerable improvement to competitor methods in reconstruction quality (about 5 dB PSNR gain) and robustness to noise (about 50% reduction in PSNR vs noise increase rate)."
Pre-trained Perceptual Features Improve Differentially Private Image Generation,"Training even moderately-sized generative models with differentially-private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) is difficult: the required level of noise for reasonable levels of privacy is simply too large. We advocate instead building off a good, relevant representation on an informative public dataset, then learning to model the private data with that representation. In particular, we minimize the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) between private target data and a generator's distribution, using a kernel based on perceptual features learned from a public dataset. With the MMD, we can simply privatize the data-dependent term once and for all, rather than introducing noise at each step of optimization as in DP-SGD. Our algorithm allows us to generate CIFAR10-level images with ε\approx 2 which capture distinctive features in the distribution, far surpassing the current state of the art, which mostly focuses on datasets such as MNIST and FashionMNIST at a large ε\approx 10. Our work introduces simple yet powerful foundations for reducing the gap between private and non-private deep generative models. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/ParkLabML/DP-MEPF}."
Unsupervised Misaligned Infrared and Visible Image Fusion via Cross-Modality Image Generation and Registration,"Recent learning-based image fusion methods have marked numerous progress in pre-registered multi-modality data, but suffered serious ghosts dealing with misaligned multi-modality data, due to the spatial deformation and the difficulty narrowing cross-modality discrepancy. To overcome the obstacles, in this paper, we present a robust cross-modality generation-registration paradigm for unsupervised misaligned infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF). Specifically, we propose a Cross-modality Perceptual Style Transfer Network (CPSTN) to generate a pseudo infrared image taking a visible image as input. Benefiting from the favorable geometry preservation ability of the CPSTN, the generated pseudo infrared image embraces a sharp structure, which is more conducive to transforming cross-modality image alignment into mono-modality registration coupled with the structure-sensitive of the infrared image. In this case, we introduce a Multi-level Refinement Registration Network (MRRN) to predict the displacement vector field between distorted and pseudo infrared images and reconstruct registered infrared image under the mono-modality setting. Moreover, to better fuse the registered infrared images and visible images, we present a feature Interaction Fusion Module (IFM) to adaptively select more meaningful features for fusion in the Dual-path Interaction Fusion Network (DIFN). Extensive experimental results suggest that the proposed method performs superior capability on misaligned cross-modality image fusion."
M6-Fashion: High-Fidelity Multi-modal Image Generation and Editing,"The fashion industry has diverse applications in multi-modal image generation and editing. It aims to create a desired high-fidelity image with the multi-modal conditional signal as guidance. Most existing methods learn different condition guidance controls by introducing extra models or ignoring the style prior knowledge, which is difficult to handle multiple signal combinations and faces a low-fidelity problem. In this paper, we adapt both style prior knowledge and flexibility of multi-modal control into one unified two-stage framework, M6-Fashion, focusing on the practical AI-aided Fashion design. It decouples style codes in both spatial and semantic dimensions to guarantee high-fidelity image generation in the first stage. M6-Fashion utilizes self-correction for the non-autoregressive generation to improve inference speed, enhance holistic consistency, and support various signal controls. Extensive experiments on a large-scale clothing dataset M2C-Fashion demonstrate superior performances on various image generation and editing tasks. M6-Fashion model serves as a highly potential AI designer for the fashion industry."
On Advances in Text Generation from Images Beyond Captioning: A Case Study in Self-Rationalization,"Combining the visual modality with pretrained language models has been surprisingly effective for simple descriptive tasks such as image captioning. More general text generation however remains elusive. We take a step back and ask: How do these models work for more complex generative tasks, i.e. conditioning on both text and images? Are multimodal models simply visually adapted language models, or do they combine they reason jointly over modalities?  We investigate these questions in the context of self-rationalization (jointly generating task labels/answers and free-text explanations) of three tasks: (i) visual question answering in VQA-X, (ii) visual commonsense reasoning in VCR, and (iii) visual-textual entailment in e-SNLI-VE. We show that recent unimodal advances, CLIP image representations and scaling of language models, do not consistently improve self-rationalization in multimodal tasks. We find that no single model type works universally best across tasks, datasets, and finetuning data sizes. Our findings motivate the need for novel general backbones approach that move text generation from images and text beyond image captioning."
GR-GAN: Gradual Refinement Text-to-image Generation,"A good Text-to-Image model should not only generate high quality images, but also ensure the consistency between the text and the generated image. Previous models failed to simultaneously fix both sides well. This paper proposes a Gradual Refinement Generative Adversarial Network (GR-GAN) to alleviates the problem efficiently. A GRG module is designed to generate images from low resolution to high resolution with the corresponding text constraints from coarse granularity (sentence) to fine granularity (word) stage by stage, a ITM module is designed to provide image-text matching losses at both sentence-image level and word-region level for corresponding stages. We also introduce a new metric Cross-Model Distance (CMD) for simultaneously evaluating image quality and image-text consistency. Experimental results show GR-GAN significant outperform previous models, and achieve new state-of-the-art on both FID and CMD. A detailed analysis demonstrates the efficiency of different generation stages in GR-GAN."
Investigating classification learning curves for automatically generated and labelled plant images,"In the context of supervised machine learning a learning curve describes how a model's performance on unseen data relates to the amount of samples used to train the model. In this paper we present a dataset of plant images with representatives of crops and weeds common to the Manitoba prairies at different growth stages. We determine the learning curve for a classification task on this data with the ResNet architecture. Our results are in accordance with previous studies and add to the evidence that learning curves are governed by power-law relationships over large scales, applications, and models. We further investigate how label noise and the reduction of trainable parameters impacts the learning curve on this dataset. Both effects lead to the model requiring disproportionally larger training sets to achieve the same classification performance as observed without these effects."
Producing Histopathology Phantom Images using Generative Adversarial Networks to improve Tumor Detection,"Advance in medical imaging is an important part in deep learning research. One of the goals of computer vision is development of a holistic, comprehensive model which can identify tumors from histology slides obtained via biopsies. A major problem that stands in the way is lack of data for a few cancer-types. In this paper, we ascertain that data augmentation using GANs can be a viable solution to reduce the unevenness in the distribution of different cancer types in our dataset. Our demonstration showed that a dataset augmented to a 50% increase causes an increase in tumor detection from 80% to 87.5%"
A SSIM Guided cGAN Architecture For Clinically Driven Generative Image Synthesis of Multiplexed Spatial Proteomics Channels,"Here we present a structural similarity index measure (SSIM) guided conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) that generatively performs image-to-image (i2i) synthesis to generate photo-accurate protein channels in multiplexed spatial proteomics images. This approach can be utilized to accurately generate missing spatial proteomics channels that were not included during experimental data collection either at the bench or the clinic. Experimental spatial proteomic data from the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP) was used to generate spatial representations of missing proteins through a U-Net based image synthesis pipeline. HuBMAP channels were hierarchically clustered by the (SSIM) as a heuristic to obtain the minimal set needed to recapitulate the underlying biology represented by the spatial landscape of proteins. We subsequently prove that our SSIM based architecture allows for scaling of generative image synthesis to slides with up to 100 channels, which is better than current state of the art algorithms which are limited to data with 11 channels. We validate these claims by generating a new experimental spatial proteomics data set from human lung adenocarcinoma tissue sections and show that a model trained on HuBMAP can accurately synthesize channels from our new data set. The ability to recapitulate experimental data from sparsely stained multiplexed histological slides containing spatial proteomic will have tremendous impact on medical diagnostics and drug development, and also raises important questions on the medical ethics of utilizing data produced by generative image synthesis in the clinical setting. The algorithm that we present in this paper will allow researchers and clinicians to save time and costs in proteomics based histological staining while also increasing the amount of data that they can generate through their experiments."
Towards the Generation of Synthetic Images of Palm Vein Patterns: A Review,"With the recent success of computer vision and deep learning, remarkable progress has been achieved on automatic personal recognition using vein biometrics. However, collecting large-scale real-world training data for palm vein recognition has turned out to be challenging, mainly due to the noise and irregular variations included at the time of acquisition. Meanwhile, existing palm vein recognition datasets are usually collected under near-infrared light, lacking detailed annotations on attributes (e.g., pose), so the influences of different attributes on vein recognition have been poorly investigated. Therefore, this paper examines the suitability of synthetic vein images generated to compensate for the urgent lack of publicly available large-scale datasets. Firstly, we present an overview of recent research progress on palm vein recognition, from the basic background knowledge to vein anatomical structure, data acquisition, public database, and quality assessment procedures. Then, we focus on the state-of-the-art methods that have allowed the generation of vascular structures for biometric purposes and the modeling of biological networks with their respective application domains. In addition, we review the existing research on the generation of style transfer and biological nature-based synthetic palm vein image algorithms. Afterward, we formalize a general flowchart for the creation of a synthetic database comparing real palm vein images and generated synthetic samples to obtain some understanding into the development of the realistic vein imaging system. Ultimately, we conclude by discussing the challenges, insights, and future perspectives in generating synthetic palm vein images for further works."
Generation of Artificial CT Images using Patch-based Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks,"Deep learning has a great potential to alleviate diagnosis and prognosis for various clinical procedures. However, the lack of a sufficient number of medical images is the most common obstacle in conducting image-based analysis using deep learning. Due to the annotations scarcity, semi-supervised techniques in the automatic medical analysis are getting high attention. Artificial data augmentation and generation techniques such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) may help overcome this obstacle. In this work, we present an image generation approach that uses generative adversarial networks with a conditional discriminator where segmentation masks are used as conditions for image generation. We validate the feasibility of GAN-enhanced medical image generation on whole heart computed tomography (CT) images and its seven substructures, namely: left ventricle, right ventricle, left atrium, right atrium, myocardium, pulmonary arteries, and aorta. Obtained results demonstrate the suitability of the proposed adversarial approach for the accurate generation of high-quality CT images. The presented method shows great potential to facilitate further research in the domain of artificial medical image generation."
Computerized Tomography Pulmonary Angiography Image Simulation using Cycle Generative Adversarial Network from Chest CT imaging in Pulmonary Embolism Patients,"The purpose of this research is to develop a system that generates simulated computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) images clinically for pulmonary embolism diagnoses. Nowadays, CTPA images are the gold standard computerized detection method to determine and identify the symptoms of pulmonary embolism (PE), although performing CTPA is harmful for patients and also expensive. Therefore, we aim to detect possible PE patients through CT images. The system will simulate CTPA images with deep learning models for the identification of PE patients' symptoms, providing physicians with another reference for determining PE patients. In this study, the simulated CTPA image generation system uses a generative antagonistic network to enhance the features of pulmonary vessels in the CT images to strengthen the reference value of the images and provide a basis for hospitals to judge PE patients. We used the CT images of 22 patients from National Cheng Kung University Hospital and the corresponding CTPA images as the training data for the task of simulating CTPA images and generated them using two sets of generative countermeasure networks. This study is expected to propose a new approach to the clinical diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, in which a deep learning network is used to assist in the complex screening process and to review the generated simulated CTPA images, allowing physicians to assess whether a patient needs to undergo detailed testing for CTPA, improving the speed of detection of pulmonary embolism and significantly reducing the number of undetected patients."
Conditional Vector Graphics Generation for Music Cover Images,"Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have motivated a rapid growth of the domain of computer image synthesis. As almost all the existing image synthesis algorithms consider an image as a pixel matrix, the high-resolution image synthesis is complicated.A good alternative can be vector images. However, they belong to the highly sophisticated parametric space, which is a restriction for solving the task of synthesizing vector graphics by GANs. In this paper, we consider a specific application domain that softens this restriction dramatically allowing the usage of vector image synthesis.  Music cover images should meet the requirements of Internet streaming services and printing standards, which imply high resolution of graphic materials without any additional requirements on the content of such images. Existing music cover image generation services do not analyze tracks themselves; however, some services mostly consider only genre tags. To generate music covers as vector images that reflect the music and consist of simple geometric objects, we suggest a GAN-based algorithm called CoverGAN. The assessment of resulting images is based on their correspondence to the music compared with AttnGAN and DALL-E text-to-image generation according to title or lyrics. Moreover, the significance of the patterns found by CoverGAN has been evaluated in terms of the correspondence of the generated cover images to the musical tracks. Listeners evaluate the music covers generated by the proposed algorithm as quite satisfactory and corresponding to the tracks. Music cover images generation code and demo are available at https://github.com/IzhanVarsky/CoverGAN."
Combating COVID-19 using Generative Adversarial Networks and Artificial Intelligence for Medical Images: A Scoping Review,"This review presents a comprehensive study on the role of GANs in addressing the challenges related to COVID-19 data scarcity and diagnosis. It is the first review that summarizes the different GANs methods and the lungs images datasets for COVID-19. It attempts to answer the questions related to applications of GANs, popular GAN architectures, frequently used image modalities, and the availability of source code. This review included 57 full-text studies that reported the use of GANs for different applications in COVID-19 lungs images data. Most of the studies (n=42) used GANs for data augmentation to enhance the performance of AI techniques for COVID-19 diagnosis. Other popular applications of GANs were segmentation of lungs and super-resolution of the lungs images. The cycleGAN and the conditional GAN were the most commonly used architectures used in nine studies each. 29 studies used chest X-Ray images while 21 studies used CT images for the training of GANs. For majority of the studies (n=47), the experiments were done and results were reported using publicly available data. A secondary evaluation of the results by radiologists/clinicians was reported by only two studies. Conclusion: Studies have shown that GANs have great potential to address the data scarcity challenge for lungs images of COVID-19. Data synthesized with GANs have been helpful to improve the training of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models trained for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Besides, GANs have also contributed to enhancing the CNNs performance through the super-resolution of the images and segmentation. This review also identified key limitations of the potential transformation of GANs based methods in clinical applications."
GLaMa: Joint Spatial and Frequency Loss for General Image Inpainting,"The purpose of image inpainting is to recover scratches and damaged areas using context information from remaining parts. In recent years, thanks to the resurgence of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), image inpainting task has made great breakthroughs. However, most of the work consider insufficient types of mask, and their performance will drop dramatically when encountering unseen masks. To combat these challenges, we propose a simple yet general method to solve this problem based on the LaMa image inpainting framework, dubbed GLaMa. Our proposed GLaMa can better capture different types of missing information by using more types of masks. By incorporating more degraded images in the training phase, we can expect to enhance the robustness of the model with respect to various masks. In order to yield more reasonable results, we further introduce a frequency-based loss in addition to the traditional spatial reconstruction loss and adversarial loss. In particular, we introduce an effective reconstruction loss both in the spatial and frequency domain to reduce the chessboard effect and ripples in the reconstructed image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can boost the performance over the original LaMa method for each type of mask on FFHQ, ImageNet, Places2 and WikiArt dataset. The proposed GLaMa was ranked first in terms of PSNR, LPIPS and SSIM in the NTIRE 2022 Image Inpainting Challenge Track 1 Unsupervised."
An Architecture for the detection of GAN-generated Flood Images with Localization Capabilities,"In this paper, we address a new image forensics task, namely the detection of fake flood images generated by ClimateGAN architecture. We do so by proposing a hybrid deep learning architecture including both a detection and a localization branch, the latter being devoted to the identification of the image regions manipulated by ClimateGAN. Even if our goal is the detection of fake flood images, in fact, we found that adding a localization branch helps the network to focus on the most relevant image regions with significant improvements in terms of generalization capabilities and robustness against image processing operations. The good performance of the proposed architecture is validated on two datasets of pristine flood images downloaded from the internet and three datasets of fake flood images generated by ClimateGAN starting from a large set of diverse street images."
D3T-GAN: Data-Dependent Domain Transfer GANs for Few-shot Image Generation,"As an important and challenging problem, few-shot image generation aims at generating realistic images through training a GAN model given few samples. A typical solution for few-shot generation is to transfer a well-trained GAN model from a data-rich source domain to the data-deficient target domain. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised transfer scheme termed D3T-GAN, addressing the cross-domain GANs transfer in few-shot image generation. Specifically, we design two individual strategies to transfer knowledge between generators and discriminators, respectively. To transfer knowledge between generators, we conduct a data-dependent transformation, which projects and reconstructs the target samples into the source generator space. Then, we perform knowledge transfer from transformed samples to generated samples. To transfer knowledge between discriminators, we design a multi-level discriminant knowledge distillation from the source discriminator to the target discriminator on both the real and fake samples. Extensive experiments show that our method improve the quality of generated images and achieves the state-of-the-art FID scores on commonly used datasets."
KeypointNeRF: Generalizing Image-based Volumetric Avatars using Relative Spatial Encoding of Keypoints,"Image-based volumetric humans using pixel-aligned features promise generalization to unseen poses and identities. Prior work leverages global spatial encodings and multi-view geometric consistency to reduce spatial ambiguity. However, global encodings often suffer from overfitting to the distribution of the training data, and it is difficult to learn multi-view consistent reconstruction from sparse views. In this work, we investigate common issues with existing spatial encodings and propose a simple yet highly effective approach to modeling high-fidelity volumetric humans from sparse views. One of the key ideas is to encode relative spatial 3D information via sparse 3D keypoints. This approach is robust to the sparsity of viewpoints and cross-dataset domain gap. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods for head reconstruction. On human body reconstruction for unseen subjects, we also achieve performance comparable to prior work that uses a parametric human body model and temporal feature aggregation. Our experiments show that a majority of errors in prior work stem from an inappropriate choice of spatial encoding and thus we suggest a new direction for high-fidelity image-based human modeling. https://markomih.github.io/KeypointNeRF"
High-Resolution UAV Image Generation for Sorghum Panicle Detection,"The number of panicles (or heads) of Sorghum plants is an important phenotypic trait for plant development and grain yield estimation. The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) enables the capability of collecting and analyzing Sorghum images on a large scale. Deep learning can provide methods for estimating phenotypic traits from UAV images but requires a large amount of labeled data. The lack of training data due to the labor-intensive ground truthing of UAV images causes a major bottleneck in developing methods for Sorghum panicle detection and counting. In this paper, we present an approach that uses synthetic training images from generative adversarial networks (GANs) for data augmentation to enhance the performance of Sorghum panicle detection and counting. Our method can generate synthetic high-resolution UAV RGB images with panicle labels by using image-to-image translation GANs with a limited ground truth dataset of real UAV RGB images. The results show the improvements in panicle detection and counting using our data augmentation approach."
WKGM: Weight-K-space Generative Model for Parallel Imaging Reconstruction,"Deep learning based parallel imaging (PI) has made great progresses in recent years to accelerate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Nevertheless, it still has some limitations, such as the robustness and flexibility of existing methods have great deficiency. In this work, we propose a method to explore the k-space domain learning via robust generative modeling for flexible calibration-less PI reconstruction, coined weight-k-space generative model (WKGM). Specifically, WKGM is a generalized k-space domain model, where the k-space weighting technology and high-dimensional space augmentation design are efficiently incorporated for score-based generative model training, resulting in good and robust reconstructions. In addition, WKGM is flexible and thus can be synergistically combined with various traditional k-space PI models, which can make full use of the correlation between multi-coil data and realizecalibration-less PI. Even though our model was trained on only 500 images, experimental results with varying sampling patterns and acceleration factors demonstrate that WKGM can attain state-of-the-art reconstruction results with the well-learned k-space generative prior."
On Conditioning the Input Noise for Controlled Image Generation with Diffusion Models,"Conditional image generation has paved the way for several breakthroughs in image editing, generating stock photos and 3-D object generation. This continues to be a significant area of interest with the rise of new state-of-the-art methods that are based on diffusion models. However, diffusion models provide very little control over the generated image, which led to subsequent works exploring techniques like classifier guidance, that provides a way to trade off diversity with fidelity. In this work, we explore techniques to condition diffusion models with carefully crafted input noise artifacts. This allows generation of images conditioned on semantic attributes. This is different from existing approaches that input Gaussian noise and further introduce conditioning at the diffusion model's inference step. Our experiments over several examples and conditional settings show the potential of our approach."
A Closer Look at Few-shot Image Generation,"Modern GANs excel at generating high quality and diverse images. However, when transferring the pretrained GANs on small target data (e.g., 10-shot), the generator tends to replicate the training samples. Several methods have been proposed to address this few-shot image generation task, but there is a lack of effort to analyze them under a unified framework. As our first contribution, we propose a framework to analyze existing methods during the adaptation. Our analysis discovers that while some methods have disproportionate focus on diversity preserving which impede quality improvement, all methods achieve similar quality after convergence. Therefore, the better methods are those that can slow down diversity degradation. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that there is still plenty of room to further slow down diversity degradation. Informed by our analysis and to slow down the diversity degradation of the target generator during adaptation, our second contribution proposes to apply mutual information (MI) maximization to retain the source domain's rich multi-level diversity information in the target domain generator. We propose to perform MI maximization by contrastive loss (CL), leverage the generator and discriminator as two feature encoders to extract different multi-level features for computing CL. We refer to our method as Dual Contrastive Learning (DCL). Extensive experiments on several public datasets show that, while leading to a slower diversity-degrading generator during adaptation, our proposed DCL brings visually pleasant quality and state-of-the-art quantitative performance.

Invariant Content Synergistic Learning for Domain Generalization of Medical Image Segmentation,"While achieving remarkable success for medical image segmentation, deep convolution neural networks (DCNNs) often fail to maintain their robustness when confronting test data with the novel distribution. To address such a drawback, the inductive bias of DCNNs is recently well-recognized. Specifically, DCNNs exhibit an inductive bias towards image style (e.g., superficial texture) rather than invariant content (e.g., object shapes). In this paper, we propose a method, named Invariant Content Synergistic Learning (ICSL), to improve the generalization ability of DCNNs on unseen datasets by controlling the inductive bias. First, ICSL mixes the style of training instances to perturb the training distribution. That is to say, more diverse domains or styles would be made available for training DCNNs. Based on the perturbed distribution, we carefully design a dual-branches invariant content synergistic learning strategy to prevent style-biased predictions and focus more on the invariant content. Extensive experimental results on two typical medical image segmentation tasks show that our approach performs better than state-of-the-art domain generalization methods."
Text to artistic image generation,"Painting is one of the ways for people to express their ideas, but what if people with disabilities in hands want to paint? To tackle this challenge, we create an end-to-end solution that can generate artistic images from text descriptions. However, due to the lack of datasets with paired text description and artistic images, it is hard to directly train an algorithm which can create art based on text input. To address this issue, we split our task into three steps: (1) Generate a realistic image from a text description by using Dynamic Memory Generative Adversarial Network (arXiv:1904.01310), (2) Classify the image as a genre that exists in the WikiArt dataset using Resnet (arXiv: 1512.03385), (3) Select a style that is compatible with the genre and transfer it to the generated image by using neural artistic stylization network (arXiv:1705.06830)."
Subverting Fair Image Search with Generative Adversarial Perturbations,"In this work we explore the intersection fairness and robustness in the context of ranking: when a ranking model has been calibrated to achieve some definition of fairness, is it possible for an external adversary to make the ranking model behave unfairly without having access to the model or training data? To investigate this question, we present a case study in which we develop and then attack a state-of-the-art, fairness-aware image search engine using images that have been maliciously modified using a Generative Adversarial Perturbation (GAP) model. These perturbations attempt to cause the fair re-ranking algorithm to unfairly boost the rank of images containing people from an adversary-selected subpopulation.  We present results from extensive experiments demonstrating that our attacks can successfully confer significant unfair advantage to people from the majority class relative to fairly-ranked baseline search results. We demonstrate that our attacks are robust across a number of variables, that they have close to zero impact on the relevance of search results, and that they succeed under a strict threat model. Our findings highlight the danger of deploying fair machine learning algorithms in-the-wild when (1) the data necessary to achieve fairness may be adversarially manipulated, and (2) the models themselves are not robust against attacks."
Compressive Ptychography using Deep Image and Generative Priors,"Ptychography is a well-established coherent diffraction imaging technique that enables non-invasive imaging of samples at a nanometer scale. It has been extensively used in various areas such as the defense industry or materials science. One major limitation of ptychography is the long data acquisition time due to mechanical scanning of the sample; therefore, approaches to reduce the scan points are highly desired. However, reconstructions with less number of scan points lead to imaging artifacts and significant distortions, hindering a quantitative evaluation of the results. To address this bottleneck, we propose a generative model combining deep image priors with deep generative priors. The self-training approach optimizes the deep generative neural network to create a solution for a given dataset. We complement our approach with a prior acquired from a previously trained discriminator network to avoid a possible divergence from the desired output caused by the noise in the measurements. We also suggest using the total variation as a complementary before combat artifacts due to measurement noise. We analyze our approach with numerical experiments through different probe overlap percentages and varying noise levels. We also demonstrate improved reconstruction accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art method and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of our approach."
An Analysis of Generative Methods for Multiple Image Inpainting,"Image inpainting refers to the restoration of an image with missing regions in a way that is not detectable by the observer. The inpainting regions can be of any size and shape. This is an ill-posed inverse problem that does not have a unique solution. In this work, we focus on learning-based image completion methods for multiple and diverse inpainting which goal is to provide a set of distinct solutions for a given damaged image. These methods capitalize on the probabilistic nature of certain generative models to sample various solutions that coherently restore the missing content. Along the chapter, we will analyze the underlying theory and analyze the recent proposals for multiple inpainting. To investigate the pros and cons of each method, we present quantitative and qualitative comparisons, on common datasets, regarding both the quality and the diversity of the set of inpainted solutions. Our analysis allows us to identify the most successful generative strategies in both inpainting quality and inpainting diversity. This task is closely related to the learning of an accurate probability distribution of images. Depending on the dataset in use, the challenges that entail the training of such a model will be discussed through the analysis."
DeepPortraitDrawing: Generating Human Body Images from Freehand Sketches,"Researchers have explored various ways to generate realistic images from freehand sketches, e.g., for objects and human faces. However, how to generate realistic human body images from sketches is still a challenging problem. It is, first because of the sensitivity to human shapes, second because of the complexity of human images caused by body shape and pose changes, and third because of the domain gap between realistic images and freehand sketches. In this work, we present DeepPortraitDrawing, a deep generative framework for converting roughly drawn sketches to realistic human body images. To encode complicated body shapes under various poses, we take a local-to-global approach. Locally, we employ semantic part auto-encoders to construct part-level shape spaces, which are useful for refining the geometry of an input pre-segmented hand-drawn sketch. Globally, we employ a cascaded spatial transformer network to refine the structure of body parts by adjusting their spatial locations and relative proportions. Finally, we use a global synthesis network for the sketch-to-image translation task, and a face refinement network to enhance facial details. Extensive experiments have shown that given roughly sketched human portraits, our method produces more realistic images than the state-of-the-art sketch-to-image synthesis techniques."
On the generalization capabilities of FSL methods through domain adaptation: a case study in endoscopic kidney stone image classification,"Deep learning has shown great promise in diverse areas of computer vision, such as image classification, object detection and semantic segmentation, among many others. However, as it has been repeatedly demonstrated, deep learning methods trained on a dataset do not generalize well to datasets from other domains or even to similar datasets, due to data distribution shifts. In this work, we propose the use of a meta-learning based few-shot learning approach to alleviate these problems. In order to demonstrate its efficacy, we use two datasets of kidney stones samples acquired with different endoscopes and different acquisition conditions. The results show how such methods are indeed capable of handling domain-shifts by attaining an accuracy of 74.38% and 88.52% in the 5-way 5-shot and 5-way 20-shot settings respectively. Instead, in the same dataset, traditional Deep Learning (DL) methods attain only an accuracy of 45%."
OSSGAN: Open-Set Semi-Supervised Image Generation,"We introduce a challenging training scheme of conditional GANs, called open-set semi-supervised image generation, where the training dataset consists of two parts: (i) labeled data and (ii) unlabeled data with samples belonging to one of the labeled data classes, namely, a closed-set, and samples not belonging to any of the labeled data classes, namely, an open-set. Unlike the existing semi-supervised image generation task, where unlabeled data only contain closed-set samples, our task is more general and lowers the data collection cost in practice by allowing open-set samples to appear. Thanks to entropy regularization, the classifier that is trained on labeled data is able to quantify sample-wise importance to the training of cGAN as confidence, allowing us to use all samples in unlabeled data. We design OSSGAN, which provides decision clues to the discriminator on the basis of whether an unlabeled image belongs to one or none of the classes of interest, smoothly integrating labeled and unlabeled data during training. The results of experiments on Tiny ImageNet and ImageNet show notable improvements over supervised BigGAN and semi-supervised methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/raven38/OSSGAN."
CogView2: Faster and Better Text-to-Image Generation via Hierarchical Transformers,"The development of the transformer-based text-to-image models are impeded by its slow generation and complexity for high-resolution images. In this work, we put forward a solution based on hierarchical transformers and local parallel auto-regressive generation. We pretrain a 6B-parameter transformer with a simple and flexible self-supervised task, Cross-modal general language model (CogLM), and finetune it for fast super-resolution. The new text-to-image system, CogView2, shows very competitive generation compared to concurrent state-of-the-art DALL-E-2, and naturally supports interactive text-guided editing on images."
A Taxonomy of Prompt Modifiers for Text-To-Image Generation,"Text-to-image generation has seen an explosion of interest since 2021. Today, beautiful and intriguing digital images and artworks can be synthesized from textual inputs (""prompts"") with deep generative models. Online communities around text-to-image generation and AI generated art have quickly emerged. This paper identifies six types of prompt modifiers used by practitioners in the online community based on a 3-month ethnographic study. The novel taxonomy of prompt modifiers provides researchers a conceptual starting point for investigating the practice of text-to-image generation, but may also help practitioners of AI generated art improve their images. We further outline how prompt modifiers are applied in the practice of ""prompt engineering."" We discuss research opportunities of this novel creative practice in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). The paper concludes with a discussion of broader implications of prompt engineering from the perspective of Human-AI Interaction (HAI) in future applications beyond the use case of text-to-image generation and AI generated art."
GRIT: General Robust Image Task Benchmark,"Computer vision models excel at making predictions when the test distribution closely resembles the training distribution. Such models have yet to match the ability of biological vision to learn from multiple sources and generalize to new data sources and tasks. To facilitate the development and evaluation of more general vision systems, we introduce the General Robust Image Task (GRIT) benchmark. GRIT evaluates the performance, robustness, and calibration of a vision system across a variety of image prediction tasks, concepts, and data sources. The seven tasks in GRIT are selected to cover a range of visual skills: object categorization, object localization, referring expression grounding, visual question answering, segmentation, human keypoint detection, and surface normal estimation. GRIT is carefully designed to enable the evaluation of robustness under image perturbations, image source distribution shift, and concept distribution shift. By providing a unified platform for thorough assessment of skills and concepts learned by a vision model, we hope GRIT catalyzes the development of performant and robust general purpose vision systems."
Generative Adversarial Networks for Image Super-Resolution: A Survey,"Single image super-resolution (SISR) has played an important role in the field of image processing. Recent generative adversarial networks (GANs) can achieve excellent results on low-resolution images with small samples. However, there are little literatures summarizing different GANs in SISR. In this paper, we conduct a comparative study of GANs from different perspectives. We first take a look at developments of GANs. Second, we present popular architectures for GANs in big and small samples for image applications. Then, we analyze motivations, implementations and differences of GANs based optimization methods and discriminative learning for image super-resolution in terms of supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised manners. Next, we compare performance of these popular GANs on public datasets via quantitative and qualitative analysis in SISR. Finally, we highlight challenges of GANs and potential research points for SISR."
Deep Generalized Unfolding Networks for Image Restoration,"Deep neural networks (DNN) have achieved great success in image restoration. However, most DNN methods are designed as a black box, lacking transparency and interpretability. Although some methods are proposed to combine traditional optimization algorithms with DNN, they usually demand pre-defined degradation processes or handcrafted assumptions, making it difficult to deal with complex and real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a Deep Generalized Unfolding Network (DGUNet) for image restoration. Concretely, without loss of interpretability, we integrate a gradient estimation strategy into the gradient descent step of the Proximal Gradient Descent (PGD) algorithm, driving it to deal with complex and real-world image degradation. In addition, we design inter-stage information pathways across proximal mapping in different PGD iterations to rectify the intrinsic information loss in most deep unfolding networks (DUN) through a multi-scale and spatial-adaptive way. By integrating the flexible gradient descent and informative proximal mapping, we unfold the iterative PGD algorithm into a trainable DNN. Extensive experiments on various image restoration tasks demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of state-of-the-art performance, interpretability, and generalizability. The source code is available at https://github.com/MC-E/Deep-Generalized-Unfolding-Networks-for-Image-Restoration."
Assessing the ability of generative adversarial networks to learn canonical medical image statistics,"In recent years, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have gained tremendous popularity for potential applications in medical imaging, such as medical image synthesis, restoration, reconstruction, translation, as well as objective image quality assessment. Despite the impressive progress in generating high-resolution, perceptually realistic images, it is not clear if modern GANs reliably learn the statistics that are meaningful to a downstream medical imaging application. In this work, the ability of a state-of-the-art GAN to learn the statistics of canonical stochastic image models (SIMs) that are relevant to objective assessment of image quality is investigated. It is shown that although the employed GAN successfully learned several basic first- and second-order statistics of the specific medical SIMs under consideration and generated images with high perceptual quality, it failed to correctly learn several per-image statistics pertinent to the these SIMs, highlighting the urgent need to assess medical image GANs in terms of objective measures of image quality."
BCI: Breast Cancer Immunohistochemical Image Generation through Pyramid Pix2pix,"The evaluation of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression is essential to formulate a precise treatment for breast cancer. The routine evaluation of HER2 is conducted with immunohistochemical techniques (IHC), which is very expensive. Therefore, for the first time, we propose a breast cancer immunohistochemical (BCI) benchmark attempting to synthesize IHC data directly with the paired hematoxylin and eosin (HE) stained images. The dataset contains 4870 registered image pairs, covering a variety of HER2 expression levels. Based on BCI, as a minor contribution, we further build a pyramid pix2pix image generation method, which achieves better HE to IHC translation results than the other current popular algorithms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BCI poses new challenges to the existing image translation research. Besides, BCI also opens the door for future pathology studies in HER2 expression evaluation based on the synthesized IHC images. BCI dataset can be downloaded from https://bupt-ai-cz.github.io/BCI."
Reinforcing Generated Images via Meta-learning for One-Shot Fine-Grained Visual Recognition,"One-shot fine-grained visual recognition often suffers from the problem of having few training examples for new fine-grained classes. To alleviate this problem, off-the-shelf image generation techniques based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can potentially create additional training images. However, these GAN-generated images are often not helpful for actually improving the accuracy of one-shot fine-grained recognition. In this paper, we propose a meta-learning framework to combine generated images with original images, so that the resulting ""hybrid"" training images improve one-shot learning. Specifically, the generic image generator is updated by a few training instances of novel classes, and a Meta Image Reinforcing Network (MetaIRNet) is proposed to conduct one-shot fine-grained recognition as well as image reinforcement. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvement over baselines on one-shot fine-grained image classification benchmarks. Furthermore, our analysis shows that the reinforced images have more diversity compared to the original and GAN-generated images."
A Note on the Regularity of Images Generated by Convolutional Neural Networks,"The regularity of images generated by convolutional neural networks, such as the U-net, generative networks, or the deep image prior, is analyzed. In a resolution-independent, infinite dimensional setting, it is shown that such images, represented as functions, are always continuous and, in some circumstances, even continuously differentiable, contradicting the widely accepted modeling of sharp edges in images via jump discontinuities. While such statements require an infinite dimensional setting, the connection to (discretized) neural networks used in practice is made by considering the limit as the resolution approaches infinity. As practical consequence, the results of this paper in particular provide analytical evidence that basic L2 regularization of network weights might lead to over-smoothed outputs."
Fourier Imager Network (FIN): A deep neural network for hologram reconstruction with superior external generalization,"Deep learning-based image reconstruction methods have achieved remarkable success in phase recovery and holographic imaging. However, the generalization of their image reconstruction performance to new types of samples never seen by the network remains a challenge. Here we introduce a deep learning framework, termed Fourier Imager Network (FIN), that can perform end-to-end phase recovery and image reconstruction from raw holograms of new types of samples, exhibiting unprecedented success in external generalization. FIN architecture is based on spatial Fourier transform modules that process the spatial frequencies of its inputs using learnable filters and a global receptive field. Compared with existing convolutional deep neural networks used for hologram reconstruction, FIN exhibits superior generalization to new types of samples, while also being much faster in its image inference speed, completing the hologram reconstruction task in ~0.04 s per 1 mm^2 of the sample area. We experimentally validated the performance of FIN by training it using human lung tissue samples and blindly testing it on human prostate, salivary gland tissue and Pap smear samples, proving its superior external generalization and image reconstruction speed. Beyond holographic microscopy and quantitative phase imaging, FIN and the underlying neural network architecture might open up various new opportunities to design broadly generalizable deep learning models in computational imaging and machine vision fields."
Pixel2Mesh++: 3D Mesh Generation and Refinement from Multi-View Images,"We study the problem of shape generation in 3D mesh representation from a small number of color images with or without camera poses. While many previous works learn to hallucinate the shape directly from priors, we adopt to further improve the shape quality by leveraging cross-view information with a graph convolution network. Instead of building a direct mapping function from images to 3D shape, our model learns to predict series of deformations to improve a coarse shape iteratively. Inspired by traditional multiple view geometry methods, our network samples nearby area around the initial mesh's vertex locations and reasons an optimal deformation using perceptual feature statistics built from multiple input images. Extensive experiments show that our model produces accurate 3D shapes that are not only visually plausible from the input perspectives, but also well aligned to arbitrary viewpoints. With the help of physically driven architecture, our model also exhibits generalization capability across different semantic categories, and the number of input images. Model analysis experiments show that our model is robust to the quality of the initial mesh and the error of camera pose, and can be combined with a differentiable renderer for test-time optimization."
Opal: Multimodal Image Generation for News Illustration,"Advances in multimodal AI have presented people with powerful ways to create images from text. Recent work has shown that text-to-image generations are able to represent a broad range of subjects and artistic styles. However, finding the right visual language for text prompts is difficult. In this paper, we address this challenge with Opal, a system that produces text-to-image generations for news illustration. Given an article, Opal guides users through a structured search for visual concepts and provides a pipeline allowing users to generate illustrations based on an article's tone, keywords, and related artistic styles. Our evaluation shows that Opal efficiently generates diverse sets of news illustrations, visual assets, and concept ideas. Users with Opal generated two times more usable results than users without. We discuss how structured exploration can help users better understand the capabilities of human AI co-creative systems."
VQGAN-CLIP: Open Domain Image Generation and Editing with Natural Language Guidance,"Generating and editing images from open domain text prompts is a challenging task that heretofore has required expensive and specially trained models. We demonstrate a novel methodology for both tasks which is capable of producing images of high visual quality from text prompts of significant semantic complexity without any training by using a multimodal encoder to guide image generations. We demonstrate on a variety of tasks how using CLIP [37] to guide VQGAN [11] produces higher visual quality outputs than prior, less flexible approaches like DALL-E [38], GLIDE [33] and Open-Edit [24], despite not being trained for the tasks presented. Our code is available in a public repository."
A Comprehensive Survey on Data-Efficient GANs in Image Generation,"Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have achieved remarkable achievements in image synthesis. These successes of GANs rely on large scale datasets, requiring too much cost. With limited training data, how to stable the training process of GANs and generate realistic images have attracted more attention. The challenges of Data-Efficient GANs (DE-GANs) mainly arise from three aspects: (i) Mismatch Between Training and Target Distributions, (ii) Overfitting of the Discriminator, and (iii) Imbalance Between Latent and Data Spaces. Although many augmentation and pre-training strategies have been proposed to alleviate these issues, there lacks a systematic survey to summarize the properties, challenges, and solutions of DE-GANs. In this paper, we revisit and define DE-GANs from the perspective of distribution optimization. We conclude and analyze the challenges of DE-GANs. Meanwhile, we propose a taxonomy, which classifies the existing methods into three categories: Data Selection, GANs Optimization, and Knowledge Sharing. Last but not the least, we attempt to highlight the current problems and the future directions."
DR-GAN: Distribution Regularization for Text-to-Image Generation,"This paper presents a new Text-to-Image generation model, named Distribution Regularization Generative Adversarial Network (DR-GAN), to generate images from text descriptions from improved distribution learning. In DR-GAN, we introduce two novel modules: a Semantic Disentangling Module (SDM) and a Distribution Normalization Module (DNM). SDM combines the spatial self-attention mechanism and a new Semantic Disentangling Loss (SDL) to help the generator distill key semantic information for the image generation. DNM uses a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) to normalize and denoise the image latent distribution, which can help the discriminator better distinguish synthesized images from real images. DNM also adopts a Distribution Adversarial Loss (DAL) to guide the generator to align with normalized real image distributions in the latent space. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrated that our DR-GAN achieved a competitive performance in the Text-to-Image task."
Unconditional Image-Text Pair Generation with Multimodal Cross Quantizer,"Although deep generative models have gained a lot of attention, most of the existing works are designed for unimodal generation. In this paper, we explore a new method for unconditional image-text pair generation. We design Multimodal Cross-Quantization VAE (MXQ-VAE), a novel vector quantizer for joint image-text representations, with which we discover that a joint image-text representation space is effective for semantically consistent image-text pair generation. To learn a multimodal semantic correlation in a quantized space, we combine VQ-VAE with a Transformer encoder and apply an input masking strategy. Specifically, MXQ-VAE accepts a masked image-text pair as input and learns a quantized joint representation space, so that the input can be converted to a unified code sequence, then we perform unconditional image-text pair generation with the code sequence. Extensive experiments show the correlation between the quantized joint space and the multimodal generation capability on synthetic and real-world datasets. In addition, we demonstrate the superiority of our approach in these two aspects over several baselines. The source code is publicly available at: https://github.com/ttumyche/MXQ-VAE."
PLGAN: Generative Adversarial Networks for Power-Line Segmentation in Aerial Images,"Accurate segmentation of power lines in various aerial images is very important for UAV flight safety. The complex background and very thin structures of power lines, however, make it an inherently difficult task in computer vision. This paper presents PLGAN, a simple yet effective method based on generative adversarial networks, to segment power lines from aerial images with different backgrounds. Instead of directly using the adversarial networks to generate the segmentation, we take their certain decoding features and embed them into another semantic segmentation network by considering more context, geometry, and appearance information of power lines. We further exploit the appropriate form of the generated images for high-quality feature embedding and define a new loss function in the Hough-transform parameter space to enhance the segmentation of very thin power lines. Extensive experiments and comprehensive analysis demonstrate that our proposed PLGAN outperforms the prior state-of-the-art methods for semantic segmentation and line detection."
Multi-View Consistent Generative Adversarial Networks for 3D-aware Image Synthesis,"3D-aware image synthesis aims to generate images of objects from multiple views by learning a 3D representation. However, one key challenge remains: existing approaches lack geometry constraints, hence usually fail to generate multi-view consistent images. To address this challenge, we propose Multi-View Consistent Generative Adversarial Networks (MVCGAN) for high-quality 3D-aware image synthesis with geometry constraints. By leveraging the underlying 3D geometry information of generated images, i.e., depth and camera transformation matrix, we explicitly establish stereo correspondence between views to perform multi-view joint optimization. In particular, we enforce the photometric consistency between pairs of views and integrate a stereo mixup mechanism into the training process, encouraging the model to reason about the correct 3D shape. Besides, we design a two-stage training strategy with feature-level multi-view joint optimization to improve the image quality. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that MVCGAN achieves the state-of-the-art performance for 3D-aware image synthesis."
Hierarchical Text-Conditional Image Generation with CLIP Latents,"Contrastive models like CLIP have been shown to learn robust representations of images that capture both semantics and style. To leverage these representations for image generation, we propose a two-stage model: a prior that generates a CLIP image embedding given a text caption, and a decoder that generates an image conditioned on the image embedding. We show that explicitly generating image representations improves image diversity with minimal loss in photorealism and caption similarity. Our decoders conditioned on image representations can also produce variations of an image that preserve both its semantics and style, while varying the non-essential details absent from the image representation. Moreover, the joint embedding space of CLIP enables language-guided image manipulations in a zero-shot fashion. We use diffusion models for the decoder and experiment with both autoregressive and diffusion models for the prior, finding that the latter are computationally more efficient and produce higher-quality samples."
Content and Style Aware Generation of Text-line Images for Handwriting Recognition,"Handwritten Text Recognition has achieved an impressive performance in public benchmarks. However, due to the high inter- and intra-class variability between handwriting styles, such recognizers need to be trained using huge volumes of manually labeled training data. To alleviate this labor-consuming problem, synthetic data produced with TrueType fonts has been often used in the training loop to gain volume and augment the handwriting style variability. However, there is a significant style bias between synthetic and real data which hinders the improvement of recognition performance. To deal with such limitations, we propose a generative method for handwritten text-line images, which is conditioned on both visual appearance and textual content. Our method is able to produce long text-line samples with diverse handwriting styles. Once properly trained, our method can also be adapted to new target data by only accessing unlabeled text-line images to mimic handwritten styles and produce images with any textual content. Extensive experiments have been done on making use of the generated samples to boost Handwritten Text Recognition performance. Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the current state of the art."
Commonality in Natural Images Rescues GANs: Pretraining GANs with Generic and Privacy-free Synthetic Data,"Transfer learning for GANs successfully improves generation performance under low-shot regimes. However, existing studies show that the pretrained model using a single benchmark dataset is not generalized to various target datasets. More importantly, the pretrained model can be vulnerable to copyright or privacy risks as membership inference attack advances. To resolve both issues, we propose an effective and unbiased data synthesizer, namely Primitives-PS, inspired by the generic characteristics of natural images. Specifically, we utilize 1) the generic statistics on the frequency magnitude spectrum, 2) the elementary shape (i.e., image composition via elementary shapes) for representing the structure information, and 3) the existence of saliency as prior. Since our synthesizer only considers the generic properties of natural images, the single model pretrained on our dataset can be consistently transferred to various target datasets, and even outperforms the previous methods pretrained with the natural images in terms of Fr'echet inception distance. Extensive analysis, ablation study, and evaluations demonstrate that each component of our data synthesizer is effective, and provide insights on the desirable nature of the pretrained model for the transferability of GANs."
No Token Left Behind: Explainability-Aided Image Classification and Generation,"The application of zero-shot learning in computer vision has been revolutionized by the use of image-text matching models. The most notable example, CLIP, has been widely used for both zero-shot classification and guiding generative models with a text prompt. However, the zero-shot use of CLIP is unstable with respect to the phrasing of the input text, making it necessary to carefully engineer the prompts used. We find that this instability stems from a selective similarity score, which is based only on a subset of the semantically meaningful input tokens. To mitigate it, we present a novel explainability-based approach, which adds a loss term to ensure that CLIP focuses on all relevant semantic parts of the input, in addition to employing the CLIP similarity loss used in previous works. When applied to one-shot classification through prompt engineering, our method yields an improvement in the recognition rate, without additional training or fine-tuning. Additionally, we show that CLIP guidance of generative models using our method significantly improves the generated images. Finally, we demonstrate a novel use of CLIP guidance for text-based image generation with spatial conditioning on object location, by requiring the image explainability heatmap for each object to be confined to a pre-determined bounding box."
Generative Adversarial Networks for Image Augmentation in Agriculture: A Systematic Review,"In agricultural image analysis, optimal model performance is keenly pursued for better fulfilling visual recognition tasks (e.g., image classification, segmentation, object detection and localization), in the presence of challenges with biological variability and unstructured environments. Large-scale, balanced and ground-truthed image datasets, however, are often difficult to obtain to fuel the development of advanced, high-performance models. As artificial intelligence through deep learning is impacting analysis and modeling of agricultural images, data augmentation plays a crucial role in boosting model performance while reducing manual efforts for data preparation, by algorithmically expanding training datasets. Beyond traditional data augmentation techniques, generative adversarial network (GAN) invented in 2014 in the computer vision community, provides a suite of novel approaches that can learn good data representations and generate highly realistic samples. Since 2017, there has been a growth of research into GANs for image augmentation or synthesis in agriculture for improved model performance. This paper presents an overview of the evolution of GAN architectures followed by a systematic review of their application to agriculture (https://github.com/Derekabc/GANs-Agriculture), involving various vision tasks for plant health, weeds, fruits, aquaculture, animal farming, plant phenotyping as well as postharvest detection of fruit defects. Challenges and opportunities of GANs are discussed for future research."
ManiTrans: Entity-Level Text-Guided Image Manipulation via Token-wise Semantic Alignment and Generation,"Existing text-guided image manipulation methods aim to modify the appearance of the image or to edit a few objects in a virtual or simple scenario, which is far from practical application. In this work, we study a novel task on text-guided image manipulation on the entity level in the real world. The task imposes three basic requirements, (1) to edit the entity consistent with the text descriptions, (2) to preserve the text-irrelevant regions, and (3) to merge the manipulated entity into the image naturally. To this end, we propose a new transformer-based framework based on the two-stage image synthesis method, namely \textbf{ManiTrans}, which can not only edit the appearance of entities but also generate new entities corresponding to the text guidance. Our framework incorporates a semantic alignment module to locate the image regions to be manipulated, and a semantic loss to help align the relationship between the vision and language. We conduct extensive experiments on the real datasets, CUB, Oxford, and COCO datasets to verify that our method can distinguish the relevant and irrelevant regions and achieve more precise and flexible manipulation compared with baseline methods. The project homepage is \url{https://jawang19.github.io/manitrans}."
A Generic Image Retrieval Method for Date Estimation of Historical Document Collections,"Date estimation of historical document images is a challenging problem, with several contributions in the literature that lack of the ability to generalize from one dataset to others. This paper presents a robust date estimation system based in a retrieval approach that generalizes well in front of heterogeneous collections. we use a ranking loss function named smooth-nDCG to train a Convolutional Neural Network that learns an ordination of documents for each problem. One of the main usages of the presented approach is as a tool for historical contextual retrieval. It means that scholars could perform comparative analysis of historical images from big datasets in terms of the period where they were produced. We provide experimental evaluation on different types of documents from real datasets of manuscript and newspaper images."
SnapMode: An Intelligent and Distributed Large-Scale Fashion Image Retrieval Platform Based On Big Data and Deep Generative Adversarial Network Technologies,"Fashion is now among the largest industries worldwide, for it represents human history and helps tell the worlds story. As a result of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, the Internet has become an increasingly important source of fashion information. However, with a growing number of web pages and social data, it is nearly impossible for humans to manually catch up with the ongoing evolution and the continuously variable content in this domain. The proper management and exploitation of big data can pave the way for the substantial growth of the global economy as well as citizen satisfaction. Therefore, computer scientists have found it challenging to handle e-commerce fashion websites by using big data and machine learning technologies. This paper first proposes a scalable focused Web Crawler engine based on the distributed computing platforms to extract and process fashion data on e-commerce websites. The role of the proposed platform is then described in developing a disentangled feature extraction method by employing deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGANs) for content-based image indexing and retrieval. Finally, the state-of-the-art solutions are compared, and the results of the proposed approach are analyzed on a standard dataset. For the real-life implementation of the proposed solution, a Web-based application is developed on Apache Storm, Kafka, Solr, and Milvus platforms to create a fashion search engine called SnapMode."
Mitosis domain generalization in histopathology images -- The MIDOG challenge,"The density of mitotic figures within tumor tissue is known to be highly correlated with tumor proliferation and thus is an important marker in tumor grading. Recognition of mitotic figures by pathologists is known to be subject to a strong inter-rater bias, which limits the prognostic value. State-of-the-art deep learning methods can support the expert in this assessment but are known to strongly deteriorate when applied in a different clinical environment than was used for training. One decisive component in the underlying domain shift has been identified as the variability caused by using different whole slide scanners. The goal of the MICCAI MIDOG 2021 challenge has been to propose and evaluate methods that counter this domain shift and derive scanner-agnostic mitosis detection algorithms. The challenge used a training set of 200 cases, split across four scanning systems. As a test set, an additional 100 cases split across four scanning systems, including two previously unseen scanners, were given. The best approaches performed on an expert level, with the winning algorithm yielding an F_1 score of 0.748 (CI95: 0.704-0.781). In this paper, we evaluate and compare the approaches that were submitted to the challenge and identify methodological factors contributing to better performance."
Unsupervised Image-to-Image Translation with Generative Prior,"Unsupervised image-to-image translation aims to learn the translation between two visual domains without paired data. Despite the recent progress in image translation models, it remains challenging to build mappings between complex domains with drastic visual discrepancies. In this work, we present a novel framework, Generative Prior-guided UNsupervised Image-to-image Translation (GP-UNIT), to improve the overall quality and applicability of the translation algorithm. Our key insight is to leverage the generative prior from pre-trained class-conditional GANs (e.g., BigGAN) to learn rich content correspondences across various domains. We propose a novel coarse-to-fine scheme: we first distill the generative prior to capture a robust coarse-level content representation that can link objects at an abstract semantic level, based on which fine-level content features are adaptively learned for more accurate multi-level content correspondences. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our versatile framework over state-of-the-art methods in robust, high-quality and diversified translations, even for challenging and distant domains."
Evaluating Procedures for Establishing Generative Adversarial Network-based Stochastic Image Models in Medical Imaging,"Modern generative models, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), hold tremendous promise for several areas of medical imaging, such as unconditional medical image synthesis, image restoration, reconstruction and translation, and optimization of imaging systems. However, procedures for establishing stochastic image models (SIMs) using GANs remain generic and do not address specific issues relevant to medical imaging. In this work, canonical SIMs that simulate realistic vessels in angiography images are employed to evaluate procedures for establishing SIMs using GANs. The GAN-based SIM is compared to the canonical SIM based on its ability to reproduce those statistics that are meaningful to the particular medically realistic SIM considered. It is shown that evaluating GANs using classical metrics and medically relevant metrics may lead to different conclusions about the fidelity of the trained GANs. This work highlights the need for the development of objective metrics for evaluating GANs."
KNN-Diffusion: Image Generation via Large-Scale Retrieval,"Recent text-to-image models have achieved impressive results. However, since they require large-scale datasets of text-image pairs, it is impractical to train them on new domains where data is scarce or not labeled. In this work, we propose using large-scale retrieval methods, in particular, efficient k-Nearest-Neighbors (kNN), which offers novel capabilities: (1) training a substantially small and efficient text-to-image diffusion model without any text, (2) generating out-of-distribution images by simply swapping the retrieval database at inference time, and (3) performing text-driven local semantic manipulations while preserving object identity. To demonstrate the robustness of our method, we apply our kNN approach on two state-of-the-art diffusion backbones, and show results on several different datasets. As evaluated by human studies and automatic metrics, our method achieves state-of-the-art results compared to existing approaches that train text-to-image generation models using images only (without paired text data)"
Learning to Generate Realistic Noisy Images via Pixel-level Noise-aware Adversarial Training,"Existing deep learning real denoising methods require a large amount of noisy-clean image pairs for supervision. Nonetheless, capturing a real noisy-clean dataset is an unacceptable expensive and cumbersome procedure. To alleviate this problem, this work investigates how to generate realistic noisy images. Firstly, we formulate a simple yet reasonable noise model that treats each real noisy pixel as a random variable. This model splits the noisy image generation problem into two sub-problems: image domain alignment and noise domain alignment. Subsequently, we propose a novel framework, namely Pixel-level Noise-aware Generative Adversarial Network (PNGAN). PNGAN employs a pre-trained real denoiser to map the fake and real noisy images into a nearly noise-free solution space to perform image domain alignment. Simultaneously, PNGAN establishes a pixel-level adversarial training to conduct noise domain alignment. Additionally, for better noise fitting, we present an efficient architecture Simple Multi-scale Network (SMNet) as the generator. Qualitative validation shows that noise generated by PNGAN is highly similar to real noise in terms of intensity and distribution. Quantitative experiments demonstrate that a series of denoisers trained with the generated noisy images achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on four real denoising benchmarks. Part of codes, pre-trained models, and results are available at https://github.com/caiyuanhao1998/PNGAN for comparisons."
DT2I: Dense Text-to-Image Generation from Region Descriptions,"Despite astonishing progress, generating realistic images of complex scenes remains a challenging problem. Recently, layout-to-image synthesis approaches have attracted much interest by conditioning the generator on a list of bounding boxes and corresponding class labels. However, previous approaches are very restrictive because the set of labels is fixed a priori. Meanwhile, text-to-image synthesis methods have substantially improved and provide a flexible way for conditional image generation. In this work, we introduce dense text-to-image (DT2I) synthesis as a new task to pave the way toward more intuitive image generation. Furthermore, we propose DTC-GAN, a novel method to generate images from semantically rich region descriptions, and a multi-modal region feature matching loss to encourage semantic image-text matching. Our results demonstrate the capability of our approach to generate plausible images of complex scenes using region captions."
Interpretable Saliency Maps And Self-Supervised Learning For Generalized Zero Shot Medical Image Classification,"In many real world medical image classification settings we do not have access to samples of all possible disease classes, while a robust system is expected to give high performance in recognizing novel test data. We propose a generalized zero shot learning (GZSL) method that uses self supervised learning (SSL) for: 1) selecting anchor vectors of different disease classes; and 2) training a feature generator. Our approach does not require class attribute vectors which are available for natural images but not for medical images. SSL ensures that the anchor vectors are representative of each class. SSL is also used to generate synthetic features of unseen classes. Using a simpler architecture, our method matches a state of the art SSL based GZSL method for natural images and outperforms all methods for medical images. Our method is adaptable enough to accommodate class attribute vectors when they are available for natural images."
Adaptive Network Combination for Single-Image Reflection Removal: A Domain Generalization Perspective,"Recently, multiple synthetic and real-world datasets have been built to facilitate the training of deep single image reflection removal (SIRR) models. Meanwhile, diverse testing sets are also provided with different types of reflection and scenes. However, the non-negligible domain gaps between training and testing sets make it difficult to learn deep models generalizing well to testing images. The diversity of reflections and scenes further makes it a mission impossible to learn a single model being effective to all testing sets and real-world reflections. In this paper, we tackle these issues by learning SIRR models from a domain generalization perspective. Particularly, for each source set, a specific SIRR model is trained to serve as a domain expert of relevant reflection types. For a given reflection-contaminated image, we present a reflection type-aware weighting (RTAW) module to predict expert-wise weights. RTAW can then be incorporated with adaptive network combination (AdaNEC) for handling different reflection types and scenes, i.e., generalizing to unknown domains. Two representative AdaNEC methods, i.e., output fusion (OF) and network interpolation (NI), are provided by considering both adaptation levels and efficiency. For images from one source set, we train RTAW to only predict expert-wise weights of other domain experts for improving generalization ability, while the weights of all experts are predicted and employed during testing. An in-domain expert (IDE) loss is presented for training RTAW. Extensive experiments show the appealing performance gain of our AdaNEC on different state-of-the-art SIRR networks. Source code and pre-trained models will available at https://github.com/csmliu/AdaNEC."
PixelFolder: An Efficient Progressive Pixel Synthesis Network for Image Generation,"Pixel synthesis is a promising research paradigm for image generation, which can well exploit pixel-wise prior knowledge for generation. However, existing methods still suffer from excessive memory footprint and computation overhead. In this paper, we propose a progressive pixel synthesis network towards efficient image generation, coined as PixelFolder. Specifically, PixelFolder formulates image generation as a progressive pixel regression problem and synthesizes images via a multi-stage structure, which can greatly reduce the overhead caused by large tensor transformations. In addition, we introduce novel pixel folding operations to further improve model efficiency while maintaining pixel-wise prior knowledge for end-to-end regression. With these innovative designs, we greatly reduce the expenditure of pixel synthesis, e.g., reducing 89% computation and 53% parameters compared with the latest pixel synthesis method CIPS. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, namely FFHQ and LSUN Church. The experimental results show that with much less expenditure, PixelFolder obtains new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on two benchmark datasets, i.e., 3.77 FID and 2.45 FID on FFHQ and LSUN Church, respectively.Meanwhile, PixelFolder is also more efficient than the SOTA methods like StyleGAN2, reducing about 72% computation and 31% parameters, respectively. These results greatly validate the effectiveness of the proposed PixelFolder."
Marginal Contrastive Correspondence for Guided Image Generation,"Exemplar-based image translation establishes dense correspondences between a conditional input and an exemplar (from two different domains) for leveraging detailed exemplar styles to achieve realistic image translation. Existing work builds the cross-domain correspondences implicitly by minimizing feature-wise distances across the two domains. Without explicit exploitation of domain-invariant features, this approach may not reduce the domain gap effectively which often leads to sub-optimal correspondences and image translation. We design a Marginal Contrastive Learning Network (MCL-Net) that explores contrastive learning to learn domain-invariant features for realistic exemplar-based image translation. Specifically, we design an innovative marginal contrastive loss that guides to establish dense correspondences explicitly. Nevertheless, building correspondence with domain-invariant semantics alone may impair the texture patterns and lead to degraded texture generation. We thus design a Self-Correlation Map (SCM) that incorporates scene structures as auxiliary information which improves the built correspondences substantially. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on multifarious image translation tasks show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art consistently."
Learning to Deblur using Light Field Generated and Real Defocus Images,"Defocus deblurring is a challenging task due to the spatially varying nature of defocus blur. While deep learning approach shows great promise in solving image restoration problems, defocus deblurring demands accurate training data that consists of all-in-focus and defocus image pairs, which is difficult to collect. Naive two-shot capturing cannot achieve pixel-wise correspondence between the defocused and all-in-focus image pairs. Synthetic aperture of light fields is suggested to be a more reliable way to generate accurate image pairs. However, the defocus blur generated from light field data is different from that of the images captured with a traditional digital camera. In this paper, we propose a novel deep defocus deblurring network that leverages the strength and overcomes the shortcoming of light fields. We first train the network on a light field-generated dataset for its highly accurate image correspondence. Then, we fine-tune the network using feature loss on another dataset collected by the two-shot method to alleviate the differences between the defocus blur exists in the two domains. This strategy is proved to be highly effective and able to achieve the state-of-the-art performance both quantitatively and qualitatively on multiple test sets. Extensive ablation studies have been conducted to analyze the effect of each network module to the final performance."
Disentangled3D: Learning a 3D Generative Model with Disentangled Geometry and Appearance from Monocular Images,"Learning 3D generative models from a dataset of monocular images enables self-supervised 3D reasoning and controllable synthesis. State-of-the-art 3D generative models are GANs which use neural 3D volumetric representations for synthesis. Images are synthesized by rendering the volumes from a given camera. These models can disentangle the 3D scene from the camera viewpoint in any generated image. However, most models do not disentangle other factors of image formation, such as geometry and appearance. In this paper, we design a 3D GAN which can learn a disentangled model of objects, just from monocular observations. Our model can disentangle the geometry and appearance variations in the scene, i.e., we can independently sample from the geometry and appearance spaces of the generative model. This is achieved using a novel non-rigid deformable scene formulation. A 3D volume which represents an object instance is computed as a non-rigidly deformed canonical 3D volume. Our method learns the canonical volume, as well as its deformations, jointly during training. This formulation also helps us improve the disentanglement between the 3D scene and the camera viewpoints using a novel pose regularization loss defined on the 3D deformation field. In addition, we further model the inverse deformations, enabling the computation of dense correspondences between images generated by our model. Finally, we design an approach to embed real images into the latent space of our disentangled generative model, enabling editing of real images."
NICGSlowDown: Evaluating the Efficiency Robustness of Neural Image Caption Generation Models,"Neural image caption generation (NICG) models have received massive attention from the research community due to their excellent performance in visual understanding. Existing work focuses on improving NICG model accuracy while efficiency is less explored. However, many real-world applications require real-time feedback, which highly relies on the efficiency of NICG models. Recent research observed that the efficiency of NICG models could vary for different inputs. This observation brings in a new attack surface of NICG models, i.e., An adversary might be able to slightly change inputs to cause the NICG models to consume more computational resources. To further understand such efficiency-oriented threats, we propose a new attack approach, NICGSlowDown, to evaluate the efficiency robustness of NICG models. Our experimental results show that NICGSlowDown can generate images with human-unnoticeable perturbations that will increase the NICG model latency up to 483.86%. We hope this research could raise the community's concern about the efficiency robustness of NICG models."
Using Machine Learning to generate an open-access cropland map from satellite images time series in the Indian Himalayan Region,"Crop maps are crucial for agricultural monitoring and food management and can additionally support domain-specific applications, such as setting cold supply chain infrastructure in developing countries. Machine learning (ML) models, combined with freely-available satellite imagery, can be used to produce cost-effective and high spatial-resolution crop maps. However, accessing ground truth data for supervised learning is especially challenging in developing countries due to factors such as smallholding and fragmented geography, which often results in a lack of crop type maps or even reliable cropland maps. Our area of interest for this study lies in Himachal Pradesh, India, where we aim at producing an open-access binary cropland map at 10-meter resolution for the Kullu, Shimla, and Mandi districts. To this end, we developed an ML pipeline that relies on Sentinel-2 satellite images time series. We investigated two pixel-based supervised classifiers, support vector machines (SVM) and random forest (RF), which are used to classify per-pixel time series for binary cropland mapping. The ground truth data used for training, validation and testing was manually annotated from a combination of field survey reference points and visual interpretation of very high resolution (VHR) imagery. We trained and validated the models via spatial cross-validation to account for local spatial autocorrelation and selected the RF model due to overall robustness and lower computational cost. We tested the generalization capability of the chosen model at the pixel level by computing the accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score on hold-out test sets of each district, achieving an average accuracy for the RF (our best model) of 87%. We used this model to generate a cropland map for three districts of Himachal Pradesh, spanning 14,600 km2, which improves the resolution and quality of existing public maps."
Fusing Global and Local Features for Generalized AI-Synthesized Image Detection,"With the development of the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and DeepFakes, AI-synthesized images are now of such high quality that humans can hardly distinguish them from real images. It is imperative for media forensics to develop detectors to expose them accurately. Existing detection methods have shown high performance in generated images detection, but they tend to generalize poorly in the real-world scenarios, where the synthetic images are usually generated with unseen models using unknown source data. In this work, we emphasize the importance of combining information from the whole image and informative patches in improving the generalization ability of AI-synthesized image detection. Specifically, we design a two-branch model to combine global spatial information from the whole image and local informative features from multiple patches selected by a novel patch selection module. Multi-head attention mechanism is further utilized to fuse the global and local features. We collect a highly diverse dataset synthesized by 19 models with various objects and resolutions to evaluate our model. Experimental results demonstrate the high accuracy and good generalization ability of our method in detecting generated images. Our code is available at https://github.com/littlejuyan/FusingGlobalandLocal."
Which Generative Adversarial Network Yields High-Quality Synthetic Medical Images: Investigation Using AMD Image Datasets,"Deep learning has been proposed for the assessment and classification of medical images. However, many medical image databases with appropriately labeled and annotated images are small and imbalanced, and thus unsuitable to train and validate such models. The option is to generate synthetic images and one successful technique has been patented which limits its use for others. We have developed a free-access, alternate method for generating synthetic high-resolution images using Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for data augmentation and showed their effectiveness using eye-fundus images for Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) identification. Ten different GAN architectures were compared to generate synthetic eye-fundus images with and without AMD. Data from three public databases were evaluated using the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), two clinical experts and deep-learning classification. The results show that StyleGAN2 reached the lowest FID (166.17), and clinicians could not accurately differentiate between real and synthetic images. ResNet-18 architecture obtained the best performance with 85% accuracy and outperformed the two experts in detecting AMD fundus images, whose average accuracy was 77.5%. These results are similar to a recently patented method, and will provide an alternative to generating high-quality synthetic medical images. Free access has been provided to the entire method to facilitate the further development of this field."
Spatially Multi-conditional Image Generation,"In most scenarios, conditional image generation can be thought of as an inversion of the image understanding process. Since generic image understanding involves solving multiple tasks, it is natural to aim at generating images via multi-conditioning. However, multi-conditional image generation is a very challenging problem due to the heterogeneity and the sparsity of the (in practice) available conditioning labels. In this work, we propose a novel neural architecture to address the problem of heterogeneity and sparsity of the spatially multi-conditional labels. Our choice of spatial conditioning, such as by semantics and depth, is driven by the promise it holds for better control of the image generation process. The proposed method uses a transformer-like architecture operating pixel-wise, which receives the available labels as input tokens to merge them in a learned homogeneous space of labels. The merged labels are then used for image generation via conditional generative adversarial training. In this process, the sparsity of the labels is handled by simply dropping the input tokens corresponding to the missing labels at the desired locations, thanks to the proposed pixel-wise operating architecture. Our experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the clear superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art and compared baselines. The source code will be made publicly available."
CLIP-Mesh: Generating textured meshes from text using pretrained image-text models,"We present a technique for zero-shot generation of a 3D model using only a target text prompt. Without any 3D supervision our method deforms the control shape of a limit subdivided surface along with its texture map and normal map to obtain a 3D asset that corresponds to the input text prompt and can be easily deployed into games or modeling applications. We rely only on a pre-trained CLIP model that compares the input text prompt with differentiably rendered images of our 3D model. While previous works have focused on stylization or required training of generative models we perform optimization on mesh parameters directly to generate shape, texture or both. To constrain the optimization to produce plausible meshes and textures we introduce a number of techniques using image augmentations and the use of a pretrained prior that generates CLIP image embeddings given a text embedding."
Make-A-Scene: Scene-Based Text-to-Image Generation with Human Priors,"Recent text-to-image generation methods provide a simple yet exciting conversion capability between text and image domains. While these methods have incrementally improved the generated image fidelity and text relevancy, several pivotal gaps remain unanswered, limiting applicability and quality. We propose a novel text-to-image method that addresses these gaps by (i) enabling a simple control mechanism complementary to text in the form of a scene, (ii) introducing elements that substantially improve the tokenization process by employing domain-specific knowledge over key image regions (faces and salient objects), and (iii) adapting classifier-free guidance for the transformer use case. Our model achieves state-of-the-art FID and human evaluation results, unlocking the ability to generate high fidelity images in a resolution of 512x512 pixels, significantly improving visual quality. Through scene controllability, we introduce several new capabilities: (i) Scene editing, (ii) text editing with anchor scenes, (iii) overcoming out-of-distribution text prompts, and (iv) story illustration generation, as demonstrated in the story we wrote."
Generating natural images with direct Patch Distributions Matching,"Many traditional computer vision algorithms generate realistic images by requiring that each patch in the generated image be similar to a patch in a training image and vice versa. Recently, this classical approach has been replaced by adversarial training with a patch discriminator. The adversarial approach avoids the computational burden of finding nearest neighbors of patches but often requires very long training times and may fail to match the distribution of patches. In this paper we leverage the recently developed Sliced Wasserstein Distance and develop an algorithm that explicitly and efficiently minimizes the distance between patch distributions in two images. Our method is conceptually simple, requires no training and can be implemented in a few lines of codes. On a number of image generation tasks we show that our results are often superior to single-image-GANs, require no training, and can generate high quality images in a few seconds. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/ariel415el/GPDM"
Learning Whole Heart Mesh Generation From Patient Images For Computational Simulations,"Patient-specific cardiac modeling combines geometries of the heart derived from medical images and biophysical simulations to predict various aspects of cardiac function. However, generating simulation-suitable models of the heart from patient image data often requires complicated procedures and significant human effort. We present a fast and automated deep-learning method to construct simulation-suitable models of the heart from medical images. The approach constructs meshes from 3D patient images by learning to deform a small set of deformation handles on a whole heart template. For both 3D CT and MR data, this method achieves promising accuracy for whole heart reconstruction, consistently outperforming prior methods in constructing simulation-suitable meshes of the heart. When evaluated on time-series CT data, this method produced more anatomically and temporally consistent geometries than prior methods, and was able to produce geometries that better satisfy modeling requirements for cardiac flow simulations. Our source code will be available on GitHub."
Towards Device Efficient Conditional Image Generation,"We present a novel algorithm to reduce tensor compute required by a conditional image generation autoencoder without sacrificing quality of photo-realistic image generation. Our method is device agnostic, and can optimize an autoencoder for a given CPU-only, GPU compute device(s) in about normal time it takes to train an autoencoder on a generic workstation. We achieve this via a two-stage novel strategy where, first, we condense the channel weights, such that, as few as possible channels are used. Then, we prune the nearly zeroed out weight activations, and fine-tune the autoencoder. To maintain image quality, fine-tuning is done via student-teacher training, where we reuse the condensed autoencoder as the teacher. We show performance gains for various conditional image generation tasks: segmentation mask to face images, face images to cartoonization, and finally CycleGAN-based model over multiple compute devices. We perform various ablation studies to justify the claims and design choices, and achieve real-time versions of various autoencoders on CPU-only devices while maintaining image quality, thus enabling at-scale deployment of such autoencoders."
Relationformer: A Unified Framework for Image-to-Graph Generation,"A comprehensive representation of an image requires understanding objects and their mutual relationship, especially in image-to-graph generation, e.g., road network extraction, blood-vessel network extraction, or scene graph generation. Traditionally, image-to-graph generation is addressed with a two-stage approach consisting of object detection followed by a separate relation prediction, which prevents simultaneous object-relation interaction. This work proposes a unified one-stage transformer-based framework, namely Relationformer, that jointly predicts objects and their relations. We leverage direct set-based object prediction and incorporate the interaction among the objects to learn an object-relation representation jointly. In addition to existing [obj]-tokens, we propose a novel learnable token, namely [rln]-token. Together with [obj]-tokens, [rln]-token exploits local and global semantic reasoning in an image through a series of mutual associations. In combination with the pair-wise [obj]-token, the [rln]-token contributes to a computationally efficient relation prediction. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on multiple, diverse and multi-domain datasets that demonstrate our approach's effectiveness and generalizability."
Closing the Generalization Gap of Cross-silo Federated Medical Image Segmentation,"Cross-silo federated learning (FL) has attracted much attention in medical imaging analysis with deep learning in recent years as it can resolve the critical issues of insufficient data, data privacy, and training efficiency. However, there can be a generalization gap between the model trained from FL and the one from centralized training. This important issue comes from the non-iid data distribution of the local data in the participating clients and is well-known as client drift. In this work, we propose a novel training framework FedSM to avoid the client drift issue and successfully close the generalization gap compared with the centralized training for medical image segmentation tasks for the first time. We also propose a novel personalized FL objective formulation and a new method SoftPull to solve it in our proposed framework FedSM. We conduct rigorous theoretical analysis to guarantee its convergence for optimizing the non-convex smooth objective function. Real-world medical image segmentation experiments using deep FL validate the motivations and effectiveness of our proposed method."
Bayesian Inversion for Nonlinear Imaging Models using Deep Generative Priors,"Most modern imaging systems incorporate a computational pipeline to infer the image of interest from acquired measurements. The Bayesian approach to solve such ill-posed inverse problems involves the characterization of the posterior distribution of the image. It depends on the model of the imaging system and on prior knowledge on the image of interest. In this work, we present a Bayesian reconstruction framework for nonlinear imaging models where we specify the prior knowledge on the image through a deep generative model. We develop a tractable posterior-sampling scheme based on the Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm for the class of nonlinear inverse problems where the forward model has a neural-network-like structure. This class includes most practical imaging modalities. We introduce the notion of augmented deep generative priors in order to suitably handle the recovery of quantitative images.We illustrate the advantages of our framework by applying it to two nonlinear imaging modalities-phase retrieval and optical diffraction tomography."
Transferable Class-Modelling for Decentralized Source Attribution of GAN-Generated Images,"GAN-generated deepfakes as a genre of digital images are gaining ground as both catalysts of artistic expression and malicious forms of deception, therefore demanding systems to enforce and accredit their ethical use. Existing techniques for the source attribution of synthetic images identify subtle intrinsic fingerprints using multiclass classification neural nets limited in functionality and scalability. Hence, we redefine the deepfake detection and source attribution problems as a series of related binary classification tasks. We leverage transfer learning to rapidly adapt forgery detection networks for multiple independent attribution problems, by proposing a semi-decentralized modular design to solve them simultaneously and efficiently. Class activation mapping is also demonstrated as an effective means of feature localization for model interpretation. Our models are determined via experimentation to be competitive with current benchmarks, and capable of decent performance on human portraits in ideal conditions. Decentralized fingerprint-based attribution is found to retain validity in the presence of novel sources, but is more susceptible to type II errors that intensify with image perturbations and attributive uncertainty. We describe both our conceptual framework and model prototypes for further enhancement when investigating the technical limits of reactive deepfake attribution."
Generalized Classification of Satellite Image Time Series with Thermal Positional Encoding,"Large-scale crop type classification is a task at the core of remote sensing efforts with applications of both economic and ecological importance. Current state-of-the-art deep learning methods are based on self-attention and use satellite image time series (SITS) to discriminate crop types based on their unique growth patterns. However, existing methods generalize poorly to regions not seen during training mainly due to not being robust to temporal shifts of the growing season caused by variations in climate. To this end, we propose Thermal Positional Encoding (TPE) for attention-based crop classifiers. Unlike previous positional encoding based on calendar time (e.g. day-of-year), TPE is based on thermal time, which is obtained by accumulating daily average temperatures over the growing season. Since crop growth is directly related to thermal time, but not calendar time, TPE addresses the temporal shifts between different regions to improve generalization. We propose multiple TPE strategies, including learnable methods, to further improve results compared to the common fixed positional encodings. We demonstrate our approach on a crop classification task across four different European regions, where we obtain state-of-the-art generalization results."
deepNIR: Datasets for generating synthetic NIR images and improved fruit detection system using deep learning techniques,"This paper presents datasets utilised for synthetic near-infrared (NIR) image generation and bounding-box level fruit detection systems. It is undeniable that high-calibre machine learning frameworks such as Tensorflow or Pytorch, and large-scale ImageNet or COCO datasets with the aid of accelerated GPU hardware have pushed the limit of machine learning techniques for more than decades. Among these breakthroughs, a high-quality dataset is one of the essential building blocks that can lead to success in model generalisation and the deployment of data-driven deep neural networks. In particular, synthetic data generation tasks often require more training samples than other supervised approaches. Therefore, in this paper, we share the NIR+RGB datasets that are re-processed from two public datasets (i.e., nirscene and SEN12MS) and our novel NIR+RGB sweet pepper(capsicum) dataset. We quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrate that these NIR+RGB datasets are sufficient to be used for synthetic NIR image generation. We achieved Frechet Inception Distance (FID) of 11.36, 26.53, and 40.15 for nirscene1, SEN12MS, and sweet pepper datasets respectively. In addition, we release manual annotations of 11 fruit bounding boxes that can be exported as various formats using cloud service. Four newly added fruits [blueberry, cherry, kiwi, and wheat] compound 11 novel bounding box datasets on top of our previous work presented in the deepFruits project [apple, avocado, capsicum, mango, orange, rockmelon, strawberry]. The total number of bounding box instances of the dataset is 162k and it is ready to use from cloud service. For the evaluation of the dataset, Yolov5 single stage detector is exploited and reported impressive mean-average-precision,mAP[0.5:0.95] results of[min:0.49, max:0.812]. We hope these datasets are useful and serve as a baseline for the future studies."
Attribute Group Editing for Reliable Few-shot Image Generation,"Few-shot image generation is a challenging task even using the state-of-the-art Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Due to the unstable GAN training process and the limited training data, the generated images are often of low quality and low diversity. In this work, we propose a new editing-based method, i.e., Attribute Group Editing (AGE), for few-shot image generation. The basic assumption is that any image is a collection of attributes and the editing direction for a specific attribute is shared across all categories. AGE examines the internal representation learned in GANs and identifies semantically meaningful directions. Specifically, the class embedding, i.e., the mean vector of the latent codes from a specific category, is used to represent the category-relevant attributes, and the category-irrelevant attributes are learned globally by Sparse Dictionary Learning on the difference between the sample embedding and the class embedding. Given a GAN well trained on seen categories, diverse images of unseen categories can be synthesized through editing category-irrelevant attributes while keeping category-relevant attributes unchanged. Without re-training the GAN, AGE is capable of not only producing more realistic and diverse images for downstream visual applications with limited data but achieving controllable image editing with interpretable category-irrelevant directions."
APRNet: Attention-based Pixel-wise Rendering Network for Photo-Realistic Text Image Generation,"Style-guided text image generation tries to synthesize text image by imitating reference image's appearance while keeping text content unaltered. The text image appearance includes many aspects. In this paper, we focus on transferring style image's background and foreground color patterns to the content image to generate photo-realistic text image. To achieve this goal, we propose 1) a content-style cross attention based pixel sampling approach to roughly mimicking the style text image's background; 2) a pixel-wise style modulation technique to transfer varying color patterns of the style image to the content image spatial-adaptively; 3) a cross attention based multi-scale style fusion approach to solving text foreground misalignment issue between style and content images; 4) an image patch shuffling strategy to create style, content and ground truth image tuples for training. Experimental results on Chinese handwriting text image synthesis with SCUT-HCCDoc and CASIA-OLHWDB datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can improve the quality of synthetic text images and make them more photo-realistic."
InsetGAN for Full-Body Image Generation,"While GANs can produce photo-realistic images in ideal conditions for certain domains, the generation of full-body human images remains difficult due to the diversity of identities, hairstyles, clothing, and the variance in pose. Instead of modeling this complex domain with a single GAN, we propose a novel method to combine multiple pretrained GANs, where one GAN generates a global canvas (e.g., human body) and a set of specialized GANs, or insets, focus on different parts (e.g., faces, shoes) that can be seamlessly inserted onto the global canvas. We model the problem as jointly exploring the respective latent spaces such that the generated images can be combined, by inserting the parts from the specialized generators onto the global canvas, without introducing seams. We demonstrate the setup by combining a full body GAN with a dedicated high-quality face GAN to produce plausible-looking humans. We evaluate our results with quantitative metrics and user studies."
PNM: Pixel Null Model for General Image Segmentation,"A major challenge in image segmentation is classifying object boundaries. Recent efforts propose to refine the segmentation result with boundary masks. However, models are still prone to misclassifying boundary pixels even when they correctly capture the object contours. In such cases, even a perfect boundary map is unhelpful for segmentation refinement. In this paper, we argue that assigning proper prior weights to error-prone pixels such as object boundaries can significantly improve the segmentation quality. Specifically, we present the \textit{pixel null model} (PNM), a prior model that weights each pixel according to its probability of being correctly classified by a random segmenter. Empirical analysis shows that PNM captures the misclassification distribution of different state-of-the-art (SOTA) segmenters. Extensive experiments on semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation tasks over three datasets (Cityscapes, ADE20K, MS COCO) confirm that PNM consistently improves the segmentation quality of most SOTA methods (including the vision transformers) and outperforms boundary-based methods by a large margin. We also observe that the widely-used mean IoU (mIoU) metric is insensitive to boundaries of different sharpness. As a byproduct, we propose a new metric, \textit{PNM IoU}, which perceives the boundary sharpness and better reflects the model segmentation performance in error-prone regions."
Secret-to-Image Reversible Transformation for Generative Steganography,"Recently, generative steganography that transforms secret information to a generated image has been a promising technique to resist steganalysis detection. However, due to the inefficiency and irreversibility of the secret-to-image transformation, it is hard to find a good trade-off between the information hiding capacity and extraction accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a secret-to-image reversible transformation (S2IRT) scheme for generative steganography. The proposed S2IRT scheme is based on a generative model, i.e., Glow model, which enables a bijective-mapping between latent space with multivariate Gaussian distribution and image space with a complex distribution. In the process of S2I transformation, guided by a given secret message, we construct a latent vector and then map it to a generated image by the Glow model, so that the secret message is finally transformed to the generated image. Owing to good efficiency and reversibility of S2IRT scheme, the proposed steganographic approach achieves both high hiding capacity and accurate extraction of secret message from generated image. Furthermore, a separate encoding-based S2IRT (SE-S2IRT) scheme is also proposed to improve the robustness to common image attacks. The experiments demonstrate the proposed steganographic approaches can achieve high hiding capacity (up to 4 bpp) and accurate information extraction (almost 100% accuracy rate) simultaneously, while maintaining desirable anti-detectability and imperceptibility."
KPE: Keypoint Pose Encoding for Transformer-based Image Generation,"Transformers have recently been shown to generate high quality images from text input. However, the existing method of pose conditioning using skeleton image tokens is computationally inefficient and generate low quality images. Therefore we propose a new method; Keypoint Pose Encoding (KPE); KPE is 10 times more memory efficient and over 73% faster at generating high quality images from text input conditioned on the pose. The pose constraint improves the image quality and reduces errors on body extremities such as arms and legs. The additional benefits include invariance to changes in the target image domain and image resolution, making it easily scalable to higher resolution images. We demonstrate the versatility of KPE by generating photorealistic multiperson images derived from the DeepFashion dataset. We also introduce a evaluation method People Count Error (PCE) that is effective in detecting error in generated human images."
Analyzing General-Purpose Deep-Learning Detection and Segmentation Models with Images from a Lidar as a Camera Sensor,"Over the last decade, robotic perception algorithms have significantly benefited from the rapid advances in deep learning (DL). Indeed, a significant amount of the autonomy stack of different commercial and research platforms relies on DL for situational awareness, especially vision sensors. This work explores the potential of general-purpose DL perception algorithms, specifically detection and segmentation neural networks, for processing image-like outputs of advanced lidar sensors. Rather than processing the three-dimensional point cloud data, this is, to the best of our knowledge, the first work to focus on low-resolution images with 360\textdegree field of view obtained with lidar sensors by encoding either depth, reflectivity, or near-infrared light in the image pixels. We show that with adequate preprocessing, general-purpose DL models can process these images, opening the door to their usage in environmental conditions where vision sensors present inherent limitations. We provide both a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the performance of a variety of neural network architectures. We believe that using DL models built for visual cameras offers significant advantages due to the much wider availability and maturity compared to point cloud-based perception."
Exploring Dual-task Correlation for Pose Guided Person Image Generation,"Pose Guided Person Image Generation (PGPIG) is the task of transforming a person image from the source pose to a given target pose. Most of the existing methods only focus on the ill-posed source-to-target task and fail to capture reasonable texture mapping. To address this problem, we propose a novel Dual-task Pose Transformer Network (DPTN), which introduces an auxiliary task (i.e., source-to-source task) and exploits the dual-task correlation to promote the performance of PGPIG. The DPTN is of a Siamese structure, containing a source-to-source self-reconstruction branch, and a transformation branch for source-to-target generation. By sharing partial weights between them, the knowledge learned by the source-to-source task can effectively assist the source-to-target learning. Furthermore, we bridge the two branches with a proposed Pose Transformer Module (PTM) to adaptively explore the correlation between features from dual tasks. Such correlation can establish the fine-grained mapping of all the pixels between the sources and the targets, and promote the source texture transmission to enhance the details of the generated target images. Extensive experiments show that our DPTN outperforms state-of-the-arts in terms of both PSNR and LPIPS. In addition, our DPTN only contains 9.79 million parameters, which is significantly smaller than other approaches. Our code is available at: https://github.com/PangzeCheung/Dual-task-Pose-Transformer-Network."
DrawingInStyles: Portrait Image Generation and Editing with Spatially Conditioned StyleGAN,"The research topic of sketch-to-portrait generation has witnessed a boost of progress with deep learning techniques. The recently proposed StyleGAN architectures achieve state-of-the-art generation ability but the original StyleGAN is not friendly for sketch-based creation due to its unconditional generation nature. To address this issue, we propose a direct conditioning strategy to better preserve the spatial information under the StyleGAN framework. Specifically, we introduce Spatially Conditioned StyleGAN (SC-StyleGAN for short), which explicitly injects spatial constraints to the original StyleGAN generation process. We explore two input modalities, sketches and semantic maps, which together allow users to express desired generation results more precisely and easily. Based on SC-StyleGAN, we present DrawingInStyles, a novel drawing interface for non-professional users to easily produce high-quality, photo-realistic face images with precise control, either from scratch or editing existing ones. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations show the superior generation ability of our method to existing and alternative solutions. The usability and expressiveness of our system are confirmed by a user study."
Detecting GAN-generated Images by Orthogonal Training of Multiple CNNs,"In the last few years, we have witnessed the rise of a series of deep learning methods to generate synthetic images that look extremely realistic. These techniques prove useful in the movie industry and for artistic purposes. However, they also prove dangerous if used to spread fake news or to generate fake online accounts. For this reason, detecting if an image is an actual photograph or has been synthetically generated is becoming an urgent necessity. This paper proposes a detector of synthetic images based on an ensemble of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We consider the problem of detecting images generated with techniques not available at training time. This is a common scenario, given that new image generators are published more and more frequently. To solve this issue, we leverage two main ideas: (i) CNNs should provide orthogonal results to better contribute to the ensemble; (ii) original images are better defined than synthetic ones, thus they should be better trusted at testing time. Experiments show that pursuing these two ideas improves the detector accuracy on NVIDIA's newly generated StyleGAN3 images, never used in training."
Interactive Image Synthesis with Panoptic Layout Generation,"Interactive image synthesis from user-guided input is a challenging task when users wish to control the scene structure of a generated image with ease.Although remarkable progress has been made on layout-based image synthesis approaches, in order to get realistic fake image in interactive scene, existing methods require high-precision inputs, which probably need adjustment several times and are unfriendly to novice users. When placement of bounding boxes is subject to perturbation, layout-based models suffer from ""missing regions"" in the constructed semantic layouts and hence undesirable artifacts in the generated images. In this work, we propose Panoptic Layout Generative Adversarial Networks (PLGAN) to address this challenge. The PLGAN employs panoptic theory which distinguishes object categories between ""stuff"" with amorphous boundaries and ""things"" with well-defined shapes, such that stuff and instance layouts are constructed through separate branches and later fused into panoptic layouts. In particular, the stuff layouts can take amorphous shapes and fill up the missing regions left out by the instance layouts. We experimentally compare our PLGAN with state-of-the-art layout-based models on the COCO-Stuff, Visual Genome, and Landscape datasets. The advantages of PLGAN are not only visually demonstrated but quantitatively verified in terms of inception score, Fréchet inception distance, classification accuracy score, and coverage."
Autoregressive Image Generation using Residual Quantization,"For autoregressive (AR) modeling of high-resolution images, vector quantization (VQ) represents an image as a sequence of discrete codes. A short sequence length is important for an AR model to reduce its computational costs to consider long-range interactions of codes. However, we postulate that previous VQ cannot shorten the code sequence and generate high-fidelity images together in terms of the rate-distortion trade-off. In this study, we propose the two-stage framework, which consists of Residual-Quantized VAE (RQ-VAE) and RQ-Transformer, to effectively generate high-resolution images. Given a fixed codebook size, RQ-VAE can precisely approximate a feature map of an image and represent the image as a stacked map of discrete codes. Then, RQ-Transformer learns to predict the quantized feature vector at the next position by predicting the next stack of codes. Thanks to the precise approximation of RQ-VAE, we can represent a 256\times256 image as 8\times8 resolution of the feature map, and RQ-Transformer can efficiently reduce the computational costs. Consequently, our framework outperforms the existing AR models on various benchmarks of unconditional and conditional image generation. Our approach also has a significantly faster sampling speed than previous AR models to generate high-quality images."
Detecting High-Quality GAN-Generated Face Images using Neural Networks,"In the past decades, the excessive use of the last-generation GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks) models in computer vision has enabled the creation of artificial face images that are visually indistinguishable from genuine ones. These images are particularly used in adversarial settings to create fake social media accounts and other fake online profiles. Such malicious activities can negatively impact the trustworthiness of users identities. On the other hand, the recent development of GAN models may create high-quality face images without evidence of spatial artifacts. Therefore, reassembling uniform color channel correlations is a challenging research problem. To face these challenges, we need to develop efficient tools able to differentiate between fake and authentic face images. In this chapter, we propose a new strategy to differentiate GAN-generated images from authentic images by leveraging spectral band discrepancies, focusing on artificial face image synthesis. In particular, we enable the digital preservation of face images using the Cross-band co-occurrence matrix and spatial co-occurrence matrix. Then, we implement these techniques and feed them to a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) architecture to identify the real from artificial faces. Additionally, we show that the performance boost is particularly significant and achieves more than 92% in different post-processing environments. Finally, we provide several research observations demonstrating that this strategy improves a comparable detection method based only on intra-band spatial co-occurrences."
A Deep Neural Framework for Image Caption Generation Using GRU-Based Attention Mechanism,"Image captioning is a fast-growing research field of computer vision and natural language processing that involves creating text explanations for images. This study aims to develop a system that uses a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features from an image, integrates the features with an attention mechanism, and creates captions using a recurrent neural network (RNN). To encode an image into a feature vector as graphical attributes, we employed multiple pre-trained convolutional neural networks. Following that, a language model known as GRU is chosen as the decoder to construct the descriptive sentence. In order to increase performance, we merge the Bahdanau attention model with GRU to allow learning to be focused on a specific portion of the image. On the MSCOCO dataset, the experimental results achieve competitive performance against state-of-the-art approaches."
PetsGAN: Rethinking Priors for Single Image Generation,"Single image generation (SIG), described as generating diverse samples that have similar visual content with the given single image, is first introduced by SinGAN which builds a pyramid of GANs to progressively learn the internal patch distribution of the single image. It also shows great potentials in a wide range of image manipulation tasks. However, the paradigm of SinGAN has limitations in terms of generation quality and training time. Firstly, due to the lack of high-level information, SinGAN cannot handle the object images well as it does on the scene and texture images. Secondly, the separate progressive training scheme is time-consuming and easy to cause artifact accumulation. To tackle these problems, in this paper, we dig into the SIG problem and improve SinGAN by fully-utilization of internal and external priors. The main contributions of this paper include: 1) We introduce to SIG a regularized latent variable model. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to give a clear formulation and optimization goal of SIG, and all the existing methods for SIG can be regarded as special cases of this model. 2) We design a novel Prior-based end-to-end training GAN (PetsGAN) to overcome the problems of SinGAN. Our method gets rid of the time-consuming progressive training scheme and can be trained end-to-end. 3) We construct abundant qualitative and quantitative experiments to show the superiority of our method on both generated image quality, diversity, and the training speed. Moreover, we apply our method to other image manipulation tasks (e.g., style transfer, harmonization), and the results further prove the effectiveness and efficiency of our method."
CLIP-GEN: Language-Free Training of a Text-to-Image Generator with CLIP,"Training a text-to-image generator in the general domain (e.g., Dall.e, CogView) requires huge amounts of paired text-image data, which is too expensive to collect. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised scheme named as CLIP-GEN for general text-to-image generation with the language-image priors extracted with a pre-trained CLIP model. In our approach, we only require a set of unlabeled images in the general domain to train a text-to-image generator. Specifically, given an image without text labels, we first extract the embedding of the image in the united language-vision embedding space with the image encoder of CLIP. Next, we convert the image into a sequence of discrete tokens in the VQGAN codebook space (the VQGAN model can be trained with the unlabeled image dataset in hand). Finally, we train an autoregressive transformer that maps the image tokens from its unified language-vision representation. Once trained, the transformer can generate coherent image tokens based on the text embedding extracted from the text encoder of CLIP upon an input text. Such a strategy enables us to train a strong and general text-to-image generator with large text-free image dataset such as ImageNet. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations verify that our method significantly outperforms optimization-based text-to-image methods in terms of image quality while not compromising the text-image matching. Our method can even achieve comparable performance as flagship supervised models like CogView."
MRI-GAN: A Generalized Approach to Detect DeepFakes using Perceptual Image Assessment,"DeepFakes are synthetic videos generated by swapping a face of an original image with the face of somebody else. In this paper, we describe our work to develop general, deep learning-based models to classify DeepFake content. We propose a novel framework for using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based models, we call MRI-GAN, that utilizes perceptual differences in images to detect synthesized videos. We test our MRI-GAN approach and a plain-frames-based model using the DeepFake Detection Challenge Dataset. Our plain frames-based-model achieves 91% test accuracy and a model which uses our MRI-GAN framework with Structural Similarity Index Measurement (SSIM) for the perceptual differences achieves 74% test accuracy. The results of MRI-GAN are preliminary and may be improved further by modifying the choice of loss function, tuning hyper-parameters, or by using a more advanced perceptual similarity metric."
Local and Global GANs with Semantic-Aware Upsampling for Image Generation,"In this paper, we address the task of semantic-guided image generation. One challenge common to most existing image-level generation methods is the difficulty in generating small objects and detailed local textures. To address this, in this work we consider generating images using local context. As such, we design a local class-specific generative network using semantic maps as guidance, which separately constructs and learns subgenerators for different classes, enabling it to capture finer details. To learn more discriminative class-specific feature representations for the local generation, we also propose a novel classification module. To combine the advantages of both global image-level and local class-specific generation, a joint generation network is designed with an attention fusion module and a dual-discriminator structure embedded. Lastly, we propose a novel semantic-aware upsampling method, which has a larger receptive field and can take far-away pixels that are semantically related for feature upsampling, enabling it to better preserve semantic consistency for instances with the same semantic labels. Extensive experiments on two image generation tasks show the superior performance of the proposed method. State-of-the-art results are established by large margins on both tasks and on nine challenging public benchmarks. The source code and trained models are available at https://github.com/Ha0Tang/LGGAN."
Synthesizing Photorealistic Images with Deep Generative Learning,"The goal of this thesis is to present my research contributions towards solving various visual synthesis and generation tasks, comprising image translation, image completion, and completed scene decomposition. This thesis consists of five pieces of work, each of which presents a new learning-based approach for synthesizing images with plausible content as well as visually realistic appearance. Each work demonstrates the superiority of the proposed approach on image synthesis, with some further contributing to other tasks, such as depth estimation."
Synthetic CT Skull Generation for Transcranial MR Imaging-Guided Focused Ultrasound Interventions with Conditional Adversarial Networks,"Transcranial MRI-guided focused ultrasound (TcMRgFUS) is a therapeutic ultrasound method that focuses sound through the skull to a small region noninvasively under MRI guidance. It is clinically approved to thermally ablate regions of the thalamus and is being explored for other therapies, such as blood brain barrier opening and neuromodulation. To accurately target ultrasound through the skull, the transmitted waves must constructively interfere at the target region. However, heterogeneity of the sound speed, density, and ultrasound attenuation in different individuals' skulls requires patient-specific estimates of these parameters for optimal treatment planning. CT imaging is currently the gold standard for estimating acoustic properties of an individual skull during clinical procedures, but CT imaging exposes patients to radiation and increases the overall number of imaging procedures required for therapy. A method to estimate acoustic parameters in the skull without the need for CT would be desirable. Here, we synthesized CT images from routinely acquired T1-weighted MRI by using a 3D patch-based conditional generative adversarial network and evaluated the performance of synthesized CT images for treatment planning with transcranial focused ultrasound. We compared the performance of synthetic CT to real CT images using Kranion and k-Wave acoustic simulation. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of replacing real CT with the MR-synthesized CT for TcMRgFUS planning."
Deep Single Image Deraining using An Asymetric Cycle Generative and Adversarial Framework,"In reality, rain and fog are often present at the same time, which can greatly reduce the clarity and quality of the scene image. However, most unsupervised single image deraining methods mainly focus on rain streak removal by disregarding the fog, which leads to low-quality deraining performance. In addition, the samples are rather homogeneous generated by these methods and lack diversity, resulting in poor results in the face of complex rain scenes. To address the above issues, we propose a novel Asymetric Cycle Generative and Adversarial framework (ACGF) for single image deraining that trains on both synthetic and real rainy images while simultaneously capturing both rain streaks and fog features. ACGF consists of a Rain-fog2Clean (R2C) transformation block and a Clean2Rain-fog (C2R) transformation block. The former consists of parallel rain removal path and rain-fog feature extraction path by the rain and derain-fog network and the attention rain-fog feature extraction network (ARFE) , while the latter only contains a synthetic rain transformation path. In rain-fog feature extraction path, to better characterize the rain-fog fusion feature, we employ an ARFE to exploit the self-similarity of global and local rain-fog information by learning the spatial feature correlations. Moreover, to improve the translational capacity of C2R and the diversity of models, we design a rain-fog feature decoupling and reorganization network (RFDR) by embedding a rainy image degradation model and a mixed discriminator to preserve richer texture details in synthetic rain conversion path. Extensive experiments on benchmark rain-fog and rain datasets show that ACGF outperforms state-of-the-art deraining methods. We also conduct defogging performance evaluation experiments to further demonstrate the effectiveness of ACGF."
Diversity aware image generation,"The machine learning generative algorithms such as GAN and VAE show impressive results in practice when constructing images similar to those in a training set. However, the generation of new images builds mainly on the understanding of the hidden structure of the training database followed by a mere sampling from a multi-dimensional normal variable. In particular each sample is independent from the other ones and can repeatedly propose same type of images. To cure this drawback we propose a kernel-based measure representation method that can produce new objects from a given target measure by approximating the measure as a whole and even staying away from objects already drawn from that distribution. This ensures a better variety of the produced images. The method is tested on some classic machine learning benchmarks.\end{abstract}"
Towards better understanding and better generalization of few-shot classification in histology images with contrastive learning,"Few-shot learning is an established topic in natural images for years, but few work is attended to histology images, which is of high clinical value since well-labeled datasets and rare abnormal samples are expensive to collect. Here, we facilitate the study of few-shot learning in histology images by setting up three cross-domain tasks that simulate real clinics problems. To enable label-efficient learning and better generalizability, we propose to incorporate contrastive learning (CL) with latent augmentation (LA) to build a few-shot system. CL learns useful representations without manual labels, while LA transfers semantic variations of the base dataset in an unsupervised way. These two components fully exploit unlabeled training data and can scale gracefully to other label-hungry problems. In experiments, we find i) models learned by CL generalize better than supervised learning for histology images in unseen classes, and ii) LA brings consistent gains over baselines. Prior studies of self-supervised learning mainly focus on ImageNet-like images, which only present a dominant object in their centers. Recent attention has been paid to images with multi-objects and multi-textures. Histology images are a natural choice for such a study. We show the superiority of CL over supervised learning in terms of generalization for such data and provide our empirical understanding for this observation. The findings in this work could contribute to understanding how the model generalizes in the context of both representation learning and histological image analysis. Code is available."
Prior image-based medical image reconstruction using a style-based generative adversarial network,"Computed medical imaging systems require a computational reconstruction procedure for image formation. In order to recover a useful estimate of the object to-be-imaged when the recorded measurements are incomplete, prior knowledge about the nature of object must be utilized. In order to improve the conditioning of an ill-posed imaging inverse problem, deep learning approaches are being actively investigated for better representing object priors and constraints. This work proposes to use a style-based generative adversarial network (StyleGAN) to constrain an image reconstruction problem in the case where additional information in the form of a prior image of the sought-after object is available. An optimization problem is formulated in the intermediate latent-space of a StyleGAN, that is disentangled with respect to meaningful image attributes or ""styles"", such as the contrast used in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Discrepancy between the sought-after and prior images is measured in the disentangled latent-space, and is used to regularize the inverse problem in the form of constraints on specific styles of the disentangled latent-space. A stylized numerical study inspired by MR imaging is designed, where the sought-after and the prior image are structurally similar, but belong to different contrast mechanisms. The presented numerical studies demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach as compared to classical approaches in the form of traditional metrics."
Do Lessons from Metric Learning Generalize to Image-Caption Retrieval?,"The triplet loss with semi-hard negatives has become the de facto choice for image-caption retrieval (ICR) methods that are optimized from scratch. Recent progress in metric learning has given rise to new loss functions that outperform the triplet loss on tasks such as image retrieval and representation learning. We ask whether these findings generalize to the setting of ICR by comparing three loss functions on two ICR methods. We answer this question negatively: the triplet loss with semi-hard negative mining still outperforms newly introduced loss functions from metric learning on the ICR task. To gain a better understanding of these outcomes, we introduce an analysis method to compare loss functions by counting how many samples contribute to the gradient w.r.t. the query representation during optimization. We find that loss functions that result in lower evaluation scores on the ICR task, in general, take too many (non-informative) samples into account when computing a gradient w.r.t. the query representation, which results in sub-optimal performance. The triplet loss with semi-hard negatives is shown to outperform the other loss functions, as it only takes one (hard) negative into account when computing the gradient."
ViNTER: Image Narrative Generation with Emotion-Arc-Aware Transformer,"Image narrative generation is a task to create a story from an image with a subjective viewpoint. Given the importance of the subjective feelings of writers, readers, and characters in storytelling, an image narrative generation method should consider human emotion. In this study, we propose a novel method of image narrative generation called ViNTER (Visual Narrative Transformer with Emotion arc Representation), which takes ""emotion arc"" as input to capture a sequence of emotional changes. Since emotion arcs represent the trajectory of emotional change, it is expected that we can include detailed information about the emotional changes in the story to the model. We present experimental results of both automatic and manual evaluations on the Image Narrative dataset and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."
Text and Image Guided 3D Avatar Generation and Manipulation,"The manipulation of latent space has recently become an interesting topic in the field of generative models. Recent research shows that latent directions can be used to manipulate images towards certain attributes. However, controlling the generation process of 3D generative models remains a challenge. In this work, we propose a novel 3D manipulation method that can manipulate both the shape and texture of the model using text or image-based prompts such as 'a young face' or 'a surprised face'. We leverage the power of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model and a pre-trained 3D GAN model designed to generate face avatars, and create a fully differentiable rendering pipeline to manipulate meshes. More specifically, our method takes an input latent code and modifies it such that the target attribute specified by a text or image prompt is present or enhanced, while leaving other attributes largely unaffected. Our method requires only 5 minutes per manipulation, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with extensive results and comparisons."
Improving Image-recognition Edge Caches with a Generative Adversarial Network,"Image recognition is an essential task in several mobile applications. For instance, a smartphone can process a landmark photo to gather more information about its location. If the device does not have enough computational resources available, it offloads the processing task to a cloud infrastructure. Although this approach solves resource shortages, it introduces a communication delay. Image-recognition caches on the Internet's edge can mitigate this problem. These caches run on servers close to mobile devices and stores information about previously recognized images. If the server receives a request with a photo stored in its cache, it replies to the device, avoiding cloud offloading. The main challenge for this cache is to verify if the received image matches a stored one. Furthermore, for outdoor photos, it is difficult to compare them if one was taken in the daytime and the other at nighttime. In that case, the cache might wrongly infer that they refer to different places, offloading the processing to the cloud. This work shows that a well-known generative adversarial network, called ToDayGAN, can solve this problem by generating daytime images using nighttime ones. We can thus use this translation to populate a cache with synthetic photos that can help image matching. We show that our solution reduces cloud offloading and, therefore, the application's latency."
Describing image focused in cognitive and visual details for visually impaired people: An approach to generating inclusive paragraphs,"Several services for people with visual disabilities have emerged recently due to achievements in Assistive Technologies and Artificial Intelligence areas. Despite the growth in assistive systems availability, there is a lack of services that support specific tasks, such as understanding the image context presented in online content, e.g., webinars. Image captioning techniques and their variants are limited as Assistive Technologies as they do not match the needs of visually impaired people when generating specific descriptions. We propose an approach for generating context of webinar images combining a dense captioning technique with a set of filters, to fit the captions in our domain, and a language model for the abstractive summary task. The results demonstrated that we can produce descriptions with higher interpretability and focused on the relevant information for that group of people by combining image analysis methods and neural language models."
Mining the manifolds of deep generative models for multiple data-consistent solutions of ill-posed tomographic imaging problems,"Tomographic imaging is in general an ill-posed inverse problem. Typically, a single regularized image estimate of the sought-after object is obtained from tomographic measurements. However, there may be multiple objects that are all consistent with the same measurement data. The ability to generate such alternate solutions is important because it may enable new assessments of imaging systems. In principle, this can be achieved by means of posterior sampling methods. In recent years, deep neural networks have been employed for posterior sampling with promising results. However, such methods are not yet for use with large-scale tomographic imaging applications. On the other hand, empirical sampling methods may be computationally feasible for large-scale imaging systems and enable uncertainty quantification for practical applications. Empirical sampling involves solving a regularized inverse problem within a stochastic optimization framework to obtain alternate data-consistent solutions. In this work, a new empirical sampling method is proposed that computes multiple solutions of a tomographic inverse problem that are consistent with the same acquired measurement data. The method operates by repeatedly solving an optimization problem in the latent space of a style-based generative adversarial network (StyleGAN), and was inspired by the Photo Upsampling via Latent Space Exploration (PULSE) method that was developed for super-resolution tasks. The proposed method is demonstrated and analyzed via numerical studies that involve two stylized tomographic imaging modalities. These studies establish the ability of the method to perform efficient empirical sampling and uncertainty quantification."
MaskGIT: Masked Generative Image Transformer,"Generative transformers have experienced rapid popularity growth in the computer vision community in synthesizing high-fidelity and high-resolution images. The best generative transformer models so far, however, still treat an image naively as a sequence of tokens, and decode an image sequentially following the raster scan ordering (i.e. line-by-line). We find this strategy neither optimal nor efficient. This paper proposes a novel image synthesis paradigm using a bidirectional transformer decoder, which we term MaskGIT. During training, MaskGIT learns to predict randomly masked tokens by attending to tokens in all directions. At inference time, the model begins with generating all tokens of an image simultaneously, and then refines the image iteratively conditioned on the previous generation. Our experiments demonstrate that MaskGIT significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art transformer model on the ImageNet dataset, and accelerates autoregressive decoding by up to 64x. Besides, we illustrate that MaskGIT can be easily extended to various image editing tasks, such as inpainting, extrapolation, and image manipulation."
Federated Learning of Generative Image Priors for MRI Reconstruction,"Multi-institutional efforts can facilitate training of deep MRI reconstruction models, albeit privacy risks arise during cross-site sharing of imaging data. Federated learning (FL) has recently been introduced to address privacy concerns by enabling distributed training without transfer of imaging data. Existing FL methods for MRI reconstruction employ conditional models to map from undersampled to fully-sampled acquisitions via explicit knowledge of the imaging operator. Since conditional models generalize poorly across different acceleration rates or sampling densities, imaging operators must be fixed between training and testing, and they are typically matched across sites. To improve generalization and flexibility in multi-institutional collaborations, here we introduce a novel method for MRI reconstruction based on Federated learning of Generative IMage Priors (FedGIMP). FedGIMP leverages a two-stage approach: cross-site learning of a generative MRI prior, and subject-specific injection of the imaging operator. The global MRI prior is learned via an unconditional adversarial model that synthesizes high-quality MR images based on latent variables. Specificity in the prior is preserved via a mapper subnetwork that produces site-specific latents. During inference, the prior is combined with subject-specific imaging operators to enable reconstruction, and further adapted to individual test samples by minimizing data-consistency loss. Comprehensive experiments on multi-institutional datasets clearly demonstrate enhanced generalization performance of FedGIMP against site-specific and federated methods based on conditional models, as well as traditional reconstruction methods."
DALL-Eval: Probing the Reasoning Skills and Social Biases of Text-to-Image Generative Models,"Recently, DALL-E, a multimodal transformer language model, and its variants (including diffusion models) have shown high-quality text-to-image generation capabilities. However, despite the interesting image generation results, there has not been a detailed analysis on how to evaluate such models. In this work, we investigate the visual reasoning capabilities and social biases of different text-to-image models, covering both multimodal transformer language models and diffusion models. First, we measure three visual reasoning skills: object recognition, object counting, and spatial relation understanding. For this, we propose PaintSkills, a compositional diagnostic dataset and evaluation toolkit that measures these skills. In our experiments, there exists a large gap between the performance of recent text-to-image models and the upper bound accuracy in object counting and spatial relation understanding skills. Second, we assess gender and skin tone biases by measuring the variance of the gender/skin tone distribution based on automated and human evaluation. We demonstrate that recent text-to-image models learn specific gender/skin tone biases from web image-text pairs. We hope that our work will help guide future progress in improving text-to-image generation models on visual reasoning skills and learning socially unbiased representations.

Self-Conditioned Generative Adversarial Networks for Image Editing,"Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are susceptible to bias, learned from either the unbalanced data, or through mode collapse. The networks focus on the core of the data distribution, leaving the tails - or the edges of the distribution - behind. We argue that this bias is responsible not only for fairness concerns, but that it plays a key role in the collapse of latent-traversal editing methods when deviating away from the distribution's core. Building on this observation, we outline a method for mitigating generative bias through a self-conditioning process, where distances in the latent-space of a pre-trained generator are used to provide initial labels for the data. By fine-tuning the generator on a re-sampled distribution drawn from these self-labeled data, we force the generator to better contend with rare semantic attributes and enable more realistic generation of these properties. We compare our models to a wide range of latent editing methods, and show that by alleviating the bias they achieve finer semantic control and better identity preservation through a wider range of transformations. Our code and models will be available at https://github.com/yzliu567/sc-gan"
GANSlider: How Users Control Generative Models for Images using Multiple Sliders with and without Feedforward Information,"We investigate how multiple sliders with and without feedforward visualizations influence users' control of generative models. In an online study (N=138), we collected a dataset of people interacting with a generative adversarial network (StyleGAN2) in an image reconstruction task. We found that more control dimensions (sliders) significantly increase task difficulty and user actions. Visual feedforward partly mitigates this by enabling more goal-directed interaction. However, we found no evidence of faster or more accurate task performance. This indicates a tradeoff between feedforward detail and implied cognitive costs, such as attention. Moreover, we found that visualizations alone are not always sufficient for users to understand individual control dimensions. Our study quantifies fundamental UI design factors and resulting interaction behavior in this context, revealing opportunities for improvement in the UI design for interactive applications of generative models. We close by discussing design directions and further aspects."
Pose Guided Image Generation from Misaligned Sources via Residual Flow Based Correction,"Generating new images with desired properties (e.g. new view/poses) from source images has been enthusiastically pursued recently, due to its wide range of potential applications. One way to ensure high-quality generation is to use multiple sources with complementary information such as different views of the same object. However, as source images are often misaligned due to the large disparities among the camera settings, strong assumptions have been made in the past with respect to the camera(s) or/and the object in interest, limiting the application of such techniques. Therefore, we propose a new general approach which models multiple types of variations among sources, such as view angles, poses, facial expressions, in a unified framework, so that it can be employed on datasets of vastly different nature. We verify our approach on a variety of data including humans bodies, faces, city scenes and 3D objects. Both the qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the better performance of our method than the state of the art."
Approximation of Images via Generalized Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition over Finite-dimensional Commutative Semisimple Algebra,"Low-rank approximation of images via singular value decomposition is well-received in the era of big data. However, singular value decomposition (SVD) is only for order-two data, i.e., matrices. It is necessary to flatten a higher order input into a matrix or break it into a series of order-two slices to tackle higher order data such as multispectral images and videos with the SVD. Higher order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) extends the SVD and can approximate higher order data using sums of a few rank-one components. We consider the problem of generalizing HOSVD over a finite dimensional commutative algebra. This algebra, referred to as a t-algebra, generalizes the field of complex numbers. The elements of the algebra, called t-scalars, are fix-sized arrays of complex numbers. One can generalize matrices and tensors over t-scalars and then extend many canonical matrix and tensor algorithms, including HOSVD, to obtain higher-performance versions. The generalization of HOSVD is called THOSVD. Its performance of approximating multi-way data can be further improved by an alternating algorithm. THOSVD also unifies a wide range of principal component analysis algorithms. To exploit the potential of generalized algorithms using t-scalars for approximating images, we use a pixel neighborhood strategy to convert each pixel to ""deeper-order"" t-scalar. Experiments on publicly available images show that the generalized algorithm over t-scalars, namely THOSVD, compares favorably with its canonical counterparts."
Generalized Global Ranking-Aware Neural Architecture Ranker for Efficient Image Classifier Search,"Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is a powerful tool for automating effective image processing DNN designing. The ranking has been advocated to design an efficient performance predictor for NAS. The previous contrastive method solves the ranking problem by comparing pairs of architectures and predicting their relative performance. However, it only focuses on the rankings between two involved architectures and neglects the overall quality distributions of the search space, which may suffer generalization issues. A predictor, namely Neural Architecture Ranker (NAR) which concentrates on the global quality tier of specific architecture, is proposed to tackle such problems caused by the local perspective. The NAR explores the quality tiers of the search space globally and classifies each individual to the tier they belong to according to its global ranking. Thus, the predictor gains the knowledge of the performance distributions of the search space which helps to generalize its ranking ability to the datasets more easily. Meanwhile, the global quality distribution facilitates the search phase by directly sampling candidates according to the statistics of quality tiers, which is free of training a search algorithm, e.g., Reinforcement Learning (RL) or Evolutionary Algorithm (EA), thus it simplifies the NAS pipeline and saves the computational overheads. The proposed NAR achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art methods on two widely used datasets for NAS research. On the vast search space of NAS-Bench-101, the NAR easily finds the architecture with top 0.01\unicode{x2030} performance only by sampling. It also generalizes well to different image datasets of NAS-Bench-201, i.e., CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-16-120 by identifying the optimal architectures for each of them."
BLIP: Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training for Unified Vision-Language Understanding and Generation,"Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) has advanced the performance for many vision-language tasks. However, most existing pre-trained models only excel in either understanding-based tasks or generation-based tasks. Furthermore, performance improvement has been largely achieved by scaling up the dataset with noisy image-text pairs collected from the web, which is a suboptimal source of supervision. In this paper, we propose BLIP, a new VLP framework which transfers flexibly to both vision-language understanding and generation tasks. BLIP effectively utilizes the noisy web data by bootstrapping the captions, where a captioner generates synthetic captions and a filter removes the noisy ones. We achieve state-of-the-art results on a wide range of vision-language tasks, such as image-text retrieval (+2.7% in average recall@1), image captioning (+2.8% in CIDEr), and VQA (+1.6% in VQA score). BLIP also demonstrates strong generalization ability when directly transferred to video-language tasks in a zero-shot manner. Code, models, and datasets are released at https://github.com/salesforce/BLIP."
Generalized Visual Quality Assessment of GAN-Generated Face Images,"Recent years have witnessed the dramatically increased interest in face generation with generative adversarial networks (GANs). A number of successful GAN algorithms have been developed to produce vivid face images towards different application scenarios. However, little work has been dedicated to automatic quality assessment of such GAN-generated face images (GFIs), even less have been devoted to generalized and robust quality assessment of GFIs generated with unseen GAN model. Herein, we make the first attempt to study the subjective and objective quality towards generalized quality assessment of GFIs. More specifically, we establish a large-scale database consisting of GFIs from four GAN algorithms, the pseudo labels from image quality assessment (IQA) measures, as well as the human opinion scores via subjective testing. Subsequently, we develop a quality assessment model that is able to deliver accurate quality predictions for GFIs from both available and unseen GAN algorithms based on meta-learning. In particular, to learn shared knowledge from GFIs pairs that are born of limited GAN algorithms, we develop the convolutional block attention (CBA) and facial attributes-based analysis (ABA) modules, ensuring that the learned knowledge tends to be consistent with human visual perception. Extensive experiments exhibit that the proposed model achieves better performance compared with the state-of-the-art IQA models, and is capable of retaining the effectiveness when evaluating GFIs from the unseen GAN algorithms."
Learning Multiple Probabilistic Degradation Generators for Unsupervised Real World Image Super Resolution,"Unsupervised real world super resolution (USR) aims to restore high-resolution (HR) images given low-resolution (LR) inputs, and its difficulty stems from the absence of paired dataset. One of the most common approaches is synthesizing noisy LR images using GANs (i.e., degradation generators) and utilizing a synthetic dataset to train the model in a supervised manner. Although the goal of training the degradation generator is to approximate the distribution of LR images given a HR image, previous works have heavily relied on the unrealistic assumption that the conditional distribution is a delta function and learned the deterministic mapping from the HR image to a LR image. In this paper, we show that we can improve the performance of USR models by relaxing the assumption and propose to train the probabilistic degradation generator. Our probabilistic degradation generator can be viewed as a deep hierarchical latent variable model and is more suitable for modeling the complex conditional distribution. We also reveal the notable connection with the noise injection of StyleGAN. Furthermore, we train multiple degradation generators to improve the mode coverage and apply collaborative learning for ease of training. We outperform several baselines on benchmark datasets in terms of PSNR and SSIM and demonstrate the robustness of our method on unseen data distribution. Code is available at https://github.com/sangyun884/MSSR."
Image Generation with Self Pixel-wise Normalization,"Region-adaptive normalization (RAN) methods have been widely used in the generative adversarial network (GAN)-based image-to-image translation technique. However, since these approaches need a mask image to infer the pixel-wise affine transformation parameters, they cannot be applied to the general image generation models having no paired mask images. To resolve this problem, this paper presents a novel normalization method, called self pixel-wise normalization (SPN), which effectively boosts the generative performance by performing the pixel-adaptive affine transformation without the mask image. In our method, the transforming parameters are derived from a self-latent mask that divides the feature map into the foreground and background regions. The visualization of the self-latent masks shows that SPN effectively captures a single object to be generated as the foreground. Since the proposed method produces the self-latent mask without external data, it is easily applicable in the existing generative models. Extensive experiments on various datasets reveal that the proposed method significantly improves the performance of image generation technique in terms of Frechet inception distance (FID) and Inception score (IS)."
Universal Generative Modeling for Calibration-free Parallel Mr Imaging,"The integration of compressed sensing and parallel imaging (CS-PI) provides a robust mechanism for accelerating MRI acquisitions. However, most such strategies require the explicit formation of either coil sensitivity profiles or a cross-coil correlation operator, and as a result reconstruction corresponds to solving a challenging bilinear optimization problem. In this work, we present an unsupervised deep learning framework for calibration-free parallel MRI, coined universal generative modeling for parallel imaging (UGM-PI). More precisely, we make use of the merits of both wavelet transform and the adaptive iteration strategy in a unified framework. We train a powerful noise conditional score network by forming wavelet tensor as the network input at the training phase. Experimental results on both physical phantom and in vivo datasets implied that the proposed method is comparable and even superior to state-of-the-art CS-PI reconstruction approaches."
TGFuse: An Infrared and Visible Image Fusion Approach Based on Transformer and Generative Adversarial Network,"The end-to-end image fusion framework has achieved promising performance, with dedicated convolutional networks aggregating the multi-modal local appearance. However, long-range dependencies are directly neglected in existing CNN fusion approaches, impeding balancing the entire image-level perception for complex scenario fusion. In this paper, therefore, we propose an infrared and visible image fusion algorithm based on a lightweight transformer module and adversarial learning. Inspired by the global interaction power, we use the transformer technique to learn the effective global fusion relations. In particular, shallow features extracted by CNN are interacted in the proposed transformer fusion module to refine the fusion relationship within the spatial scope and across channels simultaneously. Besides, adversarial learning is designed in the training process to improve the output discrimination via imposing competitive consistency from the inputs, reflecting the specific characteristics in infrared and visible images. The experimental performance demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed modules, with superior improvement against the state-of-the-art, generalising a novel paradigm via transformer and adversarial learning in the fusion task."
Adaptive DropBlock Enhanced Generative Adversarial Networks for Hyperspectral Image Classification,"In recent years, hyperspectral image (HSI) classification based on generative adversarial networks (GAN) has achieved great progress. GAN-based classification methods can mitigate the limited training sample dilemma to some extent. However, several studies have pointed out that existing GAN-based HSI classification methods are heavily affected by the imbalanced training data problem. The discriminator in GAN always contradicts itself and tries to associate fake labels to the minority-class samples, and thus impair the classification performance. Another critical issue is the mode collapse in GAN-based methods. The generator is only capable of producing samples within a narrow scope of the data space, which severely hinders the advancement of GAN-based HSI classification methods. In this paper, we proposed an Adaptive DropBlock-enhanced Generative Adversarial Networks (ADGAN) for HSI classification. First, to solve the imbalanced training data problem, we adjust the discriminator to be a single classifier, and it will not contradict itself. Second, an adaptive DropBlock (AdapDrop) is proposed as a regularization method employed in the generator and discriminator to alleviate the mode collapse issue. The AdapDrop generated drop masks with adaptive shapes instead of a fixed size region, and it alleviates the limitations of DropBlock in dealing with ground objects with various shapes. Experimental results on three HSI datasets demonstrated that the proposed ADGAN achieved superior performance over state-of-the-art GAN-based methods. Our codes are available at https://github.com/summitgao/HC_ADGAN"
Enhancing Pseudo Label Quality for Semi-Supervised Domain-Generalized Medical Image Segmentation,"Generalizing the medical image segmentation algorithms to unseen domains is an important research topic for computer-aided diagnosis and surgery. Most existing methods require a fully labeled dataset in each source domain. Although some researchers developed a semi-supervised domain generalized method, it still requires the domain labels. This paper presents a novel confidence-aware cross pseudo supervision algorithm for semi-supervised domain generalized medical image segmentation. The main goal is to enhance the pseudo label quality for unlabeled images from unknown distributions. To achieve it, we perform the Fourier transformation to learn low-level statistic information across domains and augment the images to incorporate cross-domain information. With these augmentations as perturbations, we feed the input to a confidence-aware cross pseudo supervision network to measure the variance of pseudo labels and regularize the network to learn with more confident pseudo labels. Our method sets new records on public datasets, i.e., M&Ms and SCGM. Notably, without using domain labels, our method surpasses the prior art that even uses domain labels by 11.67% on Dice on M&Ms dataset with 2% labeled data. Code is available at https://github.com/XMed-Lab/EPL_SemiDG."
A Survey on Training Challenges in Generative Adversarial Networks for Biomedical Image Analysis,"In biomedical image analysis, the applicability of deep learning methods is directly impacted by the quantity of image data available. This is due to deep learning models requiring large image datasets to provide high-level performance. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been widely utilized to address data limitations through the generation of synthetic biomedical images. GANs consist of two models. The generator, a model that learns how to produce synthetic images based on the feedback it receives. The discriminator, a model that classifies an image as synthetic or real and provides feedback to the generator. Throughout the training process, a GAN can experience several technical challenges that impede the generation of suitable synthetic imagery. First, the mode collapse problem whereby the generator either produces an identical image or produces a uniform image from distinct input features. Second, the non-convergence problem whereby the gradient descent optimizer fails to reach a Nash equilibrium. Thirdly, the vanishing gradient problem whereby unstable training behavior occurs due to the discriminator achieving optimal classification performance resulting in no meaningful feedback being provided to the generator. These problems result in the production of synthetic imagery that is blurry, unrealistic, and less diverse. To date, there has been no survey article outlining the impact of these technical challenges in the context of the biomedical imagery domain. This work presents a review and taxonomy based on solutions to the training problems of GANs in the biomedical imaging domain. This survey highlights important challenges and outlines future research directions about the training of GANs in the domain of biomedical imagery."
Can We Find Neurons that Cause Unrealistic Images in Deep Generative Networks?,"Even though Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown a remarkable ability to generate high-quality images, GANs do not always guarantee the generation of photorealistic images. Occasionally, they generate images that have defective or unnatural objects, which are referred to as 'artifacts'. Research to investigate why these artifacts emerge and how they can be detected and removed has yet to be sufficiently carried out. To analyze this, we first hypothesize that rarely activated neurons and frequently activated neurons have different purposes and responsibilities for the progress of generating images. In this study, by analyzing the statistics and the roles for those neurons, we empirically show that rarely activated neurons are related to the failure results of making diverse objects and inducing artifacts. In addition, we suggest a correction method, called 'Sequential Ablation', to repair the defective part of the generated images without high computational cost and manual efforts."
Realistic Endoscopic Image Generation Method Using Virtual-to-real Image-domain Translation,"This paper proposes a realistic image generation method for visualization in endoscopic simulation systems. Endoscopic diagnosis and treatment are performed in many hospitals. To reduce complications related to endoscope insertions, endoscopic simulation systems are used for training or rehearsal of endoscope insertions. However, current simulation systems generate non-realistic virtual endoscopic images. To improve the value of the simulation systems, improvement of reality of their generated images is necessary. We propose a realistic image generation method for endoscopic simulation systems. Virtual endoscopic images are generated by using a volume rendering method from a CT volume of a patient. We improve the reality of the virtual endoscopic images using a virtual-to-real image-domain translation technique. The image-domain translator is implemented as a fully convolutional network (FCN). We train the FCN by minimizing a cycle consistency loss function. The FCN is trained using unpaired virtual and real endoscopic images. To obtain high quality image-domain translation results, we perform an image cleansing to the real endoscopic image set. We tested to use the shallow U-Net, U-Net, deep U-Net, and U-Net having residual units as the image-domain translator. The deep U-Net and U-Net having residual units generated quite realistic images."
GMFIM: A Generative Mask-guided Facial Image Manipulation Model for Privacy Preservation,"The use of social media websites and applications has become very popular and people share their photos on these networks. Automatic recognition and tagging of people's photos on these networks has raised privacy preservation issues and users seek methods for hiding their identities from these algorithms. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are shown to be very powerful in generating face images in high diversity and also in editing face images. In this paper, we propose a Generative Mask-guided Face Image Manipulation (GMFIM) model based on GANs to apply imperceptible editing to the input face image to preserve the privacy of the person in the image. Our model consists of three main components: a) the face mask module to cut the face area out of the input image and omit the background, b) the GAN-based optimization module for manipulating the face image and hiding the identity and, c) the merge module for combining the background of the input image and the manipulated de-identified face image. Different criteria are considered in the loss function of the optimization step to produce high-quality images that are as similar as possible to the input image while they cannot be recognized by AFR systems. The results of the experiments on different datasets show that our model can achieve better performance against automated face recognition systems in comparison to the state-of-the-art methods and it catches a higher attack success rate in most experiments from a total of 18. Moreover, the generated images of our proposed model have the highest quality and are more pleasing to human eyes."
COIN: Counterfactual Image Generation for VQA Interpretation,"Due to the significant advancement of Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision-based models, Visual Question Answering (VQA) systems are becoming more intelligent and advanced. However, they are still error-prone when dealing with relatively complex questions. Therefore, it is important to understand the behaviour of the VQA models before adopting their results. In this paper, we introduce an interpretability approach for VQA models by generating counterfactual images. Specifically, the generated image is supposed to have the minimal possible change to the original image and leads the VQA model to give a different answer. In addition, our approach ensures that the generated image is realistic. Since quantitative metrics cannot be employed to evaluate the interpretability of the model, we carried out a user study to assess different aspects of our approach. In addition to interpreting the result of VQA models on single images, the obtained results and the discussion provides an extensive explanation of VQA models' behaviour."
RFormer: Transformer-based Generative Adversarial Network for Real Fundus Image Restoration on A New Clinical Benchmark,"Ophthalmologists have used fundus images to screen and diagnose eye diseases. However, different equipments and ophthalmologists pose large variations to the quality of fundus images. Low-quality (LQ) degraded fundus images easily lead to uncertainty in clinical screening and generally increase the risk of misdiagnosis. Thus, real fundus image restoration is worth studying. Unfortunately, real clinical benchmark has not been explored for this task so far. In this paper, we investigate the real clinical fundus image restoration problem. Firstly, We establish a clinical dataset, Real Fundus (RF), including 120 low- and high-quality (HQ) image pairs. Then we propose a novel Transformer-based Generative Adversarial Network (RFormer) to restore the real degradation of clinical fundus images. The key component in our network is the Window-based Self-Attention Block (WSAB) which captures non-local self-similarity and long-range dependencies. To produce more visually pleasant results, a Transformer-based discriminator is introduced. Extensive experiments on our clinical benchmark show that the proposed RFormer significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. In addition, experiments of downstream tasks such as vessel segmentation and optic disc/cup detection demonstrate that our proposed RFormer benefits clinical fundus image analysis and applications. The dataset, code, and models are publicly available at https://github.com/dengzhuo-AI/Real-Fundus"
Leveraging in-domain supervision for unsupervised image-to-image translation tasks via multi-stream generators,"Supervision for image-to-image translation (I2I) tasks is hard to come by, but bears significant effect on the resulting quality. In this paper, we observe that for many Unsupervised I2I (UI2I) scenarios, one domain is more familiar than the other, and offers in-domain prior knowledge, such as semantic segmentation. We argue that for complex scenes, figuring out the semantic structure of the domain is hard, especially with no supervision, but is an important part of a successful I2I operation. We hence introduce two techniques to incorporate this invaluable in-domain prior knowledge for the benefit of translation quality: through a novel Multi-Stream generator architecture, and through a semantic segmentation-based regularization loss term. In essence, we propose splitting the input data according to semantic masks, explicitly guiding the network to different behavior for the different regions of the image. In addition, we propose training a semantic segmentation network along with the translation task, and to leverage this output as a loss term that improves robustness. We validate our approach on urban data, demonstrating superior quality in the challenging UI2I tasks of converting day images to night ones. In addition, we also demonstrate how reinforcing the target dataset with our augmented images improves the training of downstream tasks such as the classical detection one."
"StyleGAN-V: A Continuous Video Generator with the Price, Image Quality and Perks of StyleGAN2","Videos show continuous events, yet most - if not all - video synthesis frameworks treat them discretely in time. In this work, we think of videos of what they should be - time-continuous signals, and extend the paradigm of neural representations to build a continuous-time video generator. For this, we first design continuous motion representations through the lens of positional embeddings. Then, we explore the question of training on very sparse videos and demonstrate that a good generator can be learned by using as few as 2 frames per clip. After that, we rethink the traditional image + video discriminators pair and design a holistic discriminator that aggregates temporal information by simply concatenating frames' features. This decreases the training cost and provides richer learning signal to the generator, making it possible to train directly on 1024^2 videos for the first time. We build our model on top of StyleGAN2 and it is just {\approx}5\% more expensive to train at the same resolution while achieving almost the same image quality. Moreover, our latent space features similar properties, enabling spatial manipulations that our method can propagate in time. We can generate arbitrarily long videos at arbitrary high frame rate, while prior work struggles to generate even 64 frames at a fixed rate. Our model is tested on four modern 256^2 and one 1024^2-resolution video synthesis benchmarks. In terms of sheer metrics, it performs on average {\approx}30\% better than the closest runner-up.

Astronomical Image Colorization and upscaling with Generative Adversarial Networks,"Automatic colorization of images without human intervention has been a subject of interest in the machine learning community for a brief period of time. Assigning color to an image is a highly ill-posed problem because of its innate nature of possessing very high degrees of freedom; given an image, there is often no single color-combination that is correct. Besides colorization, another problem in reconstruction of images is Single Image Super Resolution, which aims at transforming low resolution images to a higher resolution. This research aims to provide an automated approach for the problem by focusing on a very specific domain of images, namely astronomical images, and process them using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We explore the usage of various models in two different color spaces, RGB and L*a*b. We use transferred learning owing to a small data set, using pre-trained ResNet-18 as a backbone, i.e. encoder for the U-net and fine-tune it further. The model produces visually appealing images which hallucinate high resolution, colorized data in these results which does not exist in the original image. We present our results by evaluating the GANs quantitatively using distance metrics such as L1 distance and L2 distance in each of the color spaces across all channels to provide a comparative analysis. We use Frechet inception distance (FID) to compare the distribution of the generated images with the distribution of the real image to assess the model's performance."
DSRGAN: Detail Prior-Assisted Perceptual Single Image Super-Resolution via Generative Adversarial Networks,"The generative adversarial network (GAN) is successfully applied to study the perceptual single image superresolution (SISR). However, the GAN often tends to generate images with high frequency details being inconsistent with the real ones. Inspired by conventional detail enhancement algorithms, we propose a novel prior knowledge, the detail prior, to assist the GAN in alleviating this problem and restoring more realistic details. The proposed method, named DSRGAN, includes a well designed detail extraction algorithm to capture the most important high frequency information from images. Then, two discriminators are utilized for supervision on image-domain and detail-domain restorations, respectively. The DSRGAN merges the restored detail into the final output via a detail enhancement manner. The special design of DSRGAN takes advantages from both the model-based conventional algorithm and the data-driven deep learning network. Experimental results demonstrate that the DSRGAN outperforms the state-of-the-art SISR methods on perceptual metrics and achieves comparable results in terms of fidelity metrics simultaneously. Following the DSRGAN, it is feasible to incorporate other conventional image processing algorithms into a deep learning network to form a model-based deep SISR."
Self-Attention Generative Adversarial Network for Iterative Reconstruction of CT Images,"Computed tomography (CT) uses X-ray measurements taken from sensors around the body to generate tomographic images of the human body. Conventional reconstruction algorithms can be used if the X-ray data are adequately sampled and of high quality; however, concerns such as reducing dose to the patient, or geometric limitations on data acquisition, may result in low quality or incomplete data. Images reconstructed from these data using conventional methods are of poor quality, due to noise and other artifacts. The aim of this study is to train a single neural network to reconstruct high-quality CT images from noisy or incomplete CT scan data, including low-dose, sparse-view, and limited-angle scenarios. To accomplish this task, we train a generative adversarial network (GAN) as a signal prior, to be used in conjunction with the iterative simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique (SART) for CT data. The network includes a self-attention block to model long-range dependencies in the data. We compare our Self-Attention GAN for CT image reconstruction with several state-of-the-art approaches, including denoising cycle GAN, CIRCLE GAN, and a total variation superiorized algorithm. Our approach is shown to have comparable overall performance to CIRCLE GAN, while outperforming the other two approaches."
Comparison and Analysis of Image-to-Image Generative Adversarial Networks: A Survey,"Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have recently introduced effective methods of performing Image-to-Image translations. These models can be applied and generalized to a variety of domains in Image-to-Image translation without changing any parameters. In this paper, we survey and analyze eight Image-to-Image Generative Adversarial Networks: Pix2Pix, CycleGAN, CoGAN, StarGAN, MUNIT, StarGAN2, DA-GAN, and Self Attention GAN. Each of these models presented state-of-the-art results and introduced new techniques to build Image-to-Image GANs. In addition to a survey of the models, we also survey the 18 datasets they were trained on and the 9 metrics they were evaluated on. Finally, we present results of a controlled experiment for 6 of these models on a common set of metrics and datasets. The results were mixed and showed that, on certain datasets, tasks, and metrics, some models outperformed others. The last section of this paper discusses those results and establishes areas of future research. As researchers continue to innovate new Image-to-Image GANs, it is important to gain a good understanding of the existing methods, datasets, and metrics. This paper provides a comprehensive overview and discussion to help build this foundation."
DA-FDFtNet: Dual Attention Fake Detection Fine-tuning Network to Detect Various AI-Generated Fake Images,"Due to the advancement of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), Autoencoders, and other AI technologies, it has been much easier to create fake images such as ""Deepfakes"". More recent research has introduced few-shot learning, which uses a small amount of training data to produce fake images and videos more effectively. Therefore, the ease of generating manipulated images and the difficulty of distinguishing those images can cause a serious threat to our society, such as propagating fake information. However, detecting realistic fake images generated by the latest AI technology is challenging due to the reasons mentioned above. In this work, we propose Dual Attention Fake Detection Fine-tuning Network (DA-FDFtNet) to detect the manipulated fake face images from the real face data. Our DA-FDFtNet integrates the pre-trained model with Fine-Tune Transformer, MBblockV3, and a channel attention module to improve the performance and robustness across different types of fake images. In particular, Fine-Tune Transformer consists of multiple numbers of an image-based self-attention module and a down-sampling layer. The channel attention module is also connected with the pre-trained model to capture the fake images feature space. We experiment with our DA-FDFtNet with the FaceForensics++ dataset and various GAN-generated datasets, and we show that our approach outperforms the previous baseline models."
StyleSDF: High-Resolution 3D-Consistent Image and Geometry Generation,"We introduce a high resolution, 3D-consistent image and shape generation technique which we call StyleSDF. Our method is trained on single-view RGB data only, and stands on the shoulders of StyleGAN2 for image generation, while solving two main challenges in 3D-aware GANs: 1) high-resolution, view-consistent generation of the RGB images, and 2) detailed 3D shape. We achieve this by merging a SDF-based 3D representation with a style-based 2D generator. Our 3D implicit network renders low-resolution feature maps, from which the style-based network generates view-consistent, 1024x1024 images. Notably, our SDF-based 3D modeling defines detailed 3D surfaces, leading to consistent volume rendering. Our method shows higher quality results compared to state of the art in terms of visual and geometric quality."
Generating Photo-realistic Images from LiDAR Point Clouds with Generative Adversarial Networks,"We examined the feasibility of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate photo-realistic images from LiDAR point clouds. For this purpose, we created a dataset of point cloud image pairs and trained the GAN to predict photorealistic images from LiDAR point clouds containing reflectance and distance information. Our models learned how to predict realistically looking images from just point cloud data, even images with black cars. Black cars are difficult to detect directly from point clouds because of their low level of reflectivity. This approach might be used in the future to perform visual object recognition on photorealistic images generated from LiDAR point clouds. In addition to the conventional LiDAR system, a second system that generates photorealistic images from LiDAR point clouds would run simultaneously for visual object recognition in real-time. In this way, we might preserve the supremacy of LiDAR and benefit from using photo-realistic images for visual object recognition without the usage of any camera. In addition, this approach could be used to colorize point clouds without the usage of any camera images."
Pixel-Stega: Generative Image Steganography Based on Autoregressive Models,"In this letter, we explored generative image steganography based on autoregressive models. We proposed Pixel-Stega, which implements pixel-level information hiding with autoregressive models and arithmetic coding algorithm. Firstly, one of the autoregressive models, PixelCNN++, is utilized to produce explicit conditional probability distribution of each pixel. Secondly, secret messages are encoded to the selection of pixels through steganographic sampling (stegosampling) based on arithmetic coding. We carried out qualitative and quantitative assessment on gray-scale and colour image datasets. Experimental results show that Pixel-Stega is able to embed secret messages adaptively according to the entropy of the pixels to achieve both high embedding capacity (up to 4.3 bpp) and nearly perfect imperceptibility (about 50% detection accuracy)."
StyleSwin: Transformer-based GAN for High-resolution Image Generation,"Despite the tantalizing success in a broad of vision tasks, transformers have not yet demonstrated on-par ability as ConvNets in high-resolution image generative modeling. In this paper, we seek to explore using pure transformers to build a generative adversarial network for high-resolution image synthesis. To this end, we believe that local attention is crucial to strike the balance between computational efficiency and modeling capacity. Hence, the proposed generator adopts Swin transformer in a style-based architecture. To achieve a larger receptive field, we propose double attention which simultaneously leverages the context of the local and the shifted windows, leading to improved generation quality. Moreover, we show that offering the knowledge of the absolute position that has been lost in window-based transformers greatly benefits the generation quality. The proposed StyleSwin is scalable to high resolutions, with both the coarse geometry and fine structures benefit from the strong expressivity of transformers. However, blocking artifacts occur during high-resolution synthesis because performing the local attention in a block-wise manner may break the spatial coherency. To solve this, we empirically investigate various solutions, among which we find that employing a wavelet discriminator to examine the spectral discrepancy effectively suppresses the artifacts. Extensive experiments show the superiority over prior transformer-based GANs, especially on high resolutions, e.g., 1024x1024. The StyleSwin, without complex training strategies, excels over StyleGAN on CelebA-HQ 1024, and achieves on-par performance on FFHQ-1024, proving the promise of using transformers for high-resolution image generation. The code and models will be available at https://github.com/microsoft/StyleSwin."
GLIDE: Towards Photorealistic Image Generation and Editing with Text-Guided Diffusion Models,"Diffusion models have recently been shown to generate high-quality synthetic images, especially when paired with a guidance technique to trade off diversity for fidelity. We explore diffusion models for the problem of text-conditional image synthesis and compare two different guidance strategies: CLIP guidance and classifier-free guidance. We find that the latter is preferred by human evaluators for both photorealism and caption similarity, and often produces photorealistic samples. Samples from a 3.5 billion parameter text-conditional diffusion model using classifier-free guidance are favored by human evaluators to those from DALL-E, even when the latter uses expensive CLIP reranking. Additionally, we find that our models can be fine-tuned to perform image inpainting, enabling powerful text-driven image editing. We train a smaller model on a filtered dataset and release the code and weights at https://github.com/openai/glide-text2im."
Calorie Aware Automatic Meal Kit Generation from an Image,"Calorie and nutrition research has attained increased interest in recent years. But, due to the complexity of the problem, literature in this area focuses on a limited subset of ingredients or dish types and simple convolutional neural networks or traditional machine learning. Simultaneously, estimation of ingredient portions can help improve calorie estimation and meal re-production from a given image. In this paper, given a single cooking image, a pipeline for calorie estimation and meal re-production for different servings of the meal is proposed. The pipeline contains two stages. In the first stage, a set of ingredients associated with the meal in the given image are predicted. In the second stage, given image features and ingredients, portions of the ingredients and finally the total meal calorie are simultaneously estimated using a deep transformer-based model. Portion estimation introduced in the model helps improve calorie estimation and is also beneficial for meal re-production in different serving sizes. To demonstrate the benefits of the pipeline, the model can be used for meal kits generation. To evaluate the pipeline, the large scale dataset Recipe1M is used. Prior to experiments, the Recipe1M dataset is parsed and explicitly annotated with portions of ingredients. Experiments show that using ingredients and their portions significantly improves calorie estimation. Also, a visual interface is created in which a user can interact with the pipeline to reach accurate calorie estimations and generate a meal kit for cooking purposes."
A Streaming Volumetric Image Generation Framework for Development and Evaluation of Out-of-Core Methods,"Advances in 3D imaging technology in recent years have allowed for increasingly high resolution volumetric images of large specimen. The resulting datasets of hundreds of Gigabytes in size call for new scalable and memory efficient approaches in the field of image processing, where some progress has been made already. At the same time, quantitative evaluation of these new methods is difficult both in terms of the availability of specific data sizes and in the generation of associated ground truth data. In this paper we present an algorithmic framework that can be used to efficiently generate test (and ground truth) volume data, optionally even in a streaming fashion. As the proposed nested sweeps algorithm is fast, it can be used to generate test data on demand. We analyze the asymptotic run time of the presented algorithm and compare it experimentally to alternative approaches as well as a hypothetical best-case baseline method. In a case study, the framework is applied to the popular VascuSynth software for vascular image generation, making it capable of efficiently producing larger-than-main memory volumes which is demonstrated by generating a trillion voxel (1TB) image. Implementations of the presented framework are available online in the form of the modified version of Vascusynth and the code used for the experimental evaluation. In addition, the test data generation procedure has been integrated into the popular volume rendering and processing framework Voreen."
GRAM: Generative Radiance Manifolds for 3D-Aware Image Generation,"3D-aware image generative modeling aims to generate 3D-consistent images with explicitly controllable camera poses. Recent works have shown promising results by training neural radiance field (NeRF) generators on unstructured 2D images, but still can not generate highly-realistic images with fine details. A critical reason is that the high memory and computation cost of volumetric representation learning greatly restricts the number of point samples for radiance integration during training. Deficient sampling not only limits the expressive power of the generator to handle fine details but also impedes effective GAN training due to the noise caused by unstable Monte Carlo sampling. We propose a novel approach that regulates point sampling and radiance field learning on 2D manifolds, embodied as a set of learned implicit surfaces in the 3D volume. For each viewing ray, we calculate ray-surface intersections and accumulate their radiance generated by the network. By training and rendering such radiance manifolds, our generator can produce high quality images with realistic fine details and strong visual 3D consistency."
Forensic Analysis of Synthetically Generated Western Blot Images,"The widespread diffusion of synthetically generated content is a serious threat that needs urgent countermeasures. As a matter of fact, the generation of synthetic content is not restricted to multimedia data like videos, photographs or audio sequences, but covers a significantly vast area that can include biological images as well, such as western blot and microscopic images. In this paper, we focus on the detection of synthetically generated western blot images. These images are largely explored in the biomedical literature and it has been already shown they can be easily counterfeited with few hopes to spot manipulations by visual inspection or by using standard forensics detectors. To overcome the absence of publicly available data for this task, we create a new dataset comprising more than 14K original western blot images and 24K synthetic western blot images, generated using four different state-of-the-art generation methods. We investigate different strategies to detect synthetic western blots, exploring binary classification methods as well as one-class detectors. In both scenarios, we never exploit synthetic western blot images at training stage. The achieved results show that synthetically generated western blot images can be spot with good accuracy, even though the exploited detectors are not optimized over synthetic versions of these scientific images. We also test the robustness of the developed detectors against post-processing operations commonly performed on scientific images, showing that we can be robust to JPEG compression and that some generative models are easily recognizable, despite the application of editing might alter the artifacts they leave."
StyleMC: Multi-Channel Based Fast Text-Guided Image Generation and Manipulation,"Discovering meaningful directions in the latent space of GANs to manipulate semantic attributes typically requires large amounts of labeled data. Recent work aims to overcome this limitation by leveraging the power of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), a joint text-image model. While promising, these methods require several hours of preprocessing or training to achieve the desired manipulations. In this paper, we present StyleMC, a fast and efficient method for text-driven image generation and manipulation. StyleMC uses a CLIP-based loss and an identity loss to manipulate images via a single text prompt without significantly affecting other attributes. Unlike prior work, StyleMC requires only a few seconds of training per text prompt to find stable global directions, does not require prompt engineering and can be used with any pre-trained StyleGAN2 model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and compare it to state-of-the-art methods. Our code can be found at http://catlab-team.github.io/stylemc."
Leveraging Image-based Generative Adversarial Networks for Time Series Generation,"Generative models synthesize image data with great success regarding sampling quality, diversity and feature disentanglement. Generative models for time series lack these benefits due to a missing representation, which captures temporal dynamics and allows inversion for sampling. The paper proposes the intertemporal return plot (IRP) representation to facilitate the use of image-based generative adversarial networks for time series generation. The representation proves effective in capturing time series characteristics and, compared to alternative representations, benefits from invertibility and scale-invariance. Empirical benchmarks confirm these features and demonstrate that the IRP enables an off-the-shelf Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty to sample realistic time series, which outperform a specialized RNN-based GAN, while simultaneously reducing model complexity."
Exploring the Asynchronous of the Frequency Spectra of GAN-generated Facial Images,"The rapid progression of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) has raised a concern of their misuse for malicious purposes, especially in creating fake face images. Although many proposed methods succeed in detecting GAN-based synthetic images, they are still limited by the need for large quantities of the training fake image dataset and challenges for the detector's generalizability to unknown facial images. In this paper, we propose a new approach that explores the asynchronous frequency spectra of color channels, which is simple but effective for training both unsupervised and supervised learning models to distinguish GAN-based synthetic images. We further investigate the transferability of a training model that learns from our suggested features in one source domain and validates on another target domains with prior knowledge of the features' distribution. Our experimental results show that the discrepancy of spectra in the frequency domain is a practical artifact to effectively detect various types of GAN-based generated images."
Show and Write: Entity-aware Article Generation with Image Information,"Many vision-language applications contain long articles of text paired with images (e.g., news or Wikipedia articles). Prior work learning to encode and/or generate these articles has primarily focused on understanding the article itself and some related metadata like the title or date it was written. However, the images and their captions or alt-text often contain crucial information such as named entities that are difficult to be correctly recognized and predicted by language models. To address this shortcoming, this paper introduces an ENtity-aware article Generation method with Image iNformation, ENGIN, to incorporate an article's image information into language models. ENGIN represents articles that can be conditioned on metadata used by prior work and information such as captions and named entities extracted from images. Our key contribution is a novel Entity-aware mechanism to help our model better recognize and predict the entity names in articles. We perform experiments on three public datasets, GoodNews, VisualNews, and WikiText. Quantitative results show that our approach improves generated article perplexity by 4-5 points over the base models. Qualitative results demonstrate the text generated by ENGIN is more consistent with embedded article images. We also perform article quality annotation experiments on the generated articles to validate that our model produces higher-quality articles. Finally, we investigate the effect ENGIN has on methods that automatically detect machine-generated articles."
Guided Generative Models using Weak Supervision for Detecting Object Spatial Arrangement in Overhead Images,"The increasing availability and accessibility of numerous overhead images allows us to estimate and assess the spatial arrangement of groups of geospatial target objects, which can benefit many applications, such as traffic monitoring and agricultural monitoring. Spatial arrangement estimation is the process of identifying the areas which contain the desired objects in overhead images. Traditional supervised object detection approaches can estimate accurate spatial arrangement but require large amounts of bounding box annotations. Recent semi-supervised clustering approaches can reduce manual labeling but still require annotations for all object categories in the image. This paper presents the target-guided generative model (TGGM), under the Variational Auto-encoder (VAE) framework, which uses Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) to estimate the distributions of both hidden and decoder variables in VAE. Modeling both hidden and decoder variables by GMM reduces the required manual annotations significantly for spatial arrangement estimation. Unlike existing approaches that the training process can only update the GMM as a whole in the optimization iterations (e.g., a ""minibatch""), TGGM allows the update of individual GMM components separately in the same optimization iteration. Optimizing GMM components separately allows TGGM to exploit the semantic relationships in spatial data and requires only a few labels to initiate and guide the generative process. Our experiments shows that TGGM achieves results comparable to the state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods and outperforms unsupervised methods by 10% based on the F_{1} scores, while requiring significantly fewer labeled data."
Edge-Enhanced Dual Discriminator Generative Adversarial Network for Fast MRI with Parallel Imaging Using Multi-view Information,"In clinical medicine, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the most important tools for diagnosis, triage, prognosis, and treatment planning. However, MRI suffers from an inherent slow data acquisition process because data is collected sequentially in k-space. In recent years, most MRI reconstruction methods proposed in the literature focus on holistic image reconstruction rather than enhancing the edge information. This work steps aside this general trend by elaborating on the enhancement of edge information. Specifically, we introduce a novel parallel imaging coupled dual discriminator generative adversarial network (PIDD-GAN) for fast multi-channel MRI reconstruction by incorporating multi-view information. The dual discriminator design aims to improve the edge information in MRI reconstruction. One discriminator is used for holistic image reconstruction, whereas the other one is responsible for enhancing edge information. An improved U-Net with local and global residual learning is proposed for the generator. Frequency channel attention blocks (FCA Blocks) are embedded in the generator for incorporating attention mechanisms. Content loss is introduced to train the generator for better reconstruction quality. We performed comprehensive experiments on Calgary-Campinas public brain MR dataset and compared our method with state-of-the-art MRI reconstruction methods. Ablation studies of residual learning were conducted on the MICCAI13 dataset to validate the proposed modules. Results show that our PIDD-GAN provides high-quality reconstructed MR images, with well-preserved edge information. The time of single-image reconstruction is below 5ms, which meets the demand of faster processing."
"Uncertainty, Edge, and Reverse-Attention Guided Generative Adversarial Network for Automatic Building Detection in Remotely Sensed Images","Despite recent advances in deep-learning based semantic segmentation, automatic building detection from remotely sensed imagery is still a challenging problem owing to large variability in the appearance of buildings across the globe. The errors occur mostly around the boundaries of the building footprints, in shadow areas, and when detecting buildings whose exterior surfaces have reflectivity properties that are very similar to those of the surrounding regions. To overcome these problems, we propose a generative adversarial network based segmentation framework with uncertainty attention unit and refinement module embedded in the generator. The refinement module, composed of edge and reverse attention units, is designed to refine the predicted building map. The edge attention enhances the boundary features to estimate building boundaries with greater precision, and the reverse attention allows the network to explore the features missing in the previously estimated regions. The uncertainty attention unit assists the network in resolving uncertainties in classification. As a measure of the power of our approach, as of December 4, 2021, it ranks at the second place on DeepGlobe's public leaderboard despite the fact that main focus of our approach -- refinement of the building edges -- does not align exactly with the metrics used for leaderboard rankings. Our overall F1-score on DeepGlobe's challenging dataset is 0.745. We also report improvements on the previous-best results for the challenging INRIA Validation Dataset for which our network achieves an overall IoU of 81.28% and an overall accuracy of 97.03%. Along the same lines, for the official INRIA Test Dataset, our network scores 77.86% and 96.41% in overall IoU and accuracy."
Gaudí: Conversational Interactions with Deep Representations to Generate Image Collections,"Based on recent advances in realistic language modeling (GPT-3) and cross-modal representations (CLIP), Gaudí was developed to help designers search for inspirational images using natural language. In the early stages of the design process, with the goal of eliciting a client's preferred creative direction, designers will typically create thematic collections of inspirational images called ""mood-boards"". Creating a mood-board involves sequential image searches which are currently performed using keywords or images. Gaudí transforms this process into a conversation where the user is gradually detailing the mood-board's theme. This representation allows our AI to generate new search queries from scratch, straight from a project briefing, following a theme hypothesized by GPT-3. Compared to previous computational approaches to mood-board creation, to the best of our knowledge, ours is the first attempt to represent mood-boards as the stories that designers tell when presenting a creative direction to a client."
Make It Move: Controllable Image-to-Video Generation with Text Descriptions,"Generating controllable videos conforming to user intentions is an appealing yet challenging topic in computer vision. To enable maneuverable control in line with user intentions, a novel video generation task, named Text-Image-to-Video generation (TI2V), is proposed. With both controllable appearance and motion, TI2V aims at generating videos from a static image and a text description. The key challenges of TI2V task lie both in aligning appearance and motion from different modalities, and in handling uncertainty in text descriptions. To address these challenges, we propose a Motion Anchor-based video GEnerator (MAGE) with an innovative motion anchor (MA) structure to store appearance-motion aligned representation. To model the uncertainty and increase the diversity, it further allows the injection of explicit condition and implicit randomness. Through three-dimensional axial transformers, MA is interacted with given image to generate next frames recursively with satisfying controllability and diversity. Accompanying the new task, we build two new video-text paired datasets based on MNIST and CATER for evaluation. Experiments conducted on these datasets verify the effectiveness of MAGE and show appealing potentials of TI2V task. Source code for model and datasets will be available soon."
Adaptive Feature Interpolation for Low-Shot Image Generation,"Training of generative models especially Generative Adversarial Networks can easily diverge in low-data setting. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel implicit data augmentation approach which facilitates stable training and synthesize high-quality samples without need of label information. Specifically, we view the discriminator as a metric embedding of the real data manifold, which offers proper distances between real data points. We then utilize information in the feature space to develop a fully unsupervised and data-driven augmentation method. Experiments on few-shot generation tasks show the proposed method significantly improve results from strong baselines with hundreds of training samples."
SemanticStyleGAN: Learning Compositional Generative Priors for Controllable Image Synthesis and Editing,"Recent studies have shown that StyleGANs provide promising prior models for downstream tasks on image synthesis and editing. However, since the latent codes of StyleGANs are designed to control global styles, it is hard to achieve a fine-grained control over synthesized images. We present SemanticStyleGAN, where a generator is trained to model local semantic parts separately and synthesizes images in a compositional way. The structure and texture of different local parts are controlled by corresponding latent codes. Experimental results demonstrate that our model provides a strong disentanglement between different spatial areas. When combined with editing methods designed for StyleGANs, it can achieve a more fine-grained control to edit synthesized or real images. The model can also be extended to other domains via transfer learning. Thus, as a generic prior model with built-in disentanglement, it could facilitate the development of GAN-based applications and enable more potential downstream tasks."
Global Context with Discrete Diffusion in Vector Quantised Modelling for Image Generation,"The integration of Vector Quantised Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE) with autoregressive models as generation part has yielded high-quality results on image generation. However, the autoregressive models will strictly follow the progressive scanning order during the sampling phase. This leads the existing VQ series models to hardly escape the trap of lacking global information. Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) in the continuous domain have shown a capability to capture the global context, while generating high-quality images. In the discrete state space, some works have demonstrated the potential to perform text generation and low resolution image generation. We show that with the help of a content-rich discrete visual codebook from VQ-VAE, the discrete diffusion model can also generate high fidelity images with global context, which compensates for the deficiency of the classical autoregressive model along pixel space. Meanwhile, the integration of the discrete VAE with the diffusion model resolves the drawback of conventional autoregressive models being oversized, and the diffusion model which demands excessive time in the sampling process when generating images. It is found that the quality of the generated images is heavily dependent on the discrete visual codebook. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed Vector Quantised Discrete Diffusion Model (VQ-DDM) is able to achieve comparable performance to top-tier methods with low complexity. It also demonstrates outstanding advantages over other vectors quantised with autoregressive models in terms of image inpainting tasks without additional training."
"An Automatic Approach for Generating Rich, Linked Geo-Metadata from Historical Map Images","Historical maps contain detailed geographic information difficult to find elsewhere covering long-periods of time (e.g., 125 years for the historical topographic maps in the US). However, these maps typically exist as scanned images without searchable metadata. Existing approaches making historical maps searchable rely on tedious manual work (including crowd-sourcing) to generate the metadata (e.g., geolocations and keywords). Optical character recognition (OCR) software could alleviate the required manual work, but the recognition results are individual words instead of location phrases (e.g., ""Black"" and ""Mountain"" vs. ""Black Mountain""). This paper presents an end-to-end approach to address the real-world problem of finding and indexing historical map images. This approach automatically processes historical map images to extract their text content and generates a set of metadata that is linked to large external geospatial knowledge bases. The linked metadata in the RDF (Resource Description Framework) format support complex queries for finding and indexing historical maps, such as retrieving all historical maps covering mountain peaks higher than 1,000 meters in California. We have implemented the approach in a system called mapKurator. We have evaluated mapKurator using historical maps from several sources with various map styles, scales, and coverage. Our results show significant improvement over the state-of-the-art methods. The code has been made publicly available as modules of the Kartta Labs project at https://github.com/kartta-labs/Project."
Multi-modal application: Image Memes Generation,"Meme is an interesting word. Internet memes offer unique insights into the changes in our perception of the world, the media and our own lives. If you surf the Internet for long enough, you will see it somewhere on the Internet. With the rise of social media platforms and convenient image dissemination, Image Meme has gained fame. Image memes have become a kind of pop culture and they play an important role in communication over social media, blogs, and open messages. With the development of artificial intelligence and the widespread use of deep learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV) can also be used to solve more problems in life, including meme generation. An Internet meme commonly takes the form of an image and is created by combining a meme template (image) and a caption (natural language sentence). In our project, we propose an end-to-end encoder-decoder architecture meme generator. For a given input sentence, we use the Meme template selection model to determine the emotion it expresses and select the image template. Then generate captions and memes through to the meme caption generator. Code and models are available at github"
FuseDream: Training-Free Text-to-Image Generation with Improved CLIP+GAN Space Optimization,"Generating images from natural language instructions is an intriguing yet highly challenging task. We approach text-to-image generation by combining the power of the retrained CLIP representation with an off-the-shelf image generator (GANs), optimizing in the latent space of GAN to find images that achieve maximum CLIP score with the given input text. Compared to traditional methods that train generative models from text to image starting from scratch, the CLIP+GAN approach is training-free, zero shot and can be easily customized with different generators.  However, optimizing CLIP score in the GAN space casts a highly challenging optimization problem and off-the-shelf optimizers such as Adam fail to yield satisfying results. In this work, we propose a FuseDream pipeline, which improves the CLIP+GAN approach with three key techniques: 1) an AugCLIP score which robustifies the CLIP objective by introducing random augmentation on image. 2) a novel initialization and over-parameterization strategy for optimization which allows us to efficiently navigate the non-convex landscape in GAN space. 3) a composed generation technique which, by leveraging a novel bi-level optimization formulation, can compose multiple images to extend the GAN space and overcome the data-bias.  When promoted by different input text, FuseDream can generate high-quality images with varying objects, backgrounds, artistic styles, even novel counterfactual concepts that do not appear in the training data of the GAN we use. Quantitatively, the images generated by FuseDream yield top-level Inception score and FID score on MS COCO dataset, without additional architecture design or training. Our code is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/gnobitab/FuseDream}."
GANSeg: Learning to Segment by Unsupervised Hierarchical Image Generation,"Segmenting an image into its parts is a frequent preprocess for high-level vision tasks such as image editing. However, annotating masks for supervised training is expensive. Weakly-supervised and unsupervised methods exist, but they depend on the comparison of pairs of images, such as from multi-views, frames of videos, and image augmentation, which limits their applicability. To address this, we propose a GAN-based approach that generates images conditioned on latent masks, thereby alleviating full or weak annotations required in previous approaches. We show that such mask-conditioned image generation can be learned faithfully when conditioning the masks in a hierarchical manner on latent keypoints that define the position of parts explicitly. Without requiring supervision of masks or points, this strategy increases robustness to viewpoint and object positions changes. It also lets us generate image-mask pairs for training a segmentation network, which outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised segmentation methods on established benchmarks."
Generating Diverse 3D Reconstructions from a Single Occluded Face Image,"Occlusions are a common occurrence in unconstrained face images. Single image 3D reconstruction from such face images often suffers from corruption due to the presence of occlusions. Furthermore, while a plurality of 3D reconstructions is plausible in the occluded regions, existing approaches are limited to generating only a single solution. To address both of these challenges, we present Diverse3DFace, which is specifically designed to simultaneously generate a diverse and realistic set of 3D reconstructions from a single occluded face image. It consists of three components: a global+local shape fitting process, a graph neural network-based mesh VAE, and a Determinantal Point Process based diversity promoting iterative optimization procedure. Quantitative and qualitative comparisons of 3D reconstruction on occluded faces show that Diverse3DFace can estimate 3D shapes that are consistent with the visible regions in the target image while exhibiting high, yet realistic, levels of diversity on the occluded regions. On face images occluded by masks, glasses, and other random objects, Diverse3DFace generates a distribution of 3D shapes having ~50% higher diversity on the occluded regions compared to the baselines. Moreover, our closest sample to the ground truth has ~40% lower MSE than the singular reconstructions by existing approaches."
GLocal: Global Graph Reasoning and Local Structure Transfer for Person Image Generation,"In this paper, we focus on person image generation, namely, generating person image under various conditions, e.g., corrupted texture or different pose. To address texture occlusion and large pose misalignment in this task, previous works just use the corresponding region's style to infer the occluded area and rely on point-wise alignment to reorganize the context texture information, lacking the ability to globally correlate the region-wise style codes and preserve the local structure of the source. To tackle these problems, we present a GLocal framework to improve the occlusion-aware texture estimation by globally reasoning the style inter-correlations among different semantic regions, which can also be employed to recover the corrupted images in texture inpainting. For local structural information preservation, we further extract the local structure of the source image and regain it in the generated image via local structure transfer. We benchmark our method to fully characterize its performance on DeepFashion dataset and present extensive ablation studies that highlight the novelty of our method."
3D Photo Stylization: Learning to Generate Stylized Novel Views from a Single Image,"Visual content creation has spurred a soaring interest given its applications in mobile photography and AR / VR. Style transfer and single-image 3D photography as two representative tasks have so far evolved independently. In this paper, we make a connection between the two, and address the challenging task of 3D photo stylization - generating stylized novel views from a single image given an arbitrary style. Our key intuition is that style transfer and view synthesis have to be jointly modeled for this task. To this end, we propose a deep model that learns geometry-aware content features for stylization from a point cloud representation of the scene, resulting in high-quality stylized images that are consistent across views. Further, we introduce a novel training protocol to enable the learning using only 2D images. We demonstrate the superiority of our method via extensive qualitative and quantitative studies, and showcase key applications of our method in light of the growing demand for 3D content creation from 2D image assets."
"EdiBERT, a generative model for image editing","Advances in computer vision are pushing the limits of im-age manipulation, with generative models sampling detailed images on various tasks. However, a specialized model is often developed and trained for each specific task, even though many image edition tasks share similarities. In denoising, inpainting, or image compositing, one always aims at generating a realistic image from a low-quality one. In this paper, we aim at making a step towards a unified approach for image editing. To do so, we propose EdiBERT, a bi-directional transformer trained in the discrete latent space built by a vector-quantized auto-encoder. We argue that such a bidirectional model is suited for image manipulation since any patch can be re-sampled conditionally to the whole image. Using this unique and straightforward training objective, we show that the resulting model matches state-of-the-art performances on a wide variety of tasks: image denoising, image completion, and image composition."
Using a GAN to Generate Adversarial Examples to Facial Image Recognition,"Images posted online present a privacy concern in that they may be used as reference examples for a facial recognition system. Such abuse of images is in violation of privacy rights but is difficult to counter. It is well established that adversarial example images can be created for recognition systems which are based on deep neural networks. These adversarial examples can be used to disrupt the utility of the images as reference examples or training data. In this work we use a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to create adversarial examples to deceive facial recognition and we achieve an acceptable success rate in fooling the face recognition. Our results reduce the training time for the GAN by removing the discriminator component. Furthermore, our results show knowledge distillation can be employed to drastically reduce the size of the resulting model without impacting performance indicating that our contribution could run comfortably on a smartphone"
Generative Convolution Layer for Image Generation,"This paper introduces a novel convolution method, called generative convolution (GConv), which is simple yet effective for improving the generative adversarial network (GAN) performance. Unlike the standard convolution, GConv first selects useful kernels compatible with the given latent vector, and then linearly combines the selected kernels to make latent-specific kernels. Using the latent-specific kernels, the proposed method produces the latent-specific features which encourage the generator to produce high-quality images. This approach is simple but surprisingly effective. First, the GAN performance is significantly improved with a little additional hardware cost. Second, GConv can be employed to the existing state-of-the-art generators without modifying the network architecture. To reveal the superiority of GConv, this paper provides extensive experiments using various standard datasets including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, LSUN-Church, CelebA, and tiny-ImageNet. Quantitative evaluations prove that GConv significantly boosts the performances of the unconditional and conditional GANs in terms of Inception score (IS) and Frechet inception distance (FID). For example, the proposed method improves both FID and IS scores on the tiny-ImageNet dataset from 35.13 to 29.76 and 20.23 to 22.64, respectively."
Equitable modelling of brain imaging by counterfactual augmentation with morphologically constrained 3D deep generative models,"We describe Countersynth, a conditional generative model of diffeomorphic deformations that induce label-driven, biologically plausible changes in volumetric brain images. The model is intended to synthesise counterfactual training data augmentations for downstream discriminative modelling tasks where fidelity is limited by data imbalance, distributional instability, confounding, or underspecification, and exhibits inequitable performance across distinct subpopulations. Focusing on demographic attributes, we evaluate the quality of synthesized counterfactuals with voxel-based morphometry, classification and regression of the conditioning attributes, and the Fréchet inception distance. Examining downstream discriminative performance in the context of engineered demographic imbalance and confounding, we use UK Biobank magnetic resonance imaging data to benchmark CounterSynth augmentation against current solutions to these problems. We achieve state-of-the-art improvements, both in overall fidelity and equity. The source code for CounterSynth is available online."
Weakly-supervised Generative Adversarial Networks for medical image classification,"Weakly-supervised learning has become a popular technology in recent years. In this paper, we propose a novel medical image classification algorithm, called Weakly-Supervised Generative Adversarial Networks (WSGAN), which only uses a small number of real images without labels to generate fake images or mask images to enlarge the sample size of the training set. First, we combine with MixMatch to generate pseudo labels for the fake images and unlabeled images to do the classification. Second, contrastive learning and self-attention mechanism are introduced into the proposed problem to enhance the classification accuracy. Third, the problem of mode collapse is well addressed by cyclic consistency loss. Finally, we design global and local classifiers to complement each other with the key information needed for classification. The experimental results on four medical image datasets show that WSGAN can obtain relatively high learning performance by using few labeled and unlabeled data. For example, the classification accuracy of WSGAN is 11% higher than that of the second-ranked MIXMATCH with 100 labeled images and 1000 unlabeled images on the OCT dataset. In addition, we also conduct ablation experiments to verify the effectiveness of our algorithm."
ZeroCap: Zero-Shot Image-to-Text Generation for Visual-Semantic Arithmetic,"Recent text-to-image matching models apply contrastive learning to large corpora of uncurated pairs of images and sentences. While such models can provide a powerful score for matching and subsequent zero-shot tasks, they are not capable of generating caption given an image. In this work, we repurpose such models to generate a descriptive text given an image at inference time, without any further training or tuning steps. This is done by combining the visual-semantic model with a large language model, benefiting from the knowledge in both web-scale models. The resulting captions are much less restrictive than those obtained by supervised captioning methods. Moreover, as a zero-shot learning method, it is extremely flexible and we demonstrate its ability to perform image arithmetic in which the inputs can be either images or text, and the output is a sentence. This enables novel high-level vision capabilities such as comparing two images or solving visual analogy tests. Our code is available at: https://github.com/YoadTew/zero-shot-image-to-text."
Data Augmentation For Medical MR Image Using Generative Adversarial Networks,"Computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD) based on deep learning has become a crucial diagnostic technology in the medical industry, effectively improving diagnosis accuracy. However, the scarcity of brain tumor Magnetic Resonance (MR) image datasets causes the low performance of deep learning algorithms. The distribution of transformed images generated by traditional data augmentation (DA) intrinsically resembles the original ones, resulting in a limited performance in terms of generalization ability. This work improves Progressive Growing of GANs with a structural similarity loss function (PGGAN-SSIM) to solve image blurriness problems and model collapse. We also explore other GAN-based data augmentation to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Our results show that PGGAN-SSIM successfully generates 256x256 realistic brain tumor MR images which fill the real image distribution uncovered by the original dataset. Furthermore, PGGAN-SSIM exceeds other GAN-based methods, achieving promising performance improvement in Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and Multi-scale Structural Similarity (MS-SSIM)."
LAFITE: Towards Language-Free Training for Text-to-Image Generation,"One of the major challenges in training text-to-image generation models is the need of a large number of high-quality image-text pairs. While image samples are often easily accessible, the associated text descriptions typically require careful human captioning, which is particularly time- and cost-consuming. In this paper, we propose the first work to train text-to-image generation models without any text data. Our method leverages the well-aligned multi-modal semantic space of the powerful pre-trained CLIP model: the requirement of text-conditioning is seamlessly alleviated via generating text features from image features. Extensive experiments are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. We obtain state-of-the-art results in the standard text-to-image generation tasks. Importantly, the proposed language-free model outperforms most existing models trained with full image-text pairs. Furthermore, our method can be applied in fine-tuning pre-trained models, which saves both training time and cost in training text-to-image generation models. Our pre-trained model obtains competitive results in zero-shot text-to-image generation on the MS-COCO dataset, yet with around only 1% of the model size and training data size relative to the recently proposed large DALL-E model."
Conditional Image Generation with Score-Based Diffusion Models,"Score-based diffusion models have emerged as one of the most promising frameworks for deep generative modelling. In this work we conduct a systematic comparison and theoretical analysis of different approaches to learning conditional probability distributions with score-based diffusion models. In particular, we prove results which provide a theoretical justification for one of the most successful estimators of the conditional score. Moreover, we introduce a multi-speed diffusion framework, which leads to a new estimator for the conditional score, performing on par with previous state-of-the-art approaches. Our theoretical and experimental findings are accompanied by an open source library MSDiff which allows for application and further research of multi-speed diffusion models."
Self-supervised Correlation Mining Network for Person Image Generation,"Person image generation aims to perform non-rigid deformation on source images, which generally requires unaligned data pairs for training. Recently, self-supervised methods express great prospects in this task by merging the disentangled representations for self-reconstruction. However, such methods fail to exploit the spatial correlation between the disentangled features. In this paper, we propose a Self-supervised Correlation Mining Network (SCM-Net) to rearrange the source images in the feature space, in which two collaborative modules are integrated, Decomposed Style Encoder (DSE) and Correlation Mining Module (CMM). Specifically, the DSE first creates unaligned pairs at the feature level. Then, the CMM establishes the spatial correlation field for feature rearrangement. Eventually, a translation module transforms the rearranged features to realistic results. Meanwhile, for improving the fidelity of cross-scale pose transformation, we propose a graph based Body Structure Retaining Loss (BSR Loss) to preserve reasonable body structures on half body to full body generation. Extensive experiments conducted on DeepFashion dataset demonstrate the superiority of our method compared with other supervised and unsupervised approaches. Furthermore, satisfactory results on face generation show the versatility of our method in other deformation tasks."
GPR1200: A Benchmark for General-Purpose Content-Based Image Retrieval,"Even though it has extensively been shown that retrieval specific training of deep neural networks is beneficial for nearest neighbor image search quality, most of these models are trained and tested in the domain of landmarks images. However, some applications use images from various other domains and therefore need a network with good generalization properties - a general-purpose CBIR model. To the best of our knowledge, no testing protocol has so far been introduced to benchmark models with respect to general image retrieval quality. After analyzing popular image retrieval test sets we decided to manually curate GPR1200, an easy to use and accessible but challenging benchmark dataset with a broad range of image categories. This benchmark is subsequently used to evaluate various pretrained models of different architectures on their generalization qualities. We show that large-scale pretraining significantly improves retrieval performance and present experiments on how to further increase these properties by appropriate fine-tuning. With these promising results, we hope to increase interest in the research topic of general-purpose CBIR."
Rotation Equivariant 3D Hand Mesh Generation from a Single RGB Image,"We develop a rotation equivariant model for generating 3D hand meshes from 2D RGB images. This guarantees that as the input image of a hand is rotated the generated mesh undergoes a corresponding rotation. Furthermore, this removes undesirable deformations in the meshes often generated by methods without rotation equivariance. By building a rotation equivariant model, through considering symmetries in the problem, we reduce the need for training on very large datasets to achieve good mesh reconstruction.  The encoder takes images defined on \mathbb{Z}^{2} and maps these to latent functions defined on the group C_{8}. We introduce a novel vector mapping function to map the function defined on C_{8} to a latent point cloud space defined on the group \mathrm{SO}(2). Further, we introduce a 3D projection function that learns a 3D function from the \mathrm{SO}(2) latent space. Finally, we use an \mathrm{SO}(3) equivariant decoder to ensure rotation equivariance. Our rotation equivariant model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a real-world dataset and we demonstrate that it accurately captures the shape and pose in the generated meshes under rotation of the input hand."
Rethinking Generic Camera Models for Deep Single Image Camera Calibration to Recover Rotation and Fisheye Distortion,"Although recent learning-based calibration methods can predict extrinsic and intrinsic camera parameters from a single image, the accuracy of these methods is degraded in fisheye images. This degradation is caused by mismatching between the actual projection and expected projection. To address this problem, we propose a generic camera model that has the potential to address various types of distortion. Our generic camera model is utilized for learning-based methods through a closed-form numerical calculation of the camera projection. Simultaneously to recover rotation and fisheye distortion, we propose a learning-based calibration method that uses the camera model. Furthermore, we propose a loss function that alleviates the bias of the magnitude of errors for four extrinsic and intrinsic camera parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our proposed method outperformed conventional methods on two largescale datasets and images captured by off-the-shelf fisheye cameras. Moreover, we are the first researchers to analyze the performance of learning-based methods using various types of projection for off-the-shelf cameras."
Unleashing Transformers: Parallel Token Prediction with Discrete Absorbing Diffusion for Fast High-Resolution Image Generation from Vector-Quantized Codes,"Whilst diffusion probabilistic models can generate high quality image content, key limitations remain in terms of both generating high-resolution imagery and their associated high computational requirements. Recent Vector-Quantized image models have overcome this limitation of image resolution but are prohibitively slow and unidirectional as they generate tokens via element-wise autoregressive sampling from the prior. By contrast, in this paper we propose a novel discrete diffusion probabilistic model prior which enables parallel prediction of Vector-Quantized tokens by using an unconstrained Transformer architecture as the backbone. During training, tokens are randomly masked in an order-agnostic manner and the Transformer learns to predict the original tokens. This parallelism of Vector-Quantized token prediction in turn facilitates unconditional generation of globally consistent high-resolution and diverse imagery at a fraction of the computational expense. In this manner, we can generate image resolutions exceeding that of the original training set samples whilst additionally provisioning per-image likelihood estimates (in a departure from generative adversarial approaches). Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of Density (LSUN Bedroom: 1.51; LSUN Churches: 1.12; FFHQ: 1.20) and Coverage (LSUN Bedroom: 0.83; LSUN Churches: 0.73; FFHQ: 0.80), and performs competitively on FID (LSUN Bedroom: 3.64; LSUN Churches: 4.07; FFHQ: 6.11) whilst offering advantages in terms of both computation and reduced training set requirements."
A Method for Evaluating Deep Generative Models of Images via Assessing the Reproduction of High-order Spatial Context,"Deep generative models (DGMs) have the potential to revolutionize diagnostic imaging. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are one kind of DGM which are widely employed. The overarching problem with deploying GANs, and other DGMs, in any application that requires domain expertise in order to actually use the generated images is that there generally is not adequate or automatic means of assessing the domain-relevant quality of generated images. In this work, we demonstrate several objective tests of images output by two popular GAN architectures. We designed several stochastic context models (SCMs) of distinct image features that can be recovered after generation by a trained GAN. Several of these features are high-order, algorithmic pixel-arrangement rules which are not readily expressed in covariance matrices. We designed and validated statistical classifiers to detect specific effects of the known arrangement rules. We then tested the rates at which two different GANs correctly reproduced the feature context under a variety of training scenarios, and degrees of feature-class similarity. We found that ensembles of generated images can appear largely accurate visually, and show high accuracy in ensemble measures, while not exhibiting the known spatial arrangements. Furthermore, GANs trained on a spectrum of distinct spatial orders did not respect the given prevalence of those orders in the training data. The main conclusion is that SCMs can be engineered to quantify numerous errors, per image, that may not be captured in ensemble statistics but plausibly can affect subsequent use of the GAN-generated images."
Causality-inspired Single-source Domain Generalization for Medical Image Segmentation,"Deep learning models usually suffer from domain shift issues, where models trained on one source domain do not generalize well to other unseen domains. In this work, we investigate the single-source domain generalization problem: training a deep network that is robust to unseen domains, under the condition that training data is only available from one source domain, which is common in medical imaging applications. We tackle this problem in the context of cross-domain medical image segmentation. Under this scenario, domain shifts are mainly caused by different acquisition processes. We propose a simple causality-inspired data augmentation approach to expose a segmentation model to synthesized domain-shifted training examples. Specifically, 1) to make the deep model robust to discrepancies in image intensities and textures, we employ a family of randomly-weighted shallow networks. They augment training images using diverse appearance transformations. 2) Further we show that spurious correlations among objects in an image are detrimental to domain robustness. These correlations might be taken by the network as domain-specific clues for making predictions, and they may break on unseen domains. We remove these spurious correlations via causal intervention. This is achieved by resampling the appearances of potentially correlated objects independently. The proposed approach is validated on three cross-domain segmentation tasks: cross-modality (CT-MRI) abdominal image segmentation, cross-sequence (bSSFP-LGE) cardiac MRI segmentation, and cross-center prostate MRI segmentation. The proposed approach yields consistent performance gains compared with competitive methods when tested on unseen domains."
Few-shot Image Generation with Mixup-based Distance Learning,"Producing diverse and realistic images with generative models such as GANs typically requires large scale training with vast amount of images. GANs trained with limited data can easily memorize few training samples and display undesirable properties like ""stairlike"" latent space where interpolation in the latent space yields discontinuous transitions in the output space. In this work, we consider a challenging task of pretraining-free few-shot image synthesis, and seek to train existing generative models with minimal overfitting and mode collapse. We propose mixup-based distance regularization on the feature space of both a generator and the counterpart discriminator that encourages the two players to reason not only about the scarce observed data points but the relative distances in the feature space they reside. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation on diverse datasets demonstrates that our method is generally applicable to existing models to enhance both fidelity and diversity under few-shot setting. Code is available."
Generative Adversarial Networks for Astronomical Images Generation,"Space exploration has always been a source of inspiration for humankind, and thanks to modern telescopes, it is now possible to observe celestial bodies far away from us. With a growing number of real and imaginary images of space available on the web and exploiting modern deep Learning architectures such as Generative Adversarial Networks, it is now possible to generate new representations of space. In this research, using a Lightweight GAN, a dataset of images obtained from the web, and the Galaxy Zoo Dataset, we have generated thousands of new images of celestial bodies, galaxies, and finally, by combining them, a wide view of the universe. The code for reproducing our results is publicly available at https://github.com/davide-coccomini/GAN-Universe, and the generated images can be explored at https://davide-coccomini.github.io/GAN-Universe/."
L-Verse: Bidirectional Generation Between Image and Text,"Far beyond learning long-range interactions of natural language, transformers are becoming the de-facto standard for many vision tasks with their power and scalability. Especially with cross-modal tasks between image and text, vector quantized variational autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) are widely used to make a raw RGB image into a sequence of feature vectors. To better leverage the correlation between image and text, we propose L-Verse, a novel architecture consisting of feature-augmented variational autoencoder (AugVAE) and bidirectional auto-regressive transformer (BiART) for image-to-text and text-to-image generation. Our AugVAE shows the state-of-the-art reconstruction performance on ImageNet1K validation set, along with the robustness to unseen images in the wild. Unlike other models, BiART can distinguish between image (or text) as a conditional reference and a generation target. L-Verse can be directly used for image-to-text or text-to-image generation without any finetuning or extra object detection framework. In quantitative and qualitative experiments, L-Verse shows impressive results against previous methods in both image-to-text and text-to-image generation on MS-COCO Captions. We furthermore assess the scalability of L-Verse architecture on Conceptual Captions and present the initial result of bidirectional vision-language representation learning on general domain."
Self-Attending Task Generative Adversarial Network for Realistic Satellite Image Creation,"We introduce a self-attending task generative adversarial network (SATGAN) and apply it to the problem of augmenting synthetic high contrast scientific imagery of resident space objects with realistic noise patterns and sensor characteristics learned from collected data. Augmenting these synthetic data is challenging due to the highly localized nature of semantic content in the data that must be preserved. Real collected images are used to train a network what a given class of sensor's images should look like. The trained network then acts as a filter on noiseless context images and outputs realistic-looking fakes with semantic content unaltered. The architecture is inspired by conditional GANs but is modified to include a task network that preserves semantic information through augmentation. Additionally, the architecture is shown to reduce instances of hallucinatory objects or obfuscation of semantic content in context images representing space observation scenes."
DiverGAN: An Efficient and Effective Single-Stage Framework for Diverse Text-to-Image Generation,"In this paper, we present an efficient and effective single-stage framework (DiverGAN) to generate diverse, plausible and semantically consistent images according to a natural-language description. DiverGAN adopts two novel word-level attention modules, i.e., a channel-attention module (CAM) and a pixel-attention module (PAM), which model the importance of each word in the given sentence while allowing the network to assign larger weights to the significant channels and pixels semantically aligning with the salient words. After that, Conditional Adaptive Instance-Layer Normalization (CAdaILN) is introduced to enable the linguistic cues from the sentence embedding to flexibly manipulate the amount of change in shape and texture, further improving visual-semantic representation and helping stabilize the training. Also, a dual-residual structure is developed to preserve more original visual features while allowing for deeper networks, resulting in faster convergence speed and more vivid details. Furthermore, we propose to plug a fully-connected layer into the pipeline to address the lack-of-diversity problem, since we observe that a dense layer will remarkably enhance the generative capability of the network, balancing the trade-off between a low-dimensional random latent code contributing to variants and modulation modules that use high-dimensional and textual contexts to strength feature maps. Inserting a linear layer after the second residual block achieves the best variety and quality. Both qualitative and quantitative results on benchmark data sets demonstrate the superiority of our DiverGAN for realizing diversity, without harming quality and semantic consistency."
A Latent Encoder Coupled Generative Adversarial Network (LE-GAN) for Efficient Hyperspectral Image Super-resolution,"Realistic hyperspectral image (HSI) super-resolution (SR) techniques aim to generate a high-resolution (HR) HSI with higher spectral and spatial fidelity from its low-resolution (LR) counterpart. The generative adversarial network (GAN) has proven to be an effective deep learning framework for image super-resolution. However, the optimisation process of existing GAN-based models frequently suffers from the problem of mode collapse, leading to the limited capacity of spectral-spatial invariant reconstruction. This may cause the spectral-spatial distortion on the generated HSI, especially with a large upscaling factor. To alleviate the problem of mode collapse, this work has proposed a novel GAN model coupled with a latent encoder (LE-GAN), which can map the generated spectral-spatial features from the image space to the latent space and produce a coupling component to regularise the generated samples. Essentially, we treat an HSI as a high-dimensional manifold embedded in a latent space. Thus, the optimisation of GAN models is converted to the problem of learning the distributions of high-resolution HSI samples in the latent space, making the distributions of the generated super-resolution HSIs closer to those of their original high-resolution counterparts. We have conducted experimental evaluations on the model performance of super-resolution and its capability in alleviating mode collapse. The proposed approach has been tested and validated based on two real HSI datasets with different sensors (i.e. AVIRIS and UHD-185) for various upscaling factors and added noise levels, and compared with the state-of-the-art super-resolution models (i.e. HyCoNet, LTTR, BAGAN, SR- GAN, WGAN)."
Solving Inverse Problems in Medical Imaging with Score-Based Generative Models,"Reconstructing medical images from partial measurements is an important inverse problem in Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Existing solutions based on machine learning typically train a model to directly map measurements to medical images, leveraging a training dataset of paired images and measurements. These measurements are typically synthesized from images using a fixed physical model of the measurement process, which hinders the generalization capability of models to unknown measurement processes. To address this issue, we propose a fully unsupervised technique for inverse problem solving, leveraging the recently introduced score-based generative models. Specifically, we first train a score-based generative model on medical images to capture their prior distribution. Given measurements and a physical model of the measurement process at test time, we introduce a sampling method to reconstruct an image consistent with both the prior and the observed measurements. Our method does not assume a fixed measurement process during training, and can thus be flexibly adapted to different measurement processes at test time. Empirically, we observe comparable or better performance to supervised learning techniques in several medical imaging tasks in CT and MRI, while demonstrating significantly better generalization to unknown measurement processes."
A Multi-attribute Controllable Generative Model for Histopathology Image Synthesis,"Generative models have been applied in the medical imaging domain for various image recognition and synthesis tasks. However, a more controllable and interpretable image synthesis model is still lacking yet necessary for important applications such as assisting in medical training. In this work, we leverage the efficient self-attention and contrastive learning modules and build upon state-of-the-art generative adversarial networks (GANs) to achieve an attribute-aware image synthesis model, termed AttributeGAN, which can generate high-quality histopathology images based on multi-attribute inputs. In comparison to existing single-attribute conditional generative models, our proposed model better reflects input attributes and enables smoother interpolation among attribute values. We conduct experiments on a histopathology dataset containing stained H&E images of urothelial carcinoma and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model via comprehensive quantitative and qualitative comparisons with state-of-the-art models as well as different variants of our model. Code is available at https://github.com/karenyyy/MICCAI2021AttributeGAN."
Multi-Fake Evolutionary Generative Adversarial Networks for Imbalance Hyperspectral Image Classification,"This paper presents a novel multi-fake evolutionary generative adversarial network(MFEGAN) for handling imbalance hyperspectral image classification. It is an end-to-end approach in which different generative objective losses are considered in the generator network to improve the classification performance of the discriminator network. Thus, the same discriminator network has been used as a standard classifier by embedding the classifier network on top of the discriminating function. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been validated through two hyperspectral spatial-spectral data sets. The same generative and discriminator architectures have been utilized with two different GAN objectives for a fair performance comparison with the proposed method. It is observed from the experimental validations that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with better classification performance."
Improving Visual Quality of Image Synthesis by A Token-based Generator with Transformers,"We present a new perspective of achieving image synthesis by viewing this task as a visual token generation problem. Different from existing paradigms that directly synthesize a full image from a single input (e.g., a latent code), the new formulation enables a flexible local manipulation for different image regions, which makes it possible to learn content-aware and fine-grained style control for image synthesis. Specifically, it takes as input a sequence of latent tokens to predict the visual tokens for synthesizing an image. Under this perspective, we propose a token-based generator (i.e.,TokenGAN). Particularly, the TokenGAN inputs two semantically different visual tokens, i.e., the learned constant content tokens and the style tokens from the latent space. Given a sequence of style tokens, the TokenGAN is able to control the image synthesis by assigning the styles to the content tokens by attention mechanism with a Transformer. We conduct extensive experiments and show that the proposed TokenGAN has achieved state-of-the-art results on several widely-used image synthesis benchmarks, including FFHQ and LSUN CHURCH with different resolutions. In particular, the generator is able to synthesize high-fidelity images with 1024x1024 size, dispensing with convolutions entirely."
Generalized Radiograph Representation Learning via Cross-supervision between Images and Free-text Radiology Reports,"Pre-training lays the foundation for recent successes in radiograph analysis supported by deep learning. It learns transferable image representations by conducting large-scale fully-supervised or self-supervised learning on a source domain. However, supervised pre-training requires a complex and labor intensive two-stage human-assisted annotation process while self-supervised learning cannot compete with the supervised paradigm. To tackle these issues, we propose a cross-supervised methodology named REviewing FreE-text Reports for Supervision (REFERS), which acquires free supervision signals from original radiology reports accompanying the radiographs. The proposed approach employs a vision transformer and is designed to learn joint representations from multiple views within every patient study. REFERS outperforms its transfer learning and self-supervised learning counterparts on 4 well-known X-ray datasets under extremely limited supervision. Moreover, REFERS even surpasses methods based on a source domain of radiographs with human-assisted structured labels. Thus REFERS has the potential to replace canonical pre-training methodologies."
A Deep Learning Generative Model Approach for Image Synthesis of Plant Leaves,"Objectives. We generate via advanced Deep Learning (DL) techniques artificial leaf images in an automatized way. We aim to dispose of a source of training samples for AI applications for modern crop management. Such applications require large amounts of data and, while leaf images are not truly scarce, image collection and annotation remains a very time--consuming process. Data scarcity can be addressed by augmentation techniques consisting in simple transformations of samples belonging to a small dataset, but the richness of the augmented data is limited: this motivates the search for alternative approaches. Methods. Pursuing an approach based on DL generative models, we propose a Leaf-to-Leaf Translation (L2L) procedure structured in two steps: first, a residual variational autoencoder architecture generates synthetic leaf skeletons (leaf profile and veins) starting from companions binarized skeletons of real images. In a second step, we perform translation via a Pix2pix framework, which uses conditional generator adversarial networks to reproduce the colorization of leaf blades, preserving the shape and the venation pattern. Results. The L2L procedure generates synthetic images of leaves with a realistic appearance. We address the performance measurement both in a qualitative and a quantitative way; for this latter evaluation, we employ a DL anomaly detection strategy which quantifies the degree of anomaly of synthetic leaves with respect to real samples. Conclusions. Generative DL approaches have the potential to be a new paradigm to provide low-cost meaningful synthetic samples for computer-aided applications. The present L2L approach represents a step towards this goal, being able to generate synthetic samples with a relevant qualitative and quantitative resemblance to real leaves."
3-D PET Image Generation with tumour masks using TGAN,"Training computer-vision related algorithms on medical images for disease diagnosis or image segmentation is difficult due to the lack of training data, labeled samples, and privacy concerns. For this reason, a robust generative method to create synthetic data is highly sought after. However, most three-dimensional image generators require additional image input or are extremely memory intensive. To address these issues we propose adapting video generation techniques for 3-D image generation. Using the temporal GAN (TGAN) architecture, we show we are able to generate realistic head and neck PET images. We also show that by conditioning the generator on tumour masks, we are able to control the geometry and location of the tumour in the generated images. To test the utility of the synthetic images, we train a segmentation model using the synthetic images. Synthetic images conditioned on real tumour masks are automatically segmented, and the corresponding real images are also segmented. We evaluate the segmentations using the Dice score and find the segmentation algorithm performs similarly on both datasets (0.65 synthetic data, 0.70 real data). Various radionomic features are then calculated over the segmented tumour volumes for each data set. A comparison of the real and synthetic feature distributions show that seven of eight feature distributions had statistically insignificant differences (p>0.05). Correlation coefficients were also calculated between all radionomic features and it is shown that all of the strong statistical correlations in the real data set are preserved in the synthetic data set."
Realistic galaxy image simulation via score-based generative models,"We show that a Denoising Diffusion Probabalistic Model (DDPM), a class of score-based generative model, can be used to produce realistic mock images that mimic observations of galaxies. Our method is tested with Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) grz imaging of galaxies from the Photometry and Rotation curve OBservations from Extragalactic Surveys (PROBES) sample and galaxies selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Subjectively, the generated galaxies are highly realistic when compared with samples from the real dataset. We quantify the similarity by borrowing from the deep generative learning literature, using the `Fréchet Inception Distance' to test for subjective and morphological similarity. We also introduce the `Synthetic Galaxy Distance' metric to compare the emergent physical properties (such as total magnitude, colour and half light radius) of a ground truth parent and synthesised child dataset. We argue that the DDPM approach produces sharper and more realistic images than other generative methods such as Adversarial Networks (with the downside of more costly inference), and could be used to produce large samples of synthetic observations tailored to a specific imaging survey. We demonstrate two potential uses of the DDPM: (1) accurate in-painting of occluded data, such as satellite trails, and (2) domain transfer, where new input images can be processed to mimic the properties of the DDPM training set. Here we `DESI-fy' cartoon images as a proof of concept for domain transfer. Finally, we suggest potential applications for score-based approaches that could motivate further research on this topic within the astronomical community."
Explainable Medical Image Segmentation via Generative Adversarial Networks and Layer-wise Relevance Propagation,"This paper contributes to automating medical image segmentation by proposing generative adversarial network-based models to segment both polyps and instruments in endoscopy images. A major contribution of this work is to provide explanations for the predictions using a layer-wise relevance propagation approach designating which input image pixels are relevant to the predictions and to what extent. On the polyp segmentation task, the models achieved 0.84 of accuracy and 0.46 on Jaccard index. On the instrument segmentation task, the models achieved 0.96 of accuracy and 0.70 on Jaccard index. The code is available at https://github.com/Awadelrahman/MedAI."
Generative Occupancy Fields for 3D Surface-Aware Image Synthesis,"The advent of generative radiance fields has significantly promoted the development of 3D-aware image synthesis. The cumulative rendering process in radiance fields makes training these generative models much easier since gradients are distributed over the entire volume, but leads to diffused object surfaces. In the meantime, compared to radiance fields occupancy representations could inherently ensure deterministic surfaces. However, if we directly apply occupancy representations to generative models, during training they will only receive sparse gradients located on object surfaces and eventually suffer from the convergence problem. In this paper, we propose Generative Occupancy Fields (GOF), a novel model based on generative radiance fields that can learn compact object surfaces without impeding its training convergence. The key insight of GOF is a dedicated transition from the cumulative rendering in radiance fields to rendering with only the surface points as the learned surface gets more and more accurate. In this way, GOF combines the merits of two representations in a unified framework. In practice, the training-time transition of start from radiance fields and march to occupancy representations is achieved in GOF by gradually shrinking the sampling region in its rendering process from the entire volume to a minimal neighboring region around the surface. Through comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets, we demonstrate that GOF can synthesize high-quality images with 3D consistency and simultaneously learn compact and smooth object surfaces. Code, models, and demo videos are available at https://sheldontsui.github.io/projects/GOF"
SVBRDF Recovery From a Single Image With Highlights using a Pretrained Generative Adversarial Network,"Spatially-varying bi-directional reflectance distribution functions (SVBRDFs) are crucial for designers to incorporate new materials in virtual scenes, making them look more realistic. Reconstruction of SVBRDFs is a long-standing problem. Existing methods either rely on extensive acquisition system or require huge datasets which are nontrivial to acquire. We aim to recover SVBRDFs from a single image, without any datasets. A single image contains incomplete information about the SVBRDF, making the reconstruction task highly ill-posed. It is also difficult to separate between the changes in color that are caused by the material and those caused by the illumination, without the prior knowledge learned from the dataset. In this paper, we use an unsupervised generative adversarial neural network (GAN) to recover SVBRDFs maps with a single image as input. To better separate the effects due to illumination from the effects due to the material, we add the hypothesis that the material is stationary and introduce a new loss function based on Fourier coefficients to enforce this stationarity. For efficiency, we train the network in two stages: reusing a trained model to initialize the SVBRDFs and fine-tune it based on the input image. Our method generates high-quality SVBRDFs maps from a single input photograph, and provides more vivid rendering results compared to previous work. The two-stage training boosts runtime performance, making it 8 times faster than previous work."
A Shading-Guided Generative Implicit Model for Shape-Accurate 3D-Aware Image Synthesis,"The advancement of generative radiance fields has pushed the boundary of 3D-aware image synthesis. Motivated by the observation that a 3D object should look realistic from multiple viewpoints, these methods introduce a multi-view constraint as regularization to learn valid 3D radiance fields from 2D images. Despite the progress, they often fall short of capturing accurate 3D shapes due to the shape-color ambiguity, limiting their applicability in downstream tasks. In this work, we address this ambiguity by proposing a novel shading-guided generative implicit model that is able to learn a starkly improved shape representation. Our key insight is that an accurate 3D shape should also yield a realistic rendering under different lighting conditions. This multi-lighting constraint is realized by modeling illumination explicitly and performing shading with various lighting conditions. Gradients are derived by feeding the synthesized images to a discriminator. To compensate for the additional computational burden of calculating surface normals, we further devise an efficient volume rendering strategy via surface tracking, reducing the training and inference time by 24% and 48%, respectively. Our experiments on multiple datasets show that the proposed approach achieves photorealistic 3D-aware image synthesis while capturing accurate underlying 3D shapes. We demonstrate improved performance of our approach on 3D shape reconstruction against existing methods, and show its applicability on image relighting. Our code will be released at https://github.com/XingangPan/ShadeGAN."
Gradient Inversion with Generative Image Prior,"Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed learning framework, in which the local data never leaves clients devices to preserve privacy, and the server trains models on the data via accessing only the gradients of those local data. Without further privacy mechanisms such as differential privacy, this leaves the system vulnerable against an attacker who inverts those gradients to reveal clients sensitive data. However, a gradient is often insufficient to reconstruct the user data without any prior knowledge. By exploiting a generative model pretrained on the data distribution, we demonstrate that data privacy can be easily breached. Further, when such prior knowledge is unavailable, we investigate the possibility of learning the prior from a sequence of gradients seen in the process of FL training. We experimentally show that the prior in a form of generative model is learnable from iterative interactions in FL. Our findings strongly suggest that additional mechanisms are necessary to prevent privacy leakage in FL."
Counterfactual Explanation of Brain Activity Classifiers using Image-to-Image Transfer by Generative Adversarial Network,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) can accurately decode task-related information from brain activations. However, because of the nonlinearity of the DNN, the decisions made by DNNs are hardly interpretable. One of the promising approaches for explaining such a black-box system is counterfactual explanation. In this framework, the behavior of a black-box system is explained by comparing real data and realistic synthetic data that are specifically generated such that the black-box system outputs an unreal outcome. Here we introduce a novel generative DNN (counterfactual activation generator, CAG) that can provide counterfactual explanations for DNN-based classifiers of brain activations. Importantly, CAG can simultaneously handle image transformation among multiple classes associated with different behavioral tasks. Using CAG, we demonstrated counterfactual explanation of DNN-based classifiers that learned to discriminate brain activations of seven behavioral tasks. Furthermore, by iterative applications of CAG, we were able to enhance and extract subtle spatial brain activity patterns that affected the classifier's decisions. Together, these results demonstrate that the counterfactual explanation based on image-to-image transformation would be a promising approach to understand and extend the current application of DNNs in fMRI analyses."
From Image to Imuge: Immunized Image Generation,"We introduce Imuge, an image tamper resilient generative scheme for image self-recovery. The traditional manner of concealing image content within the image are inflexible and fragile to diverse digital attack, i.e. image cropping and JPEG compression. To address this issue, we jointly train a U-Net backboned encoder, a tamper localization network and a decoder for image recovery. Given an original image, the encoder produces a visually indistinguishable immunized image. At the recipient's side, the verifying network localizes the malicious modifications, and the original content can be approximately recovered by the decoder, despite the presence of the attacks. Several strategies are proposed to boost the training efficiency. We demonstrate that our method can recover the details of the tampered regions with a high quality despite the presence of various kinds of attacks. Comprehensive ablation studies are conducted to validate our network designs."
Generalized Multi-Task Learning from Substantially Unlabeled Multi-Source Medical Image Data,"Deep learning-based models, when trained in a fully-supervised manner, can be effective in performing complex image analysis tasks, although contingent upon the availability of large labeled datasets. Especially in the medical imaging domain, however, expert image annotation is expensive, time-consuming, and prone to variability. Semi-supervised learning from limited quantities of labeled data has shown promise as an alternative. Maximizing knowledge gains from copious unlabeled data benefits semi-supervised learning models. Moreover, learning multiple tasks within the same model further improves its generalizability. We propose MultiMix, a new multi-task learning model that jointly learns disease classification and anatomical segmentation in a semi-supervised manner, while preserving explainability through a novel saliency bridge between the two tasks. Our experiments with varying quantities of multi-source labeled data in the training sets confirm the effectiveness of MultiMix in the simultaneous classification of pneumonia and segmentation of the lungs in chest X-ray images. Moreover, both in-domain and cross-domain evaluations across these tasks further showcase the potential of our model to adapt to challenging generalization scenarios."
Bangla Image Caption Generation through CNN-Transformer based Encoder-Decoder Network,"Automatic Image Captioning is the never-ending effort of creating syntactically and validating the accuracy of textual descriptions of an image in natural language with context. The encoder-decoder structure used throughout existing Bengali Image Captioning (BIC) research utilized abstract image feature vectors as the encoder's input. We propose a novel transformer-based architecture with an attention mechanism with a pre-trained ResNet-101 model image encoder for feature extraction from images. Experiments demonstrate that the language decoder in our technique captures fine-grained information in the caption and, then paired with image features, produces accurate and diverse captions on the BanglaLekhaImageCaptions dataset. Our approach outperforms all existing Bengali Image Captioning work and sets a new benchmark by scoring 0.694 on BLEU-1, 0.630 on BLEU-2, 0.582 on BLEU-3, and 0.337 on METEOR."
MIGS: Meta Image Generation from Scene Graphs,"Generation of images from scene graphs is a promising direction towards explicit scene generation and manipulation. However, the images generated from the scene graphs lack quality, which in part comes due to high difficulty and diversity in the data. We propose MIGS (Meta Image Generation from Scene Graphs), a meta-learning based approach for few-shot image generation from graphs that enables adapting the model to different scenes and increases the image quality by training on diverse sets of tasks. By sampling the data in a task-driven fashion, we train the generator using meta-learning on different sets of tasks that are categorized based on the scene attributes. Our results show that using this meta-learning approach for the generation of images from scene graphs achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of image quality and capturing the semantic relationships in the scene.

A Deep Insight into Measuring Face Image Utility with General and Face-specific Image Quality Metrics,"Quality scores provide a measure to evaluate the utility of biometric samples for biometric recognition. Biometric recognition systems require high-quality samples to achieve optimal performance. This paper focuses on face images and the measurement of face image utility with general and face-specific image quality metrics. While face-specific metrics rely on features of aligned face images, general image quality metrics can be used on the global image and relate to human perceptions. In this paper, we analyze the gap between the general image quality metrics and the face image quality metrics. Our contribution lies in a thorough examination of how different the image quality assessment algorithms relate to the utility for the face recognition task. The results of image quality assessment algorithms are further compared with those of dedicated face image quality assessment algorithms. In total, 25 different quality metrics are evaluated on three face image databases, BioSecure, LFW, and VGGFace2 using three open-source face recognition solutions, SphereFace, ArcFace, and FaceNet. Our results reveal a clear correlation between learned image metrics to face image utility even without being specifically trained as a face utility measure. Individual handcrafted features lack general stability and perform significantly worse than general face-specific quality metrics. We additionally provide a visual insight into the image areas contributing to the quality score of a selected set of quality assessment methods."
A Domain Gap Aware Generative Adversarial Network for Multi-domain Image Translation,"Recent image-to-image translation models have shown great success in mapping local textures between two domains. Existing approaches rely on a cycle-consistency constraint that supervises the generators to learn an inverse mapping. However, learning the inverse mapping introduces extra trainable parameters and it is unable to learn the inverse mapping for some domains. As a result, they are ineffective in the scenarios where (i) multiple visual image domains are involved; (ii) both structure and texture transformations are required; and (iii) semantic consistency is preserved. To solve these challenges, the paper proposes a unified model to translate images across multiple domains with significant domain gaps. Unlike previous models that constrain the generators with the ubiquitous cycle-consistency constraint to achieve the content similarity, the proposed model employs a perceptual self-regularization constraint. With a single unified generator, the model can maintain consistency over the global shapes as well as the local texture information across multiple domains. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance over state-of-the-art models. It is more effective in representing shape deformation in challenging mappings with significant dataset variation across multiple domains."
Fine-Grained Control of Artistic Styles in Image Generation,"Recent advances in generative models and adversarial training have enabled artificially generating artworks in various artistic styles. It is highly desirable to gain more control over the generated style in practice. However, artistic styles are unlike object categories -- there are a continuous spectrum of styles distinguished by subtle differences. Few works have been explored to capture the continuous spectrum of styles and apply it to a style generation task. In this paper, we propose to achieve this by embedding original artwork examples into a continuous style space. The style vectors are fed to the generator and discriminator to achieve fine-grained control. Our method can be used with common generative adversarial networks (such as StyleGAN). Experiments show that our method not only precisely controls the fine-grained artistic style but also improves image quality over vanilla StyleGAN as measured by FID."
Self-Supervised Object Detection via Generative Image Synthesis,"We present SSOD, the first end-to-end analysis-by synthesis framework with controllable GANs for the task of self-supervised object detection. We use collections of real world images without bounding box annotations to learn to synthesize and detect objects. We leverage controllable GANs to synthesize images with pre-defined object properties and use them to train object detectors. We propose a tight end-to-end coupling of the synthesis and detection networks to optimally train our system. Finally, we also propose a method to optimally adapt SSOD to an intended target data without requiring labels for it. For the task of car detection, on the challenging KITTI and Cityscapes datasets, we show that SSOD outperforms the prior state-of-the-art purely image-based self-supervised object detection method Wetectron. Even without requiring any 3D CAD assets, it also surpasses the state-of-the-art rendering based method Meta-Sim2. Our work advances the field of self-supervised object detection by introducing a successful new paradigm of using controllable GAN-based image synthesis for it and by significantly improving the baseline accuracy of the task. We open-source our code at https://github.com/NVlabs/SSOD."
A Picture is Worth a Thousand Words: A Unified System for Diverse Captions and Rich Images Generation,"A creative image-and-text generative AI system mimics humans' extraordinary abilities to provide users with diverse and comprehensive caption suggestions, as well as rich image creations. In this work, we demonstrate such an AI creation system to produce both diverse captions and rich images. When users imagine an image and associate it with multiple captions, our system paints a rich image to reflect all captions faithfully. Likewise, when users upload an image, our system depicts it with multiple diverse captions. We propose a unified multi-modal framework to achieve this goal. Specifically, our framework jointly models image-and-text representations with a Transformer network, which supports rich image creation by accepting multiple captions as input. We consider the relations among input captions to encourage diversity in training and adopt a non-autoregressive decoding strategy to enable real-time inference. Based on these, our system supports both diverse captions and rich images generations. Our code is available online."
Unifying Multimodal Transformer for Bi-directional Image and Text Generation,"We study the joint learning of image-to-text and text-to-image generations, which are naturally bi-directional tasks. Typical existing works design two separate task-specific models for each task, which impose expensive design efforts. In this work, we propose a unified image-and-text generative framework based on a single multimodal model to jointly study the bi-directional tasks. We adopt Transformer as our unified architecture for its strong performance and task-agnostic design. Specifically, we formulate both tasks as sequence generation tasks, where we represent images and text as unified sequences of tokens, and the Transformer learns multimodal interactions to generate sequences. We further propose two-level granularity feature representations and sequence-level training to improve the Transformer-based unified framework. Experiments show that our approach significantly improves previous Transformer-based model X-LXMERT's FID from 37.0 to 29.9 (lower is better) for text-to-image generation, and improves CIDEr-D score from 100.9% to 122.6% for fine-tuned image-to-text generation on the MS-COCO dataset. Our code is available online."
Distinguishing Natural and Computer-Generated Images using Multi-Colorspace fused EfficientNet,"The problem of distinguishing natural images from photo-realistic computer-generated ones either addresses natural images versus computer graphics or natural images versus GAN images, at a time. But in a real-world image forensic scenario, it is highly essential to consider all categories of image generation, since in most cases image generation is unknown. We, for the first time, to our best knowledge, approach the problem of distinguishing natural images from photo-realistic computer-generated images as a three-class classification task classifying natural, computer graphics, and GAN images. For the task, we propose a Multi-Colorspace fused EfficientNet model by parallelly fusing three EfficientNet networks that follow transfer learning methodology where each network operates in different colorspaces, RGB, LCH, and HSV, chosen after analyzing the efficacy of various colorspace transformations in this image forensics problem. Our model outperforms the baselines in terms of accuracy, robustness towards post-processing, and generalizability towards other datasets. We conduct psychophysics experiments to understand how accurately humans can distinguish natural, computer graphics, and GAN images where we could observe that humans find difficulty in classifying these images, particularly the computer-generated images, indicating the necessity of computational algorithms for the task. We also analyze the behavior of our model through visual explanations to understand salient regions that contribute to the model's decision making and compare with manual explanations provided by human participants in the form of region markings, where we could observe similarities in both the explanations indicating the powerful nature of our model to take the decisions meaningfully."
A Unified Framework for Generalized Low-Shot Medical Image Segmentation with Scarce Data,"Medical image segmentation has achieved remarkable advancements using deep neural networks (DNNs). However, DNNs often need big amounts of data and annotations for training, both of which can be difficult and costly to obtain. In this work, we propose a unified framework for generalized low-shot (one- and few-shot) medical image segmentation based on distance metric learning (DML). Unlike most existing methods which only deal with the lack of annotations while assuming abundance of data, our framework works with extreme scarcity of both, which is ideal for rare diseases. Via DML, the framework learns a multimodal mixture representation for each category, and performs dense predictions based on cosine distances between the pixels' deep embeddings and the category representations. The multimodal representations effectively utilize the inter-subject similarities and intraclass variations to overcome overfitting due to extremely limited data. In addition, we propose adaptive mixing coefficients for the multimodal mixture distributions to adaptively emphasize the modes better suited to the current input. The representations are implicitly embedded as weights of the fc layer, such that the cosine distances can be computed efficiently via forward propagation. In our experiments on brain MRI and abdominal CT datasets, the proposed framework achieves superior performances for low-shot segmentation towards standard DNN-based (3D U-Net) and classical registration-based (ANTs) methods, e.g., achieving mean Dice coefficients of 81%/69% for brain tissue/abdominal multiorgan segmentation using a single training sample, as compared to 52%/31% and 72%/35% by the U-Net and ANTs, respectively."
StyleNeRF: A Style-based 3D-Aware Generator for High-resolution Image Synthesis,"We propose StyleNeRF, a 3D-aware generative model for photo-realistic high-resolution image synthesis with high multi-view consistency, which can be trained on unstructured 2D images. Existing approaches either cannot synthesize high-resolution images with fine details or yield noticeable 3D-inconsistent artifacts. In addition, many of them lack control over style attributes and explicit 3D camera poses. StyleNeRF integrates the neural radiance field (NeRF) into a style-based generator to tackle the aforementioned challenges, i.e., improving rendering efficiency and 3D consistency for high-resolution image generation. We perform volume rendering only to produce a low-resolution feature map and progressively apply upsampling in 2D to address the first issue. To mitigate the inconsistencies caused by 2D upsampling, we propose multiple designs, including a better upsampler and a new regularization loss. With these designs, StyleNeRF can synthesize high-resolution images at interactive rates while preserving 3D consistency at high quality. StyleNeRF also enables control of camera poses and different levels of styles, which can generalize to unseen views. It also supports challenging tasks, including zoom-in and-out, style mixing, inversion, and semantic editing."
RGB-D Image Inpainting Using Generative Adversarial Network with a Late Fusion Approach,"Diminished reality is a technology that aims to remove objects from video images and fills in the missing region with plausible pixels. Most conventional methods utilize the different cameras that capture the same scene from different viewpoints to allow regions to be removed and restored. In this paper, we propose an RGB-D image inpainting method using generative adversarial network, which does not require multiple cameras. Recently, an RGB image inpainting method has achieved outstanding results by employing a generative adversarial network. However, RGB inpainting methods aim to restore only the texture of the missing region and, therefore, does not recover geometric information (i.e, 3D structure of the scene). We expand conventional image inpainting method to RGB-D image inpainting to jointly restore the texture and geometry of missing regions from a pair of RGB and depth images. Inspired by other tasks that use RGB and depth images (e.g., semantic segmentation and object detection), we propose late fusion approach that exploits the advantage of RGB and depth information each other. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of our proposed method."
Domain generalization in deep learning for contrast-enhanced imaging,"The domain generalization problem has been widely investigated in deep learning for non-contrast imaging over the last years, but it received limited attention for contrast-enhanced imaging. However, there are marked differences in contrast imaging protocols across clinical centers, in particular in the time between contrast injection and image acquisition, while access to multi-center contrast-enhanced image data is limited compared to available datasets for non-contrast imaging. This calls for new tools for generalizing single-domain, single-center deep learning models across new unseen domains and clinical centers in contrast-enhanced imaging. In this paper, we present an exhaustive evaluation of deep learning techniques to achieve generalizability to unseen clinical centers for contrast-enhanced image segmentation. To this end, several techniques are investigated, optimized and systematically evaluated, including data augmentation, domain mixing, transfer learning and domain adaptation. To demonstrate the potential of domain generalization for contrast-enhanced imaging, the methods are evaluated for ventricular segmentation in contrast-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The results are obtained based on a multi-center cardiac contrast-enhanced MRI dataset acquired in four hospitals located in three countries (France, Spain and China). They show that the combination of data augmentation and transfer learning can lead to single-center models that generalize well to new clinical centers not included during training. Single-domain neural networks enriched with suitable generalization procedures can reach and even surpass the performance of multi-center, multi-vendor models in contrast-enhanced imaging, hence eliminating the need for comprehensive multi-center datasets to train generalizable models."
UnfairGAN: An Enhanced Generative Adversarial Network for Raindrop Removal from A Single Image,"Image deraining is a new challenging problem in real-world applications, such as autonomous vehicles. In a bad weather condition of heavy rainfall, raindrops, mainly hitting glasses or windshields, can significantly reduce observation ability. Moreover, raindrops spreading over the glass can yield refraction's physical effect, which seriously impedes the sightline or undermine machine learning systems. In this paper, we propose an enhanced generative adversarial network to deal with the challenging problems of raindrops. UnfairGAN is an enhanced generative adversarial network that can utilize prior high-level information, such as edges and rain estimation, to boost deraining performance. To demonstrate UnfairGAN, we introduce a large dataset for training deep learning models of rain removal. The experimental results show that our proposed method is superior to other state-of-the-art approaches of deraining raindrops regarding quantitative metrics and visual quality."
Evaluating generative networks using Gaussian mixtures of image features,"We develop a measure for evaluating the performance of generative networks given two sets of images. A popular performance measure currently used to do this is the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID). FID assumes that images featurized using the penultimate layer of Inception-v3 follow a Gaussian distribution, an assumption which cannot be violated if we wish to use FID as a metric. However, we show that Inception-v3 features of the ImageNet dataset are not Gaussian; in particular, every single marginal is not Gaussian. To remedy this problem, we model the featurized images using Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and compute the 2-Wasserstein distance restricted to GMMs. We define a performance measure, which we call WaM, on two sets of images by using Inception-v3 (or another classifier) to featurize the images, estimate two GMMs, and use the restricted 2-Wasserstein distance to compare the GMMs. We experimentally show the advantages of WaM over FID, including how FID is more sensitive than WaM to imperceptible image perturbations. By modelling the non-Gaussian features obtained from Inception-v3 as GMMs and using a GMM metric, we can more accurately evaluate generative network performance."
Scale Invariant Domain Generalization Image Recapture Detection,"Recapturing and rebroadcasting of images are common attack methods in insurance frauds and face identification spoofing, and an increasing number of detection techniques were introduced to handle this problem. However, most of them ignored the domain generalization scenario and scale variances, with an inferior performance on domain shift situations, and normally were exacerbated by intra-domain and inter-domain scale variances. In this paper, we propose a scale alignment domain generalization framework (SADG) to address these challenges. First, an adversarial domain discriminator is exploited to minimize the discrepancies of image representation distributions among different domains. Meanwhile, we exploit triplet loss as a local constraint to achieve a clearer decision boundary. Moreover, a scale alignment loss is introduced as a global relationship regularization to force the image representations of the same class across different scales to be undistinguishable. Experimental results on four databases and comparison with state-of-the-art approaches show that better performance can be achieved using our framework."
SDA-GAN: Unsupervised Image Translation Using Spectral Domain Attention-Guided Generative Adversarial Network,"This work introduced a novel GAN architecture for unsupervised image translation on the task of face style transform. A spectral attention-based mechanism is embedded into the design along with spatial attention on the image contents. We proved that neural network has the potential of learning complex transformations such as Fourier transform, within considerable computational cost. The model is trained and tested in comparison to the baseline model, which only uses spatial attention. The performance improvement of our approach is significant especially when the source and target domain include different complexity (reduced FID to 49.18 from 142.84). In the translation process, a spectra filling effect was introduced due to the implementation of FFT and spectral attention. Another style transfer task and real-world object translation are also studied in this paper."
ClimateGAN: Raising Climate Change Awareness by Generating Images of Floods,"Climate change is a major threat to humanity, and the actions required to prevent its catastrophic consequences include changes in both policy-making and individual behaviour. However, taking action requires understanding the effects of climate change, even though they may seem abstract and distant. Projecting the potential consequences of extreme climate events such as flooding in familiar places can help make the abstract impacts of climate change more concrete and encourage action. As part of a larger initiative to build a website that projects extreme climate events onto user-chosen photos, we present our solution to simulate photo-realistic floods on authentic images. To address this complex task in the absence of suitable training data, we propose ClimateGAN, a model that leverages both simulated and real data for unsupervised domain adaptation and conditional image generation. In this paper, we describe the details of our framework, thoroughly evaluate components of our architecture and demonstrate that our model is capable of robustly generating photo-realistic flooding."
Seed Classification using Synthetic Image Datasets Generated from Low-Altitude UAV Imagery,"Plant breeding programs extensively monitor the evolution of seed kernels for seed certification, wherein lies the need to appropriately label the seed kernels by type and quality. However, the breeding environments are large where the monitoring of seed kernels can be challenging due to the minuscule size of seed kernels. The use of unmanned aerial vehicles aids in seed monitoring and labeling since they can capture images at low altitudes whilst being able to access even the remotest areas in the environment. A key bottleneck in the labeling of seeds using UAV imagery is drone altitude i.e. the classification accuracy decreases as the altitude increases due to lower image detail. Convolutional neural networks are a great tool for multi-class image classification when there is a training dataset that closely represents the different scenarios that the network might encounter during evaluation. The article addresses the challenge of training data creation using Domain Randomization wherein synthetic image datasets are generated from a meager sample of seeds captured by the bottom camera of an autonomously driven Parrot AR Drone 2.0. Besides, the article proposes a seed classification framework as a proof-of-concept using the convolutional neural networks of Microsoft's ResNet-100, Oxford's VGG-16, and VGG-19. To enhance the classification accuracy of the framework, an ensemble model is developed resulting in an overall accuracy of 94.6%."
Self-Supervised Generative Style Transfer for One-Shot Medical Image Segmentation,"In medical image segmentation, supervised deep networks' success comes at the cost of requiring abundant labeled data. While asking domain experts to annotate only one or a few of the cohort's images is feasible, annotating all available images is impractical. This issue is further exacerbated when pre-trained deep networks are exposed to a new image dataset from an unfamiliar distribution. Using available open-source data for ad-hoc transfer learning or hand-tuned techniques for data augmentation only provides suboptimal solutions. Motivated by atlas-based segmentation, we propose a novel volumetric self-supervised learning for data augmentation capable of synthesizing volumetric image-segmentation pairs via learning transformations from a single labeled atlas to the unlabeled data. Our work's central tenet benefits from a combined view of one-shot generative learning and the proposed self-supervised training strategy that cluster unlabeled volumetric images with similar styles together. Unlike previous methods, our method does not require input volumes at inference time to synthesize new images. Instead, it can generate diversified volumetric image-segmentation pairs from a prior distribution given a single or multi-site dataset. Augmented data generated by our method used to train the segmentation network provide significant improvements over state-of-the-art deep one-shot learning methods on the task of brain MRI segmentation. Ablation studies further exemplified that the proposed appearance model and joint training are crucial to synthesize realistic examples compared to existing medical registration methods. The code, data, and models are available at https://github.com/devavratTomar/SST."
Generative Memory-Guided Semantic Reasoning Model for Image Inpainting,"Most existing methods for image inpainting focus on learning the intra-image priors from the known regions of the current input image to infer the content of the corrupted regions in the same image. While such methods perform well on images with small corrupted regions, it is challenging for these methods to deal with images with large corrupted area due to two potential limitations: 1) such methods tend to overfit each single training pair of images relying solely on the intra-image prior knowledge learned from the limited known area; 2) the inter-image prior knowledge about the general distribution patterns of visual semantics, which can be transferred across images sharing similar semantics, is not exploited. In this paper, we propose the Generative Memory-Guided Semantic Reasoning Model (GM-SRM), which not only learns the intra-image priors from the known regions, but also distills the inter-image reasoning priors to infer the content of the corrupted regions. In particular, the proposed GM-SRM first pre-learns a generative memory from the whole training data to capture the semantic distribution patterns in a global view. Then the learned memory are leveraged to retrieve the matching inter-image priors for the current corrupted image to perform semantic reasoning during image inpainting. While the intra-image priors are used for guaranteeing the pixel-level content consistency, the inter-image priors are favorable for performing high-level semantic reasoning, which is particularly effective for inferring semantic content for large corrupted area. Extensive experiments on Paris Street View, CelebA-HQ, and Places2 benchmarks demonstrate that our GM-SRM outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for image inpainting in terms of both the visual quality and quantitative metrics."
Generative Probabilistic Image Colorization,"We propose Generative Probabilistic Image Colorization, a diffusion-based generative process that trains a sequence of probabilistic models to reverse each step of noise corruption. Given a line-drawing image as input, our method suggests multiple candidate colorized images. Therefore, our method accounts for the ill-posed nature of the colorization problem. We conducted comprehensive experiments investigating the colorization of line-drawing images, report the influence of a score-based MCMC approach that corrects the marginal distribution of estimated samples, and further compare different combinations of models and the similarity of their generated images. Despite using only a relatively small training dataset, we experimentally develop a method to generate multiple diverse colorization candidates which avoids mode collapse and does not require any additional constraints, losses, or re-training with alternative training conditions. Our proposed approach performed well not only on color-conditional image generation tasks using biased initial values, but also on some practical image completion and inpainting tasks."
WEDGE: Web-Image Assisted Domain Generalization for Semantic Segmentation,"Domain generalization for semantic segmentation is highly demanded in real applications, where a trained model is expected to work well in previously unseen domains. One challenge lies in the lack of data which could cover the diverse distributions of the possible unseen domains for training. In this paper, we propose a WEb-image assisted Domain GEneralization (WEDGE) scheme, which is the first to exploit the diversity of web-crawled images for generalizable semantic segmentation. To explore and exploit the real-world data distributions, we collect web-crawled images which present large diversity in terms of weather conditions, sites, lighting, camera styles, etc. We also present a method which injects styles of the web-crawled images into training images on-the-fly during training, which enables the network to experience images of diverse styles with reliable labels for effective training. Moreover, we use the web-crawled images with their predicted pseudo labels for training to further enhance the capability of the network. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method clearly outperforms existing domain generalization techniques."
Audio-to-Image Cross-Modal Generation,"Cross-modal representation learning allows to integrate information from different modalities into one representation. At the same time, research on generative models tends to focus on the visual domain with less emphasis on other domains, such as audio or text, potentially missing the benefits of shared representations. Studies successfully linking more than one modality in the generative setting are rare. In this context, we verify the possibility to train variational autoencoders (VAEs) to reconstruct image archetypes from audio data. Specifically, we consider VAEs in an adversarial training framework in order to ensure more variability in the generated data and find that there is a trade-off between the consistency and diversity of the generated images - this trade-off can be governed by scaling the reconstruction loss up or down, respectively. Our results further suggest that even in the case when the generated images are relatively inconsistent (diverse), features that are critical for proper image classification are preserved."
Text-based Person Search in Full Images via Semantic-Driven Proposal Generation,"Finding target persons in full scene images with a query of text description has important practical applications in intelligent video surveillance.However, different from the real-world scenarios where the bounding boxes are not available, existing text-based person retrieval methods mainly focus on the cross modal matching between the query text descriptions and the gallery of cropped pedestrian images. To close the gap, we study the problem of text-based person search in full images by proposing a new end-to-end learning framework which jointly optimize the pedestrian detection, identification and visual-semantic feature embedding tasks. To take full advantage of the query text, the semantic features are leveraged to instruct the Region Proposal Network to pay more attention to the text-described proposals. Besides, a cross-scale visual-semantic embedding mechanism is utilized to improve the performance. To validate the proposed method, we collect and annotate two large-scale benchmark datasets based on the widely adopted image-based person search datasets CUHK-SYSU and PRW. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on the two datasets and compared with the baseline methods, our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance."
Fine-Grained Image Generation from Bangla Text Description using Attentional Generative Adversarial Network,"Generating fine-grained, realistic images from text has many applications in the visual and semantic realm. Considering that, we propose Bangla Attentional Generative Adversarial Network (AttnGAN) that allows intensified, multi-stage processing for high-resolution Bangla text-to-image generation. Our model can integrate the most specific details at different sub-regions of the image. We distinctively concentrate on the relevant words in the natural language description. This framework has achieved a better inception score on the CUB dataset. For the first time, a fine-grained image is generated from Bangla text using attentional GAN. Bangla has achieved 7th position among 100 most spoken languages. This inspires us to explicitly focus on this language, which will ensure the inevitable need of many people. Moreover, Bangla has a more complex syntactic structure and less natural language processing resource that validates our work more."
Improving Tuberculosis (TB) Prediction using Synthetically Generated Computed Tomography (CT) Images,"The evaluation of infectious disease processes on radiologic images is an important and challenging task in medical image analysis. Pulmonary infections can often be best imaged and evaluated through computed tomography (CT) scans, which are often not available in low-resource environments and difficult to obtain for critically ill patients. On the other hand, X-ray, a different type of imaging procedure, is inexpensive, often available at the bedside and more widely available, but offers a simpler, two dimensional image. We show that by relying on a model that learns to generate CT images from X-rays synthetically, we can improve the automatic disease classification accuracy and provide clinicians with a different look at the pulmonary disease process. Specifically, we investigate Tuberculosis (TB), a deadly bacterial infectious disease that predominantly affects the lungs, but also other organ systems. We show that relying on synthetically generated CT improves TB identification by 7.50% and distinguishes TB properties up to 12.16% better than the X-ray baseline."
Revisit Geophysical Imaging in A New View of Physics-informed Generative Adversarial Learning,"Seismic full waveform inversion (FWI) is a powerful geophysical imaging technique that produces high-resolution subsurface models by iteratively minimizing the misfit between the simulated and observed seismograms. Unfortunately, conventional FWI with least-squares function suffers from many drawbacks such as the local-minima problem and computation of explicit gradient. It is particularly challenging with the contaminated measurements or poor starting models. Recent works relying on partial differential equations and neural networks show promising performance for two-dimensional FWI. Inspired by the competitive learning of generative adversarial networks, we proposed an unsupervised learning paradigm that integrates wave equation with a discriminate network to accurately estimate the physically consistent models in a distribution sense. Our framework needs no labelled training data nor pretraining of the network, is flexible to achieve multi-parameters inversion with minimal user interaction. The proposed method faithfully recovers the well-known synthetic models that outperforms the classical algorithms. Furthermore, our work paves the way to sidestep the local-minima issue via reducing the sensitivity to initial models and noise."
Scene Graph Generation for Better Image Captioning?,"We investigate the incorporation of visual relationships into the task of supervised image caption generation by proposing a model that leverages detected objects and auto-generated visual relationships to describe images in natural language. To do so, we first generate a scene graph from raw image pixels by identifying individual objects and visual relationships between them. This scene graph then serves as input to our graph-to-text model, which generates the final caption. In contrast to previous approaches, our model thus explicitly models the detection of objects and visual relationships in the image. For our experiments we construct a new dataset from the intersection of Visual Genome and MS COCO, consisting of images with both a corresponding gold scene graph and human-authored caption. Our results show that our methods outperform existing state-of-the-art end-to-end models that generate image descriptions directly from raw input pixels when compared in terms of the BLEU and METEOR evaluation metrics."
COVR: A test-bed for Visually Grounded Compositional Generalization with real images,"While interest in models that generalize at test time to new compositions has risen in recent years, benchmarks in the visually-grounded domain have thus far been restricted to synthetic images. In this work, we propose COVR, a new test-bed for visually-grounded compositional generalization with real images. To create COVR, we use real images annotated with scene graphs, and propose an almost fully automatic procedure for generating question-answer pairs along with a set of context images. COVR focuses on questions that require complex reasoning, including higher-order operations such as quantification and aggregation. Due to the automatic generation process, COVR facilitates the creation of compositional splits, where models at test time need to generalize to new concepts and compositions in a zero- or few-shot setting. We construct compositional splits using COVR and demonstrate a myriad of cases where state-of-the-art pre-trained language-and-vision models struggle to compositionally generalize."
Deep Anomaly Generation: An Image Translation Approach of Synthesizing Abnormal Banded Chromosome Images,"Advances in deep-learning-based pipelines have led to breakthroughs in a variety of microscopy image diagnostics. However, a sufficiently big training data set is usually difficult to obtain due to high annotation costs. In the case of banded chromosome images, the creation of big enough libraries is difficult for multiple pathologies due to the rarity of certain genetic disorders. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have proven to be effective in generating synthetic images and extending training data sets. In our work, we implement a conditional adversarial network that allows generation of realistic single chromosome images following user-defined banding patterns. To this end, an image-to-image translation approach based on self-generated 2D chromosome segmentation label maps is used. Our validation shows promising results when synthesizing chromosomes with seen as well as unseen banding patterns. We believe that this approach can be exploited for data augmentation of chromosome data sets with structural abnormalities. Therefore, the proposed method could help to tackle medical image analysis problems such as data simulation, segmentation, detection, or classification in the field of cytogenetics."
PIRenderer: Controllable Portrait Image Generation via Semantic Neural Rendering,"Generating portrait images by controlling the motions of existing faces is an important task of great consequence to social media industries. For easy use and intuitive control, semantically meaningful and fully disentangled parameters should be used as modifications. However, many existing techniques do not provide such fine-grained controls or use indirect editing methods i.e. mimic motions of other individuals. In this paper, a Portrait Image Neural Renderer (PIRenderer) is proposed to control the face motions with the parameters of three-dimensional morphable face models (3DMMs). The proposed model can generate photo-realistic portrait images with accurate movements according to intuitive modifications. Experiments on both direct and indirect editing tasks demonstrate the superiority of this model. Meanwhile, we further extend this model to tackle the audio-driven facial reenactment task by extracting sequential motions from audio inputs. We show that our model can generate coherent videos with convincing movements from only a single reference image and a driving audio stream. Our source code is available at https://github.com/RenYurui/PIRender."
Design Guidelines for Prompt Engineering Text-to-Image Generative Models,"Text-to-image generative models are a new and powerful way to generate visual artwork. The free-form nature of text as interaction is double-edged; while users have access to an infinite range of generations, they also must engage in brute-force trial and error with the text prompt when the result quality is poor. We conduct a study exploring what prompt components and model parameters can help produce coherent outputs. In particular, we study prompts structured to include subject and style and investigate success and failure modes within these dimensions. Our evaluation of 5493 generations over the course of five experiments spans 49 abstract and concrete subjects as well as 51 abstract and figurative styles. From this evaluation, we present design guidelines that can help people find better outcomes from text-to-image generative models."
Generatively Augmented Neural Network Watchdog for Image Classification Networks,"The identification of out-of-distribution data is vital to the deployment of classification networks. For example, a generic neural network that has been trained to differentiate between images of dogs and cats can only classify an input as either a dog or a cat. If a picture of a car or a kumquat were to be supplied to this classifier, the result would still be either a dog or a cat. In order to mitigate this, techniques such as the neural network watchdog have been developed. The compression of the image input into the latent layer of the autoencoder defines the region of in-distribution in the image space. This in-distribution set of input data has a corresponding boundary in the image space. The watchdog assesses whether inputs are in inside or outside this boundary. This paper demonstrates how to sharpen this boundary using generative network training data augmentation thereby bettering the discrimination and overall performance of the watchdog."
The State of the Art when using GPUs in Devising Image Generation Methods Using Deep Learning,"Deep learning is a technique for machine learning using multi-layer neural networks. It has been used for image synthesis and image recognition, but in recent years, it has also been used for various social detection and social labeling. In this analysis, we compared (1) the number of Iterations per minute between the GPU and CPU when using the VGG model and the NIN model, and (2) the number of Iterations per minute by the number of pixels when using the VGG model, using an image with 128 pixels. When the number of pixels was 64 or 128, the processing time was almost the same when using the GPU, but when the number of pixels was changed to 256, the number of iterations per minute decreased and the processing time increased by about three times. In this case study, since the number of pixels becomes core dumping when the number of pixels is 512 or more, we can consider that we should consider improvement in the vector calculation part. If we aim to achieve 8K highly saturated computer graphics using neural networks, we will need to consider an environment that allows computation even when the size of the image becomes even more highly saturated and massive, and parallel computation when performing image recognition and tuning."
Domain Generalization for Medical Image Segmentation via Hierarchical Consistency Regularization,"Modern deep neural networks struggle to transfer knowledge and generalize across diverse domains when deployed to real-world applications. Currently, domain generalization (DG) is introduced to learn a universal representation from multiple domains to improve the network generalization ability on unseen domains. However, previous DG methods only focus on the data-level consistency scheme without considering the synergistic regularization among different consistency schemes. In this paper, we present a novel Hierarchical Consistency framework for Domain Generalization (HCDG) by integrating Extrinsic Consistency and Intrinsic Consistency synergistically. Particularly, for the Extrinsic Consistency, we leverage the knowledge across multiple source domains to enforce data-level consistency. To better enhance such consistency, we design a novel Amplitude Gaussian-mixing strategy into Fourier-based data augmentation called DomainUp. For the Intrinsic Consistency, we perform task-level consistency for the same instance under the dual-task scenario. We evaluate the proposed HCDG framework on two medical image segmentation tasks, i.e., optic cup/disc segmentation on fundus images and prostate MRI segmentation. Extensive experimental results manifest the effectiveness and versatility of our HCDG framework."
Domain and Content Adaptive Convolution based Multi-Source Domain Generalization for Medical Image Segmentation,"The domain gap caused mainly by variable medical image quality renders a major obstacle on the path between training a segmentation model in the lab and applying the trained model to unseen clinical data. To address this issue, domain generalization methods have been proposed, which however usually use static convolutions and are less flexible. In this paper, we propose a multi-source domain generalization model based on the domain and content adaptive convolution (DCAC) for the segmentation of medical images across different modalities. Specifically, we design the domain adaptive convolution (DAC) module and content adaptive convolution (CAC) module and incorporate both into an encoder-decoder backbone. In the DAC module, a dynamic convolutional head is conditioned on the predicted domain code of the input to make our model adapt to the unseen target domain. In the CAC module, a dynamic convolutional head is conditioned on the global image features to make our model adapt to the test image. We evaluated the DCAC model against the baseline and four state-of-the-art domain generalization methods on the prostate segmentation, COVID-19 lesion segmentation, and optic cup/optic disc segmentation tasks. Our results not only indicate that the proposed DCAC model outperforms all competing methods on each segmentation task but also demonstrate the effectiveness of the DAC and CAC modules. Code is available at \url{https://git.io/DCAC}."
COSMic: A Coherence-Aware Generation Metric for Image Descriptions,"Developers of text generation models rely on automated evaluation metrics as a stand-in for slow and expensive manual evaluations. However, image captioning metrics have struggled to give accurate learned estimates of the semantic and pragmatic success of output text. We address this weakness by introducing the first discourse-aware learned generation metric for evaluating image descriptions. Our approach is inspired by computational theories of discourse for capturing information goals using coherence. We present a dataset of image\unicode{x2013}description pairs annotated with coherence relations. We then train a coherence-aware metric on a subset of the Conceptual Captions dataset and measure its effectiveness\unicode{x2014}its ability to predict human ratings of output captions\unicode{x2014}on a test set composed of out-of-domain images. We demonstrate a higher Kendall Correlation Coefficient for our proposed metric with the human judgments for the results of a number of state-of-the-art coherence-aware caption generation models when compared to several other metrics including recently proposed learned metrics such as BLEURT and BERTScore."
Conditional Generation of Synthetic Geospatial Images from Pixel-level and Feature-level Inputs,"Training robust supervised deep learning models for many geospatial applications of computer vision is difficult due to dearth of class-balanced and diverse training data. Conversely, obtaining enough training data for many applications is financially prohibitive or may be infeasible, especially when the application involves modeling rare or extreme events. Synthetically generating data (and labels) using a generative model that can sample from a target distribution and exploit the multi-scale nature of images can be an inexpensive solution to address scarcity of labeled data. Towards this goal, we present a deep conditional generative model, called VAE-Info-cGAN, that combines a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with a conditional Information Maximizing Generative Adversarial Network (InfoGAN), for synthesizing semantically rich images simultaneously conditioned on a pixel-level condition (PLC) and a macroscopic feature-level condition (FLC). Dimensionally, the PLC can only vary in the channel dimension from the synthesized image and is meant to be a task-specific input. The FLC is modeled as an attribute vector in the latent space of the generated image which controls the contributions of various characteristic attributes germane to the target distribution. Experiments on a GPS trajectories dataset show that the proposed model can accurately generate various forms of spatiotemporal aggregates across different geographic locations while conditioned only on a raster representation of the road network. The primary intended application of the VAE-Info-cGAN is synthetic data (and label) generation for targeted data augmentation for computer vision-based modeling of problems relevant to geospatial analysis and remote sensing."
LAViTeR: Learning Aligned Visual and Textual Representations Assisted by Image and Caption Generation,"Pre-training visual and textual representations from large-scale image-text pairs is becoming a standard approach for many downstream vision-language tasks. The transformer-based models learn inter and intra-modal attention through a list of self-supervised learning tasks. This paper proposes LAViTeR, a novel architecture for visual and textual representation learning. The main module, Visual Textual Alignment (VTA) will be assisted by two auxiliary tasks, GAN-based image synthesis and Image Captioning. We also propose a new evaluation metric measuring the similarity between the learnt visual and textual embedding. The experimental results on two public datasets, CUB and MS-COCO, demonstrate superior visual and textual representation alignment in the joint feature embedding space"
IICNet: A Generic Framework for Reversible Image Conversion,"Reversible image conversion (RIC) aims to build a reversible transformation between specific visual content (e.g., short videos) and an embedding image, where the original content can be restored from the embedding when necessary. This work develops Invertible Image Conversion Net (IICNet) as a generic solution to various RIC tasks due to its strong capacity and task-independent design. Unlike previous encoder-decoder based methods, IICNet maintains a highly invertible structure based on invertible neural networks (INNs) to better preserve the information during conversion. We use a relation module and a channel squeeze layer to improve the INN nonlinearity to extract cross-image relations and the network flexibility, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that IICNet outperforms the specifically-designed methods on existing RIC tasks and can generalize well to various newly-explored tasks. With our generic IICNet, we no longer need to hand-engineer task-specific embedding networks for rapidly occurring visual content. Our source codes are available at: https://github.com/felixcheng97/IICNet."
On the Out-of-distribution Generalization of Probabilistic Image Modelling,"Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and lossless compression constitute two problems that can be solved by the training of probabilistic models on a first dataset with subsequent likelihood evaluation on a second dataset, where data distributions differ. By defining the generalization of probabilistic models in terms of likelihood we show that, in the case of image models, the OOD generalization ability is dominated by local features. This motivates our proposal of a Local Autoregressive model that exclusively models local image features towards improving OOD performance. We apply the proposed model to OOD detection tasks and achieve state-of-the-art unsupervised OOD detection performance without the introduction of additional data. Additionally, we employ our model to build a new lossless image compressor: NeLLoC (Neural Local Lossless Compressor) and report state-of-the-art compression rates and model size."
Image Compression with Recurrent Neural Network and Generalized Divisive Normalization,"Image compression is a method to remove spatial redundancy between adjacent pixels and reconstruct a high-quality image. In the past few years, deep learning has gained huge attention from the research community and produced promising image reconstruction results. Therefore, recent methods focused on developing deeper and more complex networks, which significantly increased network complexity. In this paper, two effective novel blocks are developed: analysis and synthesis block that employs the convolution layer and Generalized Divisive Normalization (GDN) in the variable-rate encoder and decoder side. Our network utilizes a pixel RNN approach for quantization. Furthermore, to improve the whole network, we encode a residual image using LSTM cells to reduce unnecessary information. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed variable-rate framework with novel blocks outperforms existing methods and standard image codecs, such as George's ~\cite{002} and JPEG in terms of image similarity. The project page along with code and models are available at https://khawar512.github.io/cvpr/"
A Privacy-Preserving Image Retrieval Scheme Using A Codebook Generated From Independent Plain-Image Dataset,"In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving image-retrieval scheme using a codebook generated by using a plain-image dataset. Encryption-then-compression (EtC) images, which were proposed for EtC systems, have been used in conventional privacy-preserving image-retrieval schemes, in which a codebook is generated from EtC images uploaded by image owners, and extended SIMPLE descriptors are then calculated as image descriptors by using the codebook. In contrast, in the proposed scheme, a codebook is generated from a dataset independent of uploaded images. The use of an independent dataset enables us not only to use a codebook that does not require recalculation but also to constantly provide a high retrieval accuracy. In an experiment, the proposed scheme is demonstrated to maintain a high retrieval performance, even if codebooks are generated from a plain image dataset independent of image owners' encrypted images."
How Reliable Are Out-of-Distribution Generalization Methods for Medical Image Segmentation?,"The recent achievements of Deep Learning rely on the test data being similar in distribution to the training data. In an ideal case, Deep Learning models would achieve Out-of-Distribution (OoD) Generalization, i.e. reliably make predictions on out-of-distribution data. Yet in practice, models usually fail to generalize well when facing a shift in distribution. Several methods were thereby designed to improve the robustness of the features learned by a model through Regularization- or Domain-Prediction-based schemes. Segmenting medical images such as MRIs of the hippocampus is essential for the diagnosis and treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. But these brain images often suffer from distribution shift due to the patient's age and various pathologies affecting the shape of the organ. In this work, we evaluate OoD Generalization solutions for the problem of hippocampus segmentation in MR data using both fully- and semi-supervised training. We find that no method performs reliably in all experiments. Only the V-REx loss stands out as it remains easy to tune, while it outperforms a standard U-Net in most cases."
Towards Fine-grained Image Classification with Generative Adversarial Networks and Facial Landmark Detection,"Fine-grained classification remains a challenging task because distinguishing categories needs learning complex and local differences. Diversity in the pose, scale, and position of objects in an image makes the problem even more difficult. Although the recent Vision Transformer models achieve high performance, they need an extensive volume of input data. To encounter this problem, we made the best use of GAN-based data augmentation to generate extra dataset instances. Oxford-IIIT Pets was our dataset of choice for this experiment. It consists of 37 breeds of cats and dogs with variations in scale, poses, and lighting, which intensifies the difficulty of the classification task. Furthermore, we enhanced the performance of the recent Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), StyleGAN2-ADA model to generate more realistic images while preventing overfitting to the training set. We did this by training a customized version of MobileNetV2 to predict animal facial landmarks; then, we cropped images accordingly. Lastly, we combined the synthetic images with the original dataset and compared our proposed method with standard GANs augmentation and no augmentation with different subsets of training data. We validated our work by evaluating the accuracy of fine-grained image classification on the recent Vision Transformer (ViT) Model."
InSeGAN: A Generative Approach to Segmenting Identical Instances in Depth Images,"In this paper, we present InSeGAN, an unsupervised 3D generative adversarial network (GAN) for segmenting (nearly) identical instances of rigid objects in depth images. Using an analysis-by-synthesis approach, we design a novel GAN architecture to synthesize a multiple-instance depth image with independent control over each instance. InSeGAN takes in a set of code vectors (e.g., random noise vectors), each encoding the 3D pose of an object that is represented by a learned implicit object template. The generator has two distinct modules. The first module, the instance feature generator, uses each encoded pose to transform the implicit template into a feature map representation of each object instance. The second module, the depth image renderer, aggregates all of the single-instance feature maps output by the first module and generates a multiple-instance depth image. A discriminator distinguishes the generated multiple-instance depth images from the distribution of true depth images. To use our model for instance segmentation, we propose an instance pose encoder that learns to take in a generated depth image and reproduce the pose code vectors for all of the object instances. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a new synthetic dataset, ""Insta-10"", consisting of 100,000 depth images, each with 5 instances of an object from one of 10 classes. Our experiments on Insta-10, as well as on real-world noisy depth images, show that InSeGAN achieves state-of-the-art performance, often outperforming prior methods by large margins."
StackGAN: Facial Image Generation Optimizations,"Current state-of-the-art photorealistic generators are computationally expensive, involve unstable training processes, and have real and synthetic distributions that are dissimilar in higher-dimensional spaces. To solve these issues, we propose a variant of the StackGAN architecture. The new architecture incorporates conditional generators to construct an image in many stages. In our model, we generate grayscale facial images in two different stages: noise to edges (stage one) and edges to grayscale (stage two). Our model is trained with the CelebA facial image dataset and achieved a Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) score of 73 for edge images and a score of 59 for grayscale images generated using the synthetic edge images. Although our model achieved subpar results in relation to state-of-the-art models, dropout layers could reduce the overfitting in our conditional mapping. Additionally, since most images can be broken down into important features, improvements to our model can generalize to other datasets. Therefore, our model can potentially serve as a superior alternative to traditional means of generating photorealistic images."
Layout-to-Image Translation with Double Pooling Generative Adversarial Networks,"In this paper, we address the task of layout-to-image translation, which aims to translate an input semantic layout to a realistic image. One open challenge widely observed in existing methods is the lack of effective semantic constraints during the image translation process, leading to models that cannot preserve the semantic information and ignore the semantic dependencies within the same object. To address this issue, we propose a novel Double Pooing GAN (DPGAN) for generating photo-realistic and semantically-consistent results from the input layout. We also propose a novel Double Pooling Module (DPM), which consists of the Square-shape Pooling Module (SPM) and the Rectangle-shape Pooling Module (RPM). Specifically, SPM aims to capture short-range semantic dependencies of the input layout with different spatial scales, while RPM aims to capture long-range semantic dependencies from both horizontal and vertical directions. We then effectively fuse both outputs of SPM and RPM to further enlarge the receptive field of our generator. Extensive experiments on five popular datasets show that the proposed DPGAN achieves better results than state-of-the-art methods. Finally, both SPM and SPM are general and can be seamlessly integrated into any GAN-based architectures to strengthen the feature representation. The code is available at https://github.com/Ha0Tang/DPGAN."
XCI-Sketch: Extraction of Color Information from Images for Generation of Colored Outlines and Sketches,Sketches are a medium to convey a visual scene from an individual's creative perspective. The addition of color substantially enhances the overall expressivity of a sketch. This paper proposes two methods to mimic human-drawn colored sketches by utilizing the Contour Drawing Dataset. Our first approach renders colored outline sketches by applying image processing techniques aided by k-means color clustering. The second method uses a generative adversarial network to develop a model that can generate colored sketches from previously unobserved images. We assess the results obtained through quantitative and qualitative evaluations.
Heredity-aware Child Face Image Generation with Latent Space Disentanglement,"Generative adversarial networks have been widely used in image synthesis in recent years and the quality of the generated image has been greatly improved. However, the flexibility to control and decouple facial attributes (e.g., eyes, nose, mouth) is still limited. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, called ChildGAN, to generate a child's image according to the images of parents with heredity prior. The main idea is to disentangle the latent space of a pre-trained generation model and precisely control the face attributes of child images with clear semantics. We use distances between face landmarks as pseudo labels to figure out the most influential semantic vectors of the corresponding face attributes by calculating the gradient of latent vectors to pseudo labels. Furthermore, we disentangle the semantic vectors by weighting irrelevant features and orthogonalizing them with Schmidt Orthogonalization. Finally, we fuse the latent vector of the parents by leveraging the disentangled semantic vectors under the guidance of biological genetic laws. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms the existing methods with encouraging results."
Next-generation perception system for automated defects detection in composite laminates via polarized computational imaging,"Finishing operations on large-scale composite components like wind turbine blades, including trimming and sanding, often require multiple workers and part repositioning. In the composites manufacturing industry, automation of such processes is challenging, as manufactured part geometry may be inconsistent and task completion is based on human judgment and experience. Implementing a mobile, collaborative robotic system capable of performing finishing tasks in dynamic and uncertain environments would improve quality and lower manufacturing costs. To complete the given tasks, the collaborative robotic team must properly understand the environment and detect irregularities in the manufactured parts. In this paper, we describe the initial implementation and demonstration of a polarized computational imaging system to identify defects in composite laminates. As the polarimetric images are highly relevant to the surface micro-geometry, they can be used to detect surface defects that are not visible in conventional color images. The proposed vision system successfully identifies defect types and surface characteristics (e.g., pinholes, voids, scratches, resin flash) for different glass fiber and carbon fiber laminates."
Exploring the Quality of GAN Generated Images for Person Re-Identification,"Recently, GAN based method has demonstrated strong effectiveness in generating augmentation data for person re-identification (ReID), on account of its ability to bridge the gap between domains and enrich the data variety in feature space. However, most of the ReID works pick all the GAN generated data as additional training samples or evaluate the quality of GAN generation at the entire data set level, ignoring the image-level essential feature of data in ReID task. In this paper, we analyze the in-depth characteristics of ReID sample and solve the problem of ""What makes a GAN-generated image good for ReID"". Specifically, we propose to examine each data sample with id-consistency and diversity constraints by mapping image onto different spaces. With a metric-based sampling method, we demonstrate that not every GAN-generated data is beneficial for augmentation. Models trained with data filtered by our quality evaluation outperform those trained with the full augmentation set by a large margin. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our method on both supervised ReID task and unsupervised domain adaptation ReID task."
Image Inpainting via Conditional Texture and Structure Dual Generation,"Deep generative approaches have recently made considerable progress in image inpainting by introducing structure priors. Due to the lack of proper interaction with image texture during structure reconstruction, however, current solutions are incompetent in handling the cases with large corruptions, and they generally suffer from distorted results. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stream network for image inpainting, which models the structure-constrained texture synthesis and texture-guided structure reconstruction in a coupled manner so that they better leverage each other for more plausible generation. Furthermore, to enhance the global consistency, a Bi-directional Gated Feature Fusion (Bi-GFF) module is designed to exchange and combine the structure and texture information and a Contextual Feature Aggregation (CFA) module is developed to refine the generated contents by region affinity learning and multi-scale feature aggregation. Qualitative and quantitative experiments on the CelebA, Paris StreetView and Places2 datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. Our code is available at https://github.com/Xiefan-Guo/CTSDG."
Indoor Scene Generation from a Collection of Semantic-Segmented Depth Images,"We present a method for creating 3D indoor scenes with a generative model learned from a collection of semantic-segmented depth images captured from different unknown scenes. Given a room with a specified size, our method automatically generates 3D objects in a room from a randomly sampled latent code. Different from existing methods that represent an indoor scene with the type, location, and other properties of objects in the room and learn the scene layout from a collection of complete 3D indoor scenes, our method models each indoor scene as a 3D semantic scene volume and learns a volumetric generative adversarial network (GAN) from a collection of 2.5D partial observations of 3D scenes. To this end, we apply a differentiable projection layer to project the generated 3D semantic scene volumes into semantic-segmented depth images and design a new multiple-view discriminator for learning the complete 3D scene volume from 2.5D semantic-segmented depth images. Compared to existing methods, our method not only efficiently reduces the workload of modeling and acquiring 3D scenes for training, but also produces better object shapes and their detailed layouts in the scene. We evaluate our method with different indoor scene datasets and demonstrate the advantages of our method. We also extend our method for generating 3D indoor scenes from semantic-segmented depth images inferred from RGB images of real scenes."
Dual Projection Generative Adversarial Networks for Conditional Image Generation,"Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) extend the standard unconditional GAN framework to learning joint data-label distributions from samples, and have been established as powerful generative models capable of generating high-fidelity imagery. A challenge of training such a model lies in properly infusing class information into its generator and discriminator. For the discriminator, class conditioning can be achieved by either (1) directly incorporating labels as input or (2) involving labels in an auxiliary classification loss. In this paper, we show that the former directly aligns the class-conditioned fake-and-real data distributions P(\text{image}|\text{class}) ({\em data matching}), while the latter aligns data-conditioned class distributions P(\text{class}|\text{image}) ({\em label matching}). Although class separability does not directly translate to sample quality and becomes a burden if classification itself is intrinsically difficult, the discriminator cannot provide useful guidance for the generator if features of distinct classes are mapped to the same point and thus become inseparable. Motivated by this intuition, we propose a Dual Projection GAN (P2GAN) model that learns to balance between {\em data matching} and {\em label matching}. We then propose an improved cGAN model with Auxiliary Classification that directly aligns the fake and real conditionals P(\text{class}|\text{image}) by minimizing their f-divergence. Experiments on a synthetic Mixture of Gaussian (MoG) dataset and a variety of real-world datasets including CIFAR100, ImageNet, and VGGFace2 demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed models."
CIGLI: Conditional Image Generation from Language & Image,"Multi-modal generation has been widely explored in recent years. Current research directions involve generating text based on an image or vice versa. In this paper, we propose a new task called CIGLI: Conditional Image Generation from Language and Image. Instead of generating an image based on text as in text-image generation, this task requires the generation of an image from a textual description and an image prompt. We designed a new dataset to ensure that the text description describes information from both images, and that solely analyzing the description is insufficient to generate an image. We then propose a novel language-image fusion model which improves the performance over two established baseline methods, as evaluated by quantitative (automatic) and qualitative (human) evaluations. The code and dataset is available at https://github.com/vincentlux/CIGLI."
Towards Vivid and Diverse Image Colorization with Generative Color Prior,"Colorization has attracted increasing interest in recent years. Classic reference-based methods usually rely on external color images for plausible results. A large image database or online search engine is inevitably required for retrieving such exemplars. Recent deep-learning-based methods could automatically colorize images at a low cost. However, unsatisfactory artifacts and incoherent colors are always accompanied. In this work, we propose GCP-Colorization that leverages the rich and diverse color priors encapsulated in a pretrained Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for automatic colorization. Specifically, we first ""retrieve"" matched features (similar to exemplars) via a GAN encoder and then incorporate these features into the colorization process with feature modulations. Thanks to the powerful generative color prior (GCP) and delicate designs, our GCP-Colorization could produce vivid colors with a single forward pass. Moreover, it is highly convenient to obtain diverse results by modifying GAN latent codes. GCP-Colorization also inherits the merit of interpretable controls of GANs and could attain controllable and smooth transitions by walking through GAN latent space. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate that GCP-Colorization achieves superior performance than previous works. Codes are available at https://github.com/ToTheBeginning/GCP-Colorization."
Generating Superpixels for High-resolution Images with Decoupled Patch Calibration,"Superpixel segmentation has recently seen important progress benefiting from the advances in differentiable deep learning. However, the very high-resolution superpixel segmentation still remains challenging due to the expensive memory and computation cost, making the current advanced superpixel networks fail to process. In this paper, we devise Patch Calibration Networks (PCNet), aiming to efficiently and accurately implement high-resolution superpixel segmentation. PCNet follows the principle of producing high-resolution output from low-resolution input for saving GPU memory and relieving computation cost. To recall the fine details destroyed by the down-sampling operation, we propose a novel Decoupled Patch Calibration (DPC) branch for collaboratively augment the main superpixel generation branch. In particular, DPC takes a local patch from the high-resolution images and dynamically generates a binary mask to impose the network to focus on region boundaries. By sharing the parameters of DPC and main branches, the fine-detailed knowledge learned from high-resolution patches will be transferred to help calibrate the destroyed information. To the best of our knowledge, we make the first attempt to consider the deep-learning-based superpixel generation for high-resolution cases. To facilitate this research, we build evaluation benchmarks from two public datasets and one new constructed one, covering a wide range of diversities from fine-grained human parts to cityscapes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our PCNet can not only perform favorably against the state-of-the-arts in the quantitative results but also improve the resolution upper bound from 3K to 5K on 1080Ti GPUs."
Image2Lego: Customized LEGO Set Generation from Images,"Although LEGO sets have entertained generations of children and adults, the challenge of designing customized builds matching the complexity of real-world or imagined scenes remains too great for the average enthusiast. In order to make this feat possible, we implement a system that generates a LEGO brick model from 2D images. We design a novel solution to this problem that uses an octree-structured autoencoder trained on 3D voxelized models to obtain a feasible latent representation for model reconstruction, and a separate network trained to predict this latent representation from 2D images. LEGO models are obtained by algorithmic conversion of the 3D voxelized model to bricks. We demonstrate first-of-its-kind conversion of photographs to 3D LEGO models. An octree architecture enables the flexibility to produce multiple resolutions to best fit a user's creative vision or design needs. In order to demonstrate the broad applicability of our system, we generate step-by-step building instructions and animations for LEGO models of objects and human faces. Finally, we test these automatically generated LEGO sets by constructing physical builds using real LEGO bricks."
Quality assessment of image matchers for DSM generation -- a comparative study based on UAV images,"Recently developed automatic dense image matching algorithms are now being implemented for DSM/DTM production, with their pixel-level surface generation capability offering the prospect of partially alleviating the need for manual and semi-automatic stereoscopic measurements. In this paper, five commercial/public software packages for 3D surface generation are evaluated, using 5cm GSD imagery recorded from a UAV. Generated surface models are assessed against point clouds generated from mobile LiDAR and manual stereoscopic measurements. The software packages considered are APS, MICMAC, SURE, Pix4UAV and an SGM implementation from DLR."
Unsupervised Image Generation with Infinite Generative Adversarial Networks,"Image generation has been heavily investigated in computer vision, where one core research challenge is to generate images from arbitrarily complex distributions with little supervision. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) as an implicit approach have achieved great successes in this direction and therefore been employed widely. However, GANs are known to suffer from issues such as mode collapse, non-structured latent space, being unable to compute likelihoods, etc. In this paper, we propose a new unsupervised non-parametric method named mixture of infinite conditional GANs or MIC-GANs, to tackle several GAN issues together, aiming for image generation with parsimonious prior knowledge. Through comprehensive evaluations across different datasets, we show that MIC-GANs are effective in structuring the latent space and avoiding mode collapse, and outperform state-of-the-art methods. MICGANs are adaptive, versatile, and robust. They offer a promising solution to several well-known GAN issues. Code available: github.com/yinghdb/MICGANs."
Orthogonal Jacobian Regularization for Unsupervised Disentanglement in Image Generation,"Unsupervised disentanglement learning is a crucial issue for understanding and exploiting deep generative models. Recently, SeFa tries to find latent disentangled directions by performing SVD on the first projection of a pre-trained GAN. However, it is only applied to the first layer and works in a post-processing way. Hessian Penalty minimizes the off-diagonal entries of the output's Hessian matrix to facilitate disentanglement, and can be applied to multi-layers.However, it constrains each entry of output independently, making it not sufficient in disentangling the latent directions (e.g., shape, size, rotation, etc.) of spatially correlated variations. In this paper, we propose a simple Orthogonal Jacobian Regularization (OroJaR) to encourage deep generative model to learn disentangled representations. It simply encourages the variation of output caused by perturbations on different latent dimensions to be orthogonal, and the Jacobian with respect to the input is calculated to represent this variation. We show that our OroJaR also encourages the output's Hessian matrix to be diagonal in an indirect manner. In contrast to the Hessian Penalty, our OroJaR constrains the output in a holistic way, making it very effective in disentangling latent dimensions corresponding to spatially correlated variations. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results show that our method is effective in disentangled and controllable image generation, and performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/csyxwei/OroJaR"
High-dimensional Assisted Generative Model for Color Image Restoration,"This work presents an unsupervised deep learning scheme that exploiting high-dimensional assisted score-based generative model for color image restoration tasks. Considering that the sample number and internal dimension in score-based generative model have key influence on estimating the gradients of data distribution, two different high-dimensional ways are proposed: The channel-copy transformation increases the sample number and the pixel-scale transformation decreases feasible space dimension. Subsequently, a set of high-dimensional tensors represented by these transformations are used to train the network through denoising score matching. Then, sampling is performed by annealing Langevin dynamics and alternative data-consistency update. Furthermore, to alleviate the difficulty of learning high-dimensional representation, a progressive strategy is proposed to leverage the performance. The proposed unsupervised learning and iterative restoration algo-rithm, which involves a pre-trained generative network to obtain prior, has transparent and clear interpretation compared to other data-driven approaches. Experimental results on demosaicking and inpainting conveyed the remarkable performance and diversity of our proposed method."
A Generative Adversarial Framework for Optimizing Image Matting and Harmonization Simultaneously,"Image matting and image harmonization are two important tasks in image composition. Image matting, aiming to achieve foreground boundary details, and image harmonization, aiming to make the background compatible with the foreground, are both promising yet challenging tasks. Previous works consider optimizing these two tasks separately, which may lead to a sub-optimal solution. We propose to optimize matting and harmonization simultaneously to get better performance on both the two tasks and achieve more natural results. We propose a new Generative Adversarial (GAN) framework which optimizing the matting network and the harmonization network based on a self-attention discriminator. The discriminator is required to distinguish the natural images from different types of fake synthesis images. Extensive experiments on our constructed dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our dataset and dataset generating pipeline can be found in \url{https://git.io/HaMaGAN}"
PixelSynth: Generating a 3D-Consistent Experience from a Single Image,"Recent advancements in differentiable rendering and 3D reasoning have driven exciting results in novel view synthesis from a single image. Despite realistic results, methods are limited to relatively small view change. In order to synthesize immersive scenes, models must also be able to extrapolate. We present an approach that fuses 3D reasoning with autoregressive modeling to outpaint large view changes in a 3D-consistent manner, enabling scene synthesis. We demonstrate considerable improvement in single image large-angle view synthesis results compared to a variety of methods and possible variants across simulated and real datasets. In addition, we show increased 3D consistency compared to alternative accumulation methods. Project website: https://crockwell.github.io/pixelsynth/"
MISS GAN: A Multi-IlluStrator Style Generative Adversarial Network for image to illustration translation,"Unsupervised style transfer that supports diverse input styles using only one trained generator is a challenging and interesting task in computer vision. This paper proposes a Multi-IlluStrator Style Generative Adversarial Network (MISS GAN) that is a multi-style framework for unsupervised image-to-illustration translation, which can generate styled yet content preserving images. The illustrations dataset is a challenging one since it is comprised of illustrations of seven different illustrators, hence contains diverse styles. Existing methods require to train several generators (as the number of illustrators) to handle the different illustrators' styles, which limits their practical usage, or require to train an image specific network, which ignores the style information provided in other images of the illustrator. MISS GAN is both input image specific and uses the information of other images using only one trained model."
An Image-based Generator Architecture for Synthetic Image Refinement,"Proposed are alternative generator architectures for Boundary Equilibrium Generative Adversarial Networks, motivated by Learning from Simulated and Unsupervised Images through Adversarial Training. It disentangles the need for a noise-based latent space. The generator will operate mainly as a refiner network to gain a photo-realistic presentation of the given synthetic images. It also attempts to resolve the latent space's poorly understood properties by eliminating the need for noise injection and replacing it with an image-based concept. The new flexible and simple generator architecture will also give the power to control the trade-off between restrictive refinement and expressiveness ability. Contrary to other available methods, this architecture will not require a paired or unpaired dataset of real and synthetic images for the training phase. Only a relatively small set of real images would suffice."
Interpreting Generative Adversarial Networks for Interactive Image Generation,"Significant progress has been made by the advances in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for image generation. However, there lacks enough understanding of how a realistic image is generated by the deep representations of GANs from a random vector. This chapter gives a summary of recent works on interpreting deep generative models. The methods are categorized into the supervised, the unsupervised, and the embedding-guided approaches. We will see how the human-understandable concepts that emerge in the learned representation can be identified and used for interactive image generation and editing."
Instance-wise Hard Negative Example Generation for Contrastive Learning in Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation,"Contrastive learning shows great potential in unpaired image-to-image translation, but sometimes the translated results are in poor quality and the contents are not preserved consistently. In this paper, we uncover that the negative examples play a critical role in the performance of contrastive learning for image translation. The negative examples in previous methods are randomly sampled from the patches of different positions in the source image, which are not effective to push the positive examples close to the query examples. To address this issue, we present instance-wise hard Negative Example Generation for Contrastive learning in Unpaired image-to-image Translation (NEGCUT). Specifically, we train a generator to produce negative examples online. The generator is novel from two perspectives: 1) it is instance-wise which means that the generated examples are based on the input image, and 2) it can generate hard negative examples since it is trained with an adversarial loss. With the generator, the performance of unpaired image-to-image translation is significantly improved. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed NEGCUT framework achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to previous methods."
TBNet:Two-Stream Boundary-aware Network for Generic Image Manipulation Localization,"Finding tampered regions in images is a hot research topic in machine learning and computer vision. Although many image manipulation location algorithms have been proposed, most of them only focus on the RGB images with different color spaces, and the frequency information that contains the potential tampering clues is often ignored. In this work, a novel end-to-end two-stream boundary-aware network (abbreviated as TBNet) is proposed for generic image manipulation localization in which the RGB stream, the frequency stream, and the boundary artifact location are explored in a unified framework. Specifically, we first design an adaptive frequency selection module (AFS) to adaptively select the appropriate frequency to mine inconsistent statistics and eliminate the interference of redundant statistics. Then, an adaptive cross-attention fusion module (ACF) is proposed to adaptively fuse the RGB feature and the frequency feature. Finally, the boundary artifact location network (BAL) is designed to locate the boundary artifacts for which the parameters are jointly updated by the outputs of the ACF, and its results are further fed into the decoder. Thus, the parameters of the RGB stream, the frequency stream, and the boundary artifact location network are jointly optimized, and their latent complementary relationships are fully mined. The results of extensive experiments performed on four public benchmarks of the image manipulation localization task, namely, CASIA1.0, COVER, Carvalho, and In-The-Wild, demonstrate that the proposed TBNet can significantly outperform state-of-the-art generic image manipulation localization methods in terms of both MCC and F1."
FA-GAN: Fused Attentive Generative Adversarial Networks for MRI Image Super-Resolution,"High-resolution magnetic resonance images can provide fine-grained anatomical information, but acquiring such data requires a long scanning time. In this paper, a framework called the Fused Attentive Generative Adversarial Networks(FA-GAN) is proposed to generate the super-resolution MR image from low-resolution magnetic resonance images, which can reduce the scanning time effectively but with high resolution MR images. In the framework of the FA-GAN, the local fusion feature block, consisting of different three-pass networks by using different convolution kernels, is proposed to extract image features at different scales. And the global feature fusion module, including the channel attention module, the self-attention module, and the fusion operation, is designed to enhance the important features of the MR image. Moreover, the spectral normalization process is introduced to make the discriminator network stable. 40 sets of 3D magnetic resonance images (each set of images contains 256 slices) are used to train the network, and 10 sets of images are used to test the proposed method. The experimental results show that the PSNR and SSIM values of the super-resolution magnetic resonance image generated by the proposed FA-GAN method are higher than the state-of-the-art reconstruction methods."
Towards to Robust and Generalized Medical Image Segmentation Framework,"Deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis is gradually deployed to review and analyze medical images. However, this paradigm is restricted in real-world clinical applications due to the poor robustness and generalization. The issue is more sinister with a lack of training data. In this paper, we address the challenge from the transfer learning point of view. Different from the common setting that transferring knowledge from the natural image domain to the medical image domain, we find the knowledge from the same domain further boosts the model robustness and generalization. Therefore, we propose a novel two-stage framework for robust generalized medical image segmentation. Firstly, an unsupervised tile-wise autoencoder pretraining architecture is proposed to learn local and global knowledge. Secondly, the downstream segmentation model coupled with an auxiliary reconstruction network is designed. The reconstruction branch encourages the model to capture more general semantic features. Experiments of lung segmentation on multi chest X-ray datasets are conducted. Comprehensive results demonstrate the superior robustness of the proposed framework to corruption and high generalization performance on unseen datasets, especially under the scenario of the limited training data."
BIGRoC: Boosting Image Generation via a Robust Classifier,"The interest of the machine learning community in image synthesis has grown significantly in recent years, with the introduction of a wide range of deep generative models and means for training them. In this work, we propose a general model-agnostic technique for improving the image quality and the distribution fidelity of generated images obtained by any generative model. Our method, termed BIGRoC (Boosting Image Generation via a Robust Classifier), is based on a post-processing procedure via the guidance of a given robust classifier and without a need for additional training of the generative model. Given a synthesized image, we propose to update it through projected gradient steps over the robust classifier to refine its recognition. We demonstrate this post-processing algorithm on various image synthesis methods and show a significant quantitative and qualitative improvement on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. Surprisingly, although BIGRoC is the first model agnostic among refinement approaches and requires much less information, it outperforms competitive methods. Specifically, BIGRoC improves the image synthesis best performing diffusion model on ImageNet 128x128 by 14.81%, attaining an FID score of 2.53, and on 256x256 by 7.87%, achieving an FID of 3.63. Moreover, we conduct an opinion survey, according to which humans significantly prefer our method's outputs."
Efficient and Generic Interactive Segmentation Framework to Correct Mispredictions during Clinical Evaluation of Medical Images,"Semantic segmentation of medical images is an essential first step in computer-aided diagnosis systems for many applications. However, given many disparate imaging modalities and inherent variations in the patient data, it is difficult to consistently achieve high accuracy using modern deep neural networks (DNNs). This has led researchers to propose interactive image segmentation techniques where a medical expert can interactively correct the output of a DNN to the desired accuracy. However, these techniques often need separate training data with the associated human interactions, and do not generalize to various diseases, and types of medical images. In this paper, we suggest a novel conditional inference technique for DNNs which takes the intervention by a medical expert as test time constraints and performs inference conditioned upon these constraints. Our technique is generic can be used for medical images from any modality. Unlike other methods, our approach can correct multiple structures simultaneously and add structures missed at initial segmentation. We report an improvement of 13.3, 12.5, 17.8, 10.2, and 12.4 times in user annotation time than full human annotation for the nucleus, multiple cells, liver and tumor, organ, and brain segmentation respectively. We report a time saving of 2.8, 3.0, 1.9, 4.4, and 8.6 fold compared to other interactive segmentation techniques. Our method can be useful to clinicians for diagnosis and post-surgical follow-up with minimal intervention from the medical expert. The source-code and the detailed results are available here [1]."
Semi- and Self-Supervised Multi-View Fusion of 3D Microscopy Images using Generative Adversarial Networks,"Recent developments in fluorescence microscopy allow capturing high-resolution 3D images over time for living model organisms. To be able to image even large specimens, techniques like multi-view light-sheet imaging record different orientations at each time point that can then be fused into a single high-quality volume. Based on measured point spread functions (PSF), deconvolution and content fusion are able to largely revert the inevitable degradation occurring during the imaging process. Classical multi-view deconvolution and fusion methods mainly use iterative procedures and content-based averaging. Lately, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been deployed to approach 3D single-view deconvolution microscopy, but the multi-view case waits to be studied. We investigated the efficacy of CNN-based multi-view deconvolution and fusion with two synthetic data sets that mimic developing embryos and involve either two or four complementary 3D views. Compared with classical state-of-the-art methods, the proposed semi- and self-supervised models achieve competitive and superior deconvolution and fusion quality in the two-view and quad-view cases, respectively."
A universal detector of CNN-generated images using properties of checkerboard artifacts in the frequency domain,"We propose a novel universal detector for detecting images generated by using CNNs. In this paper, properties of checkerboard artifacts in CNN-generated images are considered, and the spectrum of images is enhanced in accordance with the properties. Next, a classifier is trained by using the enhanced spectrums to judge a query image to be a CNN-generated ones or not. In addition, an ensemble of the proposed detector with emphasized spectrums and a conventional detector is proposed to improve the performance of these methods. In an experiment, the proposed ensemble is demonstrated to outperform a state-of-the-art method under some conditions."
Image Augmentation Using a Task Guided Generative Adversarial Network for Age Estimation on Brain MRI,"Brain age estimation based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an active research area in early diagnosis of some neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. Alzheimer, Parkinson, Huntington, etc.) for elderly people or brain underdevelopment for the young group. Deep learning methods have achieved the state-of-the-art performance in many medical image analysis tasks, including brain age estimation. However, the performance and generalisability of the deep learning model are highly dependent on the quantity and quality of the training data set. Both collecting and annotating brain MRI data are extremely time-consuming. In this paper, to overcome the data scarcity problem, we propose a generative adversarial network (GAN) based image synthesis method. Different from the existing GAN-based methods, we integrate a task-guided branch (a regression model for age estimation) to the end of the generator in GAN. By adding a task-guided loss to the conventional GAN loss, the learned low-dimensional latent space and the synthesised images are more task-specific. It helps to boost the performance of the down-stream task by combining the synthesised images and real images for model training. The proposed method was evaluated on a public brain MRI data set for age estimation. Our proposed method outperformed (statistically significant) a deep convolutional neural network based regression model and the GAN-based image synthesis method without the task-guided branch. More importantly, it enables the identification of age-related brain regions in the image space. The code is available on GitHub (https://github.com/ruizhe-l/tgb-gan)."
StyleGAN-NADA: CLIP-Guided Domain Adaptation of Image Generators,"Can a generative model be trained to produce images from a specific domain, guided by a text prompt only, without seeing any image? In other words: can an image generator be trained ""blindly""? Leveraging the semantic power of large scale Contrastive-Language-Image-Pre-training (CLIP) models, we present a text-driven method that allows shifting a generative model to new domains, without having to collect even a single image. We show that through natural language prompts and a few minutes of training, our method can adapt a generator across a multitude of domains characterized by diverse styles and shapes. Notably, many of these modifications would be difficult or outright impossible to reach with existing methods. We conduct an extensive set of experiments and comparisons across a wide range of domains. These demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and show that our shifted models maintain the latent-space properties that make generative models appealing for downstream tasks."
Feasibility Analysis of Fifth-generation (5G) Mobile Networks for Transmission of Medical Imaging Data,"Next to higher data rates and lower latency, the upcoming fifth-generation mobile network standard will introduce a new service ecosystem. Concepts such as multi-access edge computing or network slicing will enable tailoring service level requirements to specific use-cases. In medical imaging, researchers and clinicians are currently working towards higher portability of scanners. This includes i) small scanners to be wheeled inside the hospital to the bedside and ii) conventional scanners provided via trucks to remote areas. Both use-cases introduce the need for mobile networks adhering to high safety standards and providing high data rates. These requirements could be met by fifth-generation mobile networks. In this work, we analyze the feasibility of transferring medical imaging data using the current state of development of fifth-generation mobile networks (3GPP Release 15). We demonstrate the potential of reaching 100 Mbit/s upload rates using already available consumer-grade hardware. Furthermore, we show an effective average data throughput of 50 Mbit/s when transferring medical images using out-of-the-box open-source software based on the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) standard. During transmissions, we sample the radio frequency bands to analyse the characteristics of the mobile radio network. Additionally, we discuss the potential of new features such as network slicing that will be introduced in forthcoming releases."
CRD-CGAN: Category-Consistent and Relativistic Constraints for Diverse Text-to-Image Generation,"Generating photo-realistic images from a text description is a challenging problem in computer vision. Previous works have shown promising performance to generate synthetic images conditional on text by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). In this paper, we focus on the category-consistent and relativistic diverse constraints to optimize the diversity of synthetic images. Based on those constraints, a category-consistent and relativistic diverse conditional GAN (CRD-CGAN) is proposed to synthesize K photo-realistic images simultaneously. We use the attention loss and diversity loss to improve the sensitivity of the GAN to word attention and noises. Then, we employ the relativistic conditional loss to estimate the probability of relatively real or fake for synthetic images, which can improve the performance of basic conditional loss. Finally, we introduce a category-consistent loss to alleviate the over-category issues between K synthetic images. We evaluate our approach using the Birds-200-2011, Oxford-102 flower and MSCOCO 2014 datasets, and the extensive experiments demonstrate superiority of the proposed method in comparison with state-of-the-art methods in terms of photorealistic and diversity of the generated synthetic images."
Image Scene Graph Generation (SGG) Benchmark,"There is a surge of interest in image scene graph generation (object, attribute and relationship detection) due to the need of building fine-grained image understanding models that go beyond object detection. Due to the lack of a good benchmark, the reported results of different scene graph generation models are not directly comparable, impeding the research progress. We have developed a much-needed scene graph generation benchmark based on the maskrcnn-benchmark and several popular models. This paper presents main features of our benchmark and a comprehensive ablation study of scene graph generation models using the Visual Genome and OpenImages Visual relationship detection datasets. Our codebase is made publicly available at https://github.com/microsoft/scene_graph_benchmark."
Reconstructing Images of Two Adjacent Objects through Scattering Medium Using Generative Adversarial Network,"Reconstruction of image by using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has been vigorously studied in the last decade. Until now, there have being developed several techniques for imaging of a single object through scattering medium by using neural networks, however how to reconstruct images of more than one object simultaneously seems hard to realize. In this paper, we demonstrate an approach by using generative adversarial network (GAN) to reconstruct images of two adjacent objects through scattering media. We construct an imaging system for imaging of two adjacent objects behind the scattering media. In general, as the light field of two adjacent object images pass through the scattering slab, a speckle pattern is obtained. The designed adversarial network, which is called as YGAN, is employed to reconstruct the images simultaneously. It is shown that based on the trained YGAN, we can reconstruct images of two adjacent objects from one speckle pattern with high fidelity. In addition, we study the influence of the object image types, and the distance between the two adjacent objects on the fidelity of the reconstructed images. Moreover even if another scattering medium is inserted between the two objects, we can also reconstruct the images of two objects from a speckle with high quality. The technique presented in this work can be used for applications in areas of medical image analysis, such as medical image classification, segmentation, and studies of multi-object scattering imaging etc."
WaveFill: A Wavelet-based Generation Network for Image Inpainting,"Image inpainting aims to complete the missing or corrupted regions of images with realistic contents. The prevalent approaches adopt a hybrid objective of reconstruction and perceptual quality by using generative adversarial networks. However, the reconstruction loss and adversarial loss focus on synthesizing contents of different frequencies and simply applying them together often leads to inter-frequency conflicts and compromised inpainting. This paper presents WaveFill, a wavelet-based inpainting network that decomposes images into multiple frequency bands and fills the missing regions in each frequency band separately and explicitly. WaveFill decomposes images by using discrete wavelet transform (DWT) that preserves spatial information naturally. It applies L1 reconstruction loss to the decomposed low-frequency bands and adversarial loss to high-frequency bands, hence effectively mitigate inter-frequency conflicts while completing images in spatial domain. To address the inpainting inconsistency in different frequency bands and fuse features with distinct statistics, we design a novel normalization scheme that aligns and fuses the multi-frequency features effectively. Extensive experiments over multiple datasets show that WaveFill achieves superior image inpainting qualitatively and quantitatively."
Whole Heart Mesh Generation For Image-Based Computational Simulations By Learning Free-From Deformations,"Image-based computer simulation of cardiac function can be used to probe the mechanisms of (patho)physiology, and guide diagnosis and personalized treatment of cardiac diseases. This paradigm requires constructing simulation-ready meshes of cardiac structures from medical image data--a process that has traditionally required significant time and human effort, limiting large-cohort analyses and potential clinical translations. We propose a novel deep learning approach to reconstruct simulation-ready whole heart meshes from volumetric image data. Our approach learns to deform a template mesh to the input image data by predicting displacements of multi-resolution control point grids. We discuss the methods of this approach and demonstrate its application to efficiently create simulation-ready whole heart meshes for computational fluid dynamics simulations of the cardiac flow. Our source code is available at https://github.com/fkong7/HeartFFDNet."
3D-StyleGAN: A Style-Based Generative Adversarial Network for Generative Modeling of Three-Dimensional Medical Images,"Image synthesis via Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) of three-dimensional (3D) medical images has great potential that can be extended to many medical applications, such as, image enhancement and disease progression modeling. However, current GAN technologies for 3D medical image synthesis need to be significantly improved to be readily adapted to real-world medical problems. In this paper, we extend the state-of-the-art StyleGAN2 model, which natively works with two-dimensional images, to enable 3D image synthesis. In addition to the image synthesis, we investigate the controllability and interpretability of the 3D-StyleGAN via style vectors inherited form the original StyleGAN2 that are highly suitable for medical applications: (i) the latent space projection and reconstruction of unseen real images, and (ii) style mixing. We demonstrate the 3D-StyleGAN's performance and feasibility with ~12,000 three-dimensional full brain MR T1 images, although it can be applied to any 3D volumetric images. Furthermore, we explore different configurations of hyperparameters to investigate potential improvement of the image synthesis with larger networks. The codes and pre-trained networks are available online: https://github.com/sh4174/3DStyleGAN."
SynthTIGER: Synthetic Text Image GEneratoR Towards Better Text Recognition Models,"For successful scene text recognition (STR) models, synthetic text image generators have alleviated the lack of annotated text images from the real world. Specifically, they generate multiple text images with diverse backgrounds, font styles, and text shapes and enable STR models to learn visual patterns that might not be accessible from manually annotated data. In this paper, we introduce a new synthetic text image generator, SynthTIGER, by analyzing techniques used for text image synthesis and integrating effective ones under a single algorithm. Moreover, we propose two techniques that alleviate the long-tail problem in length and character distributions of training data. In our experiments, SynthTIGER achieves better STR performance than the combination of synthetic datasets, MJSynth (MJ) and SynthText (ST). Our ablation study demonstrates the benefits of using sub-components of SynthTIGER and the guideline on generating synthetic text images for STR models. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/clovaai/synthtiger."
Exploiting generative self-supervised learning for the assessment of biological images with lack of annotations: a COVID-19 case-study,"Computer-aided analysis of biological images typically requires extensive training on large-scale annotated datasets, which is not viable in many situations. In this paper we present GAN-DL, a Discriminator Learner based on the StyleGAN2 architecture, which we employ for self-supervised image representation learning in the case of fluorescent biological images. We show that Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks combined with linear Support Vector Machines enable high-throughput compound screening based on raw images. We demonstrate this by classifying active and inactive compounds tested for the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection in VERO and HRCE cell lines. In contrast to previous methods, our deep learning based approach does not require any annotation besides the one that is normally collected during the sample preparation process. We test our technique on the RxRx19a Sars-CoV-2 image collection. The dataset consists of fluorescent images that were generated to assess the ability of regulatory-approved or in late-stage clinical trials compound to modulate the in vitro infection from SARS-CoV-2 in both VERO and HRCE cell lines. We show that our technique can be exploited not only for classification tasks, but also to effectively derive a dose response curve for the tested treatments, in a self-supervised manner. Lastly, we demonstrate its generalization capabilities by successfully addressing a zero-shot learning task, consisting in the categorization of four different cell types of the RxRx1 fluorescent images collection."
DynaDog+T: A Parametric Animal Model for Synthetic Canine Image Generation,"Synthetic data is becoming increasingly common for training computer vision models for a variety of tasks. Notably, such data has been applied in tasks related to humans such as 3D pose estimation where data is either difficult to create or obtain in realistic settings. Comparatively, there has been less work into synthetic animal data and it's uses for training models. Consequently, we introduce a parametric canine model, DynaDog+T, for generating synthetic canine images and data which we use for a common computer vision task, binary segmentation, which would otherwise be difficult due to the lack of available data."
A Generalized Framework for Edge-preserving and Structure-preserving Image Smoothing,"Image smoothing is a fundamental procedure in applications of both computer vision and graphics. The required smoothing properties can be different or even contradictive among different tasks. Nevertheless, the inherent smoothing nature of one smoothing operator is usually fixed and thus cannot meet the various requirements of different applications. In this paper, we first introduce the truncated Huber penalty function which shows strong flexibility under different parameter settings. A generalized framework is then proposed with the introduced truncated Huber penalty function. When combined with its strong flexibility, our framework is able to achieve diverse smoothing natures where contradictive smoothing behaviors can even be achieved. It can also yield the smoothing behavior that can seldom be achieved by previous methods, and superior performance is thus achieved in challenging cases. These together enable our framework capable of a range of applications and able to outperform the state-of-the-art approaches in several tasks, such as image detail enhancement, clip-art compression artifacts removal, guided depth map restoration, image texture removal, etc. In addition, an efficient numerical solution is provided and its convergence is theoretically guaranteed even the optimization framework is non-convex and non-smooth. A simple yet effective approach is further proposed to reduce the computational cost of our method while maintaining its performance. The effectiveness and superior performance of our approach are validated through comprehensive experiments in a range of applications. Our code is available at https://github.com/wliusjtu/Generalized-Smoothing-Framework."
Multi-Attention Generative Adversarial Network for Remote Sensing Image Super-Resolution,"Image super-resolution (SR) methods can generate remote sensing images with high spatial resolution without increasing the cost, thereby providing a feasible way to acquire high-resolution remote sensing images, which are difficult to obtain due to the high cost of acquisition equipment and complex weather. Clearly, image super-resolution is a severe ill-posed problem. Fortunately, with the development of deep learning, the powerful fitting ability of deep neural networks has solved this problem to some extent. In this paper, we propose a network based on the generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate high resolution remote sensing images, named the multi-attention generative adversarial network (MA-GAN). We first designed a GAN-based framework for the image SR task. The core to accomplishing the SR task is the image generator with post-upsampling that we designed. The main body of the generator contains two blocks; one is the pyramidal convolution in the residual-dense block (PCRDB), and the other is the attention-based upsample (AUP) block. The attentioned pyramidal convolution (AttPConv) in the PCRDB block is a module that combines multi-scale convolution and channel attention to automatically learn and adjust the scaling of the residuals for better results. The AUP block is a module that combines pixel attention (PA) to perform arbitrary multiples of upsampling. These two blocks work together to help generate better quality images. For the loss function, we design a loss function based on pixel loss and introduce both adversarial loss and feature loss to guide the generator learning. We have compared our method with several state-of-the-art methods on a remote sensing scene image dataset, and the experimental results consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MA-GAN."
Automated Mobile App Test Script Intent Generation via Image and Code Understanding,"Testing is the most direct and effective technique to ensure software quality. However, it is a burden for developers to understand the poorly-commented tests, which are common in industry environment projects. Mobile applications (app) are GUI-intensive and event-driven, so test scripts focusing on GUI interactions play a more important role in mobile app testing besides the test cases for the source code. Therefore, more attention should be paid to the user interactions and the corresponding user event responses. However, test scripts are loosely linked to apps under test (AUT) based on widget selectors, making it hard to map the operations to the functionality code of AUT. In such a situation, code understanding algorithms may lose efficacy if directly applied to mobile app test scripts.  We present a novel approach, TestIntent, to infer the intent of mobile app test scripts. TestIntent combines the GUI image understanding and code understanding technologies. The test script is transferred into an operation sequence model. For each operation, TestIntent extracts the operated widget selector and link the selector to the UI layout structure, which stores the detailed information of the widgets, including coordinates, type, etc. With code understanding technologies, TestIntent can locate response methods in the source code. Afterwards, NLP algorithms are adopted to understand the code and generate descriptions. Also, TestIntent can locate widgets on the app GUI images. Then, TestIntent can understand the widget intent with an encoder-decoder model. With the combination of the results from GUI and code understanding, TestIntent generates the test intents in natural language format. We also conduct an empirical experiment, and the results prove the outstanding performance of TestIntent. A user study also declares that TestIntent can save developers' time to understand test scripts."
Self-Supervised Generative Adversarial Network for Depth Estimation in Laparoscopic Images,"Dense depth estimation and 3D reconstruction of a surgical scene are crucial steps in computer assisted surgery. Recent work has shown that depth estimation from a stereo images pair could be solved with convolutional neural networks. However, most recent depth estimation models were trained on datasets with per-pixel ground truth. Such data is especially rare for laparoscopic imaging, making it hard to apply supervised depth estimation to real surgical applications. To overcome this limitation, we propose SADepth, a new self-supervised depth estimation method based on Generative Adversarial Networks. It consists of an encoder-decoder generator and a discriminator to incorporate geometry constraints during training. Multi-scale outputs from the generator help to solve the local minima caused by the photometric reprojection loss, while the adversarial learning improves the framework generation quality. Extensive experiments on two public datasets show that SADepth outperforms recent state-of-the-art unsupervised methods by a large margin, and reduces the gap between supervised and unsupervised depth estimation in laparoscopic images."
JPGNet: Joint Predictive Filtering and Generative Network for Image Inpainting,"Image inpainting aims to restore the missing regions of corrupted images and make the recovery result identical to the originally complete image, which is different from the common generative task emphasizing the naturalness or realism of generated images. Nevertheless, existing works usually regard it as a pure generation problem and employ cutting-edge deep generative techniques to address it. The generative networks can fill the main missing parts with realistic contents but usually distort the local structures or introduce obvious artifacts. In this paper, for the first time, we formulate image inpainting as a mix of two problems, predictive filtering and deep generation. Predictive filtering is good at preserving local structures and removing artifacts but falls short to complete the large missing regions. The deep generative network can fill the numerous missing pixels based on the understanding of the whole scene but hardly restores the details identical to the original ones. To make use of their respective advantages, we propose the joint predictive filtering and generative network (JPGNet) that contains three branches: predictive filtering & uncertainty network (PFUNet), deep generative network, and uncertainty-aware fusion network (UAFNet). The PFUNet can adaptively predict pixel-wise kernels for filtering-based inpainting according to the input image and output an uncertainty map. This map indicates the pixels should be processed by filtering or generative networks, which is further fed to the UAFNet for a smart combination between filtering and generative results. Note that, our method as a novel inpainting framework can benefit any existing generation-based methods. We validate our method on three public datasets, Dunhuang, Places2, and CelebA, and demonstrate that our method can enhance three state-of-the-art generative methods significantly with slightly extra time costs."
Towards Robust General Medical Image Segmentation,"The reliability of Deep Learning systems depends on their accuracy but also on their robustness against adversarial perturbations to the input data. Several attacks and defenses have been proposed to improve the performance of Deep Neural Networks under the presence of adversarial noise in the natural image domain. However, robustness in computer-aided diagnosis for volumetric data has only been explored for specific tasks and with limited attacks. We propose a new framework to assess the robustness of general medical image segmentation systems. Our contributions are two-fold: (i) we propose a new benchmark to evaluate robustness in the context of the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) by extending the recent AutoAttack natural image classification framework to the domain of volumetric data segmentation, and (ii) we present a novel lattice architecture for RObust Generic medical image segmentation (ROG). Our results show that ROG is capable of generalizing across different tasks of the MSD and largely surpasses the state-of-the-art under sophisticated adversarial attacks."
A Deep Residual Star Generative Adversarial Network for multi-domain Image Super-Resolution,"Recently, most of state-of-the-art single image super-resolution (SISR) methods have attained impressive performance by using deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs). The existing SR methods have limited performance due to a fixed degradation settings, i.e. usually a bicubic downscaling of low-resolution (LR) image. However, in real-world settings, the LR degradation process is unknown which can be bicubic LR, bilinear LR, nearest-neighbor LR, or real LR. Therefore, most SR methods are ineffective and inefficient in handling more than one degradation settings within a single network. To handle the multiple degradation, i.e. refers to multi-domain image super-resolution, we propose a deep Super-Resolution Residual StarGAN (SR2*GAN), a novel and scalable approach that super-resolves the LR images for the multiple LR domains using only a single model. The proposed scheme is trained in a StarGAN like network topology with a single generator and discriminator networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in quantitative and qualitative experiments compared to other state-of-the-art methods."
Controlled Caption Generation for Images Through Adversarial Attacks,"Deep learning is found to be vulnerable to adversarial examples. However, its adversarial susceptibility in image caption generation is under-explored. We study adversarial examples for vision and language models, which typically adopt an encoder-decoder framework consisting of two major components: a Convolutional Neural Network (i.e., CNN) for image feature extraction and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for caption generation. In particular, we investigate attacks on the visual encoder's hidden layer that is fed to the subsequent recurrent network. The existing methods either attack the classification layer of the visual encoder or they back-propagate the gradients from the language model. In contrast, we propose a GAN-based algorithm for crafting adversarial examples for neural image captioning that mimics the internal representation of the CNN such that the resulting deep features of the input image enable a controlled incorrect caption generation through the recurrent network. Our contribution provides new insights for understanding adversarial attacks on vision systems with language component. The proposed method employs two strategies for a comprehensive evaluation. The first examines if a neural image captioning system can be misled to output targeted image captions. The second analyzes the possibility of keywords into the predicted captions. Experiments show that our algorithm can craft effective adversarial images based on the CNN hidden layers to fool captioning framework. Moreover, we discover the proposed attack to be highly transferable. Our work leads to new robustness implications for neural image captioning."
Generalizing Nucleus Recognition Model in Multi-source Images via Pruning,"Ki67 is a significant biomarker in the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer, whose index can be evaluated by quantifying its expression in Ki67 immunohistochemistry (IHC) stained images. However, quantitative analysis on multi-source Ki67 images is yet a challenging task in practice due to cross-domain distribution differences, which result from imaging variation, staining styles, and lesion types. Many recent studies have made some efforts on domain generalization (DG), whereas there are still some noteworthy limitations. Specifically in the case of Ki67 images, learning invariant representation is at the mercy of the insufficient number of domains and the cell categories mismatching in different domains. In this paper, we propose a novel method to improve DG by searching the domain-agnostic subnetwork in a domain merging scenario. Partial model parameters are iteratively pruned according to the domain gap, which is caused by the data converting from a single domain into merged domains during training. In addition, the model is optimized by fine-tuning on merged domains to eliminate the interference of class mismatching among various domains. Furthermore, an appropriate implementation is attained by applying the pruning method to different parts of the framework. Compared with known DG methods, our method yields excellent performance in multiclass nucleus recognition of Ki67 IHC images, especially in the lost category cases. Moreover, our competitive results are also evaluated on the public dataset over the state-of-the-art DG methods."
SPI-GAN: Towards Single-Pixel Imaging through Generative Adversarial Network,"Single-pixel imaging is a novel imaging scheme that has gained popularity due to its huge computational gain and potential for a low-cost alternative to imaging beyond the visible spectrum. The traditional reconstruction methods struggle to produce a clear recovery when one limits the number of illumination patterns from a spatial light modulator. As a remedy, several deep-learning-based solutions have been proposed which lack good generalization ability due to the architectural setup and loss functions. In this paper, we propose a generative adversarial network-based reconstruction framework for single-pixel imaging, referred to as SPI-GAN. Our method can reconstruct images with 17.92 dB PSNR and 0.487 SSIM, even if the sampling ratio drops to 5%. This facilitates much faster reconstruction making our method suitable for single-pixel video. Furthermore, our ResNet-like architecture for the generator leads to useful representation learning that allows us to reconstruct completely unseen objects. The experimental results demonstrate that SPI-GAN achieves significant performance gain, e.g. near 3dB PSNR gain, over the current state-of-the-art method."
On Bridging Generic and Personalized Federated Learning for Image Classification,"Federated learning is promising for its capability to collaboratively train models with multiple clients without accessing their data, but vulnerable when clients' data distributions diverge from each other. This divergence further leads to a dilemma: ""Should we prioritize the learned model's generic performance (for future use at the server) or its personalized performance (for each client)?"" These two, seemingly competing goals have divided the community to focus on one or the other, yet in this paper we show that it is possible to approach both at the same time. Concretely, we propose a novel federated learning framework that explicitly decouples a model's dual duties with two prediction tasks. On the one hand, we introduce a family of losses that are robust to non-identical class distributions, enabling clients to train a generic predictor with a consistent objective across them. On the other hand, we formulate the personalized predictor as a lightweight adaptive module that is learned to minimize each client's empirical risk on top of the generic predictor. With this two-loss, two-predictor framework which we name Federated Robust Decoupling (Fed-RoD), the learned model can simultaneously achieve state-of-the-art generic and personalized performance, essentially bridging the two tasks."
SinGAN-Seg: Synthetic training data generation for medical image segmentation,"Analyzing medical data to find abnormalities is a time-consuming and costly task, particularly for rare abnormalities, requiring tremendous efforts from medical experts. Artificial intelligence has become a popular tool for the automatic processing of medical data, acting as a supportive tool for doctors. However, the machine learning models used to build these tools are highly dependent on the data used to train them. Large amounts of data can be difficult to obtain in medicine due to privacy, expensive and time-consuming annotations, and a general lack of data samples for infrequent lesions. Here, we present a novel synthetic data generation pipeline, called SinGAN-Seg, to produce synthetic medical images with corresponding masks using a single training image. Our method is different from the traditional GANs because our model needs only a single image and the corresponding ground truth to train. Our method produces alternative artificial segmentation datasets with ground truth masks when real datasets are not allowed to share. The pipeline is evaluated using qualitative and quantitative comparisons between real and synthetic data to show that the style transfer technique used in our pipeline significantly improves the quality of the generated data and our method is better than other state-of-the-art GANs to prepare synthetic images when the size of training datasets are limited. By training UNet++ using both real and the synthetic data generated from the SinGAN-Seg pipeline, we show that models trained with synthetic data have very close performances to those trained on real data when the datasets have a considerable amount of data. In contrast, Synthetic data generated from the SinGAN-Seg pipeline can improve the performance of segmentation models when training datasets do not have a considerable amount of data. The code is available on GitHub."
Explainable Diabetic Retinopathy Detection and Retinal Image Generation,"Though deep learning has shown successful performance in classifying the label and severity stage of certain diseases, most of them give few explanations on how to make predictions. Inspired by Koch's Postulates, the foundation in evidence-based medicine (EBM) to identify the pathogen, we propose to exploit the interpretability of deep learning application in medical diagnosis. By determining and isolating the neuron activation patterns on which diabetic retinopathy (DR) detector relies to make decisions, we demonstrate the direct relation between the isolated neuron activation and lesions for a pathological explanation. To be specific, we first define novel pathological descriptors using activated neurons of the DR detector to encode both spatial and appearance information of lesions. Then, to visualize the symptom encoded in the descriptor, we propose Patho-GAN, a new network to synthesize medically plausible retinal images. By manipulating these descriptors, we could even arbitrarily control the position, quantity, and categories of generated lesions. We also show that our synthesized images carry the symptoms directly related to diabetic retinopathy diagnosis. Our generated images are both qualitatively and quantitatively superior to the ones by previous methods. Besides, compared to existing methods that take hours to generate an image, our second level speed endows the potential to be an effective solution for data augmentation."
Image Inpainting Using Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Imputation Network,"Image inpainting is one of the important tasks in computer vision which focuses on the reconstruction of missing regions in an image. The aim of this paper is to introduce an image inpainting model based on Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Imputation Network. The generator network of the model uses building blocks of convolutional layers with different dilation rates, together with skip connections that help the model reproduce fine details of the output. This combination yields a universal imputation model that is able to handle various scenarios of missingness with sufficient quality. To show this experimentally, the model is simultaneously trained to deal with three scenarios given by missing pixels at random, missing various smaller square regions, and one missing square placed in the center of the image. It turns out that our model achieves high-quality inpainting results on all scenarios. Performance is evaluated using peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity index on two real-world benchmark datasets, CelebA faces and Paris StreetView. The results of our model are compared to biharmonic imputation and to some of the other state-of-the-art image inpainting methods."
SE-MD: A Single-encoder multiple-decoder deep network for point cloud generation from 2D images,"3D model generation from single 2D RGB images is a challenging and actively researched computer vision task. Various techniques using conventional network architectures have been proposed for the same. However, the body of research work is limited and there are various issues like using inefficient 3D representation formats, weak 3D model generation backbones, inability to generate dense point clouds, dependence of post-processing for generation of dense point clouds, and dependence on silhouettes in RGB images. In this paper, a novel 2D RGB image to point cloud conversion technique is proposed, which improves the state of art in the field due to its efficient, robust and simple model by using the concept of parallelization in network architecture. It not only uses the efficient and rich 3D representation of point clouds, but also uses a novel and robust point cloud generation backbone in order to address the prevalent issues. This involves using a single-encoder multiple-decoder deep network architecture wherein each decoder generates certain fixed viewpoints. This is followed by fusing all the viewpoints to generate a dense point cloud. Various experiments are conducted on the technique and its performance is compared with those of other state of the art techniques and impressive gains in performance are demonstrated. Code is available at https://github.com/mueedhafiz1982/"
Cascaded Diffusion Models for High Fidelity Image Generation,"We show that cascaded diffusion models are capable of generating high fidelity images on the class-conditional ImageNet generation benchmark, without any assistance from auxiliary image classifiers to boost sample quality. A cascaded diffusion model comprises a pipeline of multiple diffusion models that generate images of increasing resolution, beginning with a standard diffusion model at the lowest resolution, followed by one or more super-resolution diffusion models that successively upsample the image and add higher resolution details. We find that the sample quality of a cascading pipeline relies crucially on conditioning augmentation, our proposed method of data augmentation of the lower resolution conditioning inputs to the super-resolution models. Our experiments show that conditioning augmentation prevents compounding error during sampling in a cascaded model, helping us to train cascading pipelines achieving FID scores of 1.48 at 64x64, 3.52 at 128x128 and 4.88 at 256x256 resolutions, outperforming BigGAN-deep, and classification accuracy scores of 63.02% (top-1) and 84.06% (top-5) at 256x256, outperforming VQ-VAE-2."
Learning stochastic object models from medical imaging measurements by use of advanced ambient generative adversarial networks,"Purpose: To objectively assess new medical imaging technologies via computer-simulations, it is important to account for the variability in the ensemble of objects to be imaged. This source of variability can be described by stochastic object models (SOMs). It is generally desirable to establish SOMs from experimental imaging measurements acquired by use of a well-characterized imaging system, but this task has remained challenging. Approach: A generative adversarial network (GAN)-based method that employs AmbientGANs with modern progressive or multiresolution training approaches is proposed. AmbientGANs established using the proposed training procedure are systematically validated in a controlled way using computer-simulated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data corresponding to a stylized imaging system. Emulated single-coil experimental MRI data are also employed to demonstrate the methods under less stylized conditions. Results: The proposed AmbientGAN method can generate clean images when the imaging measurements are contaminated by measurement noise. When the imaging measurement data are incomplete, the proposed AmbientGAN can reliably learn the distribution of the measurement components of the objects. Conclusions: Both visual examinations and quantitative analyses, including task-specific validations using the Hotelling observer, demonstrated that the proposed AmbientGAN method holds promise to establish realistic SOMs from imaging measurements."
NP-DRAW: A Non-Parametric Structured Latent Variable Model for Image Generation,"In this paper, we present a non-parametric structured latent variable model for image generation, called NP-DRAW, which sequentially draws on a latent canvas in a part-by-part fashion and then decodes the image from the canvas. Our key contributions are as follows. 1) We propose a non-parametric prior distribution over the appearance of image parts so that the latent variable ``what-to-draw'' per step becomes a categorical random variable. This improves the expressiveness and greatly eases the learning compared to Gaussians used in the literature. 2) We model the sequential dependency structure of parts via a Transformer, which is more powerful and easier to train compared to RNNs used in the literature. 3) We propose an effective heuristic parsing algorithm to pre-train the prior. Experiments on MNIST, Omniglot, CIFAR-10, and CelebA show that our method significantly outperforms previous structured image models like DRAW and AIR and is competitive to other generic generative models. Moreover, we show that our model's inherent compositionality and interpretability bring significant benefits in the low-data learning regime and latent space editing. Code is available at https://github.com/ZENGXH/NPDRAW."
Generalized Unsupervised Clustering of Hyperspectral Images of Geological Targets in the Near Infrared,"The application of infrared hyperspectral imagery to geological problems is becoming more popular as data become more accessible and cost-effective. Clustering and classifying spectrally similar materials is often a first step in applications ranging from economic mineral exploration on Earth to planetary exploration on Mars. Semi-manual classification guided by expertly developed spectral parameters can be time consuming and biased, while supervised methods require abundant labeled data and can be difficult to generalize. Here we develop a fully unsupervised workflow for feature extraction and clustering informed by both expert spectral geologist input and quantitative metrics. Our pipeline uses a lightweight autoencoder followed by Gaussian mixture modeling to map the spectral diversity within any image. We validate the performance of our pipeline at submillimeter-scale with expert-labelled data from the Oman ophiolite drill core and evaluate performance at meters-scale with partially classified orbital data of Jezero Crater on Mars (the landing site for the Perseverance rover). We additionally examine the effects of various preprocessing techniques used in traditional analysis of hyperspectral imagery. This pipeline provides a fast and accurate clustering map of similar geological materials and consistently identifies and separates major mineral classes in both laboratory imagery and remote sensing imagery. We refer to our pipeline as ""Generalized Pipeline for Spectroscopic Unsupervised clustering of Minerals (GyPSUM)."""
Handling Data Heterogeneity with Generative Replay in Collaborative Learning for Medical Imaging,"Collaborative learning, which enables collaborative and decentralized training of deep neural networks at multiple institutions in a privacy-preserving manner, is rapidly emerging as a valuable technique in healthcare applications. However, its distributed nature often leads to significant heterogeneity in data distributions across institutions. In this paper, we present a novel generative replay strategy to address the challenge of data heterogeneity in collaborative learning methods. Different from traditional methods that directly aggregating the model parameters, we leverage generative adversarial learning to aggregate the knowledge from all the local institutions. Specifically, instead of directly training a model for task performance, we develop a novel dual model architecture: a primary model learns the desired task, and an auxiliary ""generative replay model"" allows aggregating knowledge from the heterogenous clients. The auxiliary model is then broadcasted to the central sever, to regulate the training of primary model with an unbiased target distribution. Experimental results demonstrate the capability of the proposed method in handling heterogeneous data across institutions. On highly heterogeneous data partitions, our model achieves ~4.88% improvement in the prediction accuracy on a diabetic retinopathy classification dataset, and ~49.8% reduction of mean absolution value on a Bone Age prediction dataset, respectively, compared to the state-of-the art collaborative learning methods."
Unsupervised Learning of Depth and Depth-of-Field Effect from Natural Images with Aperture Rendering Generative Adversarial Networks,"Understanding the 3D world from 2D projected natural images is a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics. Recently, an unsupervised learning approach has garnered considerable attention owing to its advantages in data collection. However, to mitigate training limitations, typical methods need to impose assumptions for viewpoint distribution (e.g., a dataset containing various viewpoint images) or object shape (e.g., symmetric objects). These assumptions often restrict applications; for instance, the application to non-rigid objects or images captured from similar viewpoints (e.g., flower or bird images) remains a challenge. To complement these approaches, we propose aperture rendering generative adversarial networks (AR-GANs), which equip aperture rendering on top of GANs, and adopt focus cues to learn the depth and depth-of-field (DoF) effect of unlabeled natural images. To address the ambiguities triggered by unsupervised setting (i.e., ambiguities between smooth texture and out-of-focus blurs, and between foreground and background blurs), we develop DoF mixture learning, which enables the generator to learn real image distribution while generating diverse DoF images. In addition, we devise a center focus prior to guiding the learning direction. In the experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of AR-GANs in various datasets, such as flower, bird, and face images, demonstrate their portability by incorporating them into other 3D representation learning GANs, and validate their applicability in shallow DoF rendering."
Fairness for Image Generation with Uncertain Sensitive Attributes,"This work tackles the issue of fairness in the context of generative procedures, such as image super-resolution, which entail different definitions from the standard classification setting. Moreover, while traditional group fairness definitions are typically defined with respect to specified protected groups -- camouflaging the fact that these groupings are artificial and carry historical and political motivations -- we emphasize that there are no ground truth identities. For instance, should South and East Asians be viewed as a single group or separate groups? Should we consider one race as a whole or further split by gender? Choosing which groups are valid and who belongs in them is an impossible dilemma and being ""fair"" with respect to Asians may require being ""unfair"" with respect to South Asians. This motivates the introduction of definitions that allow algorithms to be \emph{oblivious} to the relevant groupings.  We define several intuitive notions of group fairness and study their incompatibilities and trade-offs. We show that the natural extension of demographic parity is strongly dependent on the grouping, and \emph{impossible} to achieve obliviously. On the other hand, the conceptually new definition we introduce, Conditional Proportional Representation, can be achieved obliviously through Posterior Sampling. Our experiments validate our theoretical results and achieve fair image reconstruction using state-of-the-art generative models."
Structure First Detail Next: Image Inpainting with Pyramid Generator,"Recent deep generative models have achieved promising performance in image inpainting. However, it is still very challenging for a neural network to generate realistic image details and textures, due to its inherent spectral bias. By our understanding of how artists work, we suggest to adopt a `structure first detail next' workflow for image inpainting. To this end, we propose to build a Pyramid Generator by stacking several sub-generators, where lower-layer sub-generators focus on restoring image structures while the higher-layer sub-generators emphasize image details. Given an input image, it will be gradually restored by going through the entire pyramid in a bottom-up fashion. Particularly, our approach has a learning scheme of progressively increasing hole size, which allows it to restore large-hole images. In addition, our method could fully exploit the benefits of learning with high-resolution images, and hence is suitable for high-resolution image inpainting. Extensive experimental results on benchmark datasets have validated the effectiveness of our approach compared with state-of-the-art methods."
Generating Data Augmentation samples for Semantic Segmentation of Salt Bodies in a Synthetic Seismic Image Dataset,"Nowadays, subsurface salt body localization and delineation, also called semantic segmentation of salt bodies, are among the most challenging geophysicist tasks. Thus, identifying large salt bodies is notoriously tricky and is crucial for identifying hydrocarbon reservoirs and drill path planning. This work proposes a Data Augmentation method based on training two generative models to augment the number of samples in a seismic image dataset for the semantic segmentation of salt bodies. Our method uses deep learning models to generate pairs of seismic image patches and their respective salt masks for the Data Augmentation. The first model is a Variational Autoencoder and is responsible for generating patches of salt body masks. The second is a Conditional Normalizing Flow model, which receives the generated masks as inputs and generates the associated seismic image patches. We evaluate the proposed method by comparing the performance of ten distinct state-of-the-art models for semantic segmentation, trained with and without the generated augmentations, in a dataset from two synthetic seismic images. The proposed methodology yields an average improvement of 8.57% in the IoU metric across all compared models. The best result is achieved by a DeeplabV3+ model variant, which presents an IoU score of 95.17% when trained with our augmentations. Additionally, our proposal outperformed six selected data augmentation methods, and the most significant improvement in the comparison, of 9.77%, is achieved by composing our DA with augmentations from an elastic transformation. At last, we show that the proposed method is adaptable for a larger context size by achieving results comparable to the obtained on the smaller context size."
Reverse Engineering of Generative Models: Inferring Model Hyperparameters from Generated Images,"State-of-the-art (SOTA) Generative Models (GMs) can synthesize photo-realistic images that are hard for humans to distinguish from genuine photos. Identifying and understanding manipulated media are crucial to mitigate the social concerns on the potential misuse of GMs. We propose to perform reverse engineering of GMs to infer model hyperparameters from the images generated by these models. We define a novel problem, ""model parsing"", as estimating GM network architectures and training loss functions by examining their generated images - a task seemingly impossible for human beings. To tackle this problem, we propose a framework with two components: a Fingerprint Estimation Network (FEN), which estimates a GM fingerprint from a generated image by training with four constraints to encourage the fingerprint to have desired properties, and a Parsing Network (PN), which predicts network architecture and loss functions from the estimated fingerprints. To evaluate our approach, we collect a fake image dataset with 100K images generated by 116 different GMs. Extensive experiments show encouraging results in parsing the hyperparameters of the unseen models. Finally, our fingerprint estimation can be leveraged for deepfake detection and image attribution, as we show by reporting SOTA results on both the deepfake detection (Celeb-DF) and image attribution benchmarks."
BPLF: A Bi-Parallel Linear Flow Model for Facial Expression Generation from Emotion Set Images,"The flow-based generative model is a deep learning generative model, which obtains the ability to generate data by explicitly learning the data distribution. Theoretically its ability to restore data is stronger than other generative models. However, its implementation has many limitations, including limited model design, too many model parameters and tedious calculation. In this paper, a bi-parallel linear flow model for facial emotion generation from emotion set images is constructed, and a series of improvements have been made in terms of the expression ability of the model and the convergence speed in training. The model is mainly composed of several coupling layers superimposed to form a multi-scale structure, in which each coupling layer contains 1*1 reversible convolution and linear operation modules. Furthermore, this paper sorted out the current public data set of facial emotion images, made a new emotion data, and verified the model through this data set. The experimental results show that, under the traditional convolutional neural network, the 3-layer 3*3 convolution kernel is more conducive to extracte the features of the face images. The introduction of principal component decomposition can improve the convergence speed of the model."
SinIR: Efficient General Image Manipulation with Single Image Reconstruction,"We propose SinIR, an efficient reconstruction-based framework trained on a single natural image for general image manipulation, including super-resolution, editing, harmonization, paint-to-image, photo-realistic style transfer, and artistic style transfer. We train our model on a single image with cascaded multi-scale learning, where each network at each scale is responsible for image reconstruction. This reconstruction objective greatly reduces the complexity and running time of training, compared to the GAN objective. However, the reconstruction objective also exacerbates the output quality. Therefore, to solve this problem, we further utilize simple random pixel shuffling, which also gives control over manipulation, inspired by the Denoising Autoencoder. With quantitative evaluation, we show that SinIR has competitive performance on various image manipulation tasks. Moreover, with a much simpler training objective (i.e., reconstruction), SinIR is trained 33.5 times faster than SinGAN (for 500 X 500 images) that solves similar tasks. Our code is publicly available at github.com/YooJiHyeong/SinIR."
Generation of the NIR spectral Band for Satellite Images with Convolutional Neural Networks,"The near-infrared (NIR) spectral range (from 780 to 2500 nm) of the multispectral remote sensing imagery provides vital information for the landcover classification, especially concerning the vegetation assessment. Despite the usefulness of NIR, common RGB is not always accompanied by it. Modern achievements in image processing via deep neural networks allow generating artificial spectral information, such as for the image colorization problem. In this research, we aim to investigate whether this approach can produce not only visually similar images but also an artificial spectral band that can improve the performance of computer vision algorithms for solving remote sensing tasks. We study the generative adversarial network (GAN) approach in the task of the NIR band generation using just RGB channels of high-resolution satellite imagery. We evaluate the impact of a generated channel on the model performance for solving the forest segmentation task. Our results show an increase in model accuracy when using generated NIR comparing to the baseline model that uses only RGB (0.947 and 0.914 F1-score accordingly). Conducted study shows the advantages of generating the extra band and its implementation in applied challenges reducing the required amount of labeled data."
Domain Generalization on Medical Imaging Classification using Episodic Training with Task Augmentation,"Medical imaging datasets usually exhibit domain shift due to the variations of scanner vendors, imaging protocols, etc. This raises the concern about the generalization capacity of machine learning models. Domain generalization (DG), which aims to learn a model from multiple source domains such that it can be directly generalized to unseen test domains, seems particularly promising to medical imaging community. To address DG, recent model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) has been introduced, which transfers the knowledge from previous training tasks to facilitate the learning of novel testing tasks. However, in clinical practice, there are usually only a few annotated source domains available, which decreases the capacity of training task generation and thus increases the risk of overfitting to training tasks in the paradigm. In this paper, we propose a novel DG scheme of episodic training with task augmentation on medical imaging classification. Based on meta-learning, we develop the paradigm of episodic training to construct the knowledge transfer from episodic training-task simulation to the real testing task of DG. Motivated by the limited number of source domains in real-world medical deployment, we consider the unique task-level overfitting and we propose task augmentation to enhance the variety during training task generation to alleviate it. With the established learning framework, we further exploit a novel meta-objective to regularize the deep embedding of training domains. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we perform experiments on histopathological images and abdominal CT images."
View Generalization for Single Image Textured 3D Models,"Humans can easily infer the underlying 3D geometry and texture of an object only from a single 2D image. Current computer vision methods can do this, too, but suffer from view generalization problems - the models inferred tend to make poor predictions of appearance in novel views. As for generalization problems in machine learning, the difficulty is balancing single-view accuracy (cf. training error; bias) with novel view accuracy (cf. test error; variance). We describe a class of models whose geometric rigidity is easily controlled to manage this tradeoff. We describe a cycle consistency loss that improves view generalization (roughly, a model from a generated view should predict the original view well). View generalization of textures requires that models share texture information, so a car seen from the back still has headlights because other cars have headlights. We describe a cycle consistency loss that encourages model textures to be aligned, so as to encourage sharing. We compare our method against the state-of-the-art method and show both qualitative and quantitative improvements."
Generative Feature-driven Image Replay for Continual Learning,"Neural networks are prone to catastrophic forgetting when trained incrementally on different tasks. Popular incremental learning methods mitigate such forgetting by retaining a subset of previously seen samples and replaying them during the training on subsequent tasks. However, this is not always possible, e.g., due to data protection regulations. In such restricted scenarios, one can employ generative models to replay either artificial images or hidden features to a classifier. In this work, we propose Genifer (GENeratIve FEature-driven image Replay), where a generative model is trained to replay images that must induce the same hidden features as real samples when they are passed through the classifier. Our technique therefore incorporates the benefits of both image and feature replay, i.e.: (1) unlike conventional image replay, our generative model explicitly learns the distribution of features that are relevant for classification; (2) in contrast to feature replay, our entire classifier remains trainable; and (3) we can leverage image-space augmentations, which increase distillation performance while also mitigating overfitting during the training of the generative model. We show that Genifer substantially outperforms the previous state of the art for various settings on the CIFAR-100 and CUB-200 datasets."
A multi-stage GAN for multi-organ chest X-ray image generation and segmentation,"Multi-organ segmentation of X-ray images is of fundamental importance for computer aided diagnosis systems. However, the most advanced semantic segmentation methods rely on deep learning and require a huge amount of labeled images, which are rarely available due to both the high cost of human resources and the time required for labeling. In this paper, we present a novel multi-stage generation algorithm based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) that can produce synthetic images along with their semantic labels and can be used for data augmentation. The main feature of the method is that, unlike other approaches, generation occurs in several stages, which simplifies the procedure and allows it to be used on very small datasets. The method has been evaluated on the segmentation of chest radiographic images, showing promising results. The multistage approach achieves state-of-the-art and, when very few images are used to train the GANs, outperforms the corresponding single-stage approach."
Fast Computational Ghost Imaging using Unpaired Deep Learning and a Constrained Generative Adversarial Network,"The unpaired training can be the only option available for fast deep learning-based ghost imaging, where obtaining a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) image copy of each low SNR ghost image could be practically time-consuming and challenging. This paper explores the capabilities of deep learning to leverage computational ghost imaging when there is a lack of paired training images. The deep learning approach proposed here enables fast ghost imaging through reconstruction of high SNR images from faint and hastily shot ghost images using a constrained Wasserstein generative adversarial network. In the proposed approach, the objective function is regularized to enforce the generation of faithful and relevant high SNR images to the ghost copies. This regularization measures the distance between reconstructed images and the faint ghost images in a low-noise manifold generated by a shadow network. The performance of the constrained network is shown to be particularly important for ghost images with low SNR. The proposed pipeline is able to reconstruct high-quality images from the ghost images with SNR values not necessarily equal to the SNR of the training set."
On the use of automatically generated synthetic image datasets for benchmarking face recognition,"The availability of large-scale face datasets has been key in the progress of face recognition. However, due to licensing issues or copyright infringement, some datasets are not available anymore (e.g. MS-Celeb-1M). Recent advances in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), to synthesize realistic face images, provide a pathway to replace real datasets by synthetic datasets, both to train and benchmark face recognition (FR) systems. The work presented in this paper provides a study on benchmarking FR systems using a synthetic dataset. First, we introduce the proposed methodology to generate a synthetic dataset, without the need for human intervention, by exploiting the latent structure of a StyleGAN2 model with multiple controlled factors of variation. Then, we confirm that (i) the generated synthetic identities are not data subjects from the GAN's training dataset, which is verified on a synthetic dataset with 10K+ identities; (ii) benchmarking results on the synthetic dataset are a good substitution, often providing error rates and system ranking similar to the benchmarking on the real dataset."
High Resolution Solar Image Generation using Generative Adversarial Networks,"We applied Deep Learning algorithm known as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to perform solar image-to-image translation. That is, from Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager(HMI) line of sight magnetogram images to SDO/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly(AIA) 0304-Å images. The Ultraviolet(UV)/Extreme Ultraviolet(EUV) observations like the SDO/AIA0304-Å images were only made available to scientists in the late 1990s even though the magenetic field observations like the SDO/HMI have been available since the 1970s. Therefore by leveraging Deep Learning algorithms like GANs we can give scientists access to complete datasets for analysis. For generating high resolution solar images we use the Pix2PixHD and Pix2Pix algorithms. The Pix2PixHD algorithm was specifically designed for high resolution image generation tasks, and the Pix2Pix algorithm is by far the most widely used image to image translation algorithm. For training and testing we used the data for the year 2012, 2013 and 2014. The results show that our deep learning models are capable of generating high resolution(1024 x 1024 pixels) AIA0304 images from HMI magnetograms. Specifically, the pixel-to-pixel Pearson Correlation Coefficient of the images generated by Pix2PixHD and original images is as high as 0.99. The number is 0.962 if Pix2Pix is used to generate images. The results we get for our Pix2PixHD model is better than the results obtained by previous works done by others to generate AIA0304 images. Thus, we can use these models to generate AIA0304 images when the AIA0304 data is not available which can be used for understanding space weather and giving researchers the capability to predict solar events such as Solar Flares and Coronal Mass Ejections. As far as we know, our work is the first attempt to leverage Pix2PixHD algorithm for SDO/HMI to SDO/AIA0304 image-to-image translation."
MOC-GAN: Mixing Objects and Captions to Generate Realistic Images,"Generating images with conditional descriptions gains increasing interests in recent years. However, existing conditional inputs are suffering from either unstructured forms (captions) or limited information and expensive labeling (scene graphs). For a targeted scene, the core items, objects, are usually definite while their interactions are flexible and hard to clearly define. Thus, we introduce a more rational setting, generating a realistic image from the objects and captions. Under this setting, objects explicitly define the critical roles in the targeted images and captions implicitly describe their rich attributes and connections. Correspondingly, a MOC-GAN is proposed to mix the inputs of two modalities to generate realistic images. It firstly infers the implicit relations between object pairs from the captions to build a hidden-state scene graph. So a multi-layer representation containing objects, relations and captions is constructed, where the scene graph provides the structures of the scene and the caption provides the image-level guidance. Then a cascaded attentive generative network is designed to coarse-to-fine generate phrase patch by paying attention to the most relevant words in the caption. In addition, a phrase-wise DAMSM is proposed to better supervise the fine-grained phrase-patch consistency. On COCO dataset, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on both Inception Score and FID while maintaining high visual quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the unique features of our proposed method."
Uformer: A General U-Shaped Transformer for Image Restoration,"In this paper, we present Uformer, an effective and efficient Transformer-based architecture for image restoration, in which we build a hierarchical encoder-decoder network using the Transformer block. In Uformer, there are two core designs. First, we introduce a novel locally-enhanced window (LeWin) Transformer block, which performs nonoverlapping window-based self-attention instead of global self-attention. It significantly reduces the computational complexity on high resolution feature map while capturing local context. Second, we propose a learnable multi-scale restoration modulator in the form of a multi-scale spatial bias to adjust features in multiple layers of the Uformer decoder. Our modulator demonstrates superior capability for restoring details for various image restoration tasks while introducing marginal extra parameters and computational cost. Powered by these two designs, Uformer enjoys a high capability for capturing both local and global dependencies for image restoration. To evaluate our approach, extensive experiments are conducted on several image restoration tasks, including image denoising, motion deblurring, defocus deblurring and deraining. Without bells and whistles, our Uformer achieves superior or comparable performance compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms. The code and models are available at https://github.com/ZhendongWang6/Uformer."
Pathology-Aware Generative Adversarial Networks for Medical Image Augmentation,"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can play a key role in Medical Image Analysis under large-scale annotated datasets. However, preparing such massive dataset is demanding. In this context, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can generate realistic but novel samples, and thus effectively cover the real image distribution. In terms of interpolation, the GAN-based medical image augmentation is reliable because medical modalities can display the human body's strong anatomical consistency at fixed position while clearly reflecting inter-subject variability; thus, we propose to use noise-to-image GANs (e.g., random noise samples to diverse pathological images) for (i) medical Data Augmentation (DA) and (ii) physician training. Regarding the DA, the GAN-generated images can improve Computer-Aided Diagnosis based on supervised learning. For the physician training, the GANs can display novel desired pathological images and help train medical trainees despite infrastructural/legal constraints. This thesis contains four GAN projects aiming to present such novel applications' clinical relevance in collaboration with physicians. Whereas the methods are more generally applicable, this thesis only explores a few oncological applications."
ImVoxelNet: Image to Voxels Projection for Monocular and Multi-View General-Purpose 3D Object Detection,"In this paper, we introduce the task of multi-view RGB-based 3D object detection as an end-to-end optimization problem. To address this problem, we propose ImVoxelNet, a novel fully convolutional method of 3D object detection based on monocular or multi-view RGB images. The number of monocular images in each multi-view input can variate during training and inference; actually, this number might be unique for each multi-view input. ImVoxelNet successfully handles both indoor and outdoor scenes, which makes it general-purpose. Specifically, it achieves state-of-the-art results in car detection on KITTI (monocular) and nuScenes (multi-view) benchmarks among all methods that accept RGB images. Moreover, it surpasses existing RGB-based 3D object detection methods on the SUN RGB-D dataset. On ScanNet, ImVoxelNet sets a new benchmark for multi-view 3D object detection. The source code and the trained models are available at https://github.com/saic-vul/imvoxelnet."
Two-stage domain adapted training for better generalization in real-world image restoration and super-resolution,"It is well-known that in inverse problems, end-to-end trained networks overfit the degradation model seen in the training set, i.e., they do not generalize to other types of degradations well. Recently, an approach to first map images downsampled by unknown filters to bicubicly downsampled look-alike images was proposed to successfully super-resolve such images. In this paper, we show that any inverse problem can be formulated by first mapping the input degraded images to an intermediate domain, and then training a second network to form output images from these intermediate images. Furthermore, the best intermediate domain may vary according to the task. Our experimental results demonstrate that this two-stage domain-adapted training strategy does not only achieve better results on a given class of unknown degradations but can also generalize to other unseen classes of degradations better."
Image-to-Video Generation via 3D Facial Dynamics,"We present a versatile model, FaceAnime, for various video generation tasks from still images. Video generation from a single face image is an interesting problem and usually tackled by utilizing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to integrate information from the input face image and a sequence of sparse facial landmarks. However, the generated face images usually suffer from quality loss, image distortion, identity change, and expression mismatching due to the weak representation capacity of the facial landmarks. In this paper, we propose to ""imagine"" a face video from a single face image according to the reconstructed 3D face dynamics, aiming to generate a realistic and identity-preserving face video, with precisely predicted pose and facial expression. The 3D dynamics reveal changes of the facial expression and motion, and can serve as a strong prior knowledge for guiding highly realistic face video generation. In particular, we explore face video prediction and exploit a well-designed 3D dynamic prediction network to predict a 3D dynamic sequence for a single face image. The 3D dynamics are then further rendered by the sparse texture mapping algorithm to recover structural details and sparse textures for generating face frames. Our model is versatile for various AR/VR and entertainment applications, such as face video retargeting and face video prediction. Superior experimental results have well demonstrated its effectiveness in generating high-fidelity, identity-preserving, and visually pleasant face video clips from a single source face image."
M6-UFC: Unifying Multi-Modal Controls for Conditional Image Synthesis via Non-Autoregressive Generative Transformers,"Conditional image synthesis aims to create an image according to some multi-modal guidance in the forms of textual descriptions, reference images, and image blocks to preserve, as well as their combinations. In this paper, instead of investigating these control signals separately, we propose a new two-stage architecture, M6-UFC, to unify any number of multi-modal controls. In M6-UFC, both the diverse control signals and the synthesized image are uniformly represented as a sequence of discrete tokens to be processed by Transformer. Different from existing two-stage autoregressive approaches such as DALL-E and VQGAN, M6-UFC adopts non-autoregressive generation (NAR) at the second stage to enhance the holistic consistency of the synthesized image, to support preserving specified image blocks, and to improve the synthesis speed. Further, we design a progressive algorithm that iteratively improves the non-autoregressively generated image, with the help of two estimators developed for evaluating the compliance with the controls and evaluating the fidelity of the synthesized image, respectively. Extensive experiments on a newly collected large-scale clothing dataset M2C-Fashion and a facial dataset Multi-Modal CelebA-HQ verify that M6-UFC can synthesize high-fidelity images that comply with flexible multi-modal controls."
NViSII: A Scriptable Tool for Photorealistic Image Generation,"We present a Python-based renderer built on NVIDIA's OptiX ray tracing engine and the OptiX AI denoiser, designed to generate high-quality synthetic images for research in computer vision and deep learning. Our tool enables the description and manipulation of complex dynamic 3D scenes containing object meshes, materials, textures, lighting, volumetric data (e.g., smoke), and backgrounds. Metadata, such as 2D/3D bounding boxes, segmentation masks, depth maps, normal maps, material properties, and optical flow vectors, can also be generated. In this work, we discuss design goals, architecture, and performance. We demonstrate the use of data generated by path tracing for training an object detector and pose estimator, showing improved performance in sim-to-real transfer in situations that are difficult for traditional raster-based renderers. We offer this tool as an easy-to-use, performant, high-quality renderer for advancing research in synthetic data generation and deep learning."
CogView: Mastering Text-to-Image Generation via Transformers,"Text-to-Image generation in the general domain has long been an open problem, which requires both a powerful generative model and cross-modal understanding. We propose CogView, a 4-billion-parameter Transformer with VQ-VAE tokenizer to advance this problem. We also demonstrate the finetuning strategies for various downstream tasks, e.g. style learning, super-resolution, text-image ranking and fashion design, and methods to stabilize pretraining, e.g. eliminating NaN losses. CogView achieves the state-of-the-art FID on the blurred MS COCO dataset, outperforming previous GAN-based models and a recent similar work DALL-E."
Multi-modal Understanding and Generation for Medical Images and Text via Vision-Language Pre-Training,"Recently a number of studies demonstrated impressive performance on diverse vision-language multi-modal tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering by extending the BERT architecture with multi-modal pre-training objectives. In this work we explore a broad set of multi-modal representation learning tasks in the medical domain, specifically using radiology images and the unstructured report. We propose Medical Vision Language Learner (MedViLL), which adopts a BERT-based architecture combined with a novel multi-modal attention masking scheme to maximize generalization performance for both vision-language understanding tasks (diagnosis classification, medical image-report retrieval, medical visual question answering) and vision-language generation task (radiology report generation). By statistically and rigorously evaluating the proposed model on four downstream tasks with three radiographic image-report datasets (MIMIC-CXR, Open-I, and VQA-RAD), we empirically demonstrate the superior downstream task performance of MedViLL against various baselines, including task-specific architectures. The source code is publicly available at: https://github.com/SuperSupermoon/MedViLL"
Generation of COVID-19 Chest CT Scan Images using Generative Adversarial Networks,"SARS-CoV-2, also known as COVID-19 or Coronavirus, is a viral contagious disease that is infected by a novel coronavirus, and has been rapidly spreading across the globe. It is very important to test and isolate people to reduce spread, and from here comes the need to do this quickly and efficiently. According to some studies, Chest-CT outperforms RT-PCR lab testing, which is the current standard, when diagnosing COVID-19 patients. Due to this, computer vision researchers have developed various deep learning systems that can predict COVID-19 using a Chest-CT scan correctly to a certain degree. The accuracy of these systems is limited since deep learning neural networks such as CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) need a significantly large quantity of data for training in order to produce good quality results. Since the disease is relatively recent and more focus has been on CXR (Chest XRay) images, the available chest CT Scan image dataset is much less. We propose a method, by utilizing GANs, to generate synthetic chest CT images of both positive and negative COVID-19 patients. Using a pre-built predictive model, we concluded that around 40% of the generated images are correctly predicted as COVID-19 positive. The dataset thus generated can be used to train a CNN-based classifier which can help determine COVID-19 in a patient with greater accuracy."
Empirical Analysis of Image Caption Generation using Deep Learning,"Automated image captioning is one of the applications of Deep Learning which involves fusion of work done in computer vision and natural language processing, and it is typically performed using Encoder-Decoder architectures. In this project, we have implemented and experimented with various flavors of multi-modal image captioning networks where ResNet101, DenseNet121 and VGG19 based CNN Encoders and Attention based LSTM Decoders were explored. We have studied the effect of beam size and the use of pretrained word embeddings and compared them to baseline CNN encoder and RNN decoder architecture. The goal is to analyze the performance of each approach using various evaluation metrics including BLEU, CIDEr, ROUGE and METEOR. We have also explored model explainability using Visual Attention Maps (VAM) to highlight parts of the images which has maximum contribution for predicting each word of the generated caption."
Image to Image Translation : Generating maps from satellite images,"Generation of maps from satellite images is conventionally done by a range of tools. Maps became an important part of life whose conversion from satellite images may be a bit expensive but Generative models can pander to this challenge. These models aims at finding the patterns between the input and output image. Image to image translation is employed to convert satellite image to corresponding map. Different techniques for image to image translations like Generative adversarial network, Conditional adversarial networks and Co-Variational Auto encoders are used to generate the corresponding human-readable maps for that region, which takes a satellite image at a given zoom level as its input. We are training our model on Conditional Generative Adversarial Network which comprises of Generator model which which generates fake images while the discriminator tries to classify the image as real or fake and both these models are trained synchronously in adversarial manner where both try to fool each other and result in enhancing model performance."
TarGAN: Target-Aware Generative Adversarial Networks for Multi-modality Medical Image Translation,"Paired multi-modality medical images, can provide complementary information to help physicians make more reasonable decisions than single modality medical images. But they are difficult to generate due to multiple factors in practice (e.g., time, cost, radiation dose). To address these problems, multi-modality medical image translation has aroused increasing research interest recently. However, the existing works mainly focus on translation effect of a whole image instead of a critical target area or Region of Interest (ROI), e.g., organ and so on. This leads to poor-quality translation of the localized target area which becomes blurry, deformed or even with extra unreasonable textures. In this paper, we propose a novel target-aware generative adversarial network called TarGAN, which is a generic multi-modality medical image translation model capable of (1) learning multi-modality medical image translation without relying on paired data, (2) enhancing quality of target area generation with the help of target area labels. The generator of TarGAN jointly learns mapping at two levels simultaneously - whole image translation mapping and target area translation mapping. These two mappings are interrelated through a proposed crossing loss. The experiments on both quantitative measures and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that TarGAN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in all cases. Subsequent segmentation task is conducted to demonstrate effectiveness of synthetic images generated by TarGAN in a real-world application. Our code is available at https://github.com/2165998/TarGAN."
Font Style that Fits an Image -- Font Generation Based on Image Context,"When fonts are used on documents, they are intentionally selected by designers. For example, when designing a book cover, the typography of the text is an important factor in the overall feel of the book. In addition, it needs to be an appropriate font for the rest of the book cover. Thus, we propose a method of generating a book title image based on its context within a book cover. We propose an end-to-end neural network that inputs the book cover, a target location mask, and a desired book title and outputs stylized text suitable for the cover. The proposed network uses a combination of a multi-input encoder-decoder, a text skeleton prediction network, a perception network, and an adversarial discriminator. We demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively produce desirable and appropriate book cover text through quantitative and qualitative results."
Assessing aesthetics of generated abstract images using correlation structure,"Can we generate abstract aesthetic images without bias from natural or human selected image corpi? Are aesthetic images singled out in their correlation functions? In this paper we give answers to these and more questions. We generate images using compositional pattern-producing networks with random weights and varying architecture. We demonstrate that even with the randomly selected weights the correlation functions remain largely determined by the network architecture. In a controlled experiment, human subjects picked aesthetic images out of a large dataset of all generated images. Statistical analysis reveals that the correlation function is indeed different for aesthetic images."
Privacy-Preserving Constrained Domain Generalization for Medical Image Classification,"Deep neural networks (DNN) have demonstrated unprecedented success for medical imaging applications. However, due to the issue of limited dataset availability and the strict legal and ethical requirements for patient privacy protection, the broad applications of medical imaging classification driven by DNN with large-scale training data have been largely hindered. For example, when training the DNN from one domain (e.g., with data only from one hospital), the generalization capability to another domain (e.g., data from another hospital) could be largely lacking. In this paper, we aim to tackle this problem by developing the privacy-preserving constrained domain generalization method, aiming to improve the generalization capability under the privacy-preserving condition. In particular, We propose to improve the information aggregation process on the centralized server-side with a novel gradient alignment loss, expecting that the trained model can be better generalized to the ""unseen"" but related medical images. The rationale and effectiveness of our proposed method can be explained by connecting our proposed method with the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) which has been widely adopted as the distribution distance measurement. Experimental results on two challenging medical imaging classification tasks indicate that our method can achieve better cross-domain generalization capability compared to the state-of-the-art federated learning methods."
Decorating Your Own Bedroom: Locally Controlling Image Generation with Generative Adversarial Networks,"Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have made great success in synthesizing high-quality images. However, how to steer the generation process of a well-trained GAN model and customize the output image is much less explored. It has been recently found that modulating the input latent code used in GANs can reasonably alter some variation factors in the output image, but such manipulation usually presents to change the entire image as a whole. In this work, we propose an effective approach, termed as LoGAN, to support local editing of the output image. Concretely, we introduce two operators, i.e., content modulation and style modulation, together with a priority mask to facilitate the precise control of the intermediate generative features. Taking bedroom synthesis as an instance, we are able to seamlessly remove, insert, shift, and rotate the individual objects inside a room. Furthermore, our method can completely clear out a room and then refurnish it with customized furniture and styles. Experimental results show the great potentials of steering the image generation of pre-trained GANs for versatile image editing."
Finding an Unsupervised Image Segmenter in Each of Your Deep Generative Models,"Recent research has shown that numerous human-interpretable directions exist in the latent space of GANs. In this paper, we develop an automatic procedure for finding directions that lead to foreground-background image separation, and we use these directions to train an image segmentation model without human supervision. Our method is generator-agnostic, producing strong segmentation results with a wide range of different GAN architectures. Furthermore, by leveraging GANs pretrained on large datasets such as ImageNet, we are able to segment images from a range of domains without further training or finetuning. Evaluating our method on image segmentation benchmarks, we compare favorably to prior work while using neither human supervision nor access to the training data. Broadly, our results demonstrate that automatically extracting foreground-background structure from pretrained deep generative models can serve as a remarkably effective substitute for human supervision."
ExSinGAN: Learning an Explainable Generative Model from a Single Image,"Generating images from a single sample, as a newly developing branch of image synthesis, has attracted extensive attention. In this paper, we formulate this problem as sampling from the conditional distribution of a single image, and propose a hierarchical framework that simplifies the learning of the intricate conditional distributions through the successive learning of the distributions about structure, semantics and texture, making the process of learning and generation comprehensible. On this basis, we design ExSinGAN composed of three cascaded GANs for learning an explainable generative model from a given image, where the cascaded GANs model the distributions about structure, semantics and texture successively. ExSinGAN is learned not only from the internal patches of the given image as the previous works did, but also from the external prior obtained by the GAN inversion technique. Benefiting from the appropriate combination of internal and external information, ExSinGAN has a more powerful capability of generation and competitive generalization ability for the image manipulation tasks compared with prior works."
Multi-scale super-resolution generation of low-resolution scanned pathological images,"Background. Digital pathology has aroused widespread interest in modern pathology. The key of digitalization is to scan the whole slide image (WSI) at high magnification. The lager the magnification is, the richer details WSI will provide, but the scanning time is longer and the file size of obtained is larger. Methods. We design a strategy to scan slides with low resolution (5X) and a super-resolution method is proposed to restore the image details when in diagnosis. The method is based on a multi-scale generative adversarial network, which sequentially generates three high-resolution images such as 10X, 20X and 40X. Results. The peak-signal-to-noise-ratio of 10X to 40X generated images are 24.16, 22.27 and 20.44, and the structural-similarity-index are 0.845, 0.680 and 0.512, which are better than other super-resolution networks. Visual scoring average and standard deviation from three pathologists is 3.63 plus-minus 0.52, 3.70 plus-minus 0.57 and 3.74 plus-minus 0.56 and the p value of analysis of variance is 0.37, indicating that generated images include sufficient information for diagnosis. The average value of Kappa test is 0.99, meaning the diagnosis of generated images is highly consistent with that of the real images. Conclusion. This proposed method can generate high-quality 10X, 20X, 40X images from 5X images at the same time, in which the time and storage costs of digitalization can be effectively reduced up to 1/64 of the previous costs. The proposed method provides a better alternative for low-cost storage, faster image share of digital pathology. Keywords. Digital pathology; Super-resolution; Low resolution scanning; Low cost"
Verification of Image-based Neural Network Controllers Using Generative Models,"Neural networks are often used to process information from image-based sensors to produce control actions. While they are effective for this task, the complex nature of neural networks makes their output difficult to verify and predict, limiting their use in safety-critical systems. For this reason, recent work has focused on combining techniques in formal methods and reachability analysis to obtain guarantees on the closed-loop performance of neural network controllers. However, these techniques do not scale to the high-dimensional and complicated input space of image-based neural network controllers. In this work, we propose a method to address these challenges by training a generative adversarial network (GAN) to map states to plausible input images. By concatenating the generator network with the control network, we obtain a network with a low-dimensional input space. This insight allows us to use existing closed-loop verification tools to obtain formal guarantees on the performance of image-based controllers. We apply our approach to provide safety guarantees for an image-based neural network controller for an autonomous aircraft taxi problem. We guarantee that the controller will keep the aircraft on the runway and guide the aircraft towards the center of the runway. The guarantees we provide are with respect to the set of input images modeled by our generator network, so we provide a recall metric to evaluate how well the generator captures the space of plausible images."
Learning to Generate Novel Scene Compositions from Single Images and Videos,"Training GANs in low-data regimes remains a challenge, as overfitting often leads to memorization or training divergence. In this work, we introduce One-Shot GAN that can learn to generate samples from a training set as little as one image or one video. We propose a two-branch discriminator, with content and layout branches designed to judge the internal content separately from the scene layout realism. This allows synthesis of visually plausible, novel compositions of a scene, with varying content and layout, while preserving the context of the original sample. Compared to previous single-image GAN models, One-Shot GAN achieves higher diversity and quality of synthesis. It is also not restricted to the single image setting, successfully learning in the introduced setting of a single video."
ReflectNet -- A Generative Adversarial Method for Single Image Reflection Suppression,"Taking pictures through glass windows almost always produces undesired reflections that degrade the quality of the photo. The ill-posed nature of the reflection removal problem reached the attention of many researchers for more than decades. The main challenge of this problem is the lack of real training data and the necessity of generating realistic synthetic data. In this paper, we proposed a single image reflection removal method based on context understanding modules and adversarial training to efficiently restore the transmission layer without reflection. We also propose a complex data generation model in order to create a large training set with various type of reflections. Our proposed reflection removal method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of PSNR and SSIM on the SIR benchmark dataset."
Sparse image reconstruction on the sphere: a general approach with uncertainty quantification,"Inverse problems defined naturally on the sphere are becoming increasingly of interest. In this article we provide a general framework for evaluation of inverse problems on the sphere, with a strong emphasis on flexibility and scalability. We consider flexibility with respect to the prior selection (regularization), the problem definition - specifically the problem formulation (constrained/unconstrained) and problem setting (analysis/synthesis) - and optimization adopted to solve the problem. We discuss and quantify the trade-offs between problem formulation and setting. Crucially, we consider the Bayesian interpretation of the unconstrained problem which, combined with recent developments in probability density theory, permits rapid, statistically principled uncertainty quantification (UQ) in the spherical setting. Linearity is exploited to significantly increase the computational efficiency of such UQ techniques, which in some cases are shown to permit analytic solutions. We showcase this reconstruction framework and UQ techniques on a variety of spherical inverse problems. The code discussed throughout is provided under a GNU general public license, in both C++ and Python."
Towards Discovery and Attribution of Open-world GAN Generated Images,"With the recent progress in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), it is imperative for media and visual forensics to develop detectors which can identify and attribute images to the model generating them. Existing works have shown to attribute images to their corresponding GAN sources with high accuracy. However, these works are limited to a closed set scenario, failing to generalize to GANs unseen during train time and are therefore, not scalable with a steady influx of new GANs. We present an iterative algorithm for discovering images generated from previously unseen GANs by exploiting the fact that all GANs leave distinct fingerprints on their generated images. Our algorithm consists of multiple components including network training, out-of-distribution detection, clustering, merge and refine steps. Through extensive experiments, we show that our algorithm discovers unseen GANs with high accuracy and also generalizes to GANs trained on unseen real datasets. We additionally apply our algorithm to attribution and discovery of GANs in an online fashion as well as to the more standard task of real/fake detection. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to discover new GANs and can be used in an open-world setup."
"Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) Powered Fast Magnetic Resonance Imaging -- Mini Review, Comparison and Perspectives","Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a vital component of medical imaging. When compared to other image modalities, it has advantages such as the absence of radiation, superior soft tissue contrast, and complementary multiple sequence information. However, one drawback of MRI is its comparatively slow scanning and reconstruction compared to other image modalities, limiting its usage in some clinical applications when imaging time is critical. Traditional compressive sensing based MRI (CS-MRI) reconstruction can speed up MRI acquisition, but suffers from a long iterative process and noise-induced artefacts. Recently, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been used in sparse MRI reconstruction models to recreate relatively high-quality images from heavily undersampled k-space data, allowing for much faster MRI scanning. However, there are still some hurdles to tackle. For example, directly training DNNs based on L1/L2 distance to the target fully sampled images could result in blurry reconstruction because L1/L2 loss can only enforce overall image or patch similarity and does not take into account local information such as anatomical sharpness. It is also hard to preserve fine image details while maintaining a natural appearance. More recently, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) based methods are proposed to solve fast MRI with enhanced image perceptual quality. The encoder obtains a latent space for the undersampling image, and the image is reconstructed by the decoder using the GAN loss. In this chapter, we review the GAN powered fast MRI methods with a comparative study on various anatomical datasets to demonstrate the generalisability and robustness of this kind of fast MRI while providing future perspectives."
A Good Image Generator Is What You Need for High-Resolution Video Synthesis,"Image and video synthesis are closely related areas aiming at generating content from noise. While rapid progress has been demonstrated in improving image-based models to handle large resolutions, high-quality renderings, and wide variations in image content, achieving comparable video generation results remains problematic. We present a framework that leverages contemporary image generators to render high-resolution videos. We frame the video synthesis problem as discovering a trajectory in the latent space of a pre-trained and fixed image generator. Not only does such a framework render high-resolution videos, but it also is an order of magnitude more computationally efficient. We introduce a motion generator that discovers the desired trajectory, in which content and motion are disentangled. With such a representation, our framework allows for a broad range of applications, including content and motion manipulation. Furthermore, we introduce a new task, which we call cross-domain video synthesis, in which the image and motion generators are trained on disjoint datasets belonging to different domains. This allows for generating moving objects for which the desired video data is not available. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the advantages of our methods over existing video generation techniques. Code will be released at https://github.com/snap-research/MoCoGAN-HD."
Pose-driven Attention-guided Image Generation for Person Re-Identification,"Person re-identification (re-ID) concerns the matching of subject images across different camera views in a multi camera surveillance system. One of the major challenges in person re-ID is pose variations across the camera network, which significantly affects the appearance of a person. Existing development data lack adequate pose variations to carry out effective training of person re-ID systems. To solve this issue, in this paper we propose an end-to-end pose-driven attention-guided generative adversarial network, to generate multiple poses of a person. We propose to attentively learn and transfer the subject pose through an attention mechanism. A semantic-consistency loss is proposed to preserve the semantic information of the person during pose transfer. To ensure fine image details are realistic after pose translation, an appearance discriminator is used while a pose discriminator is used to ensure the pose of the transferred images will exactly be the same as the target pose. We show that by incorporating the proposed approach in a person re-identification framework, realistic pose transferred images and state-of-the-art re-identification results can be achieved."
CAGAN: Text-To-Image Generation with Combined Attention GANs,"Generating images according to natural language descriptions is a challenging task. Prior research has mainly focused to enhance the quality of generation by investigating the use of spatial attention and/or textual attention thereby neglecting the relationship between channels. In this work, we propose the Combined Attention Generative Adversarial Network (CAGAN) to generate photo-realistic images according to textual descriptions. The proposed CAGAN utilises two attention models: word attention to draw different sub-regions conditioned on related words; and squeeze-and-excitation attention to capture non-linear interaction among channels. With spectral normalisation to stabilise training, our proposed CAGAN improves the state of the art on the IS and FID on the CUB dataset and the FID on the more challenging COCO dataset. Furthermore, we demonstrate that judging a model by a single evaluation metric can be misleading by developing an additional model adding local self-attention which scores a higher IS, outperforming the state of the art on the CUB dataset, but generates unrealistic images through feature repetition."
Making Generated Images Hard To Spot: A Transferable Attack On Synthetic Image Detectors,"Visually realistic GAN-generated images have recently emerged as an important misinformation threat. Research has shown that these synthetic images contain forensic traces that are readily identifiable by forensic detectors. Unfortunately, these detectors are built upon neural networks, which are vulnerable to recently developed adversarial attacks. In this paper, we propose a new anti-forensic attack capable of fooling GAN-generated image detectors. Our attack uses an adversarially trained generator to synthesize traces that these detectors associate with real images. Furthermore, we propose a technique to train our attack so that it can achieve transferability, i.e. it can fool unknown CNNs that it was not explicitly trained against. We evaluate our attack through an extensive set of experiments, where we show that our attack can fool eight state-of-the-art detection CNNs with synthetic images created using seven different GANs, and outperform other alternative attacks."
Piggyback GAN: Efficient Lifelong Learning for Image Conditioned Generation,"Humans accumulate knowledge in a lifelong fashion. Modern deep neural networks, on the other hand, are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting: when adapted to perform new tasks, they often fail to preserve their performance on previously learned tasks. Given a sequence of tasks, a naive approach addressing catastrophic forgetting is to train a separate standalone model for each task, which scales the total number of parameters drastically without efficiently utilizing previous models. In contrast, we propose a parameter efficient framework, Piggyback GAN, which learns the current task by building a set of convolutional and deconvolutional filters that are factorized into filters of the models trained on previous tasks. For the current task, our model achieves high generation quality on par with a standalone model at a lower number of parameters. For previous tasks, our model can also preserve generation quality since the filters for previous tasks are not altered. We validate Piggyback GAN on various image-conditioned generation tasks across different domains, and provide qualitative and quantitative results to show that the proposed approach can address catastrophic forgetting effectively and efficiently."
Shadow Generation for Composite Image in Real-world Scenes,"Image composition targets at inserting a foreground object into a background image. Most previous image composition methods focus on adjusting the foreground to make it compatible with background while ignoring the shadow effect of foreground on the background. In this work, we focus on generating plausible shadow for the foreground object in the composite image. First, we contribute a real-world shadow generation dataset DESOBA by generating synthetic composite images based on paired real images and deshadowed images. Then, we propose a novel shadow generation network SGRNet, which consists of a shadow mask prediction stage and a shadow filling stage. In the shadow mask prediction stage, foreground and background information are thoroughly interacted to generate foreground shadow mask. In the shadow filling stage, shadow parameters are predicted to fill the shadow area. Extensive experiments on our DESOBA dataset and real composite images demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our dataset and code are available at https://github.com/bcmi/Object-Shadow-Generation-Dataset-DESOBA."
SRWarp: Generalized Image Super-Resolution under Arbitrary Transformation,"Deep CNNs have achieved significant successes in image processing and its applications, including single image super-resolution (SR). However, conventional methods still resort to some predetermined integer scaling factors, e.g., x2 or x4. Thus, they are difficult to be applied when arbitrary target resolutions are required. Recent approaches extend the scope to real-valued upsampling factors, even with varying aspect ratios to handle the limitation. In this paper, we propose the SRWarp framework to further generalize the SR tasks toward an arbitrary image transformation. We interpret the traditional image warping task, specifically when the input is enlarged, as a spatially-varying SR problem. We also propose several novel formulations, including the adaptive warping layer and multiscale blending, to reconstruct visually favorable results in the transformation process. Compared with previous methods, we do not constrain the SR model on a regular grid but allow numerous possible deformations for flexible and diverse image editing. Extensive experiments and ablation studies justify the necessity and demonstrate the advantage of the proposed SRWarp method under various transformations."
BraidNet: procedural generation of neural networks for image classification problems using braid theory,"In this article, we propose the approach to procedural optimization of a neural network, based on the combination of information theory and braid theory. The network studied in the article implemented with the intersections between the braid strands, as well as simplified networks (a network with strands without intersections and a simple convolutional deep neural network), are used to solve various problems of multiclass image classification that allow us to analyze the comparative effectiveness of the proposed architecture. The simulation results showed BraidNet's comparative advantage in learning speed and classification accuracy."
Free-form tumor synthesis in computed tomography images via richer generative adversarial network,"The insufficiency of annotated medical imaging scans for cancer makes it challenging to train and validate data-hungry deep learning models in precision oncology. We propose a new richer generative adversarial network for free-form 3D tumor/lesion synthesis in computed tomography (CT) images. The network is composed of a new richer convolutional feature enhanced dilated-gated generator (RicherDG) and a hybrid loss function. The RicherDG has dilated-gated convolution layers to enable tumor-painting and to enlarge perceptive fields; and it has a novel richer convolutional feature association branch to recover multi-scale convolutional features especially from uncertain boundaries between tumor and surrounding healthy tissues. The hybrid loss function, which consists of a diverse range of losses, is designed to aggregate complementary information to improve optimization.  We perform a comprehensive evaluation of the synthesis results on a wide range of public CT image datasets covering the liver, kidney tumors, and lung nodules. The qualitative and quantitative evaluations and ablation study demonstrated improved synthesizing results over advanced tumor synthesis methods."
Towards Open-World Text-Guided Face Image Generation and Manipulation,"The existing text-guided image synthesis methods can only produce limited quality results with at most \mbox{\text{256}^2} resolution and the textual instructions are constrained in a small Corpus. In this work, we propose a unified framework for both face image generation and manipulation that produces diverse and high-quality images with an unprecedented resolution at 1024 from multimodal inputs. More importantly, our method supports open-world scenarios, including both image and text, without any re-training, fine-tuning, or post-processing. To be specific, we propose a brand new paradigm of text-guided image generation and manipulation based on the superior characteristics of a pretrained GAN model. Our proposed paradigm includes two novel strategies. The first strategy is to train a text encoder to obtain latent codes that align with the hierarchically semantic of the aforementioned pretrained GAN model. The second strategy is to directly optimize the latent codes in the latent space of the pretrained GAN model with guidance from a pretrained language model. The latent codes can be randomly sampled from a prior distribution or inverted from a given image, which provides inherent supports for both image generation and manipulation from multi-modal inputs, such as sketches or semantic labels, with textual guidance. To facilitate text-guided multi-modal synthesis, we propose the Multi-Modal CelebA-HQ, a large-scale dataset consisting of real face images and corresponding semantic segmentation map, sketch, and textual descriptions. Extensive experiments on the introduced dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method. Code and data are available at https://github.com/weihaox/TediGAN."
Concadia: Towards Image-Based Text Generation with a Purpose,"Current deep learning models often achieve excellent results on benchmark image-to-text datasets but fail to generate texts that are useful in practice. We argue that to close this gap, it is vital to distinguish descriptions from captions based on their distinct communicative roles. Descriptions focus on visual features and are meant to replace an image (often to increase accessibility), whereas captions appear alongside an image to supply additional information. To motivate this distinction and help people put it into practice, we introduce the publicly available Wikipedia-based dataset Concadia consisting of 96,918 images with corresponding English-language descriptions, captions, and surrounding context. Using insights from Concadia, models trained on it, and a preregistered human-subjects experiment with human- and model-generated texts, we characterize the commonalities and differences between descriptions and captions. In addition, we show that, for generating both descriptions and captions, it is useful to augment image-to-text models with representations of the textual context in which the image appeared."
"Dressing in Order: Recurrent Person Image Generation for Pose Transfer, Virtual Try-on and Outfit Editing","We propose a flexible person generation framework called Dressing in Order (DiOr), which supports 2D pose transfer, virtual try-on, and several fashion editing tasks. The key to DiOr is a novel recurrent generation pipeline to sequentially put garments on a person, so that trying on the same garments in different orders will result in different looks. Our system can produce dressing effects not achievable by existing work, including different interactions of garments (e.g., wearing a top tucked into the bottom or over it), as well as layering of multiple garments of the same type (e.g., jacket over shirt over t-shirt). DiOr explicitly encodes the shape and texture of each garment, enabling these elements to be edited separately. Joint training on pose transfer and inpainting helps with detail preservation and coherence of generated garments. Extensive evaluations show that DiOr outperforms other recent methods like ADGAN in terms of output quality, and handles a wide range of editing functions for which there is no direct supervision."
Few-shot Image Generation via Cross-domain Correspondence,"Training generative models, such as GANs, on a target domain containing limited examples (e.g., 10) can easily result in overfitting. In this work, we seek to utilize a large source domain for pretraining and transfer the diversity information from source to target. We propose to preserve the relative similarities and differences between instances in the source via a novel cross-domain distance consistency loss. To further reduce overfitting, we present an anchor-based strategy to encourage different levels of realism over different regions in the latent space. With extensive results in both photorealistic and non-photorealistic domains, we demonstrate qualitatively and quantitatively that our few-shot model automatically discovers correspondences between source and target domains and generates more diverse and realistic images than previous methods."
Learning Semantic Person Image Generation by Region-Adaptive Normalization,"Human pose transfer has received great attention due to its wide applications, yet is still a challenging task that is not well solved. Recent works have achieved great success to transfer the person image from the source to the target pose. However, most of them cannot well capture the semantic appearance, resulting in inconsistent and less realistic textures on the reconstructed results. To address this issue, we propose a new two-stage framework to handle the pose and appearance translation. In the first stage, we predict the target semantic parsing maps to eliminate the difficulties of pose transfer and further benefit the latter translation of per-region appearance style. In the second one, with the predicted target semantic maps, we suggest a new person image generation method by incorporating the region-adaptive normalization, in which it takes the per-region styles to guide the target appearance generation. Extensive experiments show that our proposed SPGNet can generate more semantic, consistent, and photo-realistic results and perform favorably against the state of the art methods in terms of quantitative and qualitative evaluation. The source code and model are available at https://github.com/cszy98/SPGNet.git."
CoPE: Conditional image generation using Polynomial Expansions,"Generative modeling has evolved to a notable field of machine learning. Deep polynomial neural networks (PNNs) have demonstrated impressive results in unsupervised image generation, where the task is to map an input vector (i.e., noise) to a synthesized image. However, the success of PNNs has not been replicated in conditional generation tasks, such as super-resolution. Existing PNNs focus on single-variable polynomial expansions which do not fare well to two-variable inputs, i.e., the noise variable and the conditional variable. In this work, we introduce a general framework, called CoPE, that enables a polynomial expansion of two input variables and captures their auto- and cross-correlations. We exhibit how CoPE can be trivially augmented to accept an arbitrary number of input variables. CoPE is evaluated in five tasks (class-conditional generation, inverse problems, edges-to-image translation, image-to-image translation, attribute-guided generation) involving eight datasets. The thorough evaluation suggests that CoPE can be useful for tackling diverse conditional generation tasks. The source code of CoPE is available at \url{https://github.com/grigorisg9gr/polynomial_nets_for_conditional_generation}."
SIGAN: A Novel Image Generation Method for Solar Cell Defect Segmentation and Augmentation,"Solar cell electroluminescence (EL) defect segmentation is an interesting and challenging topic. Many methods have been proposed for EL defect detection, but these methods are still unsatisfactory due to the diversity of the defect and background. In this paper, we provide a new idea of using generative adversarial network (GAN) for defect segmentation. Firstly, the GAN-based method removes the defect region in the input defective image to get a defect-free image, while keeping the background almost unchanged. Then, the subtracted image is obtained by making difference between the defective input image with the generated defect-free image. Finally, the defect region can be segmented through thresholding the subtracted image. To keep the background unchanged before and after image generation, we propose a novel strong identity GAN (SIGAN), which adopts a novel strong identity loss to constraint the background consistency. The SIGAN can be used not only for defect segmentation, but also small-samples defective dataset augmentation. Moreover, we release a new solar cell EL image dataset named as EL-2019, which includes three types of images: crack, finger interruption and defect-free. Experiments on EL-2019 dataset show that the proposed method achieves 90.34% F-score, which outperforms many state-of-the-art methods in terms of solar cell defects segmentation results."
Distilling and Transferring Knowledge via cGAN-generated Samples for Image Classification and Regression,"Knowledge distillation (KD) has been actively studied for image classification tasks in deep learning, aiming to improve the performance of a student based on the knowledge from a teacher. However, applying KD in image regression with a scalar response variable has been rarely studied, and there exists no KD method applicable to both classification and regression tasks yet. Moreover, existing KD methods often require a practitioner to carefully select or adjust the teacher and student architectures, making these methods less flexible in practice. To address the above problems in a unified way, we propose a comprehensive KD framework based on cGANs, termed cGAN-KD. Fundamentally different from existing KD methods, cGAN-KD distills and transfers knowledge from a teacher model to a student model via cGAN-generated samples. This novel mechanism makes cGAN-KD suitable for both classification and regression tasks, compatible with other KD methods, and insensitive to the teacher and student architectures. An error bound for a student model trained in the cGAN-KD framework is derived in this work, providing a theory for why cGAN-KD is effective as well as guiding the practical implementation of cGAN-KD. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-100 show that we can combine state of the art KD methods with the cGAN-KD framework to yield a new state of the art. Moreover, experiments on Steering Angle and UTKFace demonstrate the effectiveness of cGAN-KD in image regression tasks, where existing KD methods are inapplicable."
[RE] CNN-generated images are surprisingly easy to spot...for now,"This work evaluates the reproducibility of the paper ""CNN-generated images are surprisingly easy to spot... for now"" by Wang et al. published at CVPR 2020. The paper addresses the challenge of detecting CNN-generated imagery, which has reached the potential to even fool humans. The authors propose two methods which help an image classifier to generalize from being trained on one specific CNN to detecting imagery produced by unseen architectures, training methods, or data sets. The paper proposes two methods to help a classifier generalize: (i) utilizing different kinds of data augmentations and (ii) using a diverse data set. This report focuses on assessing if these techniques indeed help the generalization process. Furthermore, we perform additional experiments to study the limitations of the proposed techniques."
Are GAN generated images easy to detect? A critical analysis of the state-of-the-art,"The advent of deep learning has brought a significant improvement in the quality of generated media. However, with the increased level of photorealism, synthetic media are becoming hardly distinguishable from real ones, raising serious concerns about the spread of fake or manipulated information over the Internet. In this context, it is important to develop automated tools to reliably and timely detect synthetic media. In this work, we analyze the state-of-the-art methods for the detection of synthetic images, highlighting the key ingredients of the most successful approaches, and comparing their performance over existing generative architectures. We will devote special attention to realistic and challenging scenarios, like media uploaded on social networks or generated by new and unseen architectures, analyzing the impact of suitable augmentation and training strategies on the detectors' generalization ability."
Jekyll: Attacking Medical Image Diagnostics using Deep Generative Models,"Advances in deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown tremendous promise in the medical domain. However, the deep learning tools that are helping the domain, can also be used against it. Given the prevalence of fraud in the healthcare domain, it is important to consider the adversarial use of DNNs in manipulating sensitive data that is crucial to patient healthcare. In this work, we present the design and implementation of a DNN-based image translation attack on biomedical imagery. More specifically, we propose Jekyll, a neural style transfer framework that takes as input a biomedical image of a patient and translates it to a new image that indicates an attacker-chosen disease condition. The potential for fraudulent claims based on such generated 'fake' medical images is significant, and we demonstrate successful attacks on both X-rays and retinal fundus image modalities. We show that these attacks manage to mislead both medical professionals and algorithmic detection schemes. Lastly, we also investigate defensive measures based on machine learning to detect images generated by Jekyll."
Explainability-aided Domain Generalization for Image Classification,"Traditionally, for most machine learning settings, gaining some degree of explainability that tries to give users more insights into how and why the network arrives at its predictions, restricts the underlying model and hinders performance to a certain degree. For example, decision trees are thought of as being more explainable than deep neural networks but they lack performance on visual tasks. In this work, we empirically demonstrate that applying methods and architectures from the explainability literature can, in fact, achieve state-of-the-art performance for the challenging task of domain generalization while offering a framework for more insights into the prediction and training process. For that, we develop a set of novel algorithms including DivCAM, an approach where the network receives guidance during training via gradient based class activation maps to focus on a diverse set of discriminative features, as well as ProDrop and D-Transformers which apply prototypical networks to the domain generalization task, either with self-challenging or attention alignment. Since these methods offer competitive performance on top of explainability, we argue that the proposed methods can be used as a tool to improve the robustness of deep neural network architectures."
MR-Contrast-Aware Image-to-Image Translations with Generative Adversarial Networks,"Purpose  A Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) exam typically consists of several sequences that yield different image contrasts. Each sequence is parameterized through multiple acquisition parameters that influence image contrast, signal-to-noise ratio, acquisition time, and/or resolution. Depending on the clinical indication, different contrasts are required by the radiologist to make a diagnosis. As MR sequence acquisition is time consuming and acquired images may be corrupted due to motion, a method to synthesize MR images with adjustable contrast properties is required.  Methods  Therefore, we trained an image-to-image generative adversarial network conditioned on the MR acquisition parameters repetition time and echo time. Our approach is motivated by style transfer networks, whereas the ""style"" for an image is explicitly given in our case, as it is determined by the MR acquisition parameters our network is conditioned on.  Results  This enables us to synthesize MR images with adjustable image contrast. We evaluated our approach on the fastMRI dataset, a large set of publicly available MR knee images, and show that our method outperforms a benchmark pix2pix approach in the translation of non-fat-saturated MR images to fat-saturated images. Our approach yields a peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity of 24.48 and 0.66, surpassing the pix2pix benchmark model significantly.  Conclusion  Our model is the first that enables fine-tuned contrast synthesis, which can be used to synthesize missing MR contrasts or as a data augmentation technique for AI training in MRI."
Generation of Gradient-Preserving Images allowing HOG Feature Extraction,"In this paper, we propose a method for generating visually protected images, referred to as gradient-preserving images. The protected images allow us to directly extract Histogram-of-Oriented-Gradients (HOG) features for privacy-preserving machine learning. In an experiment, HOG features extracted from gradient-preserving images are applied to a face recognition algorithm to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."
Text to Image Generation with Semantic-Spatial Aware GAN,"Text-to-image synthesis (T2I) aims to generate photo-realistic images which are semantically consistent with the text descriptions. Existing methods are usually built upon conditional generative adversarial networks (GANs) and initialize an image from noise with sentence embedding, and then refine the features with fine-grained word embedding iteratively. A close inspection of their generated images reveals a major limitation: even though the generated image holistically matches the description, individual image regions or parts of somethings are often not recognizable or consistent with words in the sentence, e.g. ""a white crown"". To address this problem, we propose a novel framework Semantic-Spatial Aware GAN for synthesizing images from input text. Concretely, we introduce a simple and effective Semantic-Spatial Aware block, which (1) learns semantic-adaptive transformation conditioned on text to effectively fuse text features and image features, and (2) learns a semantic mask in a weakly-supervised way that depends on the current text-image fusion process in order to guide the transformation spatially. Experiments on the challenging COCO and CUB bird datasets demonstrate the advantage of our method over the recent state-of-the-art approaches, regarding both visual fidelity and alignment with input text description."
Improved Image Generation via Sparse Modeling,"The interest of the deep learning community in image synthesis has grown massively in recent years. Nowadays, deep generative methods, and especially Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), are leading to state-of-the-art performance, capable of synthesizing images that appear realistic. While the efforts for improving the quality of the generated images are extensive, most attempts still consider the generator part as an uncorroborated ""black-box"". In this paper, we aim to provide a better understanding and design of the image generation process. We interpret existing generators as implicitly relying on sparsity-inspired models. More specifically, we show that generators can be viewed as manifestations of the Convolutional Sparse Coding (CSC) and its Multi-Layered version (ML-CSC) synthesis processes. We leverage this observation by explicitly enforcing a sparsifying regularization on appropriately chosen activation layers in the generator, and demonstrate that this leads to improved image synthesis. Furthermore, we show that the same rationale and benefits apply to generators serving inverse problems, demonstrated on the Deep Image Prior (DIP) method."
Exploiting Relationship for Complex-scene Image Generation,"The significant progress on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) has facilitated realistic single-object image generation based on language input. However, complex-scene generation (with various interactions among multiple objects) still suffers from messy layouts and object distortions, due to diverse configurations in layouts and appearances. Prior methods are mostly object-driven and ignore their inter-relations that play a significant role in complex-scene images. This work explores relationship-aware complex-scene image generation, where multiple objects are inter-related as a scene graph. With the help of relationships, we propose three major updates in the generation framework. First, reasonable spatial layouts are inferred by jointly considering the semantics and relationships among objects. Compared to standard location regression, we show relative scales and distances serve a more reliable target. Second, since the relations between objects significantly influence an object's appearance, we design a relation-guided generator to generate objects reflecting their relationships. Third, a novel scene graph discriminator is proposed to guarantee the consistency between the generated image and the input scene graph. Our method tends to synthesize plausible layouts and objects, respecting the interplay of multiple objects in an image. Experimental results on Visual Genome and HICO-DET datasets show that our proposed method significantly outperforms prior arts in terms of IS and FID metrics. Based on our user study and visual inspection, our method is more effective in generating logical layout and appearance for complex-scenes."
A Closer Look at Fourier Spectrum Discrepancies for CNN-generated Images Detection,"CNN-based generative modelling has evolved to produce synthetic images indistinguishable from real images in the RGB pixel space. Recent works have observed that CNN-generated images share a systematic shortcoming in replicating high frequency Fourier spectrum decay attributes. Furthermore, these works have successfully exploited this systematic shortcoming to detect CNN-generated images reporting up to 99% accuracy across multiple state-of-the-art GAN models.  In this work, we investigate the validity of assertions claiming that CNN-generated images are unable to achieve high frequency spectral decay consistency. We meticulously construct a counterexample space of high frequency spectral decay consistent CNN-generated images emerging from our handcrafted experiments using DCGAN, LSGAN, WGAN-GP and StarGAN, where we empirically show that this frequency discrepancy can be avoided by a minor architecture change in the last upsampling operation. We subsequently use images from this counterexample space to successfully bypass the recently proposed forensics detector which leverages on high frequency Fourier spectrum decay attributes for CNN-generated image detection.  Through this study, we show that high frequency Fourier spectrum decay discrepancies are not inherent characteristics for existing CNN-based generative models--contrary to the belief of some existing work--, and such features are not robust to perform synthetic image detection. Our results prompt re-thinking of using high frequency Fourier spectrum decay attributes for CNN-generated image detection. Code and models are available at https://keshik6.github.io/Fourier-Discrepancies-CNN-Detection/"
Semantic-guided Automatic Natural Image Matting with Trimap Generation Network and Light-weight Non-local Attention,"Natural image matting aims to precisely separate foreground objects from background using alpha matte. Fully automatic natural image matting without external annotation is challenging. Well-performed matting methods usually require accurate labor-intensive handcrafted trimap as extra input, while the performance of automatic trimap generation method of dilating foreground segmentation fluctuates with segmentation quality. Therefore, we argue that how to handle trade-off of additional information input is a major issue in automatic matting. This paper presents a semantic-guided automatic natural image matting pipeline with Trimap Generation Network and light-weight non-local attention, which does not need trimap and background as input. Specifically, guided by foreground segmentation, Trimap Generation Network estimates accurate trimap. Then, with estimated trimap as guidance, our light-weight Non-local Matting Network with Refinement produces final alpha matte, whose trimap-guided global aggregation attention block is equipped with stride downsampling convolution, reducing computation complexity and promoting performance. Experimental results show that our matting algorithm has competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods in both trimap-free and trimap-needed aspects."
Generating Multi-scale Maps from Remote Sensing Images via Series Generative Adversarial Networks,"Considering the success of generative adversarial networks (GANs) for image-to-image translation, researchers have attempted to translate remote sensing images (RSIs) to maps (rs2map) through GAN for cartography. However, these studies involved limited scales, which hinders multi-scale map creation. By extending their method, multi-scale RSIs can be trivially translated to multi-scale maps (multi-scale rs2map translation) through scale-wise rs2map models trained for certain scales (parallel strategy). However, this strategy has two theoretical limitations. First, inconsistency between various spatial resolutions of multi-scale RSIs and object generalization on multi-scale maps (RS-m inconsistency) increasingly complicate the extraction of geographical information from RSIs for rs2map models with decreasing scale. Second, as rs2map translation is cross-domain, generators incur high computation costs to transform the RSI pixel distribution to that on maps. Thus, we designed a series strategy of generators for multi-scale rs2map translation to address these limitations. In this strategy, high-resolution RSIs are inputted to an rs2map model to output large-scale maps, which are translated to multi-scale maps through series multi-scale map translation models. The series strategy avoids RS-m inconsistency as inputs are high-resolution large-scale RSIs, and reduces the distribution gap in multi-scale map generation through similar pixel distributions among multi-scale maps. Our experimental results showed better quality multi-scale map generation with the series strategy, as shown by average increases of 11.69%, 53.78%, 55.42%, and 72.34% in the structural similarity index, edge structural similarity index, intersection over union (road), and intersection over union (water) for data from Mexico City and Tokyo at zoom level 17-13."
Multi-Class Multi-Instance Count Conditioned Adversarial Image Generation,"Image generation has rapidly evolved in recent years. Modern architectures for adversarial training allow to generate even high resolution images with remarkable quality. At the same time, more and more effort is dedicated towards controlling the content of generated images. In this paper, we take one further step in this direction and propose a conditional generative adversarial network (GAN) that generates images with a defined number of objects from given classes. This entails two fundamental abilities (1) being able to generate high-quality images given a complex constraint and (2) being able to count object instances per class in a given image. Our proposed model modularly extends the successful StyleGAN2 architecture with a count-based conditioning as well as with a regression sub-network to count the number of generated objects per class during training. In experiments on three different datasets, we show that the proposed model learns to generate images according to the given multiple-class count condition even in the presence of complex backgrounds. In particular, we propose a new dataset, CityCount, which is derived from the Cityscapes street scenes dataset, to evaluate our approach in a challenging and practically relevant scenario."
Diagonal Attention and Style-based GAN for Content-Style Disentanglement in Image Generation and Translation,"One of the important research topics in image generative models is to disentangle the spatial contents and styles for their separate control. Although StyleGAN can generate content feature vectors from random noises, the resulting spatial content control is primarily intended for minor spatial variations, and the disentanglement of global content and styles is by no means complete. Inspired by a mathematical understanding of normalization and attention, here we present a novel hierarchical adaptive Diagonal spatial ATtention (DAT) layers to separately manipulate the spatial contents from styles in a hierarchical manner. Using DAT and AdaIN, our method enables coarse-to-fine level disentanglement of spatial contents and styles. In addition, our generator can be easily integrated into the GAN inversion framework so that the content and style of translated images from multi-domain image translation tasks can be flexibly controlled. By using various datasets, we confirm that the proposed method not only outperforms the existing models in disentanglement scores, but also provides more flexible control over spatial features in the generated images."
Learning Generative Models of Textured 3D Meshes from Real-World Images,"Recent advances in differentiable rendering have sparked an interest in learning generative models of textured 3D meshes from image collections. These models natively disentangle pose and appearance, enable downstream applications in computer graphics, and improve the ability of generative models to understand the concept of image formation. Although there has been prior work on learning such models from collections of 2D images, these approaches require a delicate pose estimation step that exploits annotated keypoints, thereby restricting their applicability to a few specific datasets. In this work, we propose a GAN framework for generating textured triangle meshes without relying on such annotations. We show that the performance of our approach is on par with prior work that relies on ground-truth keypoints, and more importantly, we demonstrate the generality of our method by setting new baselines on a larger set of categories from ImageNet - for which keypoints are not available - without any class-specific hyperparameter tuning. We release our code at https://github.com/dariopavllo/textured-3d-gan"
Drop the GAN: In Defense of Patches Nearest Neighbors as Single Image Generative Models,"Single image generative models perform synthesis and manipulation tasks by capturing the distribution of patches within a single image. The classical (pre Deep Learning) prevailing approaches for these tasks are based on an optimization process that maximizes patch similarity between the input and generated output. Recently, however, Single Image GANs were introduced both as a superior solution for such manipulation tasks, but also for remarkable novel generative tasks. Despite their impressiveness, single image GANs require long training time (usually hours) for each image and each task. They often suffer from artifacts and are prone to optimization issues such as mode collapse. In this paper, we show that all of these tasks can be performed without any training, within several seconds, in a unified, surprisingly simple framework. We revisit and cast the ""good-old"" patch-based methods into a novel optimization-free framework. We start with an initial coarse guess, and then simply refine the details coarse-to-fine using patch-nearest-neighbor search. This allows generating random novel images better and much faster than GANs. We further demonstrate a wide range of applications, such as image editing and reshuffling, retargeting to different sizes, structural analogies, image collage and a newly introduced task of conditional inpainting. Not only is our method faster (\times 10^3-\times 10^4 than a GAN), it produces superior results (confirmed by quantitative and qualitative evaluation), less artifacts and more realistic global structure than any of the previous approaches (whether GAN-based or classical patch-based)."
Photoacoustic image synthesis with generative adversarial networks,"Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) has the potential to recover morphological and functional tissue properties with high spatial resolution. However, previous attempts to solve the optical inverse problem with supervised machine learning were hampered by the absence of labeled reference data. While this bottleneck has been tackled by simulating training data, the domain gap between real and simulated images remains an unsolved challenge. We propose a novel approach to PAT image synthesis that involves subdividing the challenge of generating plausible simulations into two disjoint problems: (1) Probabilistic generation of realistic tissue morphology, and (2) pixel-wise assignment of corresponding optical and acoustic properties. The former is achieved with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) trained on semantically annotated medical imaging data. According to a validation study on a downstream task our approach yields more realistic synthetic images than the traditional model-based approach and could therefore become a fundamental step for deep learning-based quantitative PAT (qPAT)."
PeaceGAN: A GAN-based Multi-Task Learning Method for SAR Target Image Generation with a Pose Estimator and an Auxiliary Classifier,"Although Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are successfully applied to diverse fields, training GANs on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data is a challenging task mostly due to speckle noise. On the one hands, in a learning perspective of human's perception, it is natural to learn a task by using various information from multiple sources. However, in the previous GAN works on SAR target image generation, the information on target classes has only been used. Due to the backscattering characteristics of SAR image signals, the shapes and structures of SAR target images are strongly dependent on their pose angles. Nevertheless, the pose angle information has not been incorporated into such generative models for SAR target images. In this paper, we firstly propose a novel GAN-based multi-task learning (MTL) method for SAR target image generation, called PeaceGAN that uses both pose angle and target class information, which makes it possible to produce SAR target images of desired target classes at intended pose angles. For this, the PeaceGAN has two additional structures, a pose estimator and an auxiliary classifier, at the side of its discriminator to combine the pose and class information more efficiently. In addition, the PeaceGAN is jointly learned in an end-to-end manner as MTL with both pose angle and target class information, thus enhancing the diversity and quality of generated SAR target images The extensive experiments show that taking an advantage of both pose angle and target class learning by the proposed pose estimator and auxiliary classifier can help the PeaceGAN's generator effectively learn the distributions of SAR target images in the MTL framework, so that it can better generate the SAR target images more flexibly and faithfully at intended pose angles for desired target classes compared to the recent state-of-the-art methods."
ScanGAN360: A Generative Model of Realistic Scanpaths for 360^{\circ} Images,"Understanding and modeling the dynamics of human gaze behavior in 360^\circ environments is a key challenge in computer vision and virtual reality. Generative adversarial approaches could alleviate this challenge by generating a large number of possible scanpaths for unseen images. Existing methods for scanpath generation, however, do not adequately predict realistic scanpaths for 360^\circ images. We present ScanGAN360, a new generative adversarial approach to address this challenging problem. Our network generator is tailored to the specifics of 360^\circ images representing immersive environments. Specifically, we accomplish this by leveraging the use of a spherical adaptation of dynamic-time warping as a loss function and proposing a novel parameterization of 360^\circ scanpaths. The quality of our scanpaths outperforms competing approaches by a large margin and is almost on par with the human baseline. ScanGAN360 thus allows fast simulation of large numbers of virtual observers, whose behavior mimics real users, enabling a better understanding of gaze behavior and novel applications in virtual scene design."
Closing the Loop: Joint Rain Generation and Removal via Disentangled Image Translation,"Existing deep learning-based image deraining methods have achieved promising performance for synthetic rainy images, typically rely on the pairs of sharp images and simulated rainy counterparts. However, these methods suffer from significant performance drop when facing the real rain, because of the huge gap between the simplified synthetic rain and the complex real rain. In this work, we argue that the rain generation and removal are the two sides of the same coin and should be tightly coupled. To close the loop, we propose to jointly learn real rain generation and removal procedure within a unified disentangled image translation framework. Specifically, we propose a bidirectional disentangled translation network, in which each unidirectional network contains two loops of joint rain generation and removal for both the real and synthetic rain image, respectively. Meanwhile, we enforce the disentanglement strategy by decomposing the rainy image into a clean background and rain layer (rain removal), in order to better preserve the identity background via both the cycle-consistency loss and adversarial loss, and ease the rain layer translating between the real and synthetic rainy image. A counterpart composition with the entanglement strategy is symmetrically applied for rain generation. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world rain datasets show the superiority of proposed method compared to state-of-the-arts."
Generating Novel Scene Compositions from Single Images and Videos,"Given a large dataset for training, GANs can achieve remarkable performance for the image synthesis task. However, training GANs in extremely low data regimes remains a challenge, as overfitting often occurs, leading to memorization or training divergence. In this work, we introduce SIV-GAN, an unconditional generative model that can generate new scene compositions from a single training image or a single video clip. We propose a two-branch discriminator architecture, with content and layout branches designed to judge internal content and scene layout realism separately from each other. This discriminator design enables synthesis of visually plausible, novel compositions of a scene, with varying content and layout, while preserving the context of the original sample. Compared to previous single-image GANs, our model generates more diverse, higher quality images, while not being restricted to a single image setting. We show that SIV-GAN successfully deals with a new challenging task of learning from a single video, for which prior GAN models fail to achieve synthesis of both high quality and diversity."
Context-Aware Layout to Image Generation with Enhanced Object Appearance,"A layout to image (L2I) generation model aims to generate a complicated image containing multiple objects (things) against natural background (stuff), conditioned on a given layout. Built upon the recent advances in generative adversarial networks (GANs), existing L2I models have made great progress. However, a close inspection of their generated images reveals two major limitations: (1) the object-to-object as well as object-to-stuff relations are often broken and (2) each object's appearance is typically distorted lacking the key defining characteristics associated with the object class. We argue that these are caused by the lack of context-aware object and stuff feature encoding in their generators, and location-sensitive appearance representation in their discriminators. To address these limitations, two new modules are proposed in this work. First, a context-aware feature transformation module is introduced in the generator to ensure that the generated feature encoding of either object or stuff is aware of other co-existing objects/stuff in the scene. Second, instead of feeding location-insensitive image features to the discriminator, we use the Gram matrix computed from the feature maps of the generated object images to preserve location-sensitive information, resulting in much enhanced object appearance. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the COCO-Thing-Stuff and Visual Genome benchmarks."
Progressive and Aligned Pose Attention Transfer for Person Image Generation,"This paper proposes a new generative adversarial network for pose transfer, i.e., transferring the pose of a given person to a target pose. We design a progressive generator which comprises a sequence of transfer blocks. Each block performs an intermediate transfer step by modeling the relationship between the condition and the target poses with attention mechanism. Two types of blocks are introduced, namely Pose-Attentional Transfer Block (PATB) and Aligned Pose-Attentional Transfer Bloc ~(APATB). Compared with previous works, our model generates more photorealistic person images that retain better appearance consistency and shape consistency compared with input images. We verify the efficacy of the model on the Market-1501 and DeepFashion datasets, using quantitative and qualitative measures. Furthermore, we show that our method can be used for data augmentation for the person re-identification task, alleviating the issue of data insufficiency. Code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/tengteng95/Pose-Transfer.git."
3M: Multi-style image caption generation using Multi-modality features under Multi-UPDOWN model,"In this paper, we build a multi-style generative model for stylish image captioning which uses multi-modality image features, ResNeXt features and text features generated by DenseCap. We propose the 3M model, a Multi-UPDOWN caption model that encodes multi-modality features and decode them to captions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on generating human-like captions by examining its performance on two datasets, the PERSONALITY-CAPTIONS dataset and the FlickrStyle10K dataset. We compare against a variety of state-of-the-art baselines on various automatic NLP metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE-L, CIDEr, SPICE, etc. A qualitative study has also been done to verify our 3M model can be used for generating different stylized captions."
GLOWin: A Flow-based Invertible Generative Framework for Learning Disentangled Feature Representations in Medical Images,"Disentangled representations can be useful in many downstream tasks, help to make deep learning models more interpretable, and allow for control over features of synthetically generated images that can be useful in training other models that require a large number of labelled or unlabelled data. Recently, flow-based generative models have been proposed to generate realistic images by directly modeling the data distribution with invertible functions. In this work, we propose a new flow-based generative model framework, named GLOWin, that is end-to-end invertible and able to learn disentangled representations. Feature disentanglement is achieved by factorizing the latent space into components such that each component learns the representation for one generative factor. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the proposed method on a public brain tumor MR dataset. Quantitative and qualitative results suggest that the proposed method is effective in disentangling the features from complex medical images."
Large Scale Image Completion via Co-Modulated Generative Adversarial Networks,"Numerous task-specific variants of conditional generative adversarial networks have been developed for image completion. Yet, a serious limitation remains that all existing algorithms tend to fail when handling large-scale missing regions. To overcome this challenge, we propose a generic new approach that bridges the gap between image-conditional and recent modulated unconditional generative architectures via co-modulation of both conditional and stochastic style representations. Also, due to the lack of good quantitative metrics for image completion, we propose the new Paired/Unpaired Inception Discriminative Score (P-IDS/U-IDS), which robustly measures the perceptual fidelity of inpainted images compared to real images via linear separability in a feature space. Experiments demonstrate superior performance in terms of both quality and diversity over state-of-the-art methods in free-form image completion and easy generalization to image-to-image translation. Code is available at https://github.com/zsyzzsoft/co-mod-gan."
Generating Diverse Structure for Image Inpainting With Hierarchical VQ-VAE,"Given an incomplete image without additional constraint, image inpainting natively allows for multiple solutions as long as they appear plausible. Recently, multiplesolution inpainting methods have been proposed and shown the potential of generating diverse results. However, these methods have difficulty in ensuring the quality of each solution, e.g. they produce distorted structure and/or blurry texture. We propose a two-stage model for diverse inpainting, where the first stage generates multiple coarse results each of which has a different structure, and the second stage refines each coarse result separately by augmenting texture. The proposed model is inspired by the hierarchical vector quantized variational auto-encoder (VQ-VAE), whose hierarchical architecture isentangles structural and textural information. In addition, the vector quantization in VQVAE enables autoregressive modeling of the discrete distribution over the structural information. Sampling from the distribution can easily generate diverse and high-quality structures, making up the first stage of our model. In the second stage, we propose a structural attention module inside the texture generation network, where the module utilizes the structural information to capture distant correlations. We further reuse the VQ-VAE to calculate two feature losses, which help improve structure coherence and texture realism, respectively. Experimental results on CelebA-HQ, Places2, and ImageNet datasets show that our method not only enhances the diversity of the inpainting solutions but also improves the visual quality of the generated multiple images. Code and models are available at: https://github.com/USTC-JialunPeng/Diverse-Structure-Inpainting."
Spatial Dependency Networks: Neural Layers for Improved Generative Image Modeling,"How to improve generative modeling by better exploiting spatial regularities and coherence in images? We introduce a novel neural network for building image generators (decoders) and apply it to variational autoencoders (VAEs). In our spatial dependency networks (SDNs), feature maps at each level of a deep neural net are computed in a spatially coherent way, using a sequential gating-based mechanism that distributes contextual information across 2-D space. We show that augmenting the decoder of a hierarchical VAE by spatial dependency layers considerably improves density estimation over baseline convolutional architectures and the state-of-the-art among the models within the same class. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SDN can be applied to large images by synthesizing samples of high quality and coherence. In a vanilla VAE setting, we find that a powerful SDN decoder also improves learning disentangled representations, indicating that neural architectures play an important role in this task. Our results suggest favoring spatial dependency over convolutional layers in various VAE settings. The accompanying source code is given at https://github.com/djordjemila/sdn."
Assessment of image generation by quantum annealer,"Quantum annealing was originally proposed as an approach for solving combinatorial optimisation problems using quantum effects. D-Wave Systems has released a production model of quantum annealing hardware. However, the inherent noise and various environmental factors in the hardware hamper the determination of optimal solutions. In addition, the freezing effect in regions with weak quantum fluctuations generates outputs approximately following a Gibbs--Boltzmann distribution at an extremely low temperature. Thus, a quantum annealer may also serve as a fast sampler for the Ising spin-glass problem, and several studies have investigated Boltzmann machine learning using a quantum annealer. Previous developments have focused on comparing the performance in the standard distance of the resulting distributions between conventional methods in classical computers and sampling by a quantum annealer. In this study, we focused on the performance of a quantum annealer as a generative model. To evaluate its performance, we prepared a discriminator given by a neural network trained on an a priori dataset. The evaluation results show a higher performance of quantum annealing compared with the classical approach for Boltzmann machine learning."
DivCo: Diverse Conditional Image Synthesis via Contrastive Generative Adversarial Network,"Conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) target at synthesizing diverse images given the input conditions and latent codes, but unfortunately, they usually suffer from the issue of mode collapse. To solve this issue, previous works mainly focused on encouraging the correlation between the latent codes and their generated images, while ignoring the relations between images generated from various latent codes. The recent MSGAN tried to encourage the diversity of the generated image but only considers ""negative"" relations between the image pairs. In this paper, we propose a novel DivCo framework to properly constrain both ""positive"" and ""negative"" relations between the generated images specified in the latent space. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to use contrastive learning for diverse conditional image synthesis. A novel latent-augmented contrastive loss is introduced, which encourages images generated from adjacent latent codes to be similar and those generated from distinct latent codes to be dissimilar. The proposed latent-augmented contrastive loss is well compatible with various cGAN architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed DivCo can produce more diverse images than state-of-the-art methods without sacrificing visual quality in multiple unpaired and paired image generation tasks."
Unsupervised Image Transformation Learning via Generative Adversarial Networks,"In this work, we study the image transformation problem, which targets at learning the underlying transformations (e.g., the transition of seasons) from a collection of unlabeled images. However, there could be countless of transformations in the real world, making such a task incredibly challenging, especially under the unsupervised setting. To tackle this obstacle, we propose a novel learning framework built on generative adversarial networks (GANs), where the discriminator and the generator share a transformation space. After the model gets fully optimized, any two points within the shared space are expected to define a valid transformation. In this way, at the inference stage, we manage to adequately extract the variation factor between a customizable image pair by projecting both images onto the transformation space. The resulting transformation vector can further guide the image synthesis, facilitating image editing with continuous semantic change (e.g., altering summer to winter with fall as the intermediate step). Noticeably, the learned transformation space supports not only transferring image styles (e.g., changing day to night), but also manipulating image contents (e.g., adding clouds in the sky). In addition, we make in-depth analysis on the properties of the transformation space to help understand how various transformations are organized. Project page is at https://genforce.github.io/trgan/."
Advanced Multiple Linear Regression Based Dark Channel Prior Applied on Dehazing Image and Generating Synthetic Haze,"Haze removal is an extremely challenging task, and object detection in the hazy environment has recently gained much attention due to the popularity of autonomous driving and traffic surveillance. In this work, the authors propose a multiple linear regression haze removal model based on a widely adopted dehazing algorithm named Dark Channel Prior. Training this model with a synthetic hazy dataset, the proposed model can reduce the unanticipated deviations generated from the rough estimations of transmission map and atmospheric light in Dark Channel Prior. To increase object detection accuracy in the hazy environment, the authors further present an algorithm to build a synthetic hazy COCO training dataset by generating the artificial haze to the MS COCO training dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model obtains higher image quality and shares more similarity with ground truth images than most conventional pixel-based dehazing algorithms and neural network based haze-removal models. The authors also evaluate the mean average precision of Mask R-CNN when training the network with synthetic hazy COCO training dataset and preprocessing test hazy dataset by removing the haze with the proposed dehazing model. It turns out that both approaches can increase the object detection accuracy significantly and outperform most existing object detection models over hazy images."
HumanGAN: A Generative Model of Humans Images,"Generative adversarial networks achieve great performance in photorealistic image synthesis in various domains, including human images. However, they usually employ latent vectors that encode the sampled outputs globally. This does not allow convenient control of semantically-relevant individual parts of the image, and is not able to draw samples that only differ in partial aspects, such as clothing style. We address these limitations and present a generative model for images of dressed humans offering control over pose, local body part appearance and garment style. This is the first method to solve various aspects of human image generation such as global appearance sampling, pose transfer, parts and garment transfer, and parts sampling jointly in a unified framework. As our model encodes part-based latent appearance vectors in a normalized pose-independent space and warps them to different poses, it preserves body and clothing appearance under varying posture. Experiments show that our flexible and general generative method outperforms task-specific baselines for pose-conditioned image generation, pose transfer and part sampling in terms of realism and output resolution."
Face Images as Jigsaw Puzzles: Compositional Perception of Human Faces for Machines Using Generative Adversarial Networks,"An important goal in human-robot-interaction (HRI) is for machines to achieve a close to human level of face perception. One of the important differences between machine learning and human intelligence is the lack of compositionality. This paper introduces a new scheme to enable generative adversarial networks to learn the distribution of face images composed of smaller parts. This results in a more flexible machine face perception and easier generalization to outside training examples. We demonstrate that this model is able to produce realistic high-quality face images by generating and piecing together the parts. Additionally, we demonstrate that this model learns the relations between the facial parts and their distributions. Therefore, the specific facial parts are interchangeable between generated face images."
FedDG: Federated Domain Generalization on Medical Image Segmentation via Episodic Learning in Continuous Frequency Space,"Federated learning allows distributed medical institutions to collaboratively learn a shared prediction model with privacy protection. While at clinical deployment, the models trained in federated learning can still suffer from performance drop when applied to completely unseen hospitals outside the federation. In this paper, we point out and solve a novel problem setting of federated domain generalization (FedDG), which aims to learn a federated model from multiple distributed source domains such that it can directly generalize to unseen target domains. We present a novel approach, named as Episodic Learning in Continuous Frequency Space (ELCFS), for this problem by enabling each client to exploit multi-source data distributions under the challenging constraint of data decentralization. Our approach transmits the distribution information across clients in a privacy-protecting way through an effective continuous frequency space interpolation mechanism. With the transferred multi-source distributions, we further carefully design a boundary-oriented episodic learning paradigm to expose the local learning to domain distribution shifts and particularly meet the challenges of model generalization in medical image segmentation scenario. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated with superior performance over state-of-the-arts and in-depth ablation experiments on two medical image segmentation tasks. The code is available at ""https://github.com/liuquande/FedDG-ELCFS""."
Generative Transition Mechanism to Image-to-Image Translation via Encoded Transformation,"In this paper, we revisit the Image-to-Image (I2I) translation problem with transition consistency, namely the consistency defined on the conditional data mapping between each data pairs. Explicitly parameterizing each data mappings with a transition variable t, i.e., x \overset{t(x,y)}{\mapsto}y, we discover that existing I2I translation models mainly focus on maintaining consistency on results, e.g., image reconstruction or attribute prediction, named result consistency in our paper. This restricts their generalization ability to generate satisfactory results with unseen transitions in the test phase. Consequently, we propose to enforce both result consistency and transition consistency for I2I translation, to benefit the problem with a closer consistency between the input and output. To benefit the generalization ability of the translation model, we propose transition encoding to facilitate explicit regularization of these two {kinds} of consistencies on unseen transitions. We further generalize such explicitly regularized consistencies to distribution-level, thus facilitating a generalized overall consistency for I2I translation problems. With the above design, our proposed model, named Transition Encoding GAN (TEGAN), can poss superb generalization ability to generate realistic and semantically consistent translation results with unseen transitions in the test phase. It also provides a unified understanding of the existing GAN-based I2I transition models with our explicitly modeling of the data mapping, i.e., transition. Experiments on four different I2I translation tasks demonstrate the efficacy and generality of TEGAN."
Analysis of Convolutional Decoder for Image Caption Generation,"Recently Convolutional Neural Networks have been proposed for Sequence Modelling tasks such as Image Caption Generation. However, unlike Recurrent Neural Networks, the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks as Decoders for Image Caption Generation has not been extensively studied. In this work, we analyse various aspects of Convolutional Neural Network based Decoders such as Network complexity and depth, use of Data Augmentation, Attention mechanism, length of sentences used during training, etc on performance of the model. We perform experiments using Flickr8k and Flickr30k image captioning datasets and observe that unlike Recurrent Neural Network based Decoder, Convolutional Decoder for Image Captioning does not generally benefit from increase in network depth, in the form of stacked Convolutional Layers, and also the use of Data Augmentation techniques. In addition, use of Attention mechanism also provides limited performance gains with Convolutional Decoder. Furthermore, we observe that Convolutional Decoders show performance comparable with Recurrent Decoders only when trained using sentences of smaller length which contain up to 15 words but they have limitations when trained using higher sentence lengths which suggests that Convolutional Decoders may not be able to model long-term dependencies efficiently. In addition, the Convolutional Decoder usually performs poorly on CIDEr evaluation metric as compared to Recurrent Decoder."
Generating Images with Sparse Representations,"The high dimensionality of images presents architecture and sampling-efficiency challenges for likelihood-based generative models. Previous approaches such as VQ-VAE use deep autoencoders to obtain compact representations, which are more practical as inputs for likelihood-based models. We present an alternative approach, inspired by common image compression methods like JPEG, and convert images to quantized discrete cosine transform (DCT) blocks, which are represented sparsely as a sequence of DCT channel, spatial location, and DCT coefficient triples. We propose a Transformer-based autoregressive architecture, which is trained to sequentially predict the conditional distribution of the next element in such sequences, and which scales effectively to high resolution images. On a range of image datasets, we demonstrate that our approach can generate high quality, diverse images, with sample metric scores competitive with state of the art methods. We additionally show that simple modifications to our method yield effective image colorization and super-resolution models."
An Effective Loss Function for Generating 3D Models from Single 2D Image without Rendering,"Differentiable rendering is a very successful technique that applies to a Single-View 3D Reconstruction. Current renderers use losses based on pixels between a rendered image of some 3D reconstructed object and ground-truth images from given matched viewpoints to optimise parameters of the 3D shape.  These models require a rendering step, along with visibility handling and evaluation of the shading model. The main goal of this paper is to demonstrate that we can avoid these steps and still get reconstruction results as other state-of-the-art models that are equal or even better than existing category-specific reconstruction methods. First, we use the same CNN architecture for the prediction of a point cloud shape and pose prediction like the one used by Insafutdinov & Dosovitskiy. Secondly, we propose the novel effective loss function that evaluates how well the projections of reconstructed 3D point clouds cover the ground truth object's silhouette. Then we use Poisson Surface Reconstruction to transform the reconstructed point cloud into a 3D mesh. Finally, we perform a GAN-based texture mapping on a particular 3D mesh and produce a textured 3D mesh from a single 2D image. We evaluate our method on different datasets (including ShapeNet, CUB-200-2011, and Pascal3D+) and achieve state-of-the-art results, outperforming all the other supervised and unsupervised methods and 3D representations, all in terms of performance, accuracy, and training time."
Evaluation of Complexity Measures for Deep Learning Generalization in Medical Image Analysis,"The generalization performance of deep learning models for medical image analysis often decreases on images collected with different devices for data acquisition, device settings, or patient population. A better understanding of the generalization capacity on new images is crucial for clinicians' trustworthiness in deep learning. Although significant research efforts have been recently directed toward establishing generalization bounds and complexity measures, still, there is often a significant discrepancy between the predicted and actual generalization performance. As well, related large empirical studies have been primarily based on validation with general-purpose image datasets. This paper presents an empirical study that investigates the correlation between 25 complexity measures and the generalization abilities of supervised deep learning classifiers for breast ultrasound images. The results indicate that PAC-Bayes flatness-based and path norm-based measures produce the most consistent explanation for the combination of models and data. We also investigate the use of multi-task classification and segmentation approach for breast images, and report that such learning approach acts as an implicit regularizer and is conducive toward improved generalization."
Defending Medical Image Diagnostics against Privacy Attacks using Generative Methods,"Machine learning (ML) models used in medical imaging diagnostics can be vulnerable to a variety of privacy attacks, including membership inference attacks, that lead to violations of regulations governing the use of medical data and threaten to compromise their effective deployment in the clinic. In contrast to most recent work in privacy-aware ML that has been focused on model alteration and post-processing steps, we propose here a novel and complementary scheme that enhances the security of medical data by controlling the data sharing process. We develop and evaluate a privacy defense protocol based on using a generative adversarial network (GAN) that allows a medical data sourcer (e.g. a hospital) to provide an external agent (a modeler) a proxy dataset synthesized from the original images, so that the resulting diagnostic systems made available to model consumers is rendered resilient to privacy attackers. We validate the proposed method on retinal diagnostics AI used for diabetic retinopathy that bears the risk of possibly leaking private information. To incorporate concerns of both privacy advocates and modelers, we introduce a metric to evaluate privacy and utility performance in combination, and demonstrate, using these novel and classical metrics, that our approach, by itself or in conjunction with other defenses, provides state of the art (SOTA) performance for defending against privacy attacks."
MOGAN: Morphologic-structure-aware Generative Learning from a Single Image,"In most interactive image generation tasks, given regions of interest (ROI) by users, the generated results are expected to have adequate diversities in appearance while maintaining correct and reasonable structures in original images. Such tasks become more challenging if only limited data is available. Recently proposed generative models complete training based on only one image. They pay much attention to the monolithic feature of the sample while ignoring the actual semantic information of different objects inside the sample. As a result, for ROI-based generation tasks, they may produce inappropriate samples with excessive randomicity and without maintaining the related objects' correct structures. To address this issue, this work introduces a MOrphologic-structure-aware Generative Adversarial Network named MOGAN that produces random samples with diverse appearances and reliable structures based on only one image. For training for ROI, we propose to utilize the data coming from the original image being augmented and bring in a novel module to transform such augmented data into knowledge containing both structures and appearances, thus enhancing the model's comprehension of the sample. To learn the rest areas other than ROI, we employ binary masks to ensure the generation isolated from ROI. Finally, we set parallel and hierarchical branches of the mentioned learning process. Compared with other single image GAN schemes, our approach focuses on internal features including the maintenance of rational structures and variation on appearance. Experiments confirm a better capacity of our model on ROI-based image generation tasks than its competitive peers."
Vanishing Twin GAN: How training a weak Generative Adversarial Network can improve semi-supervised image classification,"Generative Adversarial Networks can learn the mapping of random noise to realistic images in a semi-supervised framework. This mapping ability can be used for semi-supervised image classification to detect images of an unknown class where there is no training data to be used for supervised classification. However, if the unknown class shares similar characteristics to the known class(es), GANs can learn to generalize and generate images that look like both classes. This generalization ability can hinder the classification performance. In this work, we propose the Vanishing Twin GAN. By training a weak GAN and using its generated output image parallel to the regular GAN, the Vanishing Twin training improves semi-supervised image classification where image similarity can hurt classification tasks."
Dual Reinforcement-Based Specification Generation for Image De-Rendering,"Advances in deep learning have led to promising progress in inferring graphics programs by de-rendering computer-generated images. However, current methods do not explore which decoding methods lead to better inductive bias for inferring graphics programs. In our work, we first explore the effectiveness of LSTM-RNN versus Transformer networks as decoders for order-independent graphics programs. Since these are sequence models, we must choose an ordering of the objects in the graphics programs for likelihood training. We found that the LSTM performance was highly sensitive to the sequence ordering (random order vs. pattern-based order), while Transformer performance was roughly independent of the sequence ordering. Further, we present a policy gradient based reinforcement learning approach for better inductive bias in the decoder via multiple diverse rewards based both on the graphics program specification and the rendered image. We also explore the combination of these complementary rewards. We achieve state-of-the-art results on two graphics program generation datasets."
GaNDLF: A Generally Nuanced Deep Learning Framework for Scalable End-to-End Clinical Workflows in Medical Imaging,"Deep Learning (DL) has the potential to optimize machine learning in both the scientific and clinical communities. However, greater expertise is required to develop DL algorithms, and the variability of implementations hinders their reproducibility, translation, and deployment. Here we present the community-driven Generally Nuanced Deep Learning Framework (GaNDLF), with the goal of lowering these barriers. GaNDLF makes the mechanism of DL development, training, and inference more stable, reproducible, interpretable, and scalable, without requiring an extensive technical background. GaNDLF aims to provide an end-to-end solution for all DL-related tasks in computational precision medicine. We demonstrate the ability of GaNDLF to analyze both radiology and histology images, with built-in support for k-fold cross-validation, data augmentation, multiple modalities and output classes. Our quantitative performance evaluation on numerous use cases, anatomies, and computational tasks supports GaNDLF as a robust application framework for deployment in clinical workflows."
MixSearch: Searching for Domain Generalized Medical Image Segmentation Architectures,"Considering the scarcity of medical data, most datasets in medical image analysis are an order of magnitude smaller than those of natural images. However, most Network Architecture Search (NAS) approaches in medical images focused on specific datasets and did not take into account the generalization ability of the learned architectures on unseen datasets as well as different domains. In this paper, we address this point by proposing to search for generalizable U-shape architectures on a composited dataset that mixes medical images from multiple segmentation tasks and domains creatively, which is named MixSearch. Specifically, we propose a novel approach to mix multiple small-scale datasets from multiple domains and segmentation tasks to produce a large-scale dataset. Then, a novel weaved encoder-decoder structure is designed to search for a generalized segmentation network in both cell-level and network-level. The network produced by the proposed MixSearch framework achieves state-of-the-art results compared with advanced encoder-decoder networks across various datasets."
Railway Anomaly detection model using synthetic defect images generated by CycleGAN,"Although training data is essential for machine learning, railway companies are facing difficulties in gathering adequate images of defective equipment due to their proactive replacement of would be defective equipment. Nevertheless, proactive replacement is indispensable for safe and undisturbed operation of public transport. In this research, we have developed a model using CycleGAN to generate artificial images of defective equipment instead of real images. By adopting these generated images as training data, we verified that these images are indistinguishable from real images and they play a vital role in enhancing the accuracy of the defect detection models."
Prior Image-Constrained Reconstruction using Style-Based Generative Models,"Obtaining a useful estimate of an object from highly incomplete imaging measurements remains a holy grail of imaging science. Deep learning methods have shown promise in learning object priors or constraints to improve the conditioning of an ill-posed imaging inverse problem. In this study, a framework for estimating an object of interest that is semantically related to a known prior image, is proposed. An optimization problem is formulated in the disentangled latent space of a style-based generative model, and semantically meaningful constraints are imposed using the disentangled latent representation of the prior image. Stable recovery from incomplete measurements with the help of a prior image is theoretically analyzed. Numerical experiments demonstrating the superior performance of our approach as compared to related methods are presented."
Zero-Shot Text-to-Image Generation,"Text-to-image generation has traditionally focused on finding better modeling assumptions for training on a fixed dataset. These assumptions might involve complex architectures, auxiliary losses, or side information such as object part labels or segmentation masks supplied during training. We describe a simple approach for this task based on a transformer that autoregressively models the text and image tokens as a single stream of data. With sufficient data and scale, our approach is competitive with previous domain-specific models when evaluated in a zero-shot fashion."
Conditional Image Generation by Conditioning Variational Auto-Encoders,"We present a conditional variational auto-encoder (VAE) which, to avoid the substantial cost of training from scratch, uses an architecture and training objective capable of leveraging a foundation model in the form of a pretrained unconditional VAE. To train the conditional VAE, we only need to train an artifact to perform amortized inference over the unconditional VAE's latent variables given a conditioning input. We demonstrate our approach on tasks including image inpainting, for which it outperforms state-of-the-art GAN-based approaches at faithfully representing the inherent uncertainty. We conclude by describing a possible application of our inpainting model, in which it is used to perform Bayesian experimental design for the purpose of guiding a sensor."
Generative Modelling of BRDF Textures from Flash Images,"We learn a latent space for easy capture, consistent interpolation, and efficient reproduction of visual material appearance. When users provide a photo of a stationary natural material captured under flashlight illumination, first it is converted into a latent material code. Then, in the second step, conditioned on the material code, our method produces an infinite and diverse spatial field of BRDF model parameters (diffuse albedo, normals, roughness, specular albedo) that subsequently allows rendering in complex scenes and illuminations, matching the appearance of the input photograph. Technically, we jointly embed all flash images into a latent space using a convolutional encoder, and -- conditioned on these latent codes -- convert random spatial fields into fields of BRDF parameters using a convolutional neural network (CNN). We condition these BRDF parameters to match the visual characteristics (statistics and spectra of visual features) of the input under matching light. A user study compares our approach favorably to previous work, even those with access to BRDF supervision."
Comparative evaluation of CNN architectures for Image Caption Generation,"Aided by recent advances in Deep Learning, Image Caption Generation has seen tremendous progress over the last few years. Most methods use transfer learning to extract visual information, in the form of image features, with the help of pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network models followed by transformation of the visual information using a Caption Generator module to generate the output sentences. Different methods have used different Convolutional Neural Network Architectures and, to the best of our knowledge, there is no systematic study which compares the relative efficacy of different Convolutional Neural Network architectures for extracting the visual information. In this work, we have evaluated 17 different Convolutional Neural Networks on two popular Image Caption Generation frameworks: the first based on Neural Image Caption (NIC) generation model and the second based on Soft-Attention framework. We observe that model complexity of Convolutional Neural Network, as measured by number of parameters, and the accuracy of the model on Object Recognition task does not necessarily co-relate with its efficacy on feature extraction for Image Caption Generation task."
Obfuscation of Images via Differential Privacy: From Facial Images to General Images,"Due to the pervasiveness of image capturing devices in every-day life, images of individuals are routinely captured. Although this has enabled many benefits, it also infringes on personal privacy. A promising direction in research on obfuscation of facial images has been the work in the k-same family of methods which employ the concept of k-anonymity from database privacy. However, there are a number of deficiencies of k-anonymity that carry over to the k-same methods, detracting from their usefulness in practice. In this paper, we first outline several of these deficiencies and discuss their implications in the context of facial obfuscation. We then develop a framework through which we obtain a formal differentially private guarantee for the obfuscation of facial images in generative machine learning models. Our approach provides a provable privacy guarantee that is not susceptible to the outlined deficiencies of k-same obfuscation and produces photo-realistic obfuscated output. In addition, we demonstrate through experimental comparisons that our approach can achieve comparable utility to k-same obfuscation in terms of preservation of useful features in the images. Furthermore, we propose a method to achieve differential privacy for any image (i.e., without restriction to facial images) through the direct modification of pixel intensities. Although the addition of noise to pixel intensities does not provide the high visual quality obtained via generative machine learning models, it offers greater versatility by eliminating the need for a trained model. We demonstrate that our proposed use of the exponential mechanism in this context is able to provide superior visual quality to pixel-space obfuscation using the Laplace mechanism."
Scalable Balanced Training of Conditional Generative Adversarial Neural Networks on Image Data,"We propose a distributed approach to train deep convolutional generative adversarial neural network (DC-CGANs) models. Our method reduces the imbalance between generator and discriminator by partitioning the training data according to data labels, and enhances scalability by performing a parallel training where multiple generators are concurrently trained, each one of them focusing on a single data label. Performance is assessed in terms of inception score and image quality on MNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet1k datasets, showing a significant improvement in comparison to state-of-the-art techniques to training DC-CGANs. Weak scaling is attained on all the four datasets using up to 1,000 processes and 2,000 NVIDIA V100 GPUs on the OLCF supercomputer Summit."
Pose Guided Person Image Generation with Hidden p-Norm Regression,"In this paper, we propose a novel approach to solve the pose guided person image generation task. We assume that the relation between pose and appearance information can be described by a simple matrix operation in hidden space. Based on this assumption, our method estimates a pose-invariant feature matrix for each identity, and uses it to predict the target appearance conditioned on the target pose. The estimation process is formulated as a p-norm regression problem in hidden space. By utilizing the differentiation of the solution of this regression problem, the parameters of the whole framework can be trained in an end-to-end manner. While most previous works are only applicable to the supervised training and single-shot generation scenario, our method can be easily adapted to unsupervised training and multi-shot generation. Extensive experiments on the challenging Market-1501 dataset show that our method yields competitive performance in all the aforementioned variant scenarios."
Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Image Synthesis with Contrast-Aware Generative Adversarial Networks,"A Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) exam typically consists of the acquisition of multiple MR pulse sequences, which are required for a reliable diagnosis. Each sequence can be parameterized through multiple acquisition parameters affecting MR image contrast, signal-to-noise ratio, resolution, or scan time. With the rise of generative deep learning models, approaches for the synthesis of MR images are developed to either synthesize additional MR contrasts, generate synthetic data, or augment existing data for AI training. However, current generative approaches for the synthesis of MR images are only trained on images with a specific set of acquisition parameter values, limiting the clinical value of these methods as various sets of acquisition parameter settings are used in clinical practice. Therefore, we trained a generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate synthetic MR knee images conditioned on various acquisition parameters (repetition time, echo time, image orientation). This approach enables us to synthesize MR images with adjustable image contrast. In a visual Turing test, two experts mislabeled 40.5% of real and synthetic MR images, demonstrating that the image quality of the generated synthetic and real MR images is comparable. This work can support radiologists and technologists during the parameterization of MR sequences by previewing the yielded MR contrast, can serve as a valuable tool for radiology training, and can be used for customized data generation to support AI training."
Just Noticeable Difference for Machine Perception and Generation of Regularized Adversarial Images with Minimal Perturbation,"In this study, we introduce a measure for machine perception, inspired by the concept of Just Noticeable Difference (JND) of human perception. Based on this measure, we suggest an adversarial image generation algorithm, which iteratively distorts an image by an additive noise until the model detects the change in the image by outputting a false label. The noise added to the original image is defined as the gradient of the cost function of the model. A novel cost function is defined to explicitly minimize the amount of perturbation applied to the input image while enforcing the perceptual similarity between the adversarial and input images. For this purpose, the cost function is regularized by the well-known total variation and bounded range terms to meet the natural appearance of the adversarial image. We evaluate the adversarial images generated by our algorithm both qualitatively and quantitatively on CIFAR10, ImageNet, and MS COCO datasets. Our experiments on image classification and object detection tasks show that adversarial images generated by our JND method are both more successful in deceiving the recognition/detection models and less perturbed compared to the images generated by the state-of-the-art methods, namely, FGV, FSGM, and DeepFool methods."
Multi-class Generative Adversarial Nets for Semi-supervised Image Classification,"From generating never-before-seen images to domain adaptation, applications of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) spread wide in the domain of vision and graphics problems. With the remarkable ability of GANs in learning the distribution and generating images of a particular class, they can be used for semi-supervised classification tasks. However, the problem is that if two classes of images share similar characteristics, the GAN might learn to generalize and hinder the classification of the two classes. In this paper, we use various images from MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets to illustrate how similar images cause the GAN to generalize, leading to the poor classification of images. We propose a modification to the traditional training of GANs that allows for improved multi-class classification in similar classes of images in a semi-supervised learning framework."
Blind stain separation using model-aware generative learning and its applications on fluorescence microscopy images,"Multiple stains are usually used to highlight biological substances in biomedical image analysis. To decompose multiple stains for co-localization quantification, blind source separation is usually performed. Prior model-based stain separation methods usually rely on stains' spatial distributions over an image and may fail to solve the co-localization problem. With the advantage of machine learning, deep generative models are used for this purpose. Since prior knowledge of imaging models is ignored in purely data-driven solutions, these methods may be sub-optimal. In this study, a novel learning-based blind source separation framework is proposed, where the physical model of biomedical imaging is incorporated to regularize the learning process. The introduced model-relevant adversarial loss couples all generators in the framework and limits the capacities of the generative models. Further more, a training algorithm is innovated for the proposed framework to avoid inter-generator confusion during learning. This paper particularly takes fluorescence unmixing in fluorescence microscopy images as an application example of the proposed framework. Qualitative and quantitative experimentation on a public fluorescence microscopy image set demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method over both prior model-based approaches and learning-based methods."
A Generative Model for Hallucinating Diverse Versions of Super Resolution Images,"Traditionally, the main focus of image super-resolution techniques is on recovering the most likely high-quality images from low-quality images, using a one-to-one low- to high-resolution mapping. Proceeding that way, we ignore the fact that there are generally many valid versions of high-resolution images that map to a given low-resolution image. We are tackling in this work the problem of obtaining different high-resolution versions from the same low-resolution image using Generative Adversarial Models. Our learning approach makes use of high frequencies available in the training high-resolution images for preserving and exploring in an unsupervised manner the structural information available within these images. Experimental results on the CelebA dataset confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method, which allows the generation of both realistic and diverse high-resolution images from low-resolution images."
Diverse Single Image Generation with Controllable Global Structure,"Image generation from a single image using generative adversarial networks is quite interesting due to the realism of generated images. However, recent approaches need improvement for such realistic and diverse image generation, when the global context of the image is important such as in face, animal, and architectural image generation. This is mainly due to the use of fewer convolutional layers for mainly capturing the patch statistics and, thereby, not being able to capture global statistics very well. We solve this problem by using attention blocks at selected scales and feeding a random Gaussian blurred image to the discriminator for training. Our results are visually better than the state-of-the-art particularly in generating images that require global context. The diversity of our image generation, measured using the average standard deviation of pixels, is also better."
Structure-aware Person Image Generation with Pose Decomposition and Semantic Correlation,"In this paper we tackle the problem of pose guided person image generation, which aims to transfer a person image from the source pose to a novel target pose while maintaining the source appearance. Given the inefficiency of standard CNNs in handling large spatial transformation, we propose a structure-aware flow based method for high-quality person image generation. Specifically, instead of learning the complex overall pose changes of human body, we decompose the human body into different semantic parts (e.g., head, torso, and legs) and apply different networks to predict the flow fields for these parts separately. Moreover, we carefully design the network modules to effectively capture the local and global semantic correlations of features within and among the human parts respectively. Extensive experimental results show that our method can generate high-quality results under large pose discrepancy and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative comparisons."
UPHDR-GAN: Generative Adversarial Network for High Dynamic Range Imaging with Unpaired Data,"The paper proposes a method to effectively fuse multi-exposure inputs and generate high-quality high dynamic range (HDR) images with unpaired datasets. Deep learning-based HDR image generation methods rely heavily on paired datasets. The ground truth images play a leading role in generating reasonable HDR images. Datasets without ground truth are hard to be applied to train deep neural networks. Recently, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have demonstrated their potentials of translating images from source domain X to target domain Y in the absence of paired examples. In this paper, we propose a GAN-based network for solving such problems while generating enjoyable HDR results, named UPHDR-GAN. The proposed method relaxes the constraint of the paired dataset and learns the mapping from the LDR domain to the HDR domain. Although the pair data are missing, UPHDR-GAN can properly handle the ghosting artifacts caused by moving objects or misalignments with the help of the modified GAN loss, the improved discriminator network and the useful initialization phase. The proposed method preserves the details of important regions and improves the total image perceptual quality. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons against the representative methods demonstrate the superiority of the proposed UPHDR-GAN."
Generating images from caption and vice versa via CLIP-Guided Generative Latent Space Search,"In this research work we present CLIP-GLaSS, a novel zero-shot framework to generate an image (or a caption) corresponding to a given caption (or image). CLIP-GLaSS is based on the CLIP neural network, which, given an image and a descriptive caption, provides similar embeddings. Differently, CLIP-GLaSS takes a caption (or an image) as an input, and generates the image (or the caption) whose CLIP embedding is the most similar to the input one. This optimal image (or caption) is produced via a generative network, after an exploration by a genetic algorithm. Promising results are shown, based on the experimentation of the image Generators BigGAN and StyleGAN2, and of the text Generator GPT2"
Model Adaptation for Image Reconstruction using Generalized Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimator,"Deep learning image reconstruction algorithms often suffer from model mismatches when the acquisition scheme differs significantly from the forward model used during training. We introduce a Generalized Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate (GSURE) loss metric to adapt the network to the measured k-space data and minimize model misfit impact. Unlike current methods that rely on the mean square error in kspace, the proposed metric accounts for noise in the measurements. This makes the approach less vulnerable to overfitting, thus offering improved reconstruction quality compared to schemes that rely on mean-square error. This approach may be useful to rapidly adapt pre-trained models to new acquisition settings (e.g., multi-site) and different contrasts than training data"
Synthetic Generation of Three-Dimensional Cancer Cell Models from Histopathological Images,"Synthetic generation of three-dimensional cell models from histopathological images aims to enhance understanding of cell mutation, and progression of cancer, necessary for clinical assessment and optimal treatment. Classical reconstruction algorithms based on image registration of consecutive slides of stained tissues are prone to errors and often not suitable for the training of three-dimensional segmentation algorithms. We propose a novel framework to generate synthetic three-dimensional histological models based on a generator-discriminator pattern optimizing constrained features that construct a 3D model via a Blender interface exploiting smooth shape continuity typical for biological specimens. To capture the spatial context of entire cell clusters we deploy a novel deep topology transformer that implements and attention mechanism on cell group images to extract features for the frozen feature decoder. The proposed algorithms achieves high quantitative and qualitative synthesis evident in comparative evaluation metrics such as a low Frechet-Inception scores."
Learning Structral coherence Via Generative Adversarial Network for Single Image Super-Resolution,"Among the major remaining challenges for single image super resolution (SISR) is the capacity to recover coherent images with global shapes and local details conforming to human vision system. Recent generative adversarial network (GAN) based SISR methods have yielded overall realistic SR images, however, there are always unpleasant textures accompanied with structural distortions in local regions. To target these issues, we introduce the gradient branch into the generator to preserve structural information by restoring high-resolution gradient maps in SR process. In addition, we utilize a U-net based discriminator to consider both the whole image and the detailed per-pixel authenticity, which could encourage the generator to maintain overall coherence of the reconstructed images. Moreover, we have studied objective functions and LPIPS perceptual loss is added to generate more realistic and natural details. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art perceptual-driven SR methods in perception index (PI), and obtains more geometrically consistent and visually pleasing textures in natural image restoration."
Macroscopic Control of Text Generation for Image Captioning,"Despite the fact that image captioning models have been able to generate impressive descriptions for a given image, challenges remain: (1) the controllability and diversity of existing models are still far from satisfactory; (2) models sometimes may produce extremely poor-quality captions. In this paper, two novel methods are introduced to solve the problems respectively. Specifically, for the former problem, we introduce a control signal which can control the macroscopic sentence attributes, such as sentence quality, sentence length, sentence tense and number of nouns etc. With such a control signal, the controllability and diversity of existing captioning models are enhanced. For the latter problem, we innovatively propose a strategy that an image-text matching model is trained to measure the quality of sentences generated in both forward and backward directions and finally choose the better one. As a result, this strategy can effectively reduce the proportion of poorquality sentences. Our proposed methods can be easily applie on most image captioning models to improve their overall performance. Based on the Up-Down model, the experimental results show that our methods achieve BLEU- 4/CIDEr/SPICE scores of 37.5/120.3/21.5 on MSCOCO Karpathy test split with cross-entropy training, which surpass the results of other state-of-the-art methods trained by cross-entropy loss."
Magnification Generalization for Histopathology Image Embedding,"Histopathology image embedding is an active research area in computer vision. Most of the embedding models exclusively concentrate on a specific magnification level. However, a useful task in histopathology embedding is to train an embedding space regardless of the magnification level. Two main approaches for tackling this goal are domain adaptation and domain generalization, where the target magnification levels may or may not be introduced to the model in training, respectively. Although magnification adaptation is a well-studied topic in the literature, this paper, to the best of our knowledge, is the first work on magnification generalization for histopathology image embedding. We use an episodic trainable domain generalization technique for magnification generalization, namely Model Agnostic Learning of Semantic Features (MASF), which works based on the Model Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) concept. Our experimental results on a breast cancer histopathology dataset with four different magnification levels show the proposed method's effectiveness for magnification generalization."
Galaxy Image Translation with Semi-supervised Noise-reconstructed Generative Adversarial Networks,"Image-to-image translation with Deep Learning neural networks, particularly with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), is one of the most powerful methods for simulating astronomical images. However, current work is limited to utilizing paired images with supervised translation, and there has been rare discussion on reconstructing noise background that encodes instrumental and observational effects. These limitations might be harmful for subsequent scientific applications in astrophysics. Therefore, we aim to develop methods for using unpaired images and preserving noise characteristics in image translation. In this work, we propose a two-way image translation model using GANs that exploits both paired and unpaired images in a semi-supervised manner, and introduce a noise emulating module that is able to learn and reconstruct noise characterized by high-frequency features. By experimenting on multi-band galaxy images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Canada France Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHT), we show that our method recovers global and local properties effectively and outperforms benchmark image translation models. To our best knowledge, this work is the first attempt to apply semi-supervised methods and noise reconstruction techniques in astrophysical studies."
Reducing bias and increasing utility by federated generative modeling of medical images using a centralized adversary,"We introduce FELICIA (FEderated LearnIng with a CentralIzed Adversary) a generative mechanism enabling collaborative learning. In particular, we show how a data owner with limited and biased data could benefit from other data owners while keeping data from all the sources private. This is a common scenario in medical image analysis where privacy legislation prevents data from being shared outside local premises. FELICIA works for a large family of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) architectures including vanilla and conditional GANs as demonstrated in this work. We show that by using the FELICIA mechanism, a data owner with limited image samples can generate high-quality synthetic images with high utility while neither data owners has to provide access to its data. The sharing happens solely through a central discriminator that has access limited to synthetic data. Here, utility is defined as classification performance on a real test set. We demonstrate these benefits on several realistic healthcare scenarions using benchmark image datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10) as well as on medical images for the task of skin lesion classification. With multiple experiments, we show that even in the worst cases, combining FELICIA with real data gracefully achieves performance on par with real data while most results significantly improves the utility."
Generation of GelSight Tactile Images for Sim2Real Learning,"Most current works in Sim2Real learning for robotic manipulation tasks leverage camera vision that may be significantly occluded by robot hands during the manipulation. Tactile sensing offers complementary information to vision and can compensate for the information loss caused by the occlusion. However, the use of tactile sensing is restricted in the Sim2Real research due to no simulated tactile sensors being available. To mitigate the gap, we introduce a novel approach for simulating a GelSight tactile sensor in the commonly used Gazebo simulator. Similar to the real GelSight sensor, the simulated sensor can produce high-resolution images by an optical sensor from the interaction between the touched object and an opaque soft membrane. It can indirectly sense forces, geometry, texture and other properties of the object and enables Sim2Real learning with tactile sensing. Preliminary experimental results have shown that the simulated sensor could generate realistic outputs similar to the ones captured by a real GelSight sensor. All the materials used in this paper are available at https://danfergo.github.io/gelsight-simulation."
Iterative Facial Image Inpainting Based on an Encoder-Generator Architecture,"Facial image inpainting is a challenging problem as it requires generating new pixels that include semantic information for masked key components in a face, e.g., eyes and nose. Recently, remarkable methods have been proposed in this field. Most of these approaches use encoder-decoder architectures and have different limitations such as allowing unique results for a given image and a particular mask. Alternatively, some optimization-based approaches generate promising results using different masks with generator networks. However, these approaches are computationally more expensive. In this paper, we propose an efficient solution to the facial image inpainting problem using the Cyclic Reverse Generator (CRG) architecture, which provides an encoder-generator model. We use the encoder to embed a given image to the generator space and incrementally inpaint the masked regions until a plausible image is generated; we trained a discriminator model to assess the quality of the generated images during the iterations and determine the convergence. After the generation process, for the post-processing, we utilize a Unet model that we trained specifically for this task to remedy the artifacts close to the mask boundaries. We empirically observed that only a few iterations are sufficient to generate realistic images with the proposed model. Since the models are not trained for particular mask types, our method allows applying sketch-based inpaintings, using a variety of mask types, and producing multiple and diverse results. We compared our method with the state-of-the-art models both quantitatively and qualitatively, and observed that our method can compete with the other models in all mask types; it is particularly better in images where larger masks are utilized. Our code, dataset and models are available at: https://github.com/yahyadogan72/iterative facial image inpainting."
Generalized Image Reconstruction over T-Algebra,"Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is well known for its capability of dimension reduction and data compression. However, when using PCA for compressing/reconstructing images, images need to be recast to vectors. The vectorization of images makes some correlation constraints of neighboring pixels and spatial information lost. To deal with the drawbacks of the vectorizations adopted by PCA, we used small neighborhoods of each pixel to form compounded pixels and use a tensorial version of PCA, called TPCA (Tensorial Principal Component Analysis), to compress and reconstruct a compounded image of compounded pixels. Our experiments on public data show that TPCA compares favorably with PCA in compressing and reconstructing images. We also show in our experiments that the performance of TPCA increases when the order of compounded pixels increases."
The Geometry of Deep Generative Image Models and its Applications,"Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have emerged as a powerful unsupervised method to model the statistical patterns of real-world data sets, such as natural images. These networks are trained to map random inputs in their latent space to new samples representative of the learned data. However, the structure of the latent space is hard to intuit due to its high dimensionality and the non-linearity of the generator, which limits the usefulness of the models. Understanding the latent space requires a way to identify input codes for existing real-world images (inversion), and a way to identify directions with known image transformations (interpretability). Here, we use a geometric framework to address both issues simultaneously. We develop an architecture-agnostic method to compute the Riemannian metric of the image manifold created by GANs. The eigen-decomposition of the metric isolates axes that account for different levels of image variability. An empirical analysis of several pretrained GANs shows that image variation around each position is concentrated along surprisingly few major axes (the space is highly anisotropic) and the directions that create this large variation are similar at different positions in the space (the space is homogeneous). We show that many of the top eigenvectors correspond to interpretable transforms in the image space, with a substantial part of eigenspace corresponding to minor transforms which could be compressed out. This geometric understanding unifies key previous results related to GAN interpretability. We show that the use of this metric allows for more efficient optimization in the latent space (e.g. GAN inversion) and facilitates unsupervised discovery of interpretable axes. Our results illustrate that defining the geometry of the GAN image manifold can serve as a general framework for understanding GANs."
Three Dimensional MR Image Synthesis with Progressive Generative Adversarial Networks,"Mainstream deep models for three-dimensional MRI synthesis are either cross-sectional or volumetric depending on the input. Cross-sectional models can decrease the model complexity, but they may lead to discontinuity artifacts. On the other hand, volumetric models can alleviate the discontinuity artifacts, but they might suffer from loss of spatial resolution due to increased model complexity coupled with scarce training data. To mitigate the limitations of both approaches, we propose a novel model that progressively recovers the target volume via simpler synthesis tasks across individual orientations."
Generative Adversarial U-Net for Domain-free Medical Image Augmentation,"The shortage of annotated medical images is one of the biggest challenges in the field of medical image computing. Without a sufficient number of training samples, deep learning based models are very likely to suffer from over-fitting problem. The common solution is image manipulation such as image rotation, cropping, or resizing. Those methods can help relieve the over-fitting problem as more training samples are introduced. However, they do not really introduce new images with additional information and may lead to data leakage as the test set may contain similar samples which appear in the training set. To address this challenge, we propose to generate diverse images with generative adversarial network. In this paper, we develop a novel generative method named generative adversarial U-Net , which utilizes both generative adversarial network and U-Net. Different from existing approaches, our newly designed model is domain-free and generalizable to various medical images. Extensive experiments are conducted over eight diverse datasets including computed tomography (CT) scan, pathology, X-ray, etc. The visualization and quantitative results demonstrate the efficacy and good generalization of the proposed method on generating a wide array of high-quality medical images."
Cross-Modal Contrastive Learning for Text-to-Image Generation,"The output of text-to-image synthesis systems should be coherent, clear, photo-realistic scenes with high semantic fidelity to their conditioned text descriptions. Our Cross-Modal Contrastive Generative Adversarial Network (XMC-GAN) addresses this challenge by maximizing the mutual information between image and text. It does this via multiple contrastive losses which capture inter-modality and intra-modality correspondences. XMC-GAN uses an attentional self-modulation generator, which enforces strong text-image correspondence, and a contrastive discriminator, which acts as a critic as well as a feature encoder for contrastive learning. The quality of XMC-GAN's output is a major step up from previous models, as we show on three challenging datasets. On MS-COCO, not only does XMC-GAN improve state-of-the-art FID from 24.70 to 9.33, but--more importantly--people prefer XMC-GAN by 77.3 for image quality and 74.1 for image-text alignment, compared to three other recent models. XMC-GAN also generalizes to the challenging Localized Narratives dataset (which has longer, more detailed descriptions), improving state-of-the-art FID from 48.70 to 14.12. Lastly, we train and evaluate XMC-GAN on the challenging Open Images data, establishing a strong benchmark FID score of 26.91."
Cycle Generative Adversarial Networks Algorithm With Style Transfer For Image Generation,"The biggest challenge faced by a Machine Learning Engineer is the lack of data they have, especially for 2-dimensional images. The image is processed to be trained into a Machine Learning model so that it can recognize patterns in the data and provide predictions. This research is intended to create a solution using the Cycle Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) algorithm in overcoming the problem of lack of data. Then use Style Transfer to be able to generate a new image based on the given style. Based on the results of testing the resulting model has been carried out several improvements, previously the loss value of the photo generator: 3.1267, monet style generator: 3.2026, photo discriminator: 0.6325, and monet style discriminator: 0.6931 to photo generator: 2.3792, monet style generator: 2.7291, photo discriminator: 0.5956, and monet style discriminator: 0.4940. It is hoped that the research will make the application of this solution useful in the fields of Education, Arts, Information Technology, Medicine, Astronomy, Automotive and other important fields."
Generalize Ultrasound Image Segmentation via Instant and Plug & Play Style Transfer,"Deep segmentation models that generalize to images with unknown appearance are important for real-world medical image analysis. Retraining models leads to high latency and complex pipelines, which are impractical in clinical settings. The situation becomes more severe for ultrasound image analysis because of their large appearance shifts. In this paper, we propose a novel method for robust segmentation under unknown appearance shifts. Our contribution is three-fold. First, we advance a one-stage plug-and-play solution by embedding hierarchical style transfer units into a segmentation architecture. Our solution can remove appearance shifts and perform segmentation simultaneously. Second, we adopt Dynamic Instance Normalization to conduct precise and dynamic style transfer in a learnable manner, rather than previously fixed style normalization. Third, our solution is fast and lightweight for routine clinical adoption. Given 400*400 image input, our solution only needs an additional 0.2ms and 1.92M FLOPs to handle appearance shifts compared to the baseline pipeline. Extensive experiments are conducted on a large dataset from three vendors demonstrate our proposed method enhances the robustness of deep segmentation models."
Unifying Relational Sentence Generation and Retrieval for Medical Image Report Composition,"Beyond generating long and topic-coherent paragraphs in traditional captioning tasks, the medical image report composition task poses more task-oriented challenges by requiring both the highly-accurate medical term diagnosis and multiple heterogeneous forms of information including impression and findings. Current methods often generate the most common sentences due to dataset bias for individual case, regardless of whether the sentences properly capture key entities and relationships. Such limitations severely hinder their applicability and generalization capability in medical report composition where the most critical sentences lie in the descriptions of abnormal diseases that are relatively rare. Moreover, some medical terms appearing in one report are often entangled with each other and co-occurred, e.g. symptoms associated with a specific disease. To enforce the semantic consistency of medical terms to be incorporated into the final reports and encourage the sentence generation for rare abnormal descriptions, we propose a novel framework that unifies template retrieval and sentence generation to handle both common and rare abnormality while ensuring the semantic-coherency among the detected medical terms. Specifically, our approach exploits hybrid-knowledge co-reasoning: i) explicit relationships among all abnormal medical terms to induce the visual attention learning and topic representation encoding for better topic-oriented symptoms descriptions; ii) adaptive generation mode that changes between the template retrieval and sentence generation according to a contextual topic encoder. Experimental results on two medical report benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework in terms of both human and metrics evaluation."
Synthetic Glacier SAR Image Generation from Arbitrary Masks Using Pix2Pix Algorithm,"Supervised machine learning requires a large amount of labeled data to achieve proper test results. However, generating accurately labeled segmentation maps on remote sensing imagery, including images from synthetic aperture radar (SAR), is tedious and highly subjective. In this work, we propose to alleviate the issue of limited training data by generating synthetic SAR images with the pix2pix algorithm. This algorithm uses conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) to generate an artificial image while preserving the structure of the input. In our case, the input is a segmentation mask, from which a corresponding synthetic SAR image is generated. We present different models, perform a comparative study and demonstrate that this approach synthesizes convincing glaciers in SAR images with promising qualitative and quantitative results."
Guiding GANs: How to control non-conditional pre-trained GANs for conditional image generation,"Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are an arrange of two neural networks -- the generator and the discriminator -- that are jointly trained to generate artificial data, such as images, from random inputs. The quality of these generated images has recently reached such levels that can often lead both machines and humans into mistaking fake for real examples. However, the process performed by the generator of the GAN has some limitations when we want to condition the network to generate images from subcategories of a specific class. Some recent approaches tackle this \textit{conditional generation} by introducing extra information prior to the training process, such as image semantic segmentation or textual descriptions. While successful, these techniques still require defining beforehand the desired subcategories and collecting large labeled image datasets representing them to train the GAN from scratch. In this paper we present a novel and alternative method for guiding generic non-conditional GANs to behave as conditional GANs. Instead of re-training the GAN, our approach adds into the mix an encoder network to generate the high-dimensional random input vectors that are fed to the generator network of a non-conditional GAN to make it generate images from a specific subcategory. In our experiments, when compared to training a conditional GAN from scratch, our guided GAN is able to generate artificial images of perceived quality comparable to that of non-conditional GANs after training the encoder on just a few hundreds of images, which substantially accelerates the process and enables adding new subcategories seamlessly."
Biologically Inspired Hexagonal Deep Learning for Hexagonal Image Generation,"Whereas conventional state-of-the-art image processing systems of recording and output devices almost exclusively utilize square arranged methods, biological models, however, suggest an alternative, evolutionarily-based structure. Inspired by the human visual perception system, hexagonal image processing in the context of machine learning offers a number of key advantages that can benefit both researchers and users alike. The hexagonal deep learning framework Hexnet leveraged in this contribution serves therefore the generation of hexagonal images by utilizing hexagonal deep neural networks (H-DNN). As the results of our created test environment show, the proposed models can surpass current approaches of conventional image generation. While resulting in a reduction of the models' complexity in the form of trainable parameters, they furthermore allow an increase of test rates in comparison to their square counterparts."
"Generative Max-Mahalanobis Classifiers for Image Classification, Generation and More","Joint Energy-based Model (JEM) of Grathwohl et al. shows that a standard softmax classifier can be reinterpreted as an energy-based model (EBM) for the joint distribution p(x,y); the resulting model can be optimized to improve calibration, robustness, and out-of-distribution detection, while generating samples rivaling the quality of recent GAN-based approaches. However, the softmax classifier that JEM exploits is inherently discriminative and its latent feature space is not well formulated as probabilistic distributions, which may hinder its potential for image generation and incur training instability. We hypothesize that generative classifiers, such as Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), might be more suitable for image generation since generative classifiers model the data generation process explicitly. This paper therefore investigates an LDA classifier for image classification and generation. In particular, the Max-Mahalanobis Classifier (MMC), a special case of LDA, fits our goal very well. We show that our Generative MMC (GMMC) can be trained discriminatively, generatively, or jointly for image classification and generation. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets show that GMMC achieves state-of-the-art discriminative and generative performances, while outperforming JEM in calibration, adversarial robustness, and out-of-distribution detection by a significant margin. Our source code is available at https://github.com/sndnyang/GMMC."
Unpaired Image Enhancement with Quality-Attention Generative Adversarial Network,"In this work, we aim to learn an unpaired image enhancement model, which can enrich low-quality images with the characteristics of high-quality images provided by users. We propose a quality attention generative adversarial network (QAGAN) trained on unpaired data based on the bidirectional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) embedded with a quality attention module (QAM). The key novelty of the proposed QAGAN lies in the injected QAM for the generator such that it learns domain-relevant quality attention directly from the two domains. More specifically, the proposed QAM allows the generator to effectively select semantic-related characteristics from the spatial-wise and adaptively incorporate style-related attributes from the channel-wise, respectively. Therefore, in our proposed QAGAN, not only discriminators but also the generator can directly access both domains which significantly facilitates the generator to learn the mapping function. Extensive experimental results show that, compared with the state-of-the-art methods based on unpaired learning, our proposed method achieves better performance in both objective and subjective evaluations."
Towards Unsupervised Deep Image Enhancement with Generative Adversarial Network,"Improving the aesthetic quality of images is challenging and eager for the public. To address this problem, most existing algorithms are based on supervised learning methods to learn an automatic photo enhancer for paired data, which consists of low-quality photos and corresponding expert-retouched versions. However, the style and characteristics of photos retouched by experts may not meet the needs or preferences of general users. In this paper, we present an unsupervised image enhancement generative adversarial network (UEGAN), which learns the corresponding image-to-image mapping from a set of images with desired characteristics in an unsupervised manner, rather than learning on a large number of paired images. The proposed model is based on single deep GAN which embeds the modulation and attention mechanisms to capture richer global and local features. Based on the proposed model, we introduce two losses to deal with the unsupervised image enhancement: (1) fidelity loss, which is defined as a L2 regularization in the feature domain of a pre-trained VGG network to ensure the content between the enhanced image and the input image is the same, and (2) quality loss that is formulated as a relativistic hinge adversarial loss to endow the input image the desired characteristics. Both quantitative and qualitative results show that the proposed model effectively improves the aesthetic quality of images. Our code is available at: https://github.com/eezkni/UEGAN."
An Image Encryption Scheme Based on Chaotic Logarithmic Map and Key Generation using Deep CNN,"A secure and reliable image encryption scheme is presented in this study. The encryption scheme hereby introduces a novel chaotic log-map, deep convolution neural network (CNN) model for key generation, and bit reversion operation for the manipulation process. Thanks to the sensitive key generation, initial values and control parameters are produced for the hyperchaotic log-map, and thus a diverse chaotic sequence is achieved for encrypting operations. The scheme then encrypts the images by scrambling and manipulating the pixels of images through four operations: permutation, DNA encoding, diffusion, and bit reversion. The encryption scheme is precisely examined for the well-known images in terms of various analyses such as keyspace, key sensitivity, information entropy, histogram, correlation, differential attack, noisy attack, and cropping attack. To corroborate the scheme, the visual and numerical results are even compared with available outcomes of the state of the art. Therefore, the proposed log-map based image encryption scheme is successfully verified and validated by the superior absolute and comparative results."
Generalized Categorisation of Digital Pathology Whole Image Slides using Unsupervised Learning,"This project aims to break down large pathology images into small tiles and then cluster those tiles into distinct groups without the knowledge of true labels, our analysis shows how difficult certain aspects of clustering tumorous and non-tumorous cells can be and also shows that comparing the results of different unsupervised approaches is not a trivial task. The project also provides a software package to be used by the digital pathology community, that uses some of the approaches developed to perform unsupervised unsupervised tile classification, which could then be easily manually labelled.  The project uses a mixture of techniques ranging from classical clustering algorithms such as K-Means and Gaussian Mixture Models to more complicated feature extraction techniques such as deep Autoencoders and Multi-loss learning. Throughout the project, we attempt to set a benchmark for evaluation using a few measures such as completeness scores and cluster plots.  Throughout our results we show that Convolutional Autoencoders manages to slightly outperform the rest of the approaches due to its powerful internal representation learning abilities. Moreover, we show that Gaussian Mixture models produce better results than K-Means on average due to its flexibility in capturing different clusters. We also show the huge difference in the difficulties of classifying different types of pathology textures."
LEUGAN:Low-Light Image Enhancement by Unsupervised Generative Attentional Networks,"Restoring images from low-light data is a challenging problem. Most existing deep-network based algorithms are designed to be trained with pairwise images. Due to the lack of real-world datasets, they usually perform poorly when generalized in practice in terms of loss of image edge and color information. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised generation network with attention-guidance to handle the low-light image enhancement task. Specifically, our network contains two parts: an edge auxiliary module that restores sharper edges and an attention guidance module that recovers more realistic colors. Moreover, we propose a novel loss function to make the edges of the generated images more visible. Experiments validate that our proposed algorithm performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods, especially for real-world images in terms of image clarity and noise control."
Correspondence Learning for Controllable Person Image Generation,"We present a generative model for controllable person image synthesis,as shown in Figure , which can be applied to pose-guided person image synthesis, i.e., converting the pose of a source person image to the target pose while preserving the texture of that source person image, and clothing-guided person image synthesis, i.e., changing the clothing texture of a source person image to the desired clothing texture. By explicitly establishing the dense correspondence between the target pose and the source image, we can effectively address the misalignment introduced by pose tranfer and generate high-quality images. Specifically, we first generate the target semantic map under the guidence of the target pose, which can provide more accurate pose representation and structural constraints during the generation process. Then, decomposed attribute encoder is used to extract the component features, which not only helps to establish a more accurate dense correspondence, but also realizes the clothing-guided person generation. After that, we will establish a dense correspondence between the target pose and the source image within the sharded domain. The source image feature is warped according to the dense correspondence to flexibly account for deformations. Finally, the network renders image based on the warped source image feature and the target pose. Experimental results show that our method is superior to state-of-the-art methods in pose-guided person generation and its effectiveness in clothing-guided person generation."
Cloud removal in remote sensing images using generative adversarial networks and SAR-to-optical image translation,"Satellite images are often contaminated by clouds. Cloud removal has received much attention due to the wide range of satellite image applications. As the clouds thicken, the process of removing the clouds becomes more challenging. In such cases, using auxiliary images such as near-infrared or synthetic aperture radar (SAR) for reconstructing is common. In this study, we attempt to solve the problem using two generative adversarial networks (GANs). The first translates SAR images into optical images, and the second removes clouds using the translated images of prior GAN. Also, we propose dilated residual inception blocks (DRIBs) instead of vanilla U-net in the generator networks and use structural similarity index measure (SSIM) in addition to the L1 Loss function. Reducing the number of downsamplings and expanding receptive fields by dilated convolutions increase the quality of output images. We used the SEN1-2 dataset to train and test both GANs, and we made cloudy images by adding synthetic clouds to optical images. The restored images are evaluated with PSNR and SSIM. We compare the proposed method with state-of-the-art deep learning models and achieve more accurate results in both SAR-to-optical translation and cloud removal parts."
Image to Bengali Caption Generation Using Deep CNN and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit,"There is very little notable research on generating descriptions of the Bengali language. About 243 million people speak in Bengali, and it is the 7th most spoken language on the planet. The purpose of this research is to propose a CNN and Bidirectional GRU based architecture model that generates natural language captions in the Bengali language from an image. Bengali people can use this research to break the language barrier and better understand each other's perspectives. It will also help many blind people with their everyday lives. This paper used an encoder-decoder approach to generate captions. We used a pre-trained Deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) called InceptonV3image embedding model as the encoder for analysis, classification, and annotation of the dataset's images Bidirectional Gated Recurrent unit (BGRU) layer as the decoder to generate captions. Argmax and Beam search is used to produce the highest possible quality of the captions. A new dataset called BNATURE is used, which comprises 8000 images with five captions per image. It is used for training and testing the proposed model. We obtained BLEU-1, BLEU-2, BLEU-3, BLEU-4 and Meteor is 42.6, 27.95, 23, 66, 16.41, 28.7 respectively."
DeepKeyGen: A Deep Learning-based Stream Cipher Generator for Medical Image Encryption and Decryption,"The need for medical image encryption is increasingly pronounced, for example to safeguard the privacy of the patients' medical imaging data. In this paper, a novel deep learning-based key generation network (DeepKeyGen) is proposed as a stream cipher generator to generate the private key, which can then be used for encrypting and decrypting of medical images. In DeepKeyGen, the generative adversarial network (GAN) is adopted as the learning network to generate the private key. Furthermore, the transformation domain (that represents the ""style"" of the private key to be generated) is designed to guide the learning network to realize the private key generation process. The goal of DeepKeyGen is to learn the mapping relationship of how to transfer the initial image to the private key. We evaluate DeepKeyGen using three datasets, namely: the Montgomery County chest X-ray dataset, the Ultrasonic Brachial Plexus dataset, and the BraTS18 dataset. The evaluation findings and security analysis show that the proposed key generation network can achieve a high-level security in generating the private key."
Infinite Nature: Perpetual View Generation of Natural Scenes from a Single Image,"We introduce the problem of perpetual view generation - long-range generation of novel views corresponding to an arbitrarily long camera trajectory given a single image. This is a challenging problem that goes far beyond the capabilities of current view synthesis methods, which quickly degenerate when presented with large camera motions. Methods for video generation also have limited ability to produce long sequences and are often agnostic to scene geometry. We take a hybrid approach that integrates both geometry and image synthesis in an iterative `\emph{render}, \emph{refine} and \emph{repeat}' framework, allowing for long-range generation that cover large distances after hundreds of frames. Our approach can be trained from a set of monocular video sequences. We propose a dataset of aerial footage of coastal scenes, and compare our method with recent view synthesis and conditional video generation baselines, showing that it can generate plausible scenes for much longer time horizons over large camera trajectories compared to existing methods.

Combining Similarity and Adversarial Learning to Generate Visual Explanation: Application to Medical Image Classification,"Explaining decisions of black-box classifiers is paramount in sensitive domains such as medical imaging since clinicians confidence is necessary for adoption. Various explanation approaches have been proposed, among which perturbation based approaches are very promising. Within this class of methods, we leverage a learning framework to produce our visual explanations method. From a given classifier, we train two generators to produce from an input image the so called similar and adversarial images. The similar image shall be classified as the input image whereas the adversarial shall not. Visual explanation is built as the difference between these two generated images. Using metrics from the literature, our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. The proposed approach is model-agnostic and has a low computation burden at prediction time. Thus, it is adapted for real-time systems. Finally, we show that random geometric augmentations applied to the original image play a regularization role that improves several previously proposed explanation methods. We validate our approach on a large chest X-ray database."
A Generative Approach for Detection-driven Underwater Image Enhancement,"In this paper, we introduce a generative model for image enhancement specifically for improving diver detection in the underwater domain. In particular, we present a model that integrates generative adversarial network (GAN)-based image enhancement with the diver detection task. Our proposed approach restructures the GAN objective function to include information from a pre-trained diver detector with the goal to generate images which would enhance the accuracy of the detector in adverse visual conditions. By incorporating the detector output into both the generator and discriminator networks, our model is able to focus on enhancing images beyond aesthetic qualities and specifically to improve robotic detection of scuba divers. We train our network on a large dataset of scuba divers, using a state-of-the-art diver detector, and demonstrate its utility on images collected from oceanic explorations of human-robot teams. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our approach significantly improves diver detection performance over raw, unenhanced images, and even outperforms detection performance on the output of state-of-the-art underwater image enhancement algorithms. Finally, we demonstrate the inference performance of our network on embedded devices to highlight the feasibility of operating on board mobile robotic platforms."
Full-Glow: Fully conditional Glow for more realistic image generation,"Autonomous agents, such as driverless cars, require large amounts of labeled visual data for their training. A viable approach for acquiring such data is training a generative model with collected real data, and then augmenting the collected real dataset with synthetic images from the model, generated with control of the scene layout and ground truth labeling. In this paper we propose Full-Glow, a fully conditional Glow-based architecture for generating plausible and realistic images of novel street scenes given a semantic segmentation map indicating the scene layout. Benchmark comparisons show our model to outperform recent works in terms of the semantic segmentation performance of a pretrained PSPNet. This indicates that images from our model are, to a higher degree than from other models, similar to real images of the same kinds of scenes and objects, making them suitable as training data for a visual semantic segmentation or object recognition system."
Deep Mining Generation of Lung Cancer Malignancy Models from Chest X-ray Images,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death and morbidity worldwide. Many studies have shown machine learning models to be effective at detecting lung nodules from chest X-ray images. However, these techniques have yet to be embraced by the medical community due to several practical, ethical, and regulatory constraints stemming from the black-box nature of deep learning models. Additionally, most lung nodules visible on chest X-ray are benign; therefore, the narrow task of computer vision-based lung nodule detection cannot be equated to automated lung cancer detection. Addressing both concerns, this study introduces a novel hybrid deep learning and decision tree-based computer vision model which presents lung cancer malignancy predictions as interpretable decision trees. The deep learning component of this process is trained using a large publicly available dataset on pathological biomarkers associated with lung cancer. These models are then used to inference biomarker scores for chest X-ray images from two, independent data sets for which malignancy metadata is available. We mine multi-variate predictive models by fitting shallow decision trees to the malignancy stratified datasets and interrogate a range of metrics to determine the best model. Our best decision tree model achieves sensitivity and specificity of 86.7% and 80.0% respectively with a positive predictive value of 92.9%. Decision trees mined using this method may be considered as a starting point for refinement into clinically useful multi-variate lung cancer malignancy models for implementation as a workflow augmentation tool to improve the efficiency of human radiologists."
Generative Data Augmentation for Vehicle Detection in Aerial Images,"Scarcity of training data is one of the prominent problems for deep networks which require large amounts data. Data augmentation is a widely used method to increase the number of training samples and their variations. In this paper, we focus on improving vehicle detection performance in aerial images and propose a generative augmentation method which does not need any extra supervision than the bounding box annotations of the vehicle objects in the training dataset. The proposed method increases the performance of vehicle detection by allowing detectors to be trained with higher number of instances, especially when there are limited number of training instances. The proposed method is generic in the sense that it can be integrated with different generators. The experiments show that the method increases the Average Precision by up to 25.2% and 25.7% when integrated with Pluralistic and DeepFill respectively."
Conditional Generation of Medical Images via Disentangled Adversarial Inference,"Synthetic medical image generation has a huge potential for improving healthcare through many applications, from data augmentation for training machine learning systems to preserving patient privacy. Conditional Adversarial Generative Networks (cGANs) use a conditioning factor to generate images and have shown great success in recent years. Intuitively, the information in an image can be divided into two parts: 1) content which is presented through the conditioning vector and 2) style which is the undiscovered information missing from the conditioning vector. Current practices in using cGANs for medical image generation, only use a single variable for image generation (i.e., content) and therefore, do not provide much flexibility nor control over the generated image. In this work we propose a methodology to learn from the image itself, disentangled representations of style and content, and use this information to impose control over the generation process. In this framework, style is learned in a fully unsupervised manner, while content is learned through both supervised learning (using the conditioning vector) and unsupervised learning (with the inference mechanism). We undergo two novel regularization steps to ensure content-style disentanglement. First, we minimize the shared information between content and style by introducing a novel application of the gradient reverse layer (GRL); second, we introduce a self-supervised regularization method to further separate information in the content and style variables. We show that in general, two latent variable models achieve better performance and give more control over the generated image. We also show that our proposed model (DRAI) achieves the best disentanglement score and has the best overall performance."
Bayesian Image Reconstruction using Deep Generative Models,"Machine learning models are commonly trained end-to-end and in a supervised setting, using paired (input, output) data. Examples include recent super-resolution methods that train on pairs of (low-resolution, high-resolution) images. However, these end-to-end approaches require re-training every time there is a distribution shift in the inputs (e.g., night images vs daylight) or relevant latent variables (e.g., camera blur or hand motion). In this work, we leverage state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models (here StyleGAN2) for building powerful image priors, which enable application of Bayes' theorem for many downstream reconstruction tasks. Our method, Bayesian Reconstruction through Generative Models (BRGM), uses a single pre-trained generator model to solve different image restoration tasks, i.e., super-resolution and in-painting, by combining it with different forward corruption models. We keep the weights of the generator model fixed, and reconstruct the image by estimating the Bayesian maximum a-posteriori (MAP) estimate over the input latent vector that generated the reconstructed image. We further use variational inference to approximate the posterior distribution over the latent vectors, from which we sample multiple solutions. We demonstrate BRGM on three large and diverse datasets: (i) 60,000 images from the Flick Faces High Quality dataset (ii) 240,000 chest X-rays from MIMIC III and (iii) a combined collection of 5 brain MRI datasets with 7,329 scans. Across all three datasets and without any dataset-specific hyperparameter tuning, our simple approach yields performance competitive with current task-specific state-of-the-art methods on super-resolution and in-painting, while being more generalisable and without requiring any training. Our source code and pre-trained models are available online: https://razvanmarinescu.github.io/brgm/."
VAE-Info-cGAN: Generating Synthetic Images by Combining Pixel-level and Feature-level Geospatial Conditional Inputs,"Training robust supervised deep learning models for many geospatial applications of computer vision is difficult due to dearth of class-balanced and diverse training data. Conversely, obtaining enough training data for many applications is financially prohibitive or may be infeasible, especially when the application involves modeling rare or extreme events. Synthetically generating data (and labels) using a generative model that can sample from a target distribution and exploit the multi-scale nature of images can be an inexpensive solution to address scarcity of labeled data. Towards this goal, we present a deep conditional generative model, called VAE-Info-cGAN, that combines a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with a conditional Information Maximizing Generative Adversarial Network (InfoGAN), for synthesizing semantically rich images simultaneously conditioned on a pixel-level condition (PLC) and a macroscopic feature-level condition (FLC). Dimensionally, the PLC can only vary in the channel dimension from the synthesized image and is meant to be a task-specific input. The FLC is modeled as an attribute vector in the latent space of the generated image which controls the contributions of various characteristic attributes germane to the target distribution. An interpretation of the attribute vector to systematically generate synthetic images by varying a chosen binary macroscopic feature is explored. Experiments on a GPS trajectories dataset show that the proposed model can accurately generate various forms of spatio-temporal aggregates across different geographic locations while conditioned only on a raster representation of the road network. The primary intended application of the VAE-Info-cGAN is synthetic data (and label) generation for targeted data augmentation for computer vision-based modeling of problems relevant to geospatial analysis and remote sensing."
Overcoming Barriers to Data Sharing with Medical Image Generation: A Comprehensive Evaluation,"Privacy concerns around sharing personally identifiable information are a major practical barrier to data sharing in medical research. However, in many cases, researchers have no interest in a particular individual's information but rather aim to derive insights at the level of cohorts. Here, we utilize Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create derived medical imaging datasets consisting entirely of synthetic patient data. The synthetic images ideally have, in aggregate, similar statistical properties to those of a source dataset but do not contain sensitive personal information. We assess the quality of synthetic data generated by two GAN models for chest radiographs with 14 different radiology findings and brain computed tomography (CT) scans with six types of intracranial hemorrhages. We measure the synthetic image quality by the performance difference of predictive models trained on either the synthetic or the real dataset. We find that synthetic data performance disproportionately benefits from a reduced number of unique label combinations. Our open-source benchmark also indicates that at low number of samples per class, label overfitting effects start to dominate GAN training. We additionally conducted a reader study in which trained radiologists do not perform better than random on discriminating between synthetic and real medical images for intermediate levels of resolutions. In accordance with our benchmark results, the classification accuracy of radiologists increases at higher spatial resolution levels. Our study offers valuable guidelines and outlines practical conditions under which insights derived from synthetic medical images are similar to those that would have been derived from real imaging data. Our results indicate that synthetic data sharing may be an attractive and privacy-preserving alternative to sharing real patient-level data in the right settings."
Generating Natural Questions from Images for Multimodal Assistants,"Generating natural, diverse, and meaningful questions from images is an essential task for multimodal assistants as it confirms whether they have understood the object and scene in the images properly. The research in visual question answering (VQA) and visual question generation (VQG) is a great step. However, this research does not capture questions that a visually-abled person would ask multimodal assistants. Recently published datasets such as KB-VQA, FVQA, and OK-VQA try to collect questions that look for external knowledge which makes them appropriate for multimodal assistants. However, they still contain many obvious and common-sense questions that humans would not usually ask a digital assistant. In this paper, we provide a new benchmark dataset that contains questions generated by human annotators keeping in mind what they would ask multimodal digital assistants. Large scale annotations for several hundred thousand images are expensive and time-consuming, so we also present an effective way of automatically generating questions from unseen images. In this paper, we present an approach for generating diverse and meaningful questions that consider image content and metadata of image (e.g., location, associated keyword). We evaluate our approach using standard evaluation metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and CIDEr to show the relevance of generated questions with human-provided questions. We also measure the diversity of generated questions using generative strength and inventiveness metrics. We report new state-of-the-art results on the public and our datasets."
TediGAN: Text-Guided Diverse Face Image Generation and Manipulation,"In this work, we propose TediGAN, a novel framework for multi-modal image generation and manipulation with textual descriptions. The proposed method consists of three components: StyleGAN inversion module, visual-linguistic similarity learning, and instance-level optimization. The inversion module maps real images to the latent space of a well-trained StyleGAN. The visual-linguistic similarity learns the text-image matching by mapping the image and text into a common embedding space. The instance-level optimization is for identity preservation in manipulation. Our model can produce diverse and high-quality images with an unprecedented resolution at 1024. Using a control mechanism based on style-mixing, our TediGAN inherently supports image synthesis with multi-modal inputs, such as sketches or semantic labels, with or without instance guidance. To facilitate text-guided multi-modal synthesis, we propose the Multi-Modal CelebA-HQ, a large-scale dataset consisting of real face images and corresponding semantic segmentation map, sketch, and textual descriptions. Extensive experiments on the introduced dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method. Code and data are available at https://github.com/weihaox/TediGAN."
DGGAN: Depth-image Guided Generative Adversarial Networks for Disentangling RGB and Depth Images in 3D Hand Pose Estimation,"Estimating3D hand poses from RGB images is essentialto a wide range of potential applications, but is challengingowing to substantial ambiguity in the inference of depth in-formation from RGB images. State-of-the-art estimators ad-dress this problem by regularizing3D hand pose estimationmodels during training to enforce the consistency betweenthe predicted3D poses and the ground-truth depth maps.However, these estimators rely on both RGB images and thepaired depth maps during training. In this study, we proposea conditional generative adversarial network (GAN) model,called Depth-image Guided GAN (DGGAN), to generate re-alistic depth maps conditioned on the input RGB image, anduse the synthesized depth maps to regularize the3D handpose estimation model, therefore eliminating the need forground-truth depth maps. Experimental results on multiplebenchmark datasets show that the synthesized depth mapsproduced by DGGAN are quite effective in regularizing thepose estimation model, yielding new state-of-the-art resultsin estimation accuracy, notably reducing the mean3D end-point errors (EPE) by4.7%,16.5%, and6.8%on the RHD,STB and MHP datasets, respectively."
Spectral Distribution Aware Image Generation,"Recent advances in deep generative models for photo-realistic images have led to high quality visual results. Such models learn to generate data from a given training distribution such that generated images can not be easily distinguished from real images by the human eye. Yet, recent work on the detection of such fake images pointed out that they are actually easily distinguishable by artifacts in their frequency spectra. In this paper, we propose to generate images according to the frequency distribution of the real data by employing a spectral discriminator. The proposed discriminator is lightweight, modular and works stably with different commonly used GAN losses. We show that the resulting models can better generate images with realistic frequency spectra, which are thus harder to detect by this cue."
MPG: A Multi-ingredient Pizza Image Generator with Conditional StyleGANs,"Multilabel conditional image generation is a challenging problem in computer vision. In this work we propose Multi-ingredient Pizza Generator (MPG), a conditional Generative Neural Network (GAN) framework for synthesizing multilabel images. We design MPG based on a state-of-the-art GAN structure called StyleGAN2, in which we develop a new conditioning technique by enforcing intermediate feature maps to learn scalewise label information. Because of the complex nature of the multilabel image generation problem, we also regularize synthetic image by predicting the corresponding ingredients as well as encourage the discriminator to distinguish between matched image and mismatched image. To verify the efficacy of MPG, we test it on Pizza10, which is a carefully annotated multi-ingredient pizza image dataset. MPG can successfully generate photo-realist pizza images with desired ingredients. The framework can be easily extend to other multilabel image generation scenarios."
Few-shot Image Generation with Elastic Weight Consolidation,"Few-shot image generation seeks to generate more data of a given domain, with only few available training examples. As it is unreasonable to expect to fully infer the distribution from just a few observations (e.g., emojis), we seek to leverage a large, related source domain as pretraining (e.g., human faces). Thus, we wish to preserve the diversity of the source domain, while adapting to the appearance of the target. We adapt a pretrained model, without introducing any additional parameters, to the few examples of the target domain. Crucially, we regularize the changes of the weights during this adaptation, in order to best preserve the information of the source dataset, while fitting the target. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm by generating high-quality results of different target domains, including those with extremely few examples (e.g., <10). We also analyze the performance of our method with respect to some important factors, such as the number of examples and the dissimilarity between the source and target domain."
Generator Pyramid for High-Resolution Image Inpainting,"Inpainting high-resolution images with large holes challenges existing deep learning based image inpainting methods. We present a novel framework -- PyramidFill for high-resolution image inpainting task, which explicitly disentangles content completion and texture synthesis. PyramidFill attempts to complete the content of unknown regions in a lower-resolution image, and synthesis the textures of unknown regions in a higher-resolution image, progressively. Thus, our model consists of a pyramid of fully convolutional GANs, wherein the content GAN is responsible for completing contents in the lowest-resolution masked image, and each texture GAN is responsible for synthesizing textures in a higher-resolution image. Since completing contents and synthesising textures demand different abilities from generators, we customize different architectures for the content GAN and texture GAN. Experiments on multiple datasets including CelebA-HQ, Places2 and a new natural scenery dataset (NSHQ) with different resolutions demonstrate that PyramidFill generates higher-quality inpainting results than the state-of-the-art methods. To better assess high-resolution image inpainting methods, we will release NSHQ, high-quality natural scenery images with high-resolution 1920\times1080."
CIT-GAN: Cyclic Image Translation Generative Adversarial Network With Application in Iris Presentation Attack Detection,"In this work, we propose a novel Cyclic Image Translation Generative Adversarial Network (CIT-GAN) for multi-domain style transfer. To facilitate this, we introduce a Styling Network that has the capability to learn style characteristics of each domain represented in the training dataset. The Styling Network helps the generator to drive the translation of images from a source domain to a reference domain and generate synthetic images with style characteristics of the reference domain. The learned style characteristics for each domain depend on both the style loss and domain classification loss. This induces variability in style characteristics within each domain. The proposed CIT-GAN is used in the context of iris presentation attack detection (PAD) to generate synthetic presentation attack (PA) samples for classes that are under-represented in the training set. Evaluation using current state-of-the-art iris PAD methods demonstrates the efficacy of using such synthetically generated PA samples for training PAD methods. Further, the quality of the synthetically generated samples is evaluated using Frechet Inception Distance (FID) score. Results show that the quality of synthetic images generated by the proposed method is superior to that of other competing methods, including StarGan."
Generating Descriptions for Sequential Images with Local-Object Attention and Global Semantic Context Modelling,"In this paper, we propose an end-to-end CNN-LSTM model for generating descriptions for sequential images with a local-object attention mechanism. To generate coherent descriptions, we capture global semantic context using a multi-layer perceptron, which learns the dependencies between sequential images. A paralleled LSTM network is exploited for decoding the sequence descriptions. Experimental results show that our model outperforms the baseline across three different evaluation metrics on the datasets published by Microsoft."
pi-GAN: Periodic Implicit Generative Adversarial Networks for 3D-Aware Image Synthesis,"We have witnessed rapid progress on 3D-aware image synthesis, leveraging recent advances in generative visual models and neural rendering. Existing approaches however fall short in two ways: first, they may lack an underlying 3D representation or rely on view-inconsistent rendering, hence synthesizing images that are not multi-view consistent; second, they often depend upon representation network architectures that are not expressive enough, and their results thus lack in image quality. We propose a novel generative model, named Periodic Implicit Generative Adversarial Networks (π-GAN or pi-GAN), for high-quality 3D-aware image synthesis. π-GAN leverages neural representations with periodic activation functions and volumetric rendering to represent scenes as view-consistent 3D representations with fine detail. The proposed approach obtains state-of-the-art results for 3D-aware image synthesis with multiple real and synthetic datasets."
GLEAN: Generative Latent Bank for Large-Factor Image Super-Resolution,"We show that pre-trained Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), e.g., StyleGAN, can be used as a latent bank to improve the restoration quality of large-factor image super-resolution (SR). While most existing SR approaches attempt to generate realistic textures through learning with adversarial loss, our method, Generative LatEnt bANk (GLEAN), goes beyond existing practices by directly leveraging rich and diverse priors encapsulated in a pre-trained GAN. But unlike prevalent GAN inversion methods that require expensive image-specific optimization at runtime, our approach only needs a single forward pass to generate the upscaled image. GLEAN can be easily incorporated in a simple encoder-bank-decoder architecture with multi-resolution skip connections. Switching the bank allows the method to deal with images from diverse categories, e.g., cat, building, human face, and car. Images upscaled by GLEAN show clear improvements in terms of fidelity and texture faithfulness in comparison to existing methods."
Long-range medical image registration through generalized mutual information (GMI): toward a fully automatic volumetric alignment,"Image registration is a key operation in medical image processing, allowing a plethora of applications. Mutual information (MI) is consolidated as a robust similarity metric often used for medical image registration. Although MI provides a robust medical image registration, it usually fails when the needed image transform is too big due to MI local maxima traps. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a generalized parametric MI as an affine registration cost function. We assessed the generalized MI (GMI) functions for separable affine transforms and exhaustively evaluated the GMI mathematical image seeking the maximum registration range through a gradient descent simulation. We also employed Monte Carlo simulation essays for testing translation registering of randomized T1 versus T2 images. GMI functions showed to have smooth isosurfaces driving the algorithm to the global maxima. Results show significantly prolonged registration ranges, avoiding the traps of local maxima. We evaluated a range of [-150mm,150mm] for translations, [-180°,180°] for rotations, [0.5,2] for scales, and [-1,1] for skew with a success rate of 99.99%, 97.58%, 99.99%, and 99.99% respectively for the transforms in the simulated gradient descent. We also obtained 99.75% success in Monte Carlo simulation from 2,000 randomized translations trials with 1,113 subjects T1 and T2 MRI images. The findings point towards the reliability of GMI for long-range registration with enhanced speed performance"
Learning geometry-image representation for 3D point cloud generation,"We study the problem of generating point clouds of 3D objects. Instead of discretizing the object into 3D voxels with huge computational cost and resolution limitations, we propose a novel geometry image based generator (GIG) to convert the 3D point cloud generation problem to a 2D geometry image generation problem. Since the geometry image is a completely regular 2D array that contains the surface points of the 3D object, it leverages both the regularity of the 2D array and the geodesic neighborhood of the 3D surface. Thus, one significant benefit of our GIG is that it allows us to directly generate the 3D point clouds using efficient 2D image generation networks. Experiments on both rigid and non-rigid 3D object datasets have demonstrated the promising performance of our method to not only create plausible and novel 3D objects, but also learn a probabilistic latent space that well supports the shape editing like interpolation and arithmetic."
General Multi-label Image Classification with Transformers,"Multi-label image classification is the task of predicting a set of labels corresponding to objects, attributes or other entities present in an image. In this work we propose the Classification Transformer (C-Tran), a general framework for multi-label image classification that leverages Transformers to exploit the complex dependencies among visual features and labels. Our approach consists of a Transformer encoder trained to predict a set of target labels given an input set of masked labels, and visual features from a convolutional neural network. A key ingredient of our method is a label mask training objective that uses a ternary encoding scheme to represent the state of the labels as positive, negative, or unknown during training. Our model shows state-of-the-art performance on challenging datasets such as COCO and Visual Genome. Moreover, because our model explicitly represents the uncertainty of labels during training, it is more general by allowing us to produce improved results for images with partial or extra label annotations during inference. We demonstrate this additional capability in the COCO, Visual Genome, News500, and CUB image datasets."
Progressively Volumetrized Deep Generative Models for Data-Efficient Contextual Learning of MR Image Recovery,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers the flexibility to image a given anatomic volume under a multitude of tissue contrasts. Yet, scan time considerations put stringent limits on the quality and diversity of MRI data. The gold-standard approach to alleviate this limitation is to recover high-quality images from data undersampled across various dimensions, most commonly the Fourier domain or contrast sets. A primary distinction among recovery methods is whether the anatomy is processed per volume or per cross-section. Volumetric models offer enhanced capture of global contextual information, but they can suffer from suboptimal learning due to elevated model complexity. Cross-sectional models with lower complexity offer improved learning behavior, yet they ignore contextual information across the longitudinal dimension of the volume. Here, we introduce a novel progressive volumetrization strategy for generative models (ProvoGAN) that serially decomposes complex volumetric image recovery tasks into successive cross-sectional mappings task-optimally ordered across individual rectilinear dimensions. ProvoGAN effectively captures global context and recovers fine-structural details across all dimensions, while maintaining low model complexity and improved learning behaviour. Comprehensive demonstrations on mainstream MRI reconstruction and synthesis tasks show that ProvoGAN yields superior performance to state-of-the-art volumetric and cross-sectional models."
Image Generators with Conditionally-Independent Pixel Synthesis,"Existing image generator networks rely heavily on spatial convolutions and, optionally, self-attention blocks in order to gradually synthesize images in a coarse-to-fine manner. Here, we present a new architecture for image generators, where the color value at each pixel is computed independently given the value of a random latent vector and the coordinate of that pixel. No spatial convolutions or similar operations that propagate information across pixels are involved during the synthesis. We analyze the modeling capabilities of such generators when trained in an adversarial fashion, and observe the new generators to achieve similar generation quality to state-of-the-art convolutional generators. We also investigate several interesting properties unique to the new architecture."
A Sheaf and Topology Approach to Generating Local Branch Numbers in Digital Images,"This paper concerns a theoretical approach that combines topological data analysis (TDA) and sheaf theory. Topological data analysis, a rising field in mathematics and computer science, concerns the shape of the data and has been proven effective in many scientific disciplines. Sheaf theory, a mathematics subject in algebraic geometry, provides a framework for describing the local consistency in geometric objects. Persistent homology (PH) is one of the main driving forces in TDA, and the idea is to track changes of geometric objects at different scales. The persistence diagram (PD) summarizes the information of PH in the form of a multi-set. While PD provides useful information about the underlying objects, it lacks fine relations about the local consistency of specific pairs of generators in PD, such as the merging relation between two connected components in the PH. The sheaf structure provides a novel point of view for describing the merging relation of local objects in PH. It is the goal of this paper to establish a theoretic framework that utilizes the sheaf theory to uncover finer information from the PH. We also show that the proposed theory can be applied to identify the branch numbers of local objects in digital images."
Tractable loss function and color image generation of multinary restricted Boltzmann machine,"The restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) is a representative generative model based on the concept of statistical mechanics. In spite of the strong merit of interpretability, unavailability of backpropagation makes it less competitive than other generative models. Here we derive differentiable loss functions for both binary and multinary RBMs. Then we demonstrate their learnability and performance by generating colored face images."
Adaptive Multiplane Image Generation from a Single Internet Picture,"In the last few years, several works have tackled the problem of novel view synthesis from stereo images or even from a single picture. However, previous methods are computationally expensive, specially for high-resolution images. In this paper, we address the problem of generating a multiplane image (MPI) from a single high-resolution picture. We present the adaptive-MPI representation, which allows rendering novel views with low computational requirements. To this end, we propose an adaptive slicing algorithm that produces an MPI with a variable number of image planes. We present a new lightweight CNN for depth estimation, which is learned by knowledge distillation from a larger network. Occluded regions in the adaptive-MPI are inpainted also by a lightweight CNN. We show that our method is capable of producing high-quality predictions with one order of magnitude less parameters compared to previous approaches. The robustness of our method is evidenced on challenging pictures from the Internet."
Augmentation-Interpolative AutoEncoders for Unsupervised Few-Shot Image Generation,"We aim to build image generation models that generalize to new domains from few examples. To this end, we first investigate the generalization properties of classic image generators, and discover that autoencoders generalize extremely well to new domains, even when trained on highly constrained data. We leverage this insight to produce a robust, unsupervised few-shot image generation algorithm, and introduce a novel training procedure based on recovering an image from data augmentations. Our Augmentation-Interpolative AutoEncoders synthesize realistic images of novel objects from only a few reference images, and outperform both prior interpolative models and supervised few-shot image generators. Our procedure is simple and lightweight, generalizes broadly, and requires no category labels or other supervision during training."
CR-Fill: Generative Image Inpainting with Auxiliary Contexutal Reconstruction,"Recent deep generative inpainting methods use attention layers to allow the generator to explicitly borrow feature patches from the known region to complete a missing region. Due to the lack of supervision signals for the correspondence between missing regions and known regions, it may fail to find proper reference features, which often leads to artifacts in the results. Also, it computes pair-wise similarity across the entire feature map during inference bringing a significant computational overhead. To address this issue, we propose to teach such patch-borrowing behavior to an attention-free generator by joint training of an auxiliary contextual reconstruction task, which encourages the generated output to be plausible even when reconstructed by surrounding regions. The auxiliary branch can be seen as a learnable loss function, i.e. named as contextual reconstruction (CR) loss, where query-reference feature similarity and reference-based reconstructor are jointly optimized with the inpainting generator. The auxiliary branch (i.e. CR loss) is required only during training, and only the inpainting generator is required during the inference. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed inpainting model compares favourably against the state-of-the-art in terms of quantitative and visual performance."
StyleSpace Analysis: Disentangled Controls for StyleGAN Image Generation,"We explore and analyze the latent style space of StyleGAN2, a state-of-the-art architecture for image generation, using models pretrained on several different datasets. We first show that StyleSpace, the space of channel-wise style parameters, is significantly more disentangled than the other intermediate latent spaces explored by previous works. Next, we describe a method for discovering a large collection of style channels, each of which is shown to control a distinct visual attribute in a highly localized and disentangled manner. Third, we propose a simple method for identifying style channels that control a specific attribute, using a pretrained classifier or a small number of example images. Manipulation of visual attributes via these StyleSpace controls is shown to be better disentangled than via those proposed in previous works. To show this, we make use of a newly proposed Attribute Dependency metric. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of StyleSpace controls to the manipulation of real images. Our findings pave the way to semantically meaningful and well-disentangled image manipulations via simple and intuitive interfaces."
Adversarial Generation of Continuous Images,"In most existing learning systems, images are typically viewed as 2D pixel arrays. However, in another paradigm gaining popularity, a 2D image is represented as an implicit neural representation (INR) - an MLP that predicts an RGB pixel value given its (x,y) coordinate. In this paper, we propose two novel architectural techniques for building INR-based image decoders: factorized multiplicative modulation and multi-scale INRs, and use them to build a state-of-the-art continuous image GAN. Previous attempts to adapt INRs for image generation were limited to MNIST-like datasets and do not scale to complex real-world data. Our proposed INR-GAN architecture improves the performance of continuous image generators by several times, greatly reducing the gap between continuous image GANs and pixel-based ones. Apart from that, we explore several exciting properties of the INR-based decoders, like out-of-the-box superresolution, meaningful image-space interpolation, accelerated inference of low-resolution images, an ability to extrapolate outside of image boundaries, and strong geometric prior. The project page is located at https://universome.github.io/inr-gan."
HistoGAN: Controlling Colors of GAN-Generated and Real Images via Color Histograms,"While generative adversarial networks (GANs) can successfully produce high-quality images, they can be challenging to control. Simplifying GAN-based image generation is critical for their adoption in graphic design and artistic work. This goal has led to significant interest in methods that can intuitively control the appearance of images generated by GANs. In this paper, we present HistoGAN, a color histogram-based method for controlling GAN-generated images' colors. We focus on color histograms as they provide an intuitive way to describe image color while remaining decoupled from domain-specific semantics. Specifically, we introduce an effective modification of the recent StyleGAN architecture to control the colors of GAN-generated images specified by a target color histogram feature. We then describe how to expand HistoGAN to recolor real images. For image recoloring, we jointly train an encoder network along with HistoGAN. The recoloring model, ReHistoGAN, is an unsupervised approach trained to encourage the network to keep the original image's content while changing the colors based on the given target histogram. We show that this histogram-based approach offers a better way to control GAN-generated and real images' colors while producing more compelling results compared to existing alternative strategies."
Very Deep VAEs Generalize Autoregressive Models and Can Outperform Them on Images,"We present a hierarchical VAE that, for the first time, generates samples quickly while outperforming the PixelCNN in log-likelihood on all natural image benchmarks. We begin by observing that, in theory, VAEs can actually represent autoregressive models, as well as faster, better models if they exist, when made sufficiently deep. Despite this, autoregressive models have historically outperformed VAEs in log-likelihood. We test if insufficient depth explains why by scaling a VAE to greater stochastic depth than previously explored and evaluating it CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and FFHQ. In comparison to the PixelCNN, these very deep VAEs achieve higher likelihoods, use fewer parameters, generate samples thousands of times faster, and are more easily applied to high-resolution images. Qualitative studies suggest this is because the VAE learns efficient hierarchical visual representations. We release our source code and models at https://github.com/openai/vdvae."
Inspecting state of the art performance and NLP metrics in image-based medical report generation,"Several deep learning architectures have been proposed over the last years to deal with the problem of generating a written report given an imaging exam as input. Most works evaluate the generated reports using standard Natural Language Processing (NLP) metrics (e.g. BLEU, ROUGE), reporting significant progress. In this article, we contrast this progress by comparing state of the art (SOTA) models against weak baselines. We show that simple and even naive approaches yield near SOTA performance on most traditional NLP metrics. We conclude that evaluation methods in this task should be further studied towards correctly measuring clinical accuracy, ideally involving physicians to contribute to this end."
MUST-GAN: Multi-level Statistics Transfer for Self-driven Person Image Generation,"Pose-guided person image generation usually involves using paired source-target images to supervise the training, which significantly increases the data preparation effort and limits the application of the models. To deal with this problem, we propose a novel multi-level statistics transfer model, which disentangles and transfers multi-level appearance features from person images and merges them with pose features to reconstruct the source person images themselves. So that the source images can be used as supervision for self-driven person image generation. Specifically, our model extracts multi-level features from the appearance encoder and learns the optimal appearance representation through attention mechanism and attributes statistics. Then we transfer them to a pose-guided generator for re-fusion of appearance and pose. Our approach allows for flexible manipulation of person appearance and pose properties to perform pose transfer and clothes style transfer tasks. Experimental results on the DeepFashion dataset demonstrate our method's superiority compared with state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised methods. In addition, our approach also performs well in the wild."
Survey2Survey: A deep learning generative model approach for cross-survey image mapping,"During the last decade, there has been an explosive growth in survey data and deep learning techniques, both of which have enabled great advances for astronomy. The amount of data from various surveys from multiple epochs with a wide range of wavelengths, albeit with varying brightness and quality, is overwhelming, and leveraging information from overlapping observations from different surveys has limitless potential in understanding galaxy formation and evolution. Synthetic galaxy image generation using physical models has been an important tool for survey data analysis, while deep learning generative models show great promise. In this paper, we present a novel approach for robustly expanding and improving survey data through cross survey feature translation. We trained two types of neural networks to map images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to corresponding images from the Dark Energy Survey (DES). This map was used to generate false DES representations of SDSS images, increasing the brightness and S/N while retaining important morphological information. We substantiate the robustness of our method by generating DES representations of SDSS images from outside the overlapping region, showing that the brightness and quality are improved even when the source images are of lower quality than the training images. Finally, we highlight several images in which the reconstruction process appears to have removed large artifacts from SDSS images. While only an initial application, our method shows promise as a method for robustly expanding and improving the quality of optical survey data and provides a potential avenue for cross-band reconstruction."
Generative and Discriminative Learning for Distorted Image Restoration,"Liquify is a common technique for image editing, which can be used for image distortion. Due to the uncertainty in the distortion variation, restoring distorted images caused by liquify filter is a challenging task. To edit images in an efficient way, distorted images are expected to be restored automatically. This paper aims at the distorted image restoration, which is characterized by seeking the appropriate warping and completion of a distorted image. Existing methods focus on the hardware assistance or the geometric principle to solve the specific regular deformation caused by natural phenomena, but they cannot handle the irregularity and uncertainty of artificial distortion in this task. To address this issue, we propose a novel generative and discriminative learning method based on deep neural networks, which can learn various reconstruction mappings and represent complex and high-dimensional data. This method decomposes the task into a rectification stage and a refinement stage. The first stage generative network predicts the mapping from the distorted images to the rectified ones. The second stage generative network then further optimizes the perceptual quality. Since there is no available dataset or benchmark to explore this task, we create a Distorted Face Dataset (DFD) by forward distortion mapping based on CelebA dataset. Extensive experimental evaluation on the proposed benchmark and the application demonstrates that our method is an effective way for distorted image restoration."
Generating Image Descriptions via Sequential Cross-Modal Alignment Guided by Human Gaze,"When speakers describe an image, they tend to look at objects before mentioning them. In this paper, we investigate such sequential cross-modal alignment by modelling the image description generation process computationally. We take as our starting point a state-of-the-art image captioning system and develop several model variants that exploit information from human gaze patterns recorded during language production. In particular, we propose the first approach to image description generation where visual processing is modelled \textit{sequentially}. Our experiments and analyses confirm that better descriptions can be obtained by exploiting gaze-driven attention and shed light on human cognitive processes by comparing different ways of aligning the gaze modality with language production. We find that processing gaze data sequentially leads to descriptions that are better aligned to those produced by speakers, more diverse, and more natural{-}particularly when gaze is encoded with a dedicated recurrent component."
Two-Stream Appearance Transfer Network for Person Image Generation,"Pose guided person image generation means to generate a photo-realistic person image conditioned on an input person image and a desired pose. This task requires spatial manipulation of the source image according to the target pose. However, the generative adversarial networks (GANs) widely used for image generation and translation rely on spatially local and translation equivariant operators, i.e., convolution, pooling and unpooling, which cannot handle large image deformation. This paper introduces a novel two-stream appearance transfer network (2s-ATN) to address this challenge. It is a multi-stage architecture consisting of a source stream and a target stream. Each stage features an appearance transfer module and several two-stream feature fusion modules. The former finds the dense correspondence between the two-stream feature maps and then transfers the appearance information from the source stream to the target stream. The latter exchange local information between the two streams and supplement the non-local appearance transfer. Both quantitative and qualitative results indicate the proposed 2s-ATN can effectively handle large spatial deformation and occlusion while retaining the appearance details. It outperforms prior states of the art on two widely used benchmarks."
Image Clustering using an Augmented Generative Adversarial Network and Information Maximization,"Image clustering has recently attracted significant attention due to the increased availability of unlabelled datasets. The efficiency of traditional clustering algorithms heavily depends on the distance functions used and the dimensionality of the features. Therefore, performance degradation is often observed when tackling either unprocessed images or high-dimensional features extracted from processed images. To deal with these challenges, we propose a deep clustering framework consisting of a modified generative adversarial network (GAN) and an auxiliary classifier. The modification employs Sobel operations prior to the discriminator of the GAN to enhance the separability of the learned features. The discriminator is then leveraged to generate representations as the input to an auxiliary classifier. An adaptive objective function is utilised to train the auxiliary classifier for clustering the representations, aiming to increase the robustness by minimizing the divergence of multiple representations generated by the discriminator. The auxiliary classifier is implemented with a group of multiple cluster-heads, where a tolerance hyper-parameter is used to tackle imbalanced data. Our results indicate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art clustering methods on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, and is competitive on the STL10 and MNIST datasets."
Text-to-Image Generation Grounded by Fine-Grained User Attention,"Localized Narratives is a dataset with detailed natural language descriptions of images paired with mouse traces that provide a sparse, fine-grained visual grounding for phrases. We propose TReCS, a sequential model that exploits this grounding to generate images. TReCS uses descriptions to retrieve segmentation masks and predict object labels aligned with mouse traces. These alignments are used to select and position masks to generate a fully covered segmentation canvas; the final image is produced by a segmentation-to-image generator using this canvas. This multi-step, retrieval-based approach outperforms existing direct text-to-image generation models on both automatic metrics and human evaluations: overall, its generated images are more photo-realistic and better match descriptions."
DTGAN: Dual Attention Generative Adversarial Networks for Text-to-Image Generation,"Most existing text-to-image generation methods adopt a multi-stage modular architecture which has three significant problems: 1) Training multiple networks increases the run time and affects the convergence and stability of the generative model; 2) These approaches ignore the quality of early-stage generator images; 3) Many discriminators need to be trained. To this end, we propose the Dual Attention Generative Adversarial Network (DTGAN) which can synthesize high-quality and semantically consistent images only employing a single generator/discriminator pair. The proposed model introduces channel-aware and pixel-aware attention modules that can guide the generator to focus on text-relevant channels and pixels based on the global sentence vector and to fine-tune original feature maps using attention weights. Also, Conditional Adaptive Instance-Layer Normalization (CAdaILN) is presented to help our attention modules flexibly control the amount of change in shape and texture by the input natural-language description. Furthermore, a new type of visual loss is utilized to enhance the image resolution by ensuring vivid shape and perceptually uniform color distributions of generated images. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method compared to the state-of-the-art models with a multi-stage framework. Visualization of the attention maps shows that the channel-aware attention module is able to localize the discriminative regions, while the pixel-aware attention module has the ability to capture the globally visual contents for the generation of an image."
Learning a Generative Motion Model from Image Sequences based on a Latent Motion Matrix,"We propose to learn a probabilistic motion model from a sequence of images for spatio-temporal registration. Our model encodes motion in a low-dimensional probabilistic space - the motion matrix - which enables various motion analysis tasks such as simulation and interpolation of realistic motion patterns allowing for faster data acquisition and data augmentation. More precisely, the motion matrix allows to transport the recovered motion from one subject to another simulating for example a pathological motion in a healthy subject without the need for inter-subject registration. The method is based on a conditional latent variable model that is trained using amortized variational inference. This unsupervised generative model follows a novel multivariate Gaussian process prior and is applied within a temporal convolutional network which leads to a diffeomorphic motion model. Temporal consistency and generalizability is further improved by applying a temporal dropout training scheme. Applied to cardiac cine-MRI sequences, we show improved registration accuracy and spatio-temporally smoother deformations compared to three state-of-the-art registration algorithms. Besides, we demonstrate the model's applicability for motion analysis, simulation and super-resolution by an improved motion reconstruction from sequences with missing frames compared to linear and cubic interpolation."
DeepOpht: Medical Report Generation for Retinal Images via Deep Models and Visual Explanation,"In this work, we propose an AI-based method that intends to improve the conventional retinal disease treatment procedure and help ophthalmologists increase diagnosis efficiency and accuracy. The proposed method is composed of a deep neural networks-based (DNN-based) module, including a retinal disease identifier and clinical description generator, and a DNN visual explanation module. To train and validate the effectiveness of our DNN-based module, we propose a large-scale retinal disease image dataset. Also, as ground truth, we provide a retinal image dataset manually labeled by ophthalmologists to qualitatively show, the proposed AI-based method is effective. With our experimental results, we show that the proposed method is quantitatively and qualitatively effective. Our method is capable of creating meaningful retinal image descriptions and visual explanations that are clinically relevant."
Enhanced Balancing GAN: Minority-class Image Generation,"Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are one of the most powerful generative models, but always require a large and balanced dataset to train. Traditional GANs are not applicable to generate minority-class images in a highly imbalanced dataset. Balancing GAN (BAGAN) is proposed to mitigate this problem, but it is unstable when images in different classes look similar, e.g. flowers and cells. In this work, we propose a supervised autoencoder with an intermediate embedding model to disperse the labeled latent vectors. With the improved autoencoder initialization, we also build an architecture of BAGAN with gradient penalty (BAGAN-GP). Our proposed model overcomes the unstable issue in original BAGAN and converges faster to high quality generations. Our model achieves high performance on the imbalanced scale-down version of MNIST Fashion, CIFAR-10, and one small-scale medical image dataset."
MichiGAN: Multi-Input-Conditioned Hair Image Generation for Portrait Editing,"Despite the recent success of face image generation with GANs, conditional hair editing remains challenging due to the under-explored complexity of its geometry and appearance. In this paper, we present MichiGAN (Multi-Input-Conditioned Hair Image GAN), a novel conditional image generation method for interactive portrait hair manipulation. To provide user control over every major hair visual factor, we explicitly disentangle hair into four orthogonal attributes, including shape, structure, appearance, and background. For each of them, we design a corresponding condition module to represent, process, and convert user inputs, and modulate the image generation pipeline in ways that respect the natures of different visual attributes. All these condition modules are integrated with the backbone generator to form the final end-to-end network, which allows fully-conditioned hair generation from multiple user inputs. Upon it, we also build an interactive portrait hair editing system that enables straightforward manipulation of hair by projecting intuitive and high-level user inputs such as painted masks, guiding strokes, or reference photos to well-defined condition representations. Through extensive experiments and evaluations, we demonstrate the superiority of our method regarding both result quality and user controllability. The code is available at https://github.com/tzt101/MichiGAN."
Maximum a posteriori signal recovery for optical coherence tomography angiography image generation and denoising,"Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a novel and clinically promising imaging modality to image retinal and sub-retinal vasculature. Based on repeated optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans, intensity changes are observed over time and used to compute OCTA image data. OCTA data are prone to noise and artifacts caused by variations in flow speed and patient movement. We propose a novel iterative maximum a posteriori signal recovery algorithm in order to generate OCTA volumes with reduced noise and increased image quality. This algorithm is based on previous work on probabilistic OCTA signal models and maximum likelihood estimates. Reconstruction results using total variation minimization and wavelet shrinkage for regularization were compared against an OCTA ground truth volume, merged from six co-registered single OCTA volumes. The results show a significant improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity. The presented algorithm brings together OCTA image generation and Bayesian statistics and can be developed into new OCTA image generation and denoising algorithms."
Exploring Generative Adversarial Networks for Image-to-Image Translation in STEM Simulation,"The use of accurate scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) image simulation methods require large computation times that can make their use infeasible for the simulation of many images. Other simulation methods based on linear imaging models, such as the convolution method, are much faster but are too inaccurate to be used in application. In this paper, we explore deep learning models that attempt to translate a STEM image produced by the convolution method to a prediction of the high accuracy multislice image. We then compare our results to those of regression methods. We find that using the deep learning model Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) provides us with the best results and performs at a similar accuracy level to previous regression models on the same dataset. Codes and data for this project can be found in this GitHub repository, https://github.com/uw-cmg/GAN-STEM-Conv2MultiSlice."
A Method of Generating Measurable Panoramic Image for Indoor Mobile Measurement System,"This paper designs a technique route to generate high-quality panoramic image with depth information, which involves two critical research hotspots: fusion of LiDAR and image data and image stitching. For the fusion of 3D points and image data, since a sparse depth map can be firstly generated by projecting LiDAR point onto the RGB image plane based on our reliable calibrated and synchronized sensors, we adopt a parameter self-adaptive framework to produce 2D dense depth map. For image stitching, optimal seamline for the overlapping area is searched using a graph-cuts-based method to alleviate the geometric influence and image blending based on the pyramid multi-band is utilized to eliminate the photometric effects near the stitching line. Since each pixel is associated with a depth value, we design this depth value as a radius in the spherical projection which can further project the panoramic image to the world coordinate and consequently produces a high-quality measurable panoramic image. The purposed method is tested on the data from our data collection platform and presents a satisfactory application prospects."
The power of pictures: using ML assisted image generation to engage the crowd in complex socioscientific problems,"Human-computer image generation using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is becoming a well-established methodology for casual entertainment and open artistic exploration. Here, we take the interaction a step further by weaving in carefully structured design elements to transform the activity of ML-assisted imaged generation into a catalyst for large-scale popular dialogue on complex socioscientific problems such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and as a gateway for public participation in research."
Lightweight Generative Adversarial Networks for Text-Guided Image Manipulation,"We propose a novel lightweight generative adversarial network for efficient image manipulation using natural language descriptions. To achieve this, a new word-level discriminator is proposed, which provides the generator with fine-grained training feedback at word-level, to facilitate training a lightweight generator that has a small number of parameters, but can still correctly focus on specific visual attributes of an image, and then edit them without affecting other contents that are not described in the text. Furthermore, thanks to the explicit training signal related to each word, the discriminator can also be simplified to have a lightweight structure. Compared with the state of the art, our method has a much smaller number of parameters, but still achieves a competitive manipulation performance. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method can better disentangle different visual attributes, then correctly map them to corresponding semantic words, and thus achieve a more accurate image modification using natural language descriptions."
Using Deep Image Priors to Generate Counterfactual Explanations,"Through the use of carefully tailored convolutional neural network architectures, a deep image prior (DIP) can be used to obtain pre-images from latent representation encodings. Though DIP inversion has been known to be superior to conventional regularized inversion strategies such as total variation, such an over-parameterized generator is able to effectively reconstruct even images that are not in the original data distribution. This limitation makes it challenging to utilize such priors for tasks such as counterfactual reasoning, wherein the goal is to generate small, interpretable changes to an image that systematically leads to changes in the model prediction. To this end, we propose a novel regularization strategy based on an auxiliary loss estimator jointly trained with the predictor, which efficiently guides the prior to recover natural pre-images. Our empirical studies with a real-world ISIC skin lesion detection problem clearly evidence the effectiveness of the proposed approach in synthesizing meaningful counterfactuals. In comparison, we find that the standard DIP inversion often proposes visually imperceptible perturbations to irrelevant parts of the image, thus providing no additional insights into the model behavior."
ENSURE: A General Approach for Unsupervised Training of Deep Image Reconstruction Algorithms,"Image reconstruction using deep learning algorithms offers improved reconstruction quality and lower reconstruction time than classical compressed sensing and model-based algorithms. Unfortunately, clean and fully sampled ground-truth data to train the deep networks is often unavailable in several applications, restricting the applicability of the above methods. We introduce a novel metric termed the ENsemble Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate (ENSURE) framework, which can be used to train deep image reconstruction algorithms without fully sampled and noise-free images. The proposed framework is the generalization of the classical SURE and GSURE formulation to the setting where the images are sampled by different measurement operators, chosen randomly from a set. We evaluate the expectation of the GSURE loss functions over the sampling patterns to obtain the ENSURE loss function. We show that this loss is an unbiased estimate for the true mean-square error, which offers a better alternative to GSURE, which only offers an unbiased estimate for the projected error. Our experiments show that the networks trained with this loss function can offer reconstructions comparable to the supervised setting. While we demonstrate this framework in the context of MR image recovery, the ENSURE framework is generally applicable to arbitrary inverse problems."
A Survey on Deep Learning and Explainability for Automatic Report Generation from Medical Images,"Every year physicians face an increasing demand of image-based diagnosis from patients, a problem that can be addressed with recent artificial intelligence methods. In this context, we survey works in the area of automatic report generation from medical images, with emphasis on methods using deep neural networks, with respect to: (1) Datasets, (2) Architecture Design, (3) Explainability and (4) Evaluation Metrics. Our survey identifies interesting developments, but also remaining challenges. Among them, the current evaluation of generated reports is especially weak, since it mostly relies on traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) metrics, which do not accurately capture medical correctness."
Two-stage generative adversarial networks for document image binarization with color noise and background removal,"Document image enhancement and binarization methods are often used to improve the accuracy and efficiency of document image analysis tasks such as text recognition. Traditional non-machine-learning methods are constructed on low-level features in an unsupervised manner but have difficulty with binarization on documents with severely degraded backgrounds. Convolutional neural network-based methods focus only on grayscale images and on local textual features. In this paper, we propose a two-stage color document image enhancement and binarization method using generative adversarial neural networks. In the first stage, four color-independent adversarial networks are trained to extract color foreground information from an input image for document image enhancement. In the second stage, two independent adversarial networks with global and local features are trained for image binarization of documents of variable size. For the adversarial neural networks, we formulate loss functions between a discriminator and generators having an encoder-decoder structure. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves better performance than many classical and state-of-the-art algorithms over the Document Image Binarization Contest (DIBCO) datasets, the LRDE Document Binarization Dataset (LRDE DBD), and our shipping label image dataset. We plan to release the shipping label dataset as well as our implementation code at github.com/opensuh/DocumentBinarization/."
Improving Factual Completeness and Consistency of Image-to-Text Radiology Report Generation,"Neural image-to-text radiology report generation systems offer the potential to improve radiology reporting by reducing the repetitive process of report drafting and identifying possible medical errors. However, existing report generation systems, despite achieving high performances on natural language generation metrics such as CIDEr or BLEU, still suffer from incomplete and inconsistent generations. Here we introduce two new simple rewards to encourage the generation of factually complete and consistent radiology reports: one that encourages the system to generate radiology domain entities consistent with the reference, and one that uses natural language inference to encourage these entities to be described in inferentially consistent ways. We combine these with the novel use of an existing semantic equivalence metric (BERTScore). We further propose a report generation system that optimizes these rewards via reinforcement learning. On two open radiology report datasets, our system substantially improved the F1 score of a clinical information extraction performance by +22.1 (Delta +63.9%). We further show via a human evaluation and a qualitative analysis that our system leads to generations that are more factually complete and consistent compared to the baselines."
End-to-End Learning for Simultaneously Generating Decision Map and Multi-Focus Image Fusion Result,"The general aim of multi-focus image fusion is to gather focused regions of different images to generate a unique all-in-focus fused image. Deep learning based methods become the mainstream of image fusion by virtue of its powerful feature representation ability. However, most of the existing deep learning structures failed to balance fusion quality and end-to-end implementation convenience. End-to-end decoder design often leads to unrealistic result because of its non-linear mapping mechanism. On the other hand, generating an intermediate decision map achieves better quality for the fused image, but relies on the rectification with empirical post-processing parameter choices. In this work, to handle the requirements of both output image quality and comprehensive simplicity of structure implementation, we propose a cascade network to simultaneously generate decision map and fused result with an end-to-end training procedure. It avoids the dependence on empirical post-processing methods in the inference stage. To improve the fusion quality, we introduce a gradient aware loss function to preserve gradient information in output fused image. In addition, we design a decision calibration strategy to decrease the time consumption in the application of multiple images fusion. Extensive experiments are conducted to compare with 19 different state-of-the-art multi-focus image fusion structures with 6 assessment metrics. The results prove that our designed structure can generally ameliorate the output fused image quality, while implementation efficiency increases over 30\% for multiple images fusion."
Generalized Intersection Algorithms with Fixpoints for Image Decomposition Learning,"In image processing, classical methods minimize a suitable functional that balances between computational feasibility (convexity of the functional is ideal) and suitable penalties reflecting the desired image decomposition. The fact that algorithms derived from such minimization problems can be used to construct (deep) learning architectures has spurred the development of algorithms that can be trained for a specifically desired image decomposition, e.g. into cartoon and texture. While many such methods are very successful, theoretical guarantees are only scarcely available. To this end, in this contribution, we formalize a general class of intersection point problems encompassing a wide range of (learned) image decomposition models, and we give an existence result for a large subclass of such problems, i.e. giving the existence of a fixpoint of the corresponding algorithm. This class generalizes classical model-based variational problems, such as the TV-l2 -model or the more general TV-Hilbert model. To illustrate the potential for learned algorithms, novel (non learned) choices within our class show comparable results in denoising and texture removal."
Zoom-CAM: Generating Fine-grained Pixel Annotations from Image Labels,"Current weakly supervised object localization and segmentation rely on class-discriminative visualization techniques to generate pseudo-labels for pixel-level training. Such visualization methods, including class activation mapping (CAM) and Grad-CAM, use only the deepest, lowest resolution convolutional layer, missing all information in intermediate layers. We propose Zoom-CAM: going beyond the last lowest resolution layer by integrating the importance maps over all activations in intermediate layers. Zoom-CAM captures fine-grained small-scale objects for various discriminative class instances, which are commonly missed by the baseline visualization methods. We focus on generating pixel-level pseudo-labels from class labels. The quality of our pseudo-labels evaluated on the ImageNet localization task exhibits more than 2.8% improvement on top-1 error. For weakly supervised semantic segmentation our generated pseudo-labels improve a state of the art model by 1.1%."
A Human Eye-based Text Color Scheme Generation Method for Image Synthesis,"Synthetic data used for scene text detection and recognition tasks have proven effective. However, there are still two problems: First, the color schemes used for text coloring in the existing methods are relatively fixed color key-value pairs learned from real datasets. The dirty data in real datasets may cause the problem that the colors of text and background are too similar to be distinguished from each other. Second, the generated texts are uniformly limited to the same depth of a picture, while there are special cases in the real world that text may appear across depths. To address these problems, in this paper we design a novel method to generate color schemes, which are consistent with the characteristics of human eyes to observe things. The advantages of our method are as follows: (1) overcomes the color confusion problem between text and background caused by dirty data; (2) the texts generated are allowed to appear in most locations of any image, even across depths; (3) avoids analyzing the depth of background, such that the performance of our method exceeds the state-of-the-art methods; (4) the speed of generating images is fast, nearly one picture generated per three milliseconds. The effectiveness of our method is verified on several public datasets."
Random Network Distillation as a Diversity Metric for Both Image and Text Generation,"Generative models are increasingly able to produce remarkably high quality images and text. The community has developed numerous evaluation metrics for comparing generative models. However, these metrics do not effectively quantify data diversity. We develop a new diversity metric that can readily be applied to data, both synthetic and natural, of any type. Our method employs random network distillation, a technique introduced in reinforcement learning. We validate and deploy this metric on both images and text. We further explore diversity in few-shot image generation, a setting which was previously difficult to evaluate."
Experimental Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks for Image Generation,"Quantum machine learning is expected to be one of the first practical applications of near-term quantum devices. Pioneer theoretical works suggest that quantum generative adversarial networks (GANs) may exhibit a potential exponential advantage over classical GANs, thus attracting widespread attention. However, it remains elusive whether quantum GANs implemented on near-term quantum devices can actually solve real-world learning tasks. Here, we devise a flexible quantum GAN scheme to narrow this knowledge gap, which could accomplish image generation with arbitrarily high-dimensional features, and could also take advantage of quantum superposition to train multiple examples in parallel. For the first time, we experimentally achieve the learning and generation of real-world hand-written digit images on a superconducting quantum processor. Moreover, we utilize a gray-scale bar dataset to exhibit the competitive performance between quantum GANs and the classical GANs based on multilayer perceptron and convolutional neural network architectures, respectively, benchmarked by the Fréchet Distance score. Our work provides guidance for developing advanced quantum generative models on near-term quantum devices and opens up an avenue for exploring quantum advantages in various GAN-related learning tasks."
Omni-Directional Image Generation from Single Snapshot Image,"An omni-directional image (ODI) is the image that has a field of view covering the entire sphere around the camera. The ODIs have begun to be used in a wide range of fields such as virtual reality (VR), robotics, and social network services. Although the contents using ODI have increased, the available images and videos are still limited, compared with widespread snapshot images. A large number of ODIs are desired not only for the VR contents, but also for training deep learning models for ODI. For these purposes, a novel computer vision task to generate ODI from a single snapshot image is proposed in this paper. To tackle this problem, the conditional generative adversarial network was applied in combination with class-conditioned convolution layers. With this novel task, VR images and videos will be easily created even with a smartphone camera."
Image Generation With Neural Cellular Automatas,"In this paper, we propose a novel approach to generate images (or other artworks) by using neural cellular automatas (NCAs). Rather than training NCAs based on single images one by one, we combined the idea with variational autoencoders (VAEs), and hence explored some applications, such as image restoration and style fusion. The code for model implementation is available online."
Sickle-cell disease diagnosis support selecting the most appropriate machinelearning method: Towards a general and interpretable approach for cellmorphology analysis from microscopy images,"In this work we propose an approach to select the classification method and features, based on the state-of-the-art, with best performance for diagnostic support through peripheral blood smear images of red blood cells. In our case we used samples of patients with sickle-cell disease which can be generalized for other study cases. To trust the behavior of the proposed system, we also analyzed the interpretability.  We pre-processed and segmented microscopic images, to ensure high feature quality. We applied the methods used in the literature to extract the features from blood cells and the machine learning methods to classify their morphology. Next, we searched for their best parameters from the resulting data in the feature extraction phase. Then, we found the best parameters for every classifier using Randomized and Grid search.  For the sake of scientific progress, we published parameters for each classifier, the implemented code library, the confusion matrices with the raw data, and we used the public erythrocytesIDB dataset for validation. We also defined how to select the most important features for classification to decrease the complexity and the training time, and for interpretability purpose in opaque models. Finally, comparing the best performing classification methods with the state-of-the-art, we obtained better results even with interpretable model classifiers."
Deep-Masking Generative Network: A Unified Framework for Background Restoration from Superimposed Images,"Restoring the clean background from the superimposed images containing a noisy layer is the common crux of a classical category of tasks on image restoration such as image reflection removal, image deraining and image dehazing. These tasks are typically formulated and tackled individually due to the diverse and complicated appearance patterns of noise layers within the image. In this work we present the Deep-Masking Generative Network (DMGN), which is a unified framework for background restoration from the superimposed images and is able to cope with different types of noise. Our proposed DMGN follows a coarse-to-fine generative process: a coarse background image and a noise image are first generated in parallel, then the noise image is further leveraged to refine the background image to achieve a higher-quality background image. In particular, we design the novel Residual Deep-Masking Cell as the core operating unit for our DMGN to enhance the effective information and suppress the negative information during image generation via learning a gating mask to control the information flow. By iteratively employing this Residual Deep-Masking Cell, our proposed DMGN is able to generate both high-quality background image and noisy image progressively. Furthermore, we propose a two-pronged strategy to effectively leverage the generated noise image as contrasting cues to facilitate the refinement of the background image. Extensive experiments across three typical tasks for image background restoration, including image reflection removal, image rain steak removal and image dehazing, show that our DMGN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods specifically designed for each single task."
Large Scale Indexing of Generic Medical Image Data using Unbiased Shallow Keypoints and Deep CNN Features,"We propose a unified appearance model accounting for traditional shallow (i.e. 3D SIFT keypoints) and deep (i.e. CNN output layers) image feature representations, encoding respectively specific, localized neuroanatomical patterns and rich global information into a single indexing and classification framework. A novel Bayesian model combines shallow and deep features based on an assumption of conditional independence and validated by experiments indexing specific family members and general group categories in 3D MRI neuroimage data of 1010 subjects from the Human Connectome Project, including twins and non-twin siblings. A novel domain adaptation strategy is presented, transforming deep CNN vectors elements into binary class-informative descriptors. A GPU-based implementation of all processing is provided. State-of-the-art performance is achieved in large-scale neuroimage indexing, both in terms of computational complexity, accuracy in identifying family members and sex classification."
DML-GANR: Deep Metric Learning With Generative Adversarial Network Regularization for High Spatial Resolution Remote Sensing Image Retrieval,"With a small number of labeled samples for training, it can save considerable manpower and material resources, especially when the amount of high spatial resolution remote sensing images (HSR-RSIs) increases considerably. However, many deep models face the problem of overfitting when using a small number of labeled samples. This might degrade HSRRSI retrieval accuracy. Aiming at obtaining more accurate HSR-RSI retrieval performance with small training samples, we develop a deep metric learning approach with generative adversarial network regularization (DML-GANR) for HSR-RSI retrieval. The DML-GANR starts from a high-level feature extraction (HFE) to extract high-level features, which includes convolutional layers and fully connected (FC) layers. Each of the FC layers is constructed by deep metric learning (DML) to maximize the interclass variations and minimize the intraclass variations. The generative adversarial network (GAN) is adopted to mitigate the overfitting problem and validate the qualities of extracted high-level features. DML-GANR is optimized through a customized approach, and the optimal parameters are obtained. The experimental results on the three data sets demonstrate the superior performance of DML-GANR over state-of-the-art techniques in HSR-RSI retrieval."
Contrastive Cross-Modal Pre-Training: A General Strategy for Small Sample Medical Imaging,"A key challenge in training neural networks for a given medical imaging task is often the difficulty of obtaining a sufficient number of manually labeled examples. In contrast, textual imaging reports, which are often readily available in medical records, contain rich but unstructured interpretations written by experts as part of standard clinical practice. We propose using these textual reports as a form of weak supervision to improve the image interpretation performance of a neural network without requiring additional manually labeled examples. We use an image-text matching task to train a feature extractor and then fine-tune it in a transfer learning setting for a supervised task using a small labeled dataset. The end result is a neural network that automatically interprets imagery without requiring textual reports during inference. This approach can be applied to any task for which text-image pairs are readily available. We evaluate our method on three classification tasks and find consistent performance improvements, reducing the need for labeled data by 67%-98%."
Image Translation for Medical Image Generation -- Ischemic Stroke Lesions,"Deep learning based disease detection and segmentation algorithms promise to improve many clinical processes. However, such algorithms require vast amounts of annotated training data, which are typically not available in the medical context due to data privacy, legal obstructions, and non-uniform data acquisition protocols. Synthetic databases with annotated pathologies could provide the required amounts of training data. We demonstrate with the example of ischemic stroke that an improvement in lesion segmentation is feasible using deep learning based augmentation. To this end, we train different image-to-image translation models to synthesize magnetic resonance images of brain volumes with and without stroke lesions from semantic segmentation maps. In addition, we train a generative adversarial network to generate synthetic lesion masks. Subsequently, we combine these two components to build a large database of synthetic stroke images. The performance of the various models is evaluated using a U-Net which is trained to segment stroke lesions on a clinical test set. We report a Dice score of \mathbf{72.8}% [\mathbf{70.8\pm1.0}%] for the model with the best performance, which outperforms the model trained on the clinical images alone \mathbf{67.3}% [\mathbf{63.2\pm1.9}%], and is close to the human inter-reader Dice score of \mathbf{76.9}%. Moreover, we show that for a small database of only 10 or 50 clinical cases, synthetic data augmentation yields significant improvement compared to a setting where no synthetic data is used. To the best of our knowledge, this presents the first comparative analysis of synthetic data augmentation based on image-to-image translation, and first application to ischemic stroke."
Generalized Two-Dimensional Quaternion Principal Component Analysis with Weighting for Color Image Recognition,"A generalized two-dimensional quaternion principal component analysis (G2DQPCA) approach with weighting is presented for color image analysis. As a general framework of 2DQPCA, G2DQPCA is flexible to adapt different constraints or requirements by imposing L_{p} norms both on the constraint function and the objective function. The gradient operator of quaternion vector functions is redefined by the structure-preserving gradient operator of real vector function. Under the framework of minorization-maximization (MM), an iterative algorithm is developed to obtain the optimal closed-form solution of G2DQPCA. The projection vectors generated by the deflating scheme are required to be orthogonal to each other. A weighting matrix is defined to magnify the effect of main features. The weighted projection bases remain the accuracy of face recognition unchanged or moving in a tight range as the number of features increases. The numerical results based on the real face databases validate that the newly proposed method performs better than the state-of-the-art algorithms."
Tubular Shape Aware Data Generation for Semantic Segmentation in Medical Imaging,"Chest X-ray is one of the most widespread examinations of the human body. In interventional radiology, its use is frequently associated with the need to visualize various tube-like objects, such as puncture needles, guiding sheaths, wires, and catheters. Detection and precise localization of these tube-like objects in the X-ray images is, therefore, of utmost value, catalyzing the development of accurate target-specific segmentation algorithms. Similar to the other medical imaging tasks, the manual pixel-wise annotation of the tubes is a resource-consuming process. In this work, we aim to alleviate the lack of the annotated images by using artificial data. Specifically, we present an approach for synthetic data generation of the tube-shaped objects, with a generative adversarial network being regularized with a prior-shape constraint. Our method eliminates the need for paired image--mask data and requires only a weakly-labeled dataset (10--20 images) to reach the accuracy of the fully-supervised models. We report the applicability of the approach for the task of segmenting tubes and catheters in the X-ray images, whereas the results should also hold for the other imaging modalities."
TinyGAN: Distilling BigGAN for Conditional Image Generation,"Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have become a powerful approach for generative image modeling. However, GANs are notorious for their training instability, especially on large-scale, complex datasets. While the recent work of BigGAN has significantly improved the quality of image generation on ImageNet, it requires a huge model, making it hard to deploy on resource-constrained devices. To reduce the model size, we propose a black-box knowledge distillation framework for compressing GANs, which highlights a stable and efficient training process. Given BigGAN as the teacher network, we manage to train a much smaller student network to mimic its functionality, achieving competitive performance on Inception and FID scores with the generator having 16\times fewer parameters."
Learning to Generate Image Source-Agnostic Universal Adversarial Perturbations,"Adversarial perturbations are critical for certifying the robustness of deep learning models. A universal adversarial perturbation (UAP) can simultaneously attack multiple images, and thus offers a more unified threat model, obviating an image-wise attack algorithm. However, the existing UAP generator is underdeveloped when images are drawn from different image sources (e.g., with different image resolutions). Towards an authentic universality across image sources, we take a novel view of UAP generation as a customized instance of few-shot learning, which leverages bilevel optimization and learning-to-optimize (L2O) techniques for UAP generation with improved attack success rate (ASR). We begin by considering the popular model agnostic meta-learning (MAML) framework to meta-learn a UAP generator. However, we see that the MAML framework does not directly offer the universal attack across image sources, requiring us to integrate it with another meta-learning framework of L2O. The resulting scheme for meta-learning a UAP generator (i) has better performance (50% higher ASR) than baselines such as Projected Gradient Descent, (ii) has better performance (37% faster) than the vanilla L2O and MAML frameworks (when applicable), and (iii) is able to simultaneously handle UAP generation for different victim models and image data sources."
Domain Generalization for Medical Imaging Classification with Linear-Dependency Regularization,"Recently, we have witnessed great progress in the field of medical imaging classification by adopting deep neural networks. However, the recent advanced models still require accessing sufficiently large and representative datasets for training, which is often unfeasible in clinically realistic environments. When trained on limited datasets, the deep neural network is lack of generalization capability, as the trained deep neural network on data within a certain distribution (e.g. the data captured by a certain device vendor or patient population) may not be able to generalize to the data with another distribution.  In this paper, we introduce a simple but effective approach to improve the generalization capability of deep neural networks in the field of medical imaging classification. Motivated by the observation that the domain variability of the medical images is to some extent compact, we propose to learn a representative feature space through variational encoding with a novel linear-dependency regularization term to capture the shareable information among medical data collected from different domains. As a result, the trained neural network is expected to equip with better generalization capability to the ""unseen"" medical data. Experimental results on two challenging medical imaging classification tasks indicate that our method can achieve better cross-domain generalization capability compared with state-of-the-art baselines."
COVID-19 Infection Map Generation and Detection from Chest X-Ray Images,"Computer-aided diagnosis has become a necessity for accurate and immediate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) detection to aid treatment and prevent the spread of the virus. Numerous studies have proposed to use Deep Learning techniques for COVID-19 diagnosis. However, they have used very limited chest X-ray (CXR) image repositories for evaluation with a small number, a few hundreds, of COVID-19 samples. Moreover, these methods can neither localize nor grade the severity of COVID-19 infection. For this purpose, recent studies proposed to explore the activation maps of deep networks. However, they remain inaccurate for localizing the actual infestation making them unreliable for clinical use. This study proposes a novel method for the joint localization, severity grading, and detection of COVID-19 from CXR images by generating the so-called infection maps. To accomplish this, we have compiled the largest dataset with 119,316 CXR images including 2951 COVID-19 samples, where the annotation of the ground-truth segmentation masks is performed on CXRs by a novel collaborative human-machine approach. Furthermore, we publicly release the first CXR dataset with the ground-truth segmentation masks of the COVID-19 infected regions. A detailed set of experiments show that state-of-the-art segmentation networks can learn to localize COVID-19 infection with an F1-score of 83.20%, which is significantly superior to the activation maps created by the previous methods. Finally, the proposed approach achieved a COVID-19 detection performance with 94.96% sensitivity and 99.88% specificity."
Scene Graph to Image Generation with Contextualized Object Layout Refinement,"Generating images from scene graphs is a challenging task that attracted substantial interest recently. Prior works have approached this task by generating an intermediate layout description of the target image. However, the representation of each object in the layout was generated independently, which resulted in high overlap, low coverage, and an overall blurry layout. We propose a novel method that alleviates these issues by generating the entire layout description gradually to improve inter-object dependency. We empirically show on the COCO-STUFF dataset that our approach improves the quality of both the intermediate layout and the final image. Our approach improves the layout coverage by almost 20 points and drops object overlap to negligible amounts."
Generating Adversarial yet Inconspicuous Patches with a Single Image,"Deep neural networks have been shown vulnerable toadversarial patches, where exotic patterns can resultin models wrong prediction. Nevertheless, existing ap-proaches to adversarial patch generation hardly con-sider the contextual consistency between patches andthe image background, causing such patches to be eas-ily detected and adversarial attacks to fail. On the otherhand, these methods require a large amount of data fortraining, which is computationally expensive. To over-come these challenges, we propose an approach to gen-erate adversarial yet inconspicuous patches with onesingle image. In our approach, adversarial patches areproduced in a coarse-to-fine way with multiple scalesof generators and discriminators. Contextual informa-tion is encoded during the Min-Max training to makepatches consistent with surroundings. The selection ofpatch location is based on the perceptual sensitivity ofvictim models. Through extensive experiments, our ap-proach shows strong attacking ability in both the white-box and black-box setting. Experiments on saliency de-tection and user evaluation indicate that our adversar-ial patches can evade human observations, demonstratethe inconspicuousness of our approach. Lastly, we showthat our approach preserves the attack ability in thephysical world."
MFIF-GAN: A New Generative Adversarial Network for Multi-Focus Image Fusion,"Multi-Focus Image Fusion (MFIF) is a promising image enhancement technique to obtain all-in-focus images meeting visual needs and it is a precondition of other computer vision tasks. One of the research trends of MFIF is to avoid the defocus spread effect (DSE) around the focus/defocus boundary (FDB). In this paper,we propose a network termed MFIF-GAN to attenuate the DSE by generating focus maps in which the foreground region are correctly larger than the corresponding objects. The Squeeze and Excitation Residual module is employed in the network. By combining the prior knowledge of training condition, this network is trained on a synthetic dataset based on an α-matte model. In addition, the reconstruction and gradient regularization terms are combined in the loss functions to enhance the boundary details and improve the quality of fused images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the MFIF-GAN outperforms several state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in visual perception, quantitative analysis as well as efficiency. Moreover, the edge diffusion and contraction module is firstly proposed to verify that focus maps generated by our method are accurate at the pixel level."
Knowledge-Guided Multi-Label Few-Shot Learning for General Image Recognition,"Recognizing multiple labels of an image is a practical yet challenging task, and remarkable progress has been achieved by searching for semantic regions and exploiting label dependencies. However, current works utilize RNN/LSTM to implicitly capture sequential region/label dependencies, which cannot fully explore mutual interactions among the semantic regions/labels and do not explicitly integrate label co-occurrences. In addition, these works require large amounts of training samples for each category, and they are unable to generalize to novel categories with limited samples. To address these issues, we propose a knowledge-guided graph routing (KGGR) framework, which unifies prior knowledge of statistical label correlations with deep neural networks. The framework exploits prior knowledge to guide adaptive information propagation among different categories to facilitate multi-label analysis and reduce the dependency of training samples. Specifically, it first builds a structured knowledge graph to correlate different labels based on statistical label co-occurrence. Then, it introduces the label semantics to guide learning semantic-specific features to initialize the graph, and it exploits a graph propagation network to explore graph node interactions, enabling learning contextualized image feature representations. Moreover, we initialize each graph node with the classifier weights for the corresponding label and apply another propagation network to transfer node messages through the graph. In this way, it can facilitate exploiting the information of correlated labels to help train better classifiers. We conduct extensive experiments on the traditional multi-label image recognition (MLR) and multi-label few-shot learning (ML-FSL) tasks and show that our KGGR framework outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods by sizable margins on the public benchmarks."
Deriving Visual Semantics from Spatial Context: An Adaptation of LSA and Word2Vec to generate Object and Scene Embeddings from Images,"Embeddings are an important tool for the representation of word meaning. Their effectiveness rests on the distributional hypothesis: words that occur in the same context carry similar semantic information. Here, we adapt this approach to index visual semantics in images of scenes. To this end, we formulate a distributional hypothesis for objects and scenes: Scenes that contain the same objects (object context) are semantically related. Similarly, objects that appear in the same spatial context (within a scene or subregions of a scene) are semantically related. We develop two approaches for learning object and scene embeddings from annotated images. In the first approach, we adapt LSA and Word2vec's Skipgram and CBOW models to generate two sets of embeddings from object co-occurrences in whole images, one for objects and one for scenes. The representational space spanned by these embeddings suggests that the distributional hypothesis holds for images. In an initial application of this approach, we show that our image-based embeddings improve scene classification models such as ResNet18 and VGG-11 (3.72\% improvement on Top5 accuracy, 4.56\% improvement on Top1 accuracy). In the second approach, rather than analyzing whole images of scenes, we focus on co-occurrences of objects within subregions of an image. We illustrate that this method yields a sensible hierarchical decomposition of a scene into collections of semantically related objects. Overall, these results suggest that object and scene embeddings from object co-occurrences and spatial context yield semantically meaningful representations as well as computational improvements for downstream applications such as scene classification."
DeltaGAN: Towards Diverse Few-shot Image Generation with Sample-Specific Delta,"Learning to generate new images for a novel category based on only a few images, named as few-shot image generation, has attracted increasing research interest. Several state-of-the-art works have yielded impressive results, but the diversity is still limited. In this work, we propose a novel Delta Generative Adversarial Network (DeltaGAN), which consists of a reconstruction subnetwork and a generation subnetwork. The reconstruction subnetwork captures intra-category transformation, i.e., ""delta"", between same-category pairs. The generation subnetwork generates sample-specific ""delta"" for an input image, which is combined with this input image to generate a new image within the same category. Besides, an adversarial delta matching loss is designed to link the above two subnetworks together. Extensive experiments on five few-shot image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method."
Conditional Image Generation with One-Vs-All Classifier,"This paper explores conditional image generation with a One-Vs-All classifier based on the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Instead of the real/fake discriminator used in vanilla GANs, we propose to extend the discriminator to a One-Vs-All classifier (GAN-OVA) that can distinguish each input data to its category label. Specifically, we feed certain additional information as conditions to the generator and take the discriminator as a One-Vs-All classifier to identify each conditional category. Our model can be applied to different divergence or distances used to define the objective function, such as Jensen-Shannon divergence and Earth-Mover (or called Wasserstein-1) distance. We evaluate GAN-OVAs on MNIST and CelebA-HQ datasets, and the experimental results show that GAN-OVAs make progress toward stable training over regular conditional GANs. Furthermore, GAN-OVAs effectively accelerate the generation process of different classes and improves generation quality."
"Objective, Probabilistic, and Generalized Noise Level Dependent Classifications of sets of more or less 2D Periodic Images into Plane Symmetry Groups","Crystallographic symmetry classifications from real-world images with periodicities in two dimensions (2D) are of interest to crystallographers and practitioners of computer vision studies alike. Currently, these classifications are typically made by both communities in a subjective manner that relies on arbitrary thresholds for judgments, and are reported under the pretense of being definitive, which is impossible. Moreover, the computer vision community tends to use direct space methods to make such classifications instead of more powerful and computationally efficient Fourier space methods. This is because the proper functioning of those methods requires more periodic repeats of a unit cell motif than are commonly present in images analyzed by the computer vision community. We demonstrate a novel approach to plane symmetry group classifications that is enabled by Kenichi Kanatani's Geometric Akaike Information Criterion and associated Geometric Akaike weights. Our approach leverages the advantages of working in Fourier space, is well suited for handling the hierarchic nature of crystallographic symmetries, and yields probabilistic results that are generalized noise level dependent. The latter feature means crystallographic symmetry classifications can be updated when less noisy image data and more accurate processing algorithms become available. We demonstrate the ability of our approach to objectively estimate the plane symmetry and pseudosymmetries of sets of synthetic 2D-periodic images with varying amounts of red-green-blue and spread noise. Additionally, we suggest a simple solution to the problem of too few periodic repeats in an input image for practical application of Fourier space methods. In doing so, we effectively solve the decades-old and heretofore intractable problem from computer vision of symmetry detection and classification from images in the presence of noise."
TreeGAN: Incorporating Class Hierarchy into Image Generation,"Conditional image generation (CIG) is a widely studied problem in computer vision and machine learning. Given a class, CIG takes the name of this class as input and generates a set of images that belong to this class. In existing CIG works, for different classes, their corresponding images are generated independently, without considering the relationship among classes. In real-world applications, the classes are organized into a hierarchy and their hierarchical relationships are informative for generating high-fidelity images. In this paper, we aim to leverage the class hierarchy for conditional image generation. We propose two ways of incorporating class hierarchy: prior control and post constraint. In prior control, we first encode the class hierarchy, then feed it as a prior into the conditional generator to generate images. In post constraint, after the images are generated, we measure their consistency with the class hierarchy and use the consistency score to guide the training of the generator. Based on these two ideas, we propose a TreeGAN model which consists of three modules: (1) a class hierarchy encoder (CHE) which takes the hierarchical structure of classes and their textual names as inputs and learns an embedding for each class; the embedding captures the hierarchical relationship among classes; (2) a conditional image generator (CIG) which takes the CHE-generated embedding of a class as input and generates a set of images belonging to this class; (3) a consistency checker which performs hierarchical classification on the generated images and checks whether the generated images are compatible with the class hierarchy; the consistency score is used to guide the CIG to generate hierarchy-compatible images. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."
CSI2Image: Image Reconstruction from Channel State Information Using Generative Adversarial Networks,"This study aims to find the upper limit of the wireless sensing capability of acquiring physical space information. This is a challenging objective, because at present, wireless sensing studies continue to succeed in acquiring novel phenomena. Thus, although a complete answer cannot be obtained yet, a step is taken towards it here. To achieve this, CSI2Image, a novel channel-state-information (CSI)-to-image conversion method based on generative adversarial networks (GANs), is proposed. The type of physical information acquired using wireless sensing can be estimated by checking wheth\-er the reconstructed image captures the desired physical space information. Three types of learning methods are demonstrated: gen\-er\-a\-tor-only learning, GAN-only learning, and hybrid learning. Evaluating the performance of CSI2Image is difficult, because both the clarity of the image and the presence of the desired physical space information must be evaluated. To solve this problem, a quantitative evaluation methodology using an object detection library is also proposed. CSI2Image was implemented using IEEE 802.11ac compressed CSI, and the evaluation results show that the image was successfully reconstructed. The results demonstrate that gen\-er\-a\-tor-only learning is sufficient for simple wireless sensing problems, but in complex wireless sensing problems, GANs are important for reconstructing generalized images with more accurate physical space information."
Super Resolution of Arterial Spin Labeling MR Imaging Using Unsupervised Multi-Scale Generative Adversarial Network,"Arterial spin labeling (ASL) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful imaging technology that can measure cerebral blood flow (CBF) quantitatively. However, since only a small portion of blood is labeled compared to the whole tissue volume, conventional ASL suffers from low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), poor spatial resolution, and long acquisition time. In this paper, we proposed a super-resolution method based on a multi-scale generative adversarial network (GAN) through unsupervised training. The network only needs the low-resolution (LR) ASL image itself for training and the T1-weighted image as the anatomical prior. No training pairs or pre-training are needed. A low-pass filter guided item was added as an additional loss to suppress the noise interference from the LR ASL image. After the network was trained, the super-resolution (SR) image was generated by supplying the upsampled LR ASL image and corresponding T1-weighted image to the generator of the last layer. Performance of the proposed method was evaluated by comparing the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index (SSIM) using normal-resolution (NR) ASL image (5.5 min acquisition) and high-resolution (HR) ASL image (44 min acquisition) as the ground truth. Compared to the nearest, linear, and spline interpolation methods, the proposed method recovers more detailed structure information, reduces the image noise visually, and achieves the highest PSNR and SSIM when using HR ASL image as the ground-truth."
Segmentation of Lungs in Chest X-Ray Image Using Generative Adversarial Networks,"Chest X-ray (CXR) is a low-cost medical imaging technique. It is a common procedure for the identification of many respiratory diseases compared to MRI, CT, and PET scans. This paper presents the use of generative adversarial networks (GAN) to perform the task of lung segmentation on a given CXR. GANs are popular to generate realistic data by learning the mapping from one domain to another. In our work, the generator of the GAN is trained to generate a segmented mask of a given input CXR. The discriminator distinguishes between a ground truth and the generated mask, and updates the generator through the adversarial loss measure. The objective is to generate masks for the input CXR, which are as realistic as possible compared to the ground truth masks. The model is trained and evaluated using four different discriminators referred to as D1, D2, D3, and D4, respectively. Experimental results on three different CXR datasets reveal that the proposed model is able to achieve a dice-score of 0.9740, and IOU score of 0.943, which are better than other reported state-of-the art results."
Adversarial score matching and improved sampling for image generation,"Denoising Score Matching with Annealed Langevin Sampling (DSM-ALS) has recently found success in generative modeling. The approach works by first training a neural network to estimate the score of a distribution, and then using Langevin dynamics to sample from the data distribution assumed by the score network. Despite the convincing visual quality of samples, this method appears to perform worse than Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) under the Fréchet Inception Distance, a standard metric for generative models.  We show that this apparent gap vanishes when denoising the final Langevin samples using the score network. In addition, we propose two improvements to DSM-ALS: 1) Consistent Annealed Sampling as a more stable alternative to Annealed Langevin Sampling, and 2) a hybrid training formulation, composed of both Denoising Score Matching and adversarial objectives. By combining these two techniques and exploring different network architectures, we elevate score matching methods and obtain results competitive with state-of-the-art image generation on CIFAR-10."
Generating Image Adversarial Examples by Embedding Digital Watermarks,"With the increasing attention to deep neural network (DNN) models, attacks are also upcoming for such models. For example, an attacker may carefully construct images in specific ways (also referred to as adversarial examples) aiming to mislead the DNN models to output incorrect classification results. Similarly, many efforts are proposed to detect and mitigate adversarial examples, usually for certain dedicated attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel digital watermark-based method to generate image adversarial examples to fool DNN models. Specifically, partial main features of the watermark image are embedded into the host image almost invisibly, aiming to tamper with and damage the recognition capabilities of the DNN models. We devise an efficient mechanism to select host images and watermark images and utilize the improved discrete wavelet transform (DWT) based Patchwork watermarking algorithm with a set of valid hyperparameters to embed digital watermarks from the watermark image dataset into original images for generating image adversarial examples. The experimental results illustrate that the attack success rate on common DNN models can reach an average of 95.47% on the CIFAR-10 dataset and the highest at 98.71%. Besides, our scheme is able to generate a large number of adversarial examples efficiently, concretely, an average of 1.17 seconds for completing the attacks on each image on the CIFAR-10 dataset. In addition, we design a baseline experiment using the watermark images generated by Gaussian noise as the watermark image dataset that also displays the effectiveness of our scheme. Similarly, we also propose the modified discrete cosine transform (DCT) based Patchwork watermarking algorithm. To ensure repeatability and reproducibility, the source code is available on GitHub."
not-so-BigGAN: Generating High-Fidelity Images on Small Compute with Wavelet-based Super-Resolution,"State-of-the-art models for high-resolution image generation, such as BigGAN and VQVAE-2, require an incredible amount of compute resources and/or time (512 TPU-v3 cores) to train, putting them out of reach for the larger research community. On the other hand, GAN-based image super-resolution models, such as ESRGAN, can not only upscale images to high dimensions, but also are efficient to train. In this paper, we present not-so-big-GAN (nsb-GAN), a simple yet cost-effective two-step training framework for deep generative models (DGMs) of high-dimensional natural images. First, we generate images in low-frequency bands by training a sampler in the wavelet domain. Then, we super-resolve these images from the wavelet domain back to the pixel-space with our novel wavelet super-resolution decoder network. Wavelet-based down-sampling method preserves more structural information than pixel-based methods, leading to significantly better generative quality of the low-resolution sampler (e.g., 64x64). Since the sampler and decoder can be trained in parallel and operate on much lower dimensional spaces than end-to-end models, the training cost is substantially reduced. On ImageNet 512x512, our model achieves a Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) of 10.59 -- beating the baseline BigGAN model -- at half the compute (256 TPU-v3 cores)."
Anonymization of labeled TOF-MRA images for brain vessel segmentation using generative adversarial networks,"Anonymization and data sharing are crucial for privacy protection and acquisition of large datasets for medical image analysis. This is a big challenge, especially for neuroimaging. Here, the brain's unique structure allows for re-identification and thus requires non-conventional anonymization. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have the potential to provide anonymous images while preserving predictive properties. Analyzing brain vessel segmentation, we trained 3 GANs on time-of-flight (TOF) magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) patches for image-label generation: 1) Deep convolutional GAN, 2) Wasserstein-GAN with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP) and 3) WGAN-GP with spectral normalization (WGAN-GP-SN). The generated image-labels from each GAN were used to train a U-net for segmentation and tested on real data. Moreover, we applied our synthetic patches using transfer learning on a second dataset. For an increasing number of up to 15 patients we evaluated the model performance on real data with and without pre-training. The performance for all models was assessed by the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and the 95th percentile of the Hausdorff Distance (95HD). Comparing the 3 GANs, the U-net trained on synthetic data generated by the WGAN-GP-SN showed the highest performance to predict vessels (DSC/95HD 0.82/28.97) benchmarked by the U-net trained on real data (0.89/26.61). The transfer learning approach showed superior performance for the same GAN compared to no pre-training, especially for one patient only (0.91/25.68 vs. 0.85/27.36). In this work, synthetic image-label pairs retained generalizable information and showed good performance for vessel segmentation. Besides, we showed that synthetic patches can be used in a transfer learning approach with independent data. This paves the way to overcome the challenges of scarce data and anonymization in medical imaging."
Deep Cyclic Generative Adversarial Residual Convolutional Networks for Real Image Super-Resolution,"Recent deep learning based single image super-resolution (SISR) methods mostly train their models in a clean data domain where the low-resolution (LR) and the high-resolution (HR) images come from noise-free settings (same domain) due to the bicubic down-sampling assumption. However, such degradation process is not available in real-world settings. We consider a deep cyclic network structure to maintain the domain consistency between the LR and HR data distributions, which is inspired by the recent success of CycleGAN in the image-to-image translation applications. We propose the Super-Resolution Residual Cyclic Generative Adversarial Network (SRResCycGAN) by training with a generative adversarial network (GAN) framework for the LR to HR domain translation in an end-to-end manner. We demonstrate our proposed approach in the quantitative and qualitative experiments that generalize well to the real image super-resolution and it is easy to deploy for the mobile/embedded devices. In addition, our SR results on the AIM 2020 Real Image SR Challenge datasets demonstrate that the proposed SR approach achieves comparable results as the other state-of-art methods."
Unsupervised Change Detection in Satellite Images with Generative Adversarial Network,"Detecting changed regions in paired satellite images plays a key role in many remote sensing applications. The evolution of recent techniques could provide satellite images with very high spatial resolution (VHR) but made it challenging to apply image coregistration, and many change detection methods are dependent on its accuracy.Two images of the same scene taken at different time or from different angle would introduce unregistered objects and the existence of both unregistered areas and actual changed areas would lower the performance of many change detection algorithms in unsupervised condition.To alleviate the effect of unregistered objects in the paired images, we propose a novel change detection framework utilizing a special neural network architecture -- Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate many better coregistered images. In this paper, we show that GAN model can be trained upon a pair of images through using the proposed expanding strategy to create a training set and optimizing designed objective functions. The optimized GAN model would produce better coregistered images where changes can be easily spotted and then the change map can be presented through a comparison strategy using these generated images explicitly.Compared to other deep learning-based methods, our method is less sensitive to the problem of unregistered images and makes most of the deep learning structure.Experimental results on synthetic images and real data with many different scenes could demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."
TiVGAN: Text to Image to Video Generation with Step-by-Step Evolutionary Generator,"Advances in technology have led to the development of methods that can create desired visual multimedia. In particular, image generation using deep learning has been extensively studied across diverse fields. In comparison, video generation, especially on conditional inputs, remains a challenging and less explored area. To narrow this gap, we aim to train our model to produce a video corresponding to a given text description. We propose a novel training framework, Text-to-Image-to-Video Generative Adversarial Network (TiVGAN), which evolves frame-by-frame and finally produces a full-length video. In the first phase, we focus on creating a high-quality single video frame while learning the relationship between the text and an image. As the steps proceed, our model is trained gradually on more number of consecutive frames.This step-by-step learning process helps stabilize the training and enables the creation of high-resolution video based on conditional text descriptions. Qualitative and quantitative experimental results on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."
Heightmap Reconstruction of Macula on Color Fundus Images Using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks,"For screening, 3D shape of the eye retina often provides structural information and can assist ophthalmologists to diagnose diseases. However, fundus images which are one the most common screening modalities for retina diagnosis lack this information due to their 2D nature. Hence, in this work, we try to infer about this 3D information or more specifically its heights. Recent approaches have used shading information for reconstructing the heights but their output is not accurate since the utilized information is not sufficient. Additionally, other methods were dependent on the availability of more than one image of the eye which is not available in practice. In this paper, motivated by the success of Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks(cGANs) and deeply supervised networks, we propose a novel architecture for the generator which enhances the details in a sequence of steps. Comparisons on our dataset illustrate that the proposed method outperforms all of the state-of-the-art methods in image translation and medical image translation on this particular task. Additionally, clinical studies also indicate that the proposed method can provide additional information for ophthalmologists for diagnosis."
Evaluation of Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks for data augmentation of chest X-ray images,"Medical image datasets are usually imbalanced, due to the high costs of obtaining the data and time-consuming annotations. Training deep neural network models on such datasets to accurately classify the medical condition does not yield desired results and often over-fits the data on majority class samples. In order to address this issue, data augmentation is often performed on training data by position augmentation techniques such as scaling, cropping, flipping, padding, rotation, translation, affine transformation, and color augmentation techniques such as brightness, contrast, saturation, and hue to increase the dataset sizes. These augmentation techniques are not guaranteed to be advantageous in domains with limited data, especially medical image data, and could lead to further overfitting. In this work, we performed data augmentation on the Chest X-rays dataset through generative modeling (deep convolutional generative adversarial network) which creates artificial instances retaining similar characteristics to the original data and evaluation of the model resulted in Fréchet Distance of Inception (FID) score of 1.289."
"Exploiting Latent Codes: Interactive Fashion Product Generation, Similar Image Retrieval, and Cross-Category Recommendation using Variational Autoencoders","The rise of deep learning applications in the fashion industry has fueled advances in curating large-scale datasets to build applications for product design, image retrieval, and recommender systems. In this paper, the author proposes using Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to build an interactive fashion product application framework that allows the users to generate products with attributes according to their liking, retrieve similar styles for the same product category, and receive content-based recommendations from other categories. Fashion product images dataset containing eyewear, footwear, and bags are appropriate to illustrate that this pipeline is applicable in the booming industry of e-commerce enabling direct user interaction in specifying desired products paired with new methods for data matching, and recommendation systems by using VAE and exploiting its generated latent codes."
Deep Generative Model for Image Inpainting with Local Binary Pattern Learning and Spatial Attention,"Deep learning (DL) has demonstrated its powerful capabilities in the field of image inpainting. The DL-based image inpainting approaches can produce visually plausible results, but often generate various unpleasant artifacts, especially in the boundary and highly textured regions. To tackle this challenge, in this work, we propose a new end-to-end, two-stage (coarse-to-fine) generative model through combining a local binary pattern (LBP) learning network with an actual inpainting network. Specifically, the first LBP learning network using U-Net architecture is designed to accurately predict the structural information of the missing region, which subsequently guides the second image inpainting network for better filling the missing pixels. Furthermore, an improved spatial attention mechanism is integrated in the image inpainting network, by considering the consistency not only between the known region with the generated one, but also within the generated region itself. Extensive experiments on public datasets including CelebA-HQ, Places and Paris StreetView demonstrate that our model generates better inpainting results than the state-of-the-art competing algorithms, both quantitatively and qualitatively. The source code and trained models will be made available at https://github.com/HighwayWu/ImageInpainting."
Privacy Leakage of SIFT Features via Deep Generative Model based Image Reconstruction,"Many practical applications, e.g., content based image retrieval and object recognition, heavily rely on the local features extracted from the query image. As these local features are usually exposed to untrustworthy parties, the privacy leakage problem of image local features has received increasing attention in recent years. In this work, we thoroughly evaluate the privacy leakage of Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), which is one of the most widely-used image local features. We first consider the case that the adversary can fully access the SIFT features, i.e., both the SIFT descriptors and the coordinates are available. We propose a novel end-to-end, coarse-to-fine deep generative model for reconstructing the latent image from its SIFT features. The designed deep generative model consists of two networks, where the first one attempts to learn the structural information of the latent image by transforming from SIFT features to Local Binary Pattern (LBP) features, while the second one aims to reconstruct the pixel values guided by the learned LBP. Compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed deep generative model produces much improved reconstructed results over three public datasets. Furthermore, we address more challenging cases that only partial SIFT features (either SIFT descriptors or coordinates) are accessible to the adversary. It is shown that, if the adversary can only have access to the SIFT descriptors while not their coordinates, then the modest success of reconstructing the latent image can be achieved for highly-structured images (e.g., faces) and would fail in general settings. In addition, the latent image can be reconstructed with reasonably good quality solely from the SIFT coordinates. Our results would suggest that the privacy leakage problem can be largely avoided if the SIFT coordinates can be well protected."
Structure-Aware Generation Network for Recipe Generation from Images,"Sharing food has become very popular with the development of social media. For many real-world applications, people are keen to know the underlying recipes of a food item. In this paper, we are interested in automatically generating cooking instructions for food. We investigate an open research task of generating cooking instructions based on only food images and ingredients, which is similar to the image captioning task. However, compared with image captioning datasets, the target recipes are long-length paragraphs and do not have annotations on structure information. To address the above limitations, we propose a novel framework of Structure-aware Generation Network (SGN) to tackle the food recipe generation task. Our approach brings together several novel ideas in a systematic framework: (1) exploiting an unsupervised learning approach to obtain the sentence-level tree structure labels before training; (2) generating trees of target recipes from images with the supervision of tree structure labels learned from (1); and (3) integrating the inferred tree structures with the recipe generation procedure. Our proposed model can produce high-quality and coherent recipes, and achieve the state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark Recipe1M dataset."
Deep Spatial Transformation for Pose-Guided Person Image Generation and Animation,"Pose-guided person image generation and animation aim to transform a source person image to target poses. These tasks require spatial manipulation of source data. However, Convolutional Neural Networks are limited by the lack of ability to spatially transform the inputs. In this paper, we propose a differentiable global-flow local-attention framework to reassemble the inputs at the feature level. This framework first estimates global flow fields between sources and targets. Then, corresponding local source feature patches are sampled with content-aware local attention coefficients. We show that our framework can spatially transform the inputs in an efficient manner. Meanwhile, we further model the temporal consistency for the person image animation task to generate coherent videos. The experiment results of both image generation and animation tasks demonstrate the superiority of our model. Besides, additional results of novel view synthesis and face image animation show that our model is applicable to other tasks requiring spatial transformation. The source code of our project is available at https://github.com/RenYurui/Global-Flow-Local-Attention."
Attribute-guided image generation from layout,"Recent approaches have achieved great success in image generation from structured inputs, e.g., semantic segmentation, scene graph or layout. Although these methods allow specification of objects and their locations at image-level, they lack the fidelity and semantic control to specify visual appearance of these objects at an instance-level. To address this limitation, we propose a new image generation method that enables instance-level attribute control. Specifically, the input to our attribute-guided generative model is a tuple that contains: (1) object bounding boxes, (2) object categories and (3) an (optional) set of attributes for each object. The output is a generated image where the requested objects are in the desired locations and have prescribed attributes. Several losses work collaboratively to encourage accurate, consistent and diverse image generation. Experiments on Visual Genome dataset demonstrate our model's capacity to control object-level attributes in generated images, and validate plausibility of disentangled object-attribute representation in the image generation from layout task. Also, the generated images from our model have higher resolution, object classification accuracy and consistency, as compared to the previous state-of-the-art."
Crossing-Domain Generative Adversarial Networks for Unsupervised Multi-Domain Image-to-Image Translation,"State-of-the-art techniques in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown remarkable success in image-to-image translation from peer domain X to domain Y using paired image data. However, obtaining abundant paired data is a non-trivial and expensive process in the majority of applications. When there is a need to translate images across n domains, if the training is performed between every two domains, the complexity of the training will increase quadratically. Moreover, training with data from two domains only at a time cannot benefit from data of other domains, which prevents the extraction of more useful features and hinders the progress of this research area. In this work, we propose a general framework for unsupervised image-to-image translation across multiple domains, which can translate images from domain X to any a domain without requiring direct training between the two domains involved in image translation. A byproduct of the framework is the reduction of computing time and computing resources, since it needs less time than training the domains in pairs as is done in state-of-the-art works. Our proposed framework consists of a pair of encoders along with a pair of GANs which learns high-level features across different domains to generate diverse and realistic samples from. Our framework shows competing results on many image-to-image tasks compared with state-of-the-art techniques."
Anime-to-Real Clothing: Cosplay Costume Generation via Image-to-Image Translation,"Cosplay has grown from its origins at fan conventions into a billion-dollar global dress phenomenon. To facilitate imagination and reinterpretation from animated images to real garments, this paper presents an automatic costume image generation method based on image-to-image translation. Cosplay items can be significantly diverse in their styles and shapes, and conventional methods cannot be directly applied to the wide variation in clothing images that are the focus of this study. To solve this problem, our method starts by collecting and preprocessing web images to prepare a cleaned, paired dataset of the anime and real domains. Then, we present a novel architecture for generative adversarial networks (GANs) to facilitate high-quality cosplay image generation. Our GAN consists of several effective techniques to fill the gap between the two domains and improve both the global and local consistency of generated images. Experiments demonstrated that, with two types of evaluation metrics, the proposed GAN achieves better performance than existing methods. We also showed that the images generated by the proposed method are more realistic than those generated by the conventional methods. Our codes and pretrained model are available on the web."
What makes fake images detectable? Understanding properties that generalize,"The quality of image generation and manipulation is reaching impressive levels, making it increasingly difficult for a human to distinguish between what is real and what is fake. However, deep networks can still pick up on the subtle artifacts in these doctored images. We seek to understand what properties of fake images make them detectable and identify what generalizes across different model architectures, datasets, and variations in training. We use a patch-based classifier with limited receptive fields to visualize which regions of fake images are more easily detectable. We further show a technique to exaggerate these detectable properties and demonstrate that, even when the image generator is adversarially finetuned against a fake image classifier, it is still imperfect and leaves detectable artifacts in certain image patches. Code is available at https://chail.github.io/patch-forensics/."
Generate High Resolution Images With Generative Variational Autoencoder,"In this work, we present a novel neural network to generate high resolution images. We replace the decoder of VAE with a discriminator while using the encoder as it is. The encoder is fed data from a normal distribution while the generator is fed from a gaussian distribution. The combination from both is given to a discriminator which tells whether the generated image is correct or not. We evaluate our network on 3 different datasets: MNIST, LSUN and CelebA dataset. Our network beats the previous state of the art using MMD, SSIM, log likelihood, reconstruction error, ELBO and KL divergence as the evaluation metrics while generating much sharper images. This work is potentially very exciting as we are able to combine the advantages of generative models and inference models in a principled bayesian manner."
Fidelity-Controllable Extreme Image Compression with Generative Adversarial Networks,"We propose a GAN-based image compression method working at extremely low bitrates below 0.1bpp. Most existing learned image compression methods suffer from blur at extremely low bitrates. Although GAN can help to reconstruct sharp images, there are two drawbacks. First, GAN makes training unstable. Second, the reconstructions often contain unpleasing noise or artifacts. To address both of the drawbacks, our method adopts two-stage training and network interpolation. The two-stage training is effective to stabilize the training. Moreover, the network interpolation utilizes the models in both stages and reduces undesirable noise and artifacts, while maintaining important edges. Hence, we can control the trade-off between perceptual quality and fidelity without re-training models. The experimental results show that our model can reconstruct high quality images. Furthermore, our user study confirms that our reconstructions are preferable to state-of-the-art GAN-based image compression model. The code will be available."
Generative View Synthesis: From Single-view Semantics to Novel-view Images,"Content creation, central to applications such as virtual reality, can be a tedious and time-consuming. Recent image synthesis methods simplify this task by offering tools to generate new views from as little as a single input image, or by converting a semantic map into a photorealistic image. We propose to push the envelope further, and introduce Generative View Synthesis (GVS), which can synthesize multiple photorealistic views of a scene given a single semantic map. We show that the sequential application of existing techniques, e.g., semantics-to-image translation followed by monocular view synthesis, fail at capturing the scene's structure. In contrast, we solve the semantics-to-image translation in concert with the estimation of the 3D layout of the scene, thus producing geometrically consistent novel views that preserve semantic structures. We first lift the input 2D semantic map onto a 3D layered representation of the scene in feature space, thereby preserving the semantic labels of 3D geometric structures. We then project the layered features onto the target views to generate the final novel-view images. We verify the strengths of our method and compare it with several advanced baselines on three different datasets. Our approach also allows for style manipulation and image editing operations, such as the addition or removal of objects, with simple manipulations of the input style images and semantic maps respectively. Visit the project page at https://gvsnet.github.io."
Improving Text to Image Generation using Mode-seeking Function,"Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have long been used to understand the semantic relationship between the text and image. However, there are problems with mode collapsing in the image generation that causes some preferred output modes. Our aim is to improve the training of the network by using a specialized mode-seeking loss function to avoid this issue. In the text to image synthesis, our loss function differentiates two points in latent space for the generation of distinct images. We validate our model on the Caltech Birds (CUB) dataset and the Microsoft COCO dataset by changing the intensity of the loss function during the training. Experimental results demonstrate that our model works very well compared to some state-of-the-art approaches."
Person image generation with semantic attention network for person re-identification,"Pose variation is one of the key factors which prevents the network from learning a robust person re-identification (Re-ID) model. To address this issue, we propose a novel person pose-guided image generation method, which is called the semantic attention network. The network consists of several semantic attention blocks, where each block attends to preserve and update the pose code and the clothing textures. The introduction of the binary segmentation mask and the semantic parsing is important for seamlessly stitching foreground and background in the pose-guided image generation. Compared with other methods, our network can characterize better body shape and keep clothing attributes, simultaneously. Our synthesized image can obtain better appearance and shape consistency related to the original image. Experimental results show that our approach is competitive with respect to both quantitative and qualitative results on Market-1501 and DeepFashion. Furthermore, we conduct extensive evaluations by using person re-identification (Re-ID) systems trained with the pose-transferred person based augmented data. The experiment shows that our approach can significantly enhance the person Re-ID accuracy."
Domain Generalizer: A Few-shot Meta Learning Framework for Domain Generalization in Medical Imaging,"Deep learning models perform best when tested on target (test) data domains whose distribution is similar to the set of source (train) domains. However, model generalization can be hindered when there is significant difference in the underlying statistics between the target and source domains. In this work, we adapt a domain generalization method based on a model-agnostic meta-learning framework to biomedical imaging. The method learns a domain-agnostic feature representation to improve generalization of models to the unseen test distribution. The method can be used for any imaging task, as it does not depend on the underlying model architecture. We validate the approach through a computed tomography (CT) vertebrae segmentation task across healthy and pathological cases on three datasets. Next, we employ few-shot learning, i.e. training the generalized model using very few examples from the unseen domain, to quickly adapt the model to new unseen data distribution. Our results suggest that the method could help generalize models across different medical centers, image acquisition protocols, anatomies, different regions in a given scan, healthy and diseased populations across varied imaging modalities."
Multiple View Generation and Classification of Mid-wave Infrared Images using Deep Learning,"We propose a novel study of generating unseen arbitrary viewpoints for infrared imagery in the non-linear feature subspace . Current methods use synthetic images and often result in blurry and distorted outputs. Our approach on the contrary understands the semantic information in natural images and encapsulates it such that our predicted unseen views possess good 3D representations. We further explore the non-linear feature subspace and conclude that our network does not operate in the Euclidean subspace but rather in the Riemannian subspace. It does not learn the geometric transformation for predicting the position of the pixel in the new image but rather learns the manifold. To this end, we use t-SNE visualisations to conduct a detailed analysis of our network and perform classification of generated images as a low-shot learning task."
DeepGIN: Deep Generative Inpainting Network for Extreme Image Inpainting,"The degree of difficulty in image inpainting depends on the types and sizes of the missing parts. Existing image inpainting approaches usually encounter difficulties in completing the missing parts in the wild with pleasing visual and contextual results as they are trained for either dealing with one specific type of missing patterns (mask) or unilaterally assuming the shapes and/or sizes of the masked areas. We propose a deep generative inpainting network, named DeepGIN, to handle various types of masked images. We design a Spatial Pyramid Dilation (SPD) ResNet block to enable the use of distant features for reconstruction. We also employ Multi-Scale Self-Attention (MSSA) mechanism and Back Projection (BP) technique to enhance our inpainting results. Our DeepGIN outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches generally, including two publicly available datasets (FFHQ and Oxford Buildings), both quantitatively and qualitatively. We also demonstrate that our model is capable of completing masked images in the wild."
Homotopic Gradients of Generative Density Priors for MR Image Reconstruction,"Deep learning, particularly the generative model, has demonstrated tremendous potential to significantly speed up image reconstruction with reduced measurements recently. Rather than the existing generative models that often optimize the density priors, in this work, by taking advantage of the denoising score matching, homotopic gradients of generative density priors (HGGDP) are proposed for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstruction. More precisely, to tackle the low-dimensional manifold and low data density region issues in generative density prior, we estimate the target gradients in higher-dimensional space. We train a more powerful noise conditional score network by forming high-dimensional tensor as the network input at the training phase. More artificial noise is also injected in the embedding space. At the reconstruction stage, a homotopy method is employed to pursue the density prior, such as to boost the reconstruction performance. Experiment results imply the remarkable performance of HGGDP in terms of high reconstruction accuracy; only 10% of the k-space data can still generate images of high quality as effectively as standard MRI reconstruction with the fully sampled data."
crea.blender: A Neural Network-Based Image Generation Game to Assess Creativity,"We present a pilot study on crea.blender, a novel co-creative game designed for large-scale, systematic assessment of distinct constructs of human creativity. Co-creative systems are systems in which humans and computers (often with Machine Learning) collaborate on a creative task. This human-computer collaboration raises questions about the relevance and level of human creativity and involvement in the process. We expand on, and explore aspects of these questions in this pilot study. We observe participants play through three different play modes in crea.blender, each aligned with established creativity assessment methods. In these modes, players ""blend"" existing images into new images under varying constraints. Our study indicates that crea.blender provides a playful experience, affords players a sense of control over the interface, and elicits different types of player behavior, supporting further study of the tool for use in a scalable, playful, creativity assessment."
Improving the Performance of Fine-Grain Image Classifiers via Generative Data Augmentation,"Recent advances in machine learning (ML) and computer vision tools have enabled applications in a wide variety of arenas such as financial analytics, medical diagnostics, and even within the Department of Defense. However, their widespread implementation in real-world use cases poses several challenges: (1) many applications are highly specialized, and hence operate in a \emph{sparse data} domain; (2) ML tools are sensitive to their training sets and typically require cumbersome, labor-intensive data collection and data labelling processes; and (3) ML tools can be extremely ""black box,"" offering users little to no insight into the decision-making process or how new data might affect prediction performance. To address these challenges, we have designed and developed Data Augmentation from Proficient Pre-Training of Robust Generative Adversarial Networks (DAPPER GAN), an ML analytics support tool that automatically generates novel views of training images in order to improve downstream classifier performance. DAPPER GAN leverages high-fidelity embeddings generated by a StyleGAN2 model (trained on the LSUN cars dataset) to create novel imagery for previously unseen classes. We experimentally evaluate this technique on the Stanford Cars dataset, demonstrating improved vehicle make and model classification accuracy and reduced requirements for real data using our GAN based data augmentation framework. The method's validity was supported through an analysis of classifier performance on both augmented and non-augmented datasets, achieving comparable or better accuracy with up to 30\% less real data across visually similar classes. To support this method, we developed a novel augmentation method that can manipulate semantically meaningful dimensions (e.g., orientation) of the target object in the embedding space."
SAFRON: Stitching Across the Frontier for Generating Colorectal Cancer Histology Images,"Synthetic images can be used for the development and evaluation of deep learning algorithms in the context of limited availability of data. In the field of computational pathology, where histology images are large in size and visual context is crucial, synthesis of large high resolution images via generative modeling is a challenging task. This is due to memory and computational constraints hindering the generation of large images. To address this challenge, we propose a novel SAFRON (Stitching Across the FRONtiers) framework to construct realistic, large high resolution tissue image tiles from ground truth annotations while preserving morphological features and with minimal boundary artifacts. We show that the proposed method can generate realistic image tiles of arbitrarily large size after training it on relatively small image patches. We demonstrate that our model can generate high quality images, both visually and in terms of the Frechet Inception Distance. Compared to other existing approaches, our framework is efficient in terms of the memory requirements for training and also in terms of the number of computations to construct a large high-resolution image. We also show that training on synthetic data generated by SAFRON can significantly boost the performance of a state-of-the-art algorithm for gland segmentation in colorectal cancer histology images. Sample high resolution images generated using SAFRON are available at the URL: https://warwick.ac.uk/TIALab/SAFRON"
Bipartite Graph Reasoning GANs for Person Image Generation,"We present a novel Bipartite Graph Reasoning GAN (BiGraphGAN) for the challenging person image generation task. The proposed graph generator mainly consists of two novel blocks that aim to model the pose-to-pose and pose-to-image relations, respectively. Specifically, the proposed Bipartite Graph Reasoning (BGR) block aims to reason the crossing long-range relations between the source pose and the target pose in a bipartite graph, which mitigates some challenges caused by pose deformation. Moreover, we propose a new Interaction-and-Aggregation (IA) block to effectively update and enhance the feature representation capability of both person's shape and appearance in an interactive way. Experiments on two challenging and public datasets, i.e., Market-1501 and DeepFashion, show the effectiveness of the proposed BiGraphGAN in terms of objective quantitative scores and subjective visual realness. The source code and trained models are available at https://github.com/Ha0Tang/BiGraphGAN."
T-GD: Transferable GAN-generated Images Detection Framework,"Recent advancements in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) enable the generation of highly realistic images, raising concerns about their misuse for malicious purposes. Detecting these GAN-generated images (GAN-images) becomes increasingly challenging due to the significant reduction of underlying artifacts and specific patterns. The absence of such traces can hinder detection algorithms from identifying GAN-images and transferring knowledge to identify other types of GAN-images as well. In this work, we present the Transferable GAN-images Detection framework T-GD, a robust transferable framework for an effective detection of GAN-images. T-GD is composed of a teacher and a student model that can iteratively teach and evaluate each other to improve the detection performance. First, we train the teacher model on the source dataset and use it as a starting point for learning the target dataset. To train the student model, we inject noise by mixing up the source and target datasets, while constraining the weight variation to preserve the starting point. Our approach is a self-training method, but distinguishes itself from prior approaches by focusing on improving the transferability of GAN-image detection. T-GD achieves high performance on the source dataset by overcoming catastrophic forgetting and effectively detecting state-of-the-art GAN-images with only a small volume of data without any metadata information."
Speech Driven Talking Face Generation from a Single Image and an Emotion Condition,"Visual emotion expression plays an important role in audiovisual speech communication. In this work, we propose a novel approach to rendering visual emotion expression in speech-driven talking face generation. Specifically, we design an end-to-end talking face generation system that takes a speech utterance, a single face image, and a categorical emotion label as input to render a talking face video synchronized with the speech and expressing the conditioned emotion. Objective evaluation on image quality, audiovisual synchronization, and visual emotion expression shows that the proposed system outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline system. Subjective evaluation of visual emotion expression and video realness also demonstrates the superiority of the proposed system. Furthermore, we conduct a human emotion recognition pilot study using generated videos with mismatched emotions among the audio and visual modalities. Results show that humans respond to the visual modality more significantly than the audio modality on this task."
Generative Adversarial Networks for Image and Video Synthesis: Algorithms and Applications,"The generative adversarial network (GAN) framework has emerged as a powerful tool for various image and video synthesis tasks, allowing the synthesis of visual content in an unconditional or input-conditional manner. It has enabled the generation of high-resolution photorealistic images and videos, a task that was challenging or impossible with prior methods. It has also led to the creation of many new applications in content creation. In this paper, we provide an overview of GANs with a special focus on algorithms and applications for visual synthesis. We cover several important techniques to stabilize GAN training, which has a reputation for being notoriously difficult. We also discuss its applications to image translation, image processing, video synthesis, and neural rendering."
Image Generation for Efficient Neural Network Training in Autonomous Drone Racing,"Drone racing is a recreational sport in which the goal is to pass through a sequence of gates in a minimum amount of time while avoiding collisions. In autonomous drone racing, one must accomplish this task by flying fully autonomously in an unknown environment by relying only on computer vision methods for detecting the target gates. Due to the challenges such as background objects and varying lighting conditions, traditional object detection algorithms based on colour or geometry tend to fail. Convolutional neural networks offer impressive advances in computer vision but require an immense amount of data to learn. Collecting this data is a tedious process because the drone has to be flown manually, and the data collected can suffer from sensor failures. In this work, a semi-synthetic dataset generation method is proposed, using a combination of real background images and randomised 3D renders of the gates, to provide a limitless amount of training samples that do not suffer from those drawbacks. Using the detection results, a line-of-sight guidance algorithm is used to cross the gates. In several experimental real-time tests, the proposed framework successfully demonstrates fast and reliable detection and navigation."
GL-GAN: Adaptive Global and Local Bilevel Optimization model of Image Generation,"Although Generative Adversarial Networks have shown remarkable performance in image generation, there are some challenges in image realism and convergence speed. The results of some models display the imbalances of quality within a generated image, in which some defective parts appear compared with other regions. Different from general single global optimization methods, we introduce an adaptive global and local bilevel optimization model(GL-GAN). The model achieves the generation of high-resolution images in a complementary and promoting way, where global optimization is to optimize the whole images and local is only to optimize the low-quality areas. With a simple network structure, GL-GAN is allowed to effectively avoid the nature of imbalance by local bilevel optimization, which is accomplished by first locating low-quality areas and then optimizing them. Moreover, by using feature map cues from discriminator output, we propose the adaptive local and global optimization method(Ada-OP) for specific implementation and find that it boosts the convergence speed. Compared with the current GAN methods, our model has shown impressive performance on CelebA, CelebA-HQ and LSUN datasets."
StyleFlow: Attribute-conditioned Exploration of StyleGAN-Generated Images using Conditional Continuous Normalizing Flows,"High-quality, diverse, and photorealistic images can now be generated by unconditional GANs (e.g., StyleGAN). However, limited options exist to control the generation process using (semantic) attributes, while still preserving the quality of the output. Further, due to the entangled nature of the GAN latent space, performing edits along one attribute can easily result in unwanted changes along other attributes. In this paper, in the context of conditional exploration of entangled latent spaces, we investigate the two sub-problems of attribute-conditioned sampling and attribute-controlled editing. We present StyleFlow as a simple, effective, and robust solution to both the sub-problems by formulating conditional exploration as an instance of conditional continuous normalizing flows in the GAN latent space conditioned by attribute features. We evaluate our method using the face and the car latent space of StyleGAN, and demonstrate fine-grained disentangled edits along various attributes on both real photographs and StyleGAN generated images. For example, for faces, we vary camera pose, illumination variation, expression, facial hair, gender, and age. Finally, via extensive qualitative and quantitative comparisons, we demonstrate the superiority of StyleFlow to other concurrent works."
F2GAN: Fusing-and-Filling GAN for Few-shot Image Generation,"In order to generate images for a given category, existing deep generative models generally rely on abundant training images. However, extensive data acquisition is expensive and fast learning ability from limited data is necessarily required in real-world applications. Also, these existing methods are not well-suited for fast adaptation to a new category.  Few-shot image generation, aiming to generate images from only a few images for a new category, has attracted some research interest. In this paper, we propose a Fusing-and-Filling Generative Adversarial Network (F2GAN) to generate realistic and diverse images for a new category with only a few images. In our F2GAN, a fusion generator is designed to fuse the high-level features of conditional images with random interpolation coefficients, and then fills in attended low-level details with non-local attention module to produce a new image. Moreover, our discriminator can ensure the diversity of generated images by a mode seeking loss and an interpolation regression loss. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method for few-shot image generation."
SoloGAN: Multi-domain Multimodal Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation via a Single Generative Adversarial Network,"Despite significant advances in image-to-image (I2I) translation with generative adversarial networks (GANs), it remains challenging to effectively translate an image to a set of diverse images in multiple target domains using a single pair of generator and discriminator. Existing I2I translation methods adopt multiple domain-specific content encoders for different domains, where each domain-specific content encoder is trained with images from the same domain only. Nevertheless, we argue that the content (domain-invariance) features should be learned from images among all of the domains. Consequently, each domain-specific content encoder of existing schemes fails to extract the domain-invariant features efficiently. To address this issue, we present a flexible and general SoloGAN model for efficient multimodal I2I translation among multiple domains with unpaired data. In contrast to existing methods, the SoloGAN algorithm uses a single projection discriminator with an additional auxiliary classifier and shares the encoder and generator for all domains. Consequently, the SoloGAN can be trained effectively with images from all domains such that the domain-invariance content representation can be efficiently extracted. Qualitative and quantitative results over a wide range of datasets against several counterparts and variants of the SoloGAN demonstrate the merits of the method, especially for challenging I2I translation datasets, i.e., datasets involving extreme shape variations or need to keep the complex backgrounds unchanged after translations. Furthermore, we demonstrate the contribution of each component in SoloGAN by ablation studies."
Evaluating Automatically Generated Phoneme Captions for Images,"Image2Speech is the relatively new task of generating a spoken description of an image. This paper presents an investigation into the evaluation of this task. For this, first an Image2Speech system was implemented which generates image captions consisting of phoneme sequences. This system outperformed the original Image2Speech system on the Flickr8k corpus. Subsequently, these phoneme captions were converted into sentences of words. The captions were rated by human evaluators for their goodness of describing the image. Finally, several objective metric scores of the results were correlated with these human ratings. Although BLEU4 does not perfectly correlate with human ratings, it obtained the highest correlation among the investigated metrics, and is the best currently existing metric for the Image2Speech task. Current metrics are limited by the fact that they assume their input to be words. A more appropriate metric for the Image2Speech task should assume its input to be parts of words, i.e. phonemes, instead."
Photorealism in Driving Simulations: Blending Generative Adversarial Image Synthesis with Rendering,"Driving simulators play a large role in developing and testing new intelligent vehicle systems. The visual fidelity of the simulation is critical for building vision-based algorithms and conducting human driver experiments. Low visual fidelity breaks immersion for human-in-the-loop driving experiments. Conventional computer graphics pipelines use detailed 3D models, meshes, textures, and rendering engines to generate 2D images from 3D scenes. These processes are labor-intensive, and they do not generate photorealistic imagery. Here we introduce a hybrid generative neural graphics pipeline for improving the visual fidelity of driving simulations. Given a 3D scene, we partially render only important objects of interest, such as vehicles, and use generative adversarial processes to synthesize the background and the rest of the image. To this end, we propose a novel image formation strategy to form 2D semantic images from 3D scenery consisting of simple object models without textures. These semantic images are then converted into photorealistic RGB images with a state-of-the-art Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) trained on real-world driving scenes. This replaces repetitiveness with randomly generated but photorealistic surfaces. Finally, the partially-rendered and GAN synthesized images are blended with a blending GAN. We show that the photorealism of images generated with the proposed method is more similar to real-world driving datasets such as Cityscapes and KITTI than conventional approaches. This comparison is made using semantic retention analysis and Frechet Inception Distance (FID) measurements."
Generative Classifiers as a Basis for Trustworthy Image Classification,"With the maturing of deep learning systems, trustworthiness is becoming increasingly important for model assessment. We understand trustworthiness as the combination of explainability and robustness. Generative classifiers (GCs) are a promising class of models that are said to naturally accomplish these qualities. However, this has mostly been demonstrated on simple datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR in the past. In this work, we firstly develop an architecture and training scheme that allows GCs to operate on a more relevant level of complexity for practical computer vision, namely the ImageNet challenge. Secondly, we demonstrate the immense potential of GCs for trustworthy image classification. Explainability and some aspects of robustness are vastly improved compared to feed-forward models, even when the GCs are just applied naively. While not all trustworthiness problems are solved completely, we observe that GCs are a highly promising basis for further algorithms and modifications. We release our trained model for download in the hope that it serves as a starting point for other generative classification tasks, in much the same way as pretrained ResNet architectures do for discriminative classification."
COVID-19 CT Image Synthesis with a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an ongoing global pandemic that has spread rapidly since December 2019. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and chest computed tomography (CT) imaging both play an important role in COVID-19 diagnosis. Chest CT imaging offers the benefits of quick reporting, a low cost, and high sensitivity for the detection of pulmonary infection. Recently, deep-learning-based computer vision methods have demonstrated great promise for use in medical imaging applications, including X-rays, magnetic resonance imaging, and CT imaging. However, training a deep-learning model requires large volumes of data, and medical staff faces a high risk when collecting COVID-19 CT data due to the high infectivity of the disease. Another issue is the lack of experts available for data labeling. In order to meet the data requirements for COVID-19 CT imaging, we propose a CT image synthesis approach based on a conditional generative adversarial network that can effectively generate high-quality and realistic COVID-19 CT images for use in deep-learning-based medical imaging tasks. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art image synthesis methods with the generated COVID-19 CT images and indicates promising for various machine learning applications including semantic segmentation and classification."
Image-driven discriminative and generative machine learning algorithms for establishing microstructure-processing relationships,"We investigate methods of microstructure representation for the purpose of predicting processing condition from microstructure image data. A binary alloy (uranium-molybdenum) that is currently under development as a nuclear fuel was studied for the purpose of developing an improved machine learning approach to image recognition, characterization, and building predictive capabilities linking microstructure to processing conditions. Here, we test different microstructure representations and evaluate model performance based on the F1 score. A F1 score of 95.1% was achieved for distinguishing between micrographs corresponding to ten different thermo-mechanical material processing conditions. We find that our newly developed microstructure representation describes image data well, and the traditional approach of utilizing area fractions of different phases is insufficient for distinguishing between multiple classes using a relatively small, imbalanced original data set of 272 images. To explore the applicability of generative methods for supplementing such limited data sets, generative adversarial networks were trained to generate artificial microstructure images. Two different generative networks were trained and tested to assess performance. Challenges and best practices associated with applying machine learning to limited microstructure image data sets is also discussed. Our work has implications for quantitative microstructure analysis, and development of microstructure-processing relationships in limited data sets typical of metallurgical process design studies."
Towards Purely Unsupervised Disentanglement of Appearance and Shape for Person Images Generation,"There have been a fairly of research interests in exploring the disentanglement of appearance and shape from human images. Most existing endeavours pursuit this goal by either using training images with annotations or regulating the training process with external clues such as human skeleton, body segmentation or cloth patches etc. In this paper, we aim to address this challenge in a more unsupervised manner---we do not require any annotation nor any external task-specific clues. To this end, we formulate an encoder-decoder-like network to extract both the shape and appearance features from input images at the same time, and train the parameters by three losses: feature adversarial loss, color consistency loss and reconstruction loss. The feature adversarial loss mainly impose little to none mutual information between the extracted shape and appearance features, while the color consistency loss is to encourage the invariance of person appearance conditioned on different shapes. More importantly, our unsupervised (Unsupervised learning has many interpretations in different tasks. To be clear, in this paper, we refer unsupervised learning as learning without task-specific human annotations, pairs or any form of weak supervision.) framework utilizes learned shape features as masks which are applied to the input itself in order to obtain clean appearance features. Without using fixed input human skeleton, our network better preserves the conditional human posture while requiring less supervision. Experimental results on DeepFashion and Market1501 demonstrate that the proposed method achieves clean disentanglement and is able to synthesis novel images of comparable quality with state-of-the-art weakly-supervised or even supervised methods."
CNN Detection of GAN-Generated Face Images based on Cross-Band Co-occurrences Analysis,"Last-generation GAN models allow to generate synthetic images which are visually indistinguishable from natural ones, raising the need to develop tools to distinguish fake and natural images thus contributing to preserve the trustworthiness of digital images. While modern GAN models can generate very high-quality images with no visible spatial artifacts, reconstruction of consistent relationships among colour channels is expectedly more difficult. In this paper, we propose a method for distinguishing GAN-generated from natural images by exploiting inconsistencies among spectral bands, with specific focus on the generation of synthetic face images. Specifically, we use cross-band co-occurrence matrices, in addition to spatial co-occurrence matrices, as input to a CNN model, which is trained to distinguish between real and synthetic faces. The results of our experiments confirm the goodness of our approach which outperforms a similar detection technique based on intra-band spatial co-occurrences only. The performance gain is particularly significant with regard to robustness against post-processing, like geometric transformations, filtering and contrast manipulations."
Stain Style Transfer of Histopathology Images Via Structure-Preserved Generative Learning,"Computational histopathology image diagnosis becomes increasingly popular and important, where images are segmented or classified for disease diagnosis by computers. While pathologists do not struggle with color variations in slides, computational solutions usually suffer from this critical issue. To address the issue of color variations in histopathology images, this study proposes two stain style transfer models, SSIM-GAN and DSCSI-GAN, based on the generative adversarial networks. By cooperating structural preservation metrics and feedback of an auxiliary diagnosis net in learning, medical-relevant information presented by image texture, structure, and chroma-contrast features is preserved in color-normalized images. Particularly, the smart treat of chromatic image content in our DSCSI-GAN model helps to achieve noticeable normalization improvement in image regions where stains mix due to histological substances co-localization. Extensive experimentation on public histopathology image sets indicates that our methods outperform prior arts in terms of generating more stain-consistent images, better preserving histological information in images, and obtaining significantly higher learning efficiency. Our python implementation is published on https://github.com/hanwen0529/DSCSI-GAN."
MI^2GAN: Generative Adversarial Network for Medical Image Domain Adaptation using Mutual Information Constraint,"Domain shift between medical images from multicentres is still an open question for the community, which degrades the generalization performance of deep learning models. Generative adversarial network (GAN), which synthesize plausible images, is one of the potential solutions to address the problem. However, the existing GAN-based approaches are prone to fail at preserving image-objects in image-to-image (I2I) translation, which reduces their practicality on domain adaptation tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN (namely MI^2GAN) to maintain image-contents during cross-domain I2I translation. Particularly, we disentangle the content features from domain information for both the source and translated images, and then maximize the mutual information between the disentangled content features to preserve the image-objects. The proposed MI^2GAN is evaluated on two tasks---polyp segmentation using colonoscopic images and the segmentation of optic disc and cup in fundus images. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MI^2GAN can not only generate elegant translated images, but also significantly improve the generalization performance of widely used deep learning networks (e.g., U-Net)."
"Detection, Attribution and Localization of GAN Generated Images","Recent advances in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have led to the creation of realistic-looking digital images that pose a major challenge to their detection by humans or computers. GANs are used in a wide range of tasks, from modifying small attributes of an image (StarGAN [14]), transferring attributes between image pairs (CycleGAN [91]), as well as generating entirely new images (ProGAN [36], StyleGAN [37], SPADE/GauGAN [64]). In this paper, we propose a novel approach to detect, attribute and localize GAN generated images that combines image features with deep learning methods. For every image, co-occurrence matrices are computed on neighborhood pixels of RGB channels in different directions (horizontal, vertical and diagonal). A deep learning network is then trained on these features to detect, attribute and localize these GAN generated/manipulated images. A large scale evaluation of our approach on 5 GAN datasets comprising over 2.76 million images (ProGAN, StarGAN, CycleGAN, StyleGAN and SPADE/GauGAN) shows promising results in detecting GAN generated images."
Generative Hierarchical Features from Synthesizing Images,"Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have recently advanced image synthesis by learning the underlying distribution of the observed data. However, how the features learned from solving the task of image generation are applicable to other vision tasks remains seldom explored. In this work, we show that learning to synthesize images can bring remarkable hierarchical visual features that are generalizable across a wide range of applications. Specifically, we consider the pre-trained StyleGAN generator as a learned loss function and utilize its layer-wise representation to train a novel hierarchical encoder. The visual feature produced by our encoder, termed as Generative Hierarchical Feature (GH-Feat), has strong transferability to both generative and discriminative tasks, including image editing, image harmonization, image classification, face verification, landmark detection, and layout prediction. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experimental results demonstrate the appealing performance of GH-Feat."
Distractor-Aware Neuron Intrinsic Learning for Generic 2D Medical Image Classifications,"Medical image analysis benefits Computer Aided Diagnosis (CADx). A fundamental analyzing approach is the classification of medical images, which serves for skin lesion diagnosis, diabetic retinopathy grading, and cancer classification on histological images. When learning these discriminative classifiers, we observe that the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are vulnerable to distractor interference. This is due to the similar sample appearances from different categories (i.e., small inter-class distance). Existing attempts select distractors from input images by empirically estimating their potential effects to the classifier. The essences of how these distractors affect CNN classification are not known. In this paper, we explore distractors from the CNN feature space via proposing a neuron intrinsic learning method. We formulate a novel distractor-aware loss that encourages large distance between the original image and its distractor in the feature space. The novel loss is combined with the original classification loss to update network parameters by back-propagation. Neuron intrinsic learning first explores distractors crucial to the deep classifier and then uses them to robustify CNN inherently. Extensive experiments on medical image benchmark datasets indicate that the proposed method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art approaches."
Incorporating Reinforced Adversarial Learning in Autoregressive Image Generation,"Autoregressive models recently achieved comparable results versus state-of-the-art Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with the help of Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoders (VQ-VAE). However, autoregressive models have several limitations such as exposure bias and their training objective does not guarantee visual fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose to use Reinforced Adversarial Learning (RAL) based on policy gradient optimization for autoregressive models. By applying RAL, we enable a similar process for training and testing to address the exposure bias issue. In addition, visual fidelity has been further optimized with adversarial loss inspired by their strong counterparts: GANs. Due to the slow sampling speed of autoregressive models, we propose to use partial generation for faster training. RAL also empowers the collaboration between different modules of the VQ-VAE framework. To our best knowledge, the proposed method is first to enable adversarial learning in autoregressive models for image generation. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show improvements over the MLE trained models. The proposed method improves both negative log-likelihood (NLL) and Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), which indicates improvements in terms of visual quality and diversity. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on Celeba for 64 \times 64 image resolution, showing promise for large scale image generation."
XingGAN for Person Image Generation,"We propose a novel Generative Adversarial Network (XingGAN or CrossingGAN) for person image generation tasks, i.e., translating the pose of a given person to a desired one. The proposed Xing generator consists of two generation branches that model the person's appearance and shape information, respectively. Moreover, we propose two novel blocks to effectively transfer and update the person's shape and appearance embeddings in a crossing way to mutually improve each other, which has not been considered by any other existing GAN-based image generation work. Extensive experiments on two challenging datasets, i.e., Market-1501 and DeepFashion, demonstrate that the proposed XingGAN advances the state-of-the-art performance both in terms of objective quantitative scores and subjective visual realness. The source code and trained models are available at https://github.com/Ha0Tang/XingGAN."
Attention2AngioGAN: Synthesizing Fluorescein Angiography from Retinal Fundus Images using Generative Adversarial Networks,"Fluorescein Angiography (FA) is a technique that employs the designated camera for Fundus photography incorporating excitation and barrier filters. FA also requires fluorescein dye that is injected intravenously, which might cause adverse effects ranging from nausea, vomiting to even fatal anaphylaxis. Currently, no other fast and non-invasive technique exists that can generate FA without coupling with Fundus photography. To eradicate the need for an invasive FA extraction procedure, we introduce an Attention-based Generative network that can synthesize Fluorescein Angiography from Fundus images. The proposed gan incorporates multiple attention based skip connections in generators and comprises novel residual blocks for both generators and discriminators. It utilizes reconstruction, feature-matching, and perceptual loss along with adversarial training to produces realistic Angiograms that is hard for experts to distinguish from real ones. Our experiments confirm that the proposed architecture surpasses recent state-of-the-art generative networks for fundus-to-angio translation task."
Generating Person Images with Appearance-aware Pose Stylizer,"Generation of high-quality person images is challenging, due to the sophisticated entanglements among image factors, e.g., appearance, pose, foreground, background, local details, global structures, etc. In this paper, we present a novel end-to-end framework to generate realistic person images based on given person poses and appearances. The core of our framework is a novel generator called Appearance-aware Pose Stylizer (APS) which generates human images by coupling the target pose with the conditioned person appearance progressively. The framework is highly flexible and controllable by effectively decoupling various complex person image factors in the encoding phase, followed by re-coupling them in the decoding phase. In addition, we present a new normalization method named adaptive patch normalization, which enables region-specific normalization and shows a good performance when adopted in person image generation model. Experiments on two benchmark datasets show that our method is capable of generating visually appealing and realistic-looking results using arbitrary image and pose inputs."
Sketching Image Gist: Human-Mimetic Hierarchical Scene Graph Generation,"Scene graph aims to faithfully reveal humans' perception of image content. When humans analyze a scene, they usually prefer to describe image gist first, namely major objects and key relations in a scene graph. This humans' inherent perceptive habit implies that there exists a hierarchical structure about humans' preference during the scene parsing procedure. Therefore, we argue that a desirable scene graph should be also hierarchically constructed, and introduce a new scheme for modeling scene graph. Concretely, a scene is represented by a human-mimetic Hierarchical Entity Tree (HET) consisting of a series of image regions. To generate a scene graph based on HET, we parse HET with a Hybrid Long Short-Term Memory (Hybrid-LSTM) which specifically encodes hierarchy and siblings context to capture the structured information embedded in HET. To further prioritize key relations in the scene graph, we devise a Relation Ranking Module (RRM) to dynamically adjust their rankings by learning to capture humans' subjective perceptive habits from objective entity saliency and size. Experiments indicate that our method not only achieves state-of-the-art performances for scene graph generation, but also is expert in mining image-specific relations which play a great role in serving downstream tasks."
Image De-Quantization Using Generative Models as Priors,"Image quantization is used in several applications aiming in reducing the number of available colors in an image and therefore its size. De-quantization is the task of reversing the quantization effect and recovering the original multi-chromatic level image. Existing techniques achieve de-quantization by imposing suitable constraints on the ideal image in order to make the recovery problem feasible since it is otherwise ill-posed. Our goal in this work is to develop a de-quantization mechanism through a rigorous mathematical analysis which is based on the classical statistical estimation theory. In this effort we incorporate generative modeling of the ideal image as a suitable prior information. The resulting technique is simple and capable of de-quantizing successfully images that have experienced severe quantization effects. Interestingly, our method can recover images even if the quantization process is not exactly known and contains unknown parameters."
Modeling Artistic Workflows for Image Generation and Editing,"People often create art by following an artistic workflow involving multiple stages that inform the overall design. If an artist wishes to modify an earlier decision, significant work may be required to propagate this new decision forward to the final artwork. Motivated by the above observations, we propose a generative model that follows a given artistic workflow, enabling both multi-stage image generation as well as multi-stage image editing of an existing piece of art. Furthermore, for the editing scenario, we introduce an optimization process along with learning-based regularization to ensure the edited image produced by the model closely aligns with the originally provided image. Qualitative and quantitative results on three different artistic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on both image generation and editing tasks."
Pose2RGBD. Generating Depth and RGB images from absolute positions,"We propose a method at the intersection of Computer Vision and Computer Graphics fields, which automatically generates RGBD images using neural networks, based on previously seen and synchronized video, depth and pose signals. Since the models must be able to reconstruct both texture (RGB) and structure (Depth), it creates an implicit representation of the scene, as opposed to explicit ones, such as meshes or point clouds. The process can be thought of as neural rendering, where we obtain a function f : Pose -> RGBD, which we can use to navigate through the generated scene, similarly to graphics simulations. We introduce two new datasets, one based on synthetic data with full ground truth information, while the other one being recorded from a drone flight in an university campus, using only video and GPS signals. Finally, we propose a fully unsupervised method of generating datasets from videos alone, in order to train the Pose2RGBD networks. Code and datasets are available at:: https://gitlab.com/mihaicristianpirvu/pose2rgbd."
A new approach to descriptors generation for image retrieval by analyzing activations of deep neural network layers,"In this paper, we consider the problem of descriptors construction for the task of content-based image retrieval using deep neural networks. The idea of neural codes, based on fully connected layers activations, is extended by incorporating the information contained in convolutional layers. It is known that the total number of neurons in the convolutional part of the network is large and the majority of them have little influence on the final classification decision. Therefore, in the paper we propose a novel algorithm that allows us to extract the most significant neuron activations and utilize this information to construct effective descriptors. The descriptors consisting of values taken from both the fully connected and convolutional layers perfectly represent the whole image content. The images retrieved using these descriptors match semantically very well to the query image, and also they are similar in other secondary image characteristics, like background, textures or color distribution. These features of the proposed descriptors are verified experimentally based on the IMAGENET1M dataset using the VGG16 neural network."
Scientific Discovery by Generating Counterfactuals using Image Translation,"Model explanation techniques play a critical role in understanding the source of a model's performance and making its decisions transparent. Here we investigate if explanation techniques can also be used as a mechanism for scientific discovery. We make three contributions: first, we propose a framework to convert predictions from explanation techniques to a mechanism of discovery. Second, we show how generative models in combination with black-box predictors can be used to generate hypotheses (without human priors) that can be critically examined. Third, with these techniques we study classification models for retinal images predicting Diabetic Macular Edema (DME), where recent work showed that a CNN trained on these images is likely learning novel features in the image. We demonstrate that the proposed framework is able to explain the underlying scientific mechanism, thus bridging the gap between the model's performance and human understanding."
InfoMax-GAN: Improved Adversarial Image Generation via Information Maximization and Contrastive Learning,"While Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are fundamental to many generative modelling applications, they suffer from numerous issues. In this work, we propose a principled framework to simultaneously mitigate two fundamental issues in GANs: catastrophic forgetting of the discriminator and mode collapse of the generator. We achieve this by employing for GANs a contrastive learning and mutual information maximization approach, and perform extensive analyses to understand sources of improvements. Our approach significantly stabilizes GAN training and improves GAN performance for image synthesis across five datasets under the same training and evaluation conditions against state-of-the-art works. In particular, compared to the state-of-the-art SSGAN, our approach does not suffer from poorer performance on image domains such as faces, and instead improves performance significantly. Our approach is simple to implement and practical: it involves only one auxiliary objective, has a low computational cost, and performs robustly across a wide range of training settings and datasets without any hyperparameter tuning. For reproducibility, our code is available in Mimicry: https://github.com/kwotsin/mimicry."
SofGAN: A Portrait Image Generator with Dynamic Styling,"Recently, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)} have been widely used for portrait image generation. However, in the latent space learned by GANs, different attributes, such as pose, shape, and texture style, are generally entangled, making the explicit control of specific attributes difficult. To address this issue, we propose a SofGAN image generator to decouple the latent space of portraits into two subspaces: a geometry space and a texture space. The latent codes sampled from the two subspaces are fed to two network branches separately, one to generate the 3D geometry of portraits with canonical pose, and the other to generate textures. The aligned 3D geometries also come with semantic part segmentation, encoded as a semantic occupancy field (SOF). The SOF allows the rendering of consistent 2D semantic segmentation maps at arbitrary views, which are then fused with the generated texture maps and stylized to a portrait photo using our semantic instance-wise (SIW) module. Through extensive experiments, we show that our system can generate high quality portrait images with independently controllable geometry and texture attributes. The method also generalizes well in various applications such as appearance-consistent facial animation and dynamic styling."
GRAF: Generative Radiance Fields for 3D-Aware Image Synthesis,"While 2D generative adversarial networks have enabled high-resolution image synthesis, they largely lack an understanding of the 3D world and the image formation process. Thus, they do not provide precise control over camera viewpoint or object pose. To address this problem, several recent approaches leverage intermediate voxel-based representations in combination with differentiable rendering. However, existing methods either produce low image resolution or fall short in disentangling camera and scene properties, e.g., the object identity may vary with the viewpoint. In this paper, we propose a generative model for radiance fields which have recently proven successful for novel view synthesis of a single scene. In contrast to voxel-based representations, radiance fields are not confined to a coarse discretization of the 3D space, yet allow for disentangling camera and scene properties while degrading gracefully in the presence of reconstruction ambiguity. By introducing a multi-scale patch-based discriminator, we demonstrate synthesis of high-resolution images while training our model from unposed 2D images alone. We systematically analyze our approach on several challenging synthetic and real-world datasets. Our experiments reveal that radiance fields are a powerful representation for generative image synthesis, leading to 3D consistent models that render with high fidelity."
A Simple Domain Shifting Networkfor Generating Low Quality Images,"Deep Learning systems have proven to be extremely successful for image recognition tasks for which significant amounts of training data is available, e.g., on the famous ImageNet dataset. We demonstrate that for robotics applications with cheap camera equipment, the low image quality, however,influences the classification accuracy, and freely available databases cannot be exploited in a straight forward way to train classifiers to be used on a robot. As a solution we propose to train a network on degrading the quality images in order to mimic specific low quality imaging systems. Numerical experiments demonstrate that classification networks trained by using images produced by our quality degrading network along with the high quality images outperform classification networks trained only on high quality data when used on a real robot system, while being significantly easier to use than competing zero-shot domain adaptation techniques."
Method for the generation of depth images for view-based shape retrieval of 3D CAD model from partial point cloud,"A laser scanner can easily acquire the geometric data of physical environments in the form of a point cloud. Recognizing objects from a point cloud is often required for industrial 3D reconstruction, which should include not only geometry information but also semantic information. However, recognition process is often a bottleneck in 3D reconstruction because it requires expertise on domain knowledge and intensive labor. To address this problem, various methods have been developed to recognize objects by retrieving the corresponding model in the database from an input geometry query. In recent years, the technique of converting geometric data into an image and applying view-based 3D shape retrieval has demonstrated high accuracy. Depth image which encodes depth value as intensity of pixel is frequently used for view-based 3D shape retrieval. However, geometric data collected from objects is often incomplete due to the occlusions and the limit of line of sight. Image generated by occluded point clouds lowers the performance of view-based 3D object retrieval due to loss of information. In this paper, we propose a method of viewpoint and image resolution estimation method for view-based 3D shape retrieval from point cloud query. Automatic selection of viewpoint and image resolution by calculating the data acquisition rate and density from the sampled viewpoints and image resolutions are proposed. The retrieval performance from the images generated by the proposed method is experimented and compared for various dataset. Additionally, view-based 3D shape retrieval performance with deep convolutional neural network has been experimented with the proposed method."
Analogical Image Translation for Fog Generation,"Image-to-image translation is to map images from a given \emph{style} to another given \emph{style}. While exceptionally successful, current methods assume the availability of training images in both source and target domains, which does not always hold in practice. Inspired by humans' reasoning capability of analogy, we propose analogical image translation (AIT). Given images of two styles in the source domain: \mathcal{A} and \mathcal{A}^\prime, along with images \mathcal{B} of the first style in the target domain, learn a model to translate \mathcal{B} to \mathcal{B}^\prime in the target domain, such that \mathcal{A}:\mathcal{A}^\prime ::\mathcal{B}:\mathcal{B}^\prime. AIT is especially useful for translation scenarios in which training data of one style is hard to obtain but training data of the same two styles in another domain is available. For instance, in the case from normal conditions to extreme, rare conditions, obtaining real training images for the latter case is challenging but obtaining synthetic data for both cases is relatively easy. In this work, we are interested in adding adverse weather effects, more specifically fog effects, to images taken in clear weather. To circumvent the challenge of collecting real foggy images, AIT learns with synthetic clear-weather images, synthetic foggy images and real clear-weather images to add fog effects onto real clear-weather images without seeing any real foggy images during training. AIT achieves this zero-shot image translation capability by coupling a supervised training scheme in the synthetic domain, a cycle consistency strategy in the real domain, an adversarial training scheme between the two domains, and a novel network design. Experiments show the effectiveness of our method for zero-short image translation and its benefit for downstream tasks such as semantic foggy scene understanding."
Generative Damage Learning for Concrete Aging Detection using Auto-flight Images,"In order to monitor the state of large-scale infrastructures, image acquisition by autonomous flight drones is efficient for stable angle and high-quality images. Supervised learning requires a large data set consisting of images and annotation labels. It takes a long time to accumulate images, including identifying the damaged regions of interest (ROIs). In recent years, unsupervised deep learning approaches such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) for anomaly detection algorithms have progressed. When a damaged image is a generator input, it tends to reverse from the damaged state to the healthy state generated image. Using the distance of distribution between the real damaged image and the generated reverse aging healthy state fake image, it is possible to detect the concrete damage automatically from unsupervised learning. This paper proposes an anomaly detection method using unpaired image-to-image translation mapping from damaged images to reverse aging fakes that approximates healthy conditions. We apply our method to field studies, and we examine the usefulness of our method for health monitoring of concrete damage."
Deep Convolutional GANs for Car Image Generation,"In this paper, we investigate the application of deep convolutional GANs on car image generation. We improve upon the commonly used DCGAN architecture by implementing Wasserstein loss to decrease mode collapse and introducing dropout at the end of the discrimiantor to introduce stochasticity. Furthermore, we introduce convolutional layers at the end of the generator to improve expressiveness and smooth noise. All of these improvements upon the DCGAN architecture comprise our proposal of the novel BoolGAN architecture, which is able to decrease the FID from 195.922 (baseline) to 165.966."
Diffusion-Weighted Magnetic Resonance Brain Images Generation with Generative Adversarial Networks and Variational Autoencoders: A Comparison Study,"We show that high quality, diverse and realistic-looking diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images can be synthesized using deep generative models. Based on professional neuroradiologists' evaluations and diverse metrics with respect to quality and diversity of the generated synthetic brain images, we present two networks, the Introspective Variational Autoencoder and the Style-Based GAN, that qualify for data augmentation in the medical field, where information is saved in a dispatched and inhomogeneous way and access to it is in many aspects restricted."
ContraGAN: Contrastive Learning for Conditional Image Generation,"Conditional image generation is the task of generating diverse images using class label information. Although many conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have shown realistic results, such methods consider pairwise relations between the embedding of an image and the embedding of the corresponding label (data-to-class relations) as the conditioning losses. In this paper, we propose ContraGAN that considers relations between multiple image embeddings in the same batch (data-to-data relations) as well as the data-to-class relations by using a conditional contrastive loss. The discriminator of ContraGAN discriminates the authenticity of given samples and minimizes a contrastive objective to learn the relations between training images. Simultaneously, the generator tries to generate realistic images that deceive the authenticity and have a low contrastive loss. The experimental results show that ContraGAN outperforms state-of-the-art-models by 7.3% and 7.7% on Tiny ImageNet and ImageNet datasets, respectively. Besides, we experimentally demonstrate that contrastive learning helps to relieve the overfitting of the discriminator. For a fair comparison, we re-implement twelve state-of-the-art GANs using the PyTorch library. The software package is available at https://github.com/POSTECH-CVLab/PyTorch-StudioGAN."
Generating Annotated High-Fidelity Images Containing Multiple Coherent Objects,"Recent developments related to generative models have made it possible to generate diverse high-fidelity images. In particular, layout-to-image generation models have gained significant attention due to their capability to generate realistic complex images containing distinct objects. These models are generally conditioned on either semantic layouts or textual descriptions. However, unlike natural images, providing auxiliary information can be extremely hard in domains such as biomedical imaging and remote sensing. In this work, we propose a multi-object generation framework that can synthesize images with multiple objects without explicitly requiring their contextual information during the generation process. Based on a vector-quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) backbone, our model learns to preserve spatial coherency within an image as well as semantic coherency between the objects and the background through two powerful autoregressive priors: PixelSNAIL and LayoutPixelSNAIL. While the PixelSNAIL learns the distribution of the latent encodings of the VQ-VAE, the LayoutPixelSNAIL is used to specifically learn the semantic distribution of the objects. An implicit advantage of our approach is that the generated samples are accompanied by object-level annotations. We demonstrate how coherency and fidelity are preserved with our method through experiments on the Multi-MNIST and CLEVR datasets; thereby outperforming state-of-the-art multi-object generative methods. The efficacy of our approach is demonstrated through application on medical imaging datasets, where we show that augmenting the training set with generated samples using our approach improves the performance of existing models."
Frustratingly Simple Domain Generalization via Image Stylization,"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) show impressive performance in the standard classification setting where training and testing data are drawn i.i.d. from a given domain. However, CNNs do not readily generalize to new domains with different statistics, a setting that is simple for humans. In this work, we address the Domain Generalization problem, where the classifier must generalize to an unknown target domain. Inspired by recent works that have shown a difference in biases between CNNs and humans, we demonstrate an extremely simple yet effective method, namely correcting this bias by augmenting the dataset with stylized images. In contrast with existing stylization works, which use external data sources such as art, we further introduce a method that is entirely in-domain using no such extra sources of data. We provide a detailed analysis as to the mechanism by which the method works, verifying our claim that it changes the shape/texture bias, and demonstrate results surpassing or comparable to the state of the arts that utilize much more complex methods."
Generative Patch Priors for Practical Compressive Image Recovery,"In this paper, we propose the generative patch prior (GPP) that defines a generative prior for compressive image recovery, based on patch-manifold models. Unlike learned, image-level priors that are restricted to the range space of a pre-trained generator, GPP can recover a wide variety of natural images using a pre-trained patch generator. Additionally, GPP retains the benefits of generative priors like high reconstruction quality at extremely low sensing rates, while also being much more generally applicable. We show that GPP outperforms several unsupervised and supervised techniques on three different sensing models -- linear compressive sensing with known, and unknown calibration settings, and the non-linear phase retrieval problem. Finally, we propose an alternating optimization strategy using GPP for joint calibration-and-reconstruction which performs favorably against several baselines on a real world, un-calibrated compressive sensing dataset."
Diverse Image Generation via Self-Conditioned GANs,"We introduce a simple but effective unsupervised method for generating realistic and diverse images. We train a class-conditional GAN model without using manually annotated class labels. Instead, our model is conditional on labels automatically derived from clustering in the discriminator's feature space. Our clustering step automatically discovers diverse modes, and explicitly requires the generator to cover them. Experiments on standard mode collapse benchmarks show that our method outperforms several competing methods when addressing mode collapse. Our method also performs well on large-scale datasets such as ImageNet and Places365, improving both image diversity and standard quality metrics, compared to previous methods."
Set Distribution Networks: a Generative Model for Sets of Images,"Images with shared characteristics naturally form sets. For example, in a face verification benchmark, images of the same identity form sets. For generative models, the standard way of dealing with sets is to represent each as a one hot vector, and learn a conditional generative model p(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{y}). This representation assumes that the number of sets is limited and known, such that the distribution over sets reduces to a simple multinomial distribution. In contrast, we study a more generic problem where the number of sets is large and unknown. We introduce Set Distribution Networks (SDNs), a novel framework that learns to autoencode and freely generate sets. We achieve this by jointly learning a set encoder, set discriminator, set generator, and set prior. We show that SDNs are able to reconstruct image sets that preserve salient attributes of the inputs in our benchmark datasets, and are also able to generate novel objects/identities. We examine the sets generated by SDN with a pre-trained 3D reconstruction network and a face verification network, respectively, as a novel way to evaluate the quality of generated sets of images."
Towards a Neural Graphics Pipeline for Controllable Image Generation,"In this paper, we leverage advances in neural networks towards forming a neural rendering for controllable image generation, and thereby bypassing the need for detailed modeling in conventional graphics pipeline. To this end, we present Neural Graphics Pipeline (NGP), a hybrid generative model that brings together neural and traditional image formation models. NGP decomposes the image into a set of interpretable appearance feature maps, uncovering direct control handles for controllable image generation. To form an image, NGP generates coarse 3D models that are fed into neural rendering modules to produce view-specific interpretable 2D maps, which are then composited into the final output image using a traditional image formation model. Our approach offers control over image generation by providing direct handles controlling illumination and camera parameters, in addition to control over shape and appearance variations. The key challenge is to learn these controls through unsupervised training that links generated coarse 3D models with unpaired real images via neural and traditional (e.g., Blinn- Phong) rendering functions, without establishing an explicit correspondence between them. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on controllable image generation of single-object scenes. We evaluate our hybrid modeling framework, compare with neural-only generation methods (namely, DCGAN, LSGAN, WGAN-GP, VON, and SRNs), report improvement in FID scores against real images, and demonstrate that NGP supports direct controls common in traditional forward rendering. Code is available at http://geometry.cs.ucl.ac.uk/projects/2021/ngp."
XRayGAN: Consistency-preserving Generation of X-ray Images from Radiology Reports,"To effectively train medical students to become qualified radiologists, a large number of X-ray images collected from patients with diverse medical conditions are needed. However, due to data privacy concerns, such images are typically difficult to obtain. To address this problem, we develop methods to generate view-consistent, high-fidelity, and high-resolution X-ray images from radiology reports to facilitate radiology training of medical students. This task is presented with several challenges. First, from a single report, images with different views (e.g., frontal, lateral) need to be generated. How to ensure consistency of these images (i.e., make sure they are about the same patient)? Second, X-ray images are required to have high resolution. Otherwise, many details of diseases would be lost. How to generate high-resolutions images? Third, radiology reports are long and have complicated structure. How to effectively understand their semantics to generate high-fidelity images that accurately reflect the contents of the reports? To address these three challenges, we propose an XRayGAN composed of three modules: (1) a view consistency network that maximizes the consistency between generated frontal-view and lateral-view images; (2) a multi-scale conditional GAN that progressively generates a cascade of images with increasing resolution; (3) a hierarchical attentional encoder that learns the latent semantics of a radiology report by capturing its hierarchical linguistic structure and various levels of clinical importance of words and sentences. Experiments on two radiology datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods. To our best knowledge, this work represents the first one generating consistent and high-resolution X-ray images from radiology reports. The code is available at https://github.com/UCSD-AI4H/XRayGAN."
Generating Fundus Fluorescence Angiography Images from Structure Fundus Images Using Generative Adversarial Networks,"Fluorescein angiography can provide a map of retinal vascular structure and function, which is commonly used in ophthalmology diagnosis, however, this imaging modality may pose risks of harm to the patients. To help physicians reduce the potential risks of diagnosis, an image translation method is adopted. In this work, we proposed a conditional generative adversarial network(GAN) - based method to directly learn the mapping relationship between structure fundus images and fundus fluorescence angiography images. Moreover, local saliency maps, which define each pixel's importance, are used to define a novel saliency loss in the GAN cost function. This facilitates more accurate learning of small-vessel and fluorescein leakage features."
High-Fidelity Generative Image Compression,"We extensively study how to combine Generative Adversarial Networks and learned compression to obtain a state-of-the-art generative lossy compression system. In particular, we investigate normalization layers, generator and discriminator architectures, training strategies, as well as perceptual losses. In contrast to previous work, i) we obtain visually pleasing reconstructions that are perceptually similar to the input, ii) we operate in a broad range of bitrates, and iii) our approach can be applied to high-resolution images. We bridge the gap between rate-distortion-perception theory and practice by evaluating our approach both quantitatively with various perceptual metrics, and with a user study. The study shows that our method is preferred to previous approaches even if they use more than 2x the bitrate."
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation of NIR Images through Generative Latent Search,"Segmentation of the pixels corresponding to human skin is an essential first step in multiple applications ranging from surveillance to heart-rate estimation from remote-photoplethysmography. However, the existing literature considers the problem only in the visible-range of the EM-spectrum which limits their utility in low or no light settings where the criticality of the application is higher. To alleviate this problem, we consider the problem of skin segmentation from the Near-infrared images. However, Deep learning based state-of-the-art segmentation techniques demands large amounts of labelled data that is unavailable for the current problem. Therefore we cast the skin segmentation problem as that of target-independent Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) where we use the data from the Red-channel of the visible-range to develop skin segmentation algorithm on NIR images. We propose a method for target-independent segmentation where the 'nearest-clone' of a target image in the source domain is searched and used as a proxy in the segmentation network trained only on the source domain. We prove the existence of 'nearest-clone' and propose a method to find it through an optimization algorithm over the latent space of a Deep generative model based on variational inference. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method for NIR skin segmentation over the state-of-the-art UDA segmentation methods on the two newly created skin segmentation datasets in NIR domain despite not having access to the target NIR data. Additionally, we report state-of-the-art results for adaption from Synthia to Cityscapes which is a popular setting in Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for semantic segmentation. The code and datasets are available at https://github.com/ambekarsameer96/GLSS."
A Generalized Asymmetric Dual-front Model for Active Contours and Image Segmentation,"The Voronoi diagram-based dual-front active contour models are known as a powerful and efficient way for addressing the image segmentation and domain partitioning problems. In the basic formulation of the dual-front models, the evolving contours can be considered as the interfaces of adjacent Voronoi regions. Among these dual-front models, a crucial ingredient is regarded as the geodesic metrics by which the geodesic distances and the corresponding Voronoi diagram can be estimated. In this paper, we introduce a type of asymmetric quadratic metrics dual-front model. The metrics considered are built by the integration of the image features and a vector field derived from the evolving contours. The use of the asymmetry enhancement can reduce the risk of contour shortcut or leakage problems especially when the initial contours are far away from the target boundaries or the images have complicated intensity distributions. Moreover, the proposed dual-front model can be applied for image segmentation in conjunction with various region-based homogeneity terms. The numerical experiments on both synthetic and real images show that the proposed dual-front model indeed achieves encouraging results."
Data Augmentation using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for GAN-based Detection of Pneumonia and COVID-19 in Chest X-ray Images,"Successful training of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) requires a substantial amount of data. With small datasets networks generalize poorly. Data Augmentation techniques improve the generalizability of neural networks by using existing training data more effectively. Standard data augmentation methods, however, produce limited plausible alternative data. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been utilized to generate new data and improve the performance of CNNs. Nevertheless, data augmentation techniques for training GANs are under-explored compared to CNNs. In this work, we propose a new GAN architecture for augmentation of chest X-rays for semi-supervised detection of pneumonia and COVID-19 using generative models. We show that the proposed GAN can be used to effectively augment data and improve classification accuracy of disease in chest X-rays for pneumonia and COVID-19. We compare our augmentation GAN model with Deep Convolutional GAN and traditional augmentation methods (rotate, zoom, etc) on two different X-ray datasets and show our GAN-based augmentation method surpasses other augmentation methods for training a GAN in detecting anomalies in X-ray images."
mFI-PSO: A Flexible and Effective Method in Adversarial Image Generation for Deep Neural Networks,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved great success in image classification, but can be very vulnerable to adversarial attacks with small perturbations to images. To improve adversarial image generation for DNNs, we develop a novel method, called mFI-PSO, which utilizes a Manifold-based First-order Influence measure for vulnerable image and pixel selection and the Particle Swarm Optimization for various objective functions. Our mFI-PSO can thus effectively design adversarial images with flexible, customized options on the number of perturbed pixels, the misclassification probability, and the targeted incorrect class. Experiments demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of our mFI-PSO in adversarial attacks and its appealing advantages over some popular methods."
An embedded system for the automated generation of labeled plant images to enable machine learning applications in agriculture,"A lack of sufficient training data, both in terms of variety and quantity, is often the bottleneck in the development of machine learning (ML) applications in any domain. For agricultural applications, ML-based models designed to perform tasks such as autonomous plant classification will typically be coupled to just one or perhaps a few plant species. As a consequence, each crop-specific task is very likely to require its own specialized training data, and the question of how to serve this need for data now often overshadows the more routine exercise of actually training such models. To tackle this problem, we have developed an embedded robotic system to automatically generate and label large datasets of plant images for ML applications in agriculture. The system can image plants from virtually any angle, thereby ensuring a wide variety of data; and with an imaging rate of up to one image per second, it can produce lableled datasets on the scale of thousands to tens of thousands of images per day. As such, this system offers an important alternative to time- and cost-intensive methods of manual generation and labeling. Furthermore, the use of a uniform background made of blue keying fabric enables additional image processing techniques such as background replacement and plant segmentation. It also helps in the training process, essentially forcing the model to focus on the plant features and eliminating random correlations. To demonstrate the capabilities of our system, we generated a dataset of over 34,000 labeled images, with which we trained an ML-model to distinguish grasses from non-grasses in test data from a variety of sources. We now plan to generate much larger datasets of Canadian crop plants and weeds that will be made publicly available in the hope of further enabling ML applications in the agriculture sector."
Deep Generation of Face Images from Sketches,"Recent deep image-to-image translation techniques allow fast generation of face images from freehand sketches. However, existing solutions tend to overfit to sketches, thus requiring professional sketches or even edge maps as input. To address this issue, our key idea is to implicitly model the shape space of plausible face images and synthesize a face image in this space to approximate an input sketch. We take a local-to-global approach. We first learn feature embeddings of key face components, and push corresponding parts of input sketches towards underlying component manifolds defined by the feature vectors of face component samples. We also propose another deep neural network to learn the mapping from the embedded component features to realistic images with multi-channel feature maps as intermediate results to improve the information flow. Our method essentially uses input sketches as soft constraints and is thus able to produce high-quality face images even from rough and/or incomplete sketches. Our tool is easy to use even for non-artists, while still supporting fine-grained control of shape details. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations show the superior generation ability of our system to existing and alternative solutions. The usability and expressiveness of our system are confirmed by a user study."
Advanced Single Image Resolution Upsurging Using a Generative Adversarial Network,"The resolution of an image is a very important criterion for evaluating the quality of the image. A higher resolution of an image is always preferable as images of lower resolution are unsuitable due to fuzzy quality. A higher resolution of an image is important for various fields such as medical imaging; astronomy works and so on as images of lower resolution becomes unclear and indistinct when their sizes are enlarged. In recent times, various research works are performed to generate a higher resolution of an image from its lower resolution. In this paper, we have proposed a technique of generating higher resolution images form lower resolution using Residual in Residual Dense Block network architecture with a deep network. We have also compared our method with other methods to prove that our method provides better visual quality images."
Depth-aware Blending of Smoothed Images for Bokeh Effect Generation,"Bokeh effect is used in photography to capture images where the closer objects look sharp and every-thing else stays out-of-focus. Bokeh photos are generally captured using Single Lens Reflex cameras using shallow depth-of-field. Most of the modern smartphones can take bokeh images by leveraging dual rear cameras or a good auto-focus hardware. However, for smartphones with single-rear camera without a good auto-focus hardware, we have to rely on software to generate bokeh images. This kind of system is also useful to generate bokeh effect in already captured images. In this paper, an end-to-end deep learning framework is proposed to generate high-quality bokeh effect from images. The original image and different versions of smoothed images are blended to generate Bokeh effect with the help of a monocular depth estimation network. The proposed approach is compared against a saliency detection based baseline and a number of approaches proposed in AIM 2019 Challenge on Bokeh Effect Synthesis. Extensive experiments are shown in order to understand different parts of the proposed algorithm. The network is lightweight and can process an HD image in 0.03 seconds. This approach ranked second in AIM 2019 Bokeh effect challenge-Perceptual Track."
Image Restoration from Parametric Transformations using Generative Models,"When images are statistically described by a generative model we can use this information to develop optimum techniques for various image restoration problems as inpainting, super-resolution, image coloring, generative model inversion, etc. With the help of the generative model it is possible to formulate, in a natural way, these restoration problems as Statistical estimation problems. Our approach, by combining maximum a-posteriori probability with maximum likelihood estimation, is capable of restoring images that are distorted by transformations even when the latter contain unknown parameters. The resulting optimization is completely defined with no parameters requiring tuning. This must be compared with the current state of the art which requires exact knowledge of the transformations and contains regularizer terms with weights that must be properly defined. Finally, we must mention that we extend our method to accommodate mixtures of multiple images where each image is described by its own generative model and we are able of successfully separating each participating image from a single mixture."
CGGAN: A Context Guided Generative Adversarial Network For Single Image Dehazing,"Image haze removal is highly desired for the application of computer vision. This paper proposes a novel Context Guided Generative Adversarial Network (CGGAN) for single image dehazing. Of which, an novel new encoder-decoder is employed as the generator. And it consists of a feature-extraction-net, a context-extractionnet, and a fusion-net in sequence. The feature extraction-net acts as a encoder, and is used for extracting haze features. The context-extraction net is a multi-scale parallel pyramid decoder, and is used for extracting the deep features of the encoder and generating coarse dehazing image. The fusion-net is a decoder, and is used for obtaining the final haze-free image. To obtain more better results, multi-scale information obtained during the decoding process of the context extraction decoder is used for guiding the fusion decoder. By introducing an extra coarse decoder to the original encoder-decoder, the CGGAN can make better use of the deep feature information extracted by the encoder. To ensure our CGGAN work effectively for different haze scenarios, different loss functions are employed for the two decoders. Experiments results show the advantage and the effectiveness of our proposed CGGAN, evidential improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods are obtained."
SegAttnGAN: Text to Image Generation with Segmentation Attention,"In this paper, we propose a novel generative network (SegAttnGAN) that utilizes additional segmentation information for the text-to-image synthesis task. As the segmentation data introduced to the model provides useful guidance on the generator training, the proposed model can generate images with better realism quality and higher quantitative measures compared with the previous state-of-art methods. We achieved Inception Score of 4.84 on the CUB dataset and 3.52 on the Oxford-102 dataset. Besides, we tested the self-attention SegAttnGAN which uses generated segmentation data instead of masks from datasets for attention and achieved similar high-quality results, suggesting that our model can be adapted for the text-to-image synthesis task."
Medical Image Generation using Generative Adversarial Networks,"Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are unsupervised Deep Learning approach in the computer vision community which has gained significant attention from the last few years in identifying the internal structure of multimodal medical imaging data. The adversarial network simultaneously generates realistic medical images and corresponding annotations, which proven to be useful in many cases such as image augmentation, image registration, medical image generation, image reconstruction, and image-to-image translation. These properties bring the attention of the researcher in the field of medical image analysis and we are witness of rapid adaption in many novel and traditional applications. This chapter provides state-of-the-art progress in GANs-based clinical application in medical image generation, and cross-modality synthesis. The various framework of GANs which gained popularity in the interpretation of medical images, such as Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN), Laplacian GAN (LAPGAN), pix2pix, CycleGAN, and unsupervised image-to-image translation model (UNIT), continue to improve their performance by incorporating additional hybrid architecture, has been discussed. Further, some of the recent applications of these frameworks for image reconstruction, and synthesis, and future research directions in the area have been covered."
MBA-RainGAN: Multi-branch Attention Generative Adversarial Network for Mixture of Rain Removal from Single Images,"Rain severely hampers the visibility of scene objects when images are captured through glass in heavily rainy days. We observe three intriguing phenomenons that, 1) rain is a mixture of raindrops, rain streaks and rainy haze; 2) the depth from the camera determines the degrees of object visibility, where objects nearby and faraway are visually blocked by rain streaks and rainy haze, respectively; and 3) raindrops on the glass randomly affect the object visibility of the whole image space. We for the first time consider that, the overall visibility of objects is determined by the mixture of rain (MOR). However, existing solutions and established datasets lack full consideration of the MOR. In this work, we first formulate a new rain imaging model; by then, we enrich the popular RainCityscapes by considering raindrops, named RainCityscapes++. Furthermore, we propose a multi-branch attention generative adversarial network (termed an MBA-RainGAN) to fully remove the MOR. The experiment shows clear visual and numerical improvements of our approach over the state-of-the-arts on RainCityscapes++. The code and dataset will be available."
SINVAD: Search-based Image Space Navigation for DNN Image Classifier Test Input Generation,"The testing of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has become increasingly important as DNNs are widely adopted by safety critical systems. While many test adequacy criteria have been suggested, automated test input generation for many types of DNNs remains a challenge because the raw input space is too large to randomly sample or to navigate and search for plausible inputs. Consequently, current testing techniques for DNNs depend on small local perturbations to existing inputs, based on the metamorphic testing principle. We propose new ways to search not over the entire image space, but rather over a plausible input space that resembles the true training distribution. This space is constructed using Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and navigated through their latent vector space. We show that this space helps efficiently produce test inputs that can reveal information about the robustness of DNNs when dealing with realistic tests, opening the field to meaningful exploration through the space of highly structured images."
Semantic Photo Manipulation with a Generative Image Prior,"Despite the recent success of GANs in synthesizing images conditioned on inputs such as a user sketch, text, or semantic labels, manipulating the high-level attributes of an existing natural photograph with GANs is challenging for two reasons. First, it is hard for GANs to precisely reproduce an input image. Second, after manipulation, the newly synthesized pixels often do not fit the original image. In this paper, we address these issues by adapting the image prior learned by GANs to image statistics of an individual image. Our method can accurately reconstruct the input image and synthesize new content, consistent with the appearance of the input image. We demonstrate our interactive system on several semantic image editing tasks, including synthesizing new objects consistent with background, removing unwanted objects, and changing the appearance of an object. Quantitative and qualitative comparisons against several existing methods demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."
S2IGAN: Speech-to-Image Generation via Adversarial Learning,"An estimated half of the world's languages do not have a written form, making it impossible for these languages to benefit from any existing text-based technologies. In this paper, a speech-to-image generation (S2IG) framework is proposed which translates speech descriptions to photo-realistic images without using any text information, thus allowing unwritten languages to potentially benefit from this technology. The proposed S2IG framework, named S2IGAN, consists of a speech embedding network (SEN) and a relation-supervised densely-stacked generative model (RDG). SEN learns the speech embedding with the supervision of the corresponding visual information. Conditioned on the speech embedding produced by SEN, the proposed RDG synthesizes images that are semantically consistent with the corresponding speech descriptions. Extensive experiments on two public benchmark datasets CUB and Oxford-102 demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed S2IGAN on synthesizing high-quality and semantically-consistent images from the speech signal, yielding a good performance and a solid baseline for the S2IG task."
Detecting CNN-Generated Facial Images in Real-World Scenarios,"Artificial, CNN-generated images are now of such high quality that humans have trouble distinguishing them from real images. Several algorithmic detection methods have been proposed, but these appear to generalize poorly to data from unknown sources, making them infeasible for real-world scenarios. In this work, we present a framework for evaluating detection methods under real-world conditions, consisting of cross-model, cross-data, and post-processing evaluation, and we evaluate state-of-the-art detection methods using the proposed framework. Furthermore, we examine the usefulness of commonly used image pre-processing methods. Lastly, we evaluate human performance on detecting CNN-generated images, along with factors that influence this performance, by conducting an online survey. Our results suggest that CNN-based detection methods are not yet robust enough to be used in real-world scenarios."
Fundus2Angio: A Conditional GAN Architecture for Generating Fluorescein Angiography Images from Retinal Fundus Photography,"Carrying out clinical diagnosis of retinal vascular degeneration using Fluorescein Angiography (FA) is a time consuming process and can pose significant adverse effects on the patient. Angiography requires insertion of a dye that may cause severe adverse effects and can even be fatal. Currently, there are no non-invasive systems capable of generating Fluorescein Angiography images. However, retinal fundus photography is a non-invasive imaging technique that can be completed in a few seconds. In order to eliminate the need for FA, we propose a conditional generative adversarial network (GAN) to translate fundus images to FA images. The proposed GAN consists of a novel residual block capable of generating high quality FA images. These images are important tools in the differential diagnosis of retinal diseases without the need for invasive procedure with possible side effects. Our experiments show that the proposed architecture outperforms other state-of-the-art generative networks. Furthermore, our proposed model achieves better qualitative results indistinguishable from real angiograms."
Conditional Image Generation and Manipulation for User-Specified Content,"In recent years, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have improved steadily towards generating increasingly impressive real-world images. It is useful to steer the image generation process for purposes such as content creation. This can be done by conditioning the model on additional information. However, when conditioning on additional information, there still exists a large set of images that agree with a particular conditioning. This makes it unlikely that the generated image is exactly as envisioned by a user, which is problematic for practical content creation scenarios such as generating facial composites or stock photos. To solve this problem, we propose a single pipeline for text-to-image generation and manipulation. In the first part of our pipeline we introduce textStyleGAN, a model that is conditioned on text. In the second part of our pipeline we make use of the pre-trained weights of textStyleGAN to perform semantic facial image manipulation. The approach works by finding semantic directions in latent space. We show that this method can be used to manipulate facial images for a wide range of attributes. Finally, we introduce the CelebTD-HQ dataset, an extension to CelebA-HQ, consisting of faces and corresponding textual descriptions."
Robust Tensor Decomposition for Image Representation Based on Generalized Correntropy,"Traditional tensor decomposition methods, e.g., two dimensional principal component analysis and two dimensional singular value decomposition, that minimize mean square errors, are sensitive to outliers. To overcome this problem, in this paper we propose a new robust tensor decomposition method using generalized correntropy criterion (Corr-Tensor). A Lagrange multiplier method is used to effectively optimize the generalized correntropy objective function in an iterative manner. The Corr-Tensor can effectively improve the robustness of tensor decomposition with the existence of outliers without introducing any extra computational cost. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method significantly reduces the reconstruction error on face reconstruction and improves the accuracies on handwritten digit recognition and facial image clustering."
Deep convolutional generative adversarial networks for traffic data imputation encoding time series as images,"Sufficient high-quality traffic data are a crucial component of various Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) applications and research related to congestion prediction, speed prediction, incident detection, and other traffic operation tasks. Nonetheless, missing traffic data are a common issue in sensor data which is inevitable due to several reasons, such as malfunctioning, poor maintenance or calibration, and intermittent communications. Such missing data issues often make data analysis and decision-making complicated and challenging. In this study, we have developed a generative adversarial network (GAN) based traffic sensor data imputation framework (TSDIGAN) to efficiently reconstruct the missing data by generating realistic synthetic data. In recent years, GANs have shown impressive success in image data generation. However, generating traffic data by taking advantage of GAN based modeling is a challenging task, since traffic data have strong time dependency. To address this problem, we propose a novel time-dependent encoding method called the Gramian Angular Summation Field (GASF) that converts the problem of traffic time-series data generation into that of image generation. We have evaluated and tested our proposed model using the benchmark dataset provided by Caltrans Performance Management Systems (PeMS). This study shows that the proposed model can significantly improve the traffic data imputation accuracy in terms of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) compared to state-of-the-art models on the benchmark dataset. Further, the model achieves reasonably high accuracy in imputation tasks even under a very high missing data rate (> 50\%), which shows the robustness and efficiency of the proposed model."
Generating Memorable Images Based on Human Visual Memory Schemas,"This research study proposes using Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) that incorporate a two-dimensional measure of human memorability to generate memorable or non-memorable images of scenes. The memorability of the generated images is evaluated by modelling Visual Memory Schemas (VMS), which correspond to mental representations that human observers use to encode an image into memory. The VMS model is based upon the results of memory experiments conducted on human observers, and provides a 2D map of memorability. We impose a memorability constraint upon the latent space of a GAN by employing a VMS map prediction model as an auxiliary loss. We assess the difference in memorability between images generated to be memorable or non-memorable through an independent computational measure of memorability, and additionally assess the effect of memorability on the realness of the generated images."
CONFIG: Controllable Neural Face Image Generation,"Our ability to sample realistic natural images, particularly faces, has advanced by leaps and bounds in recent years, yet our ability to exert fine-tuned control over the generative process has lagged behind. If this new technology is to find practical uses, we need to achieve a level of control over generative networks which, without sacrificing realism, is on par with that seen in computer graphics and character animation. To this end we propose ConfigNet, a neural face model that allows for controlling individual aspects of output images in semantically meaningful ways and that is a significant step on the path towards finely-controllable neural rendering. ConfigNet is trained on real face images as well as synthetic face renders. Our novel method uses synthetic data to factorize the latent space into elements that correspond to the inputs of a traditional rendering pipeline, separating aspects such as head pose, facial expression, hair style, illumination, and many others which are very hard to annotate in real data. The real images, which are presented to the network without labels, extend the variety of the generated images and encourage realism. Finally, we propose an evaluation criterion using an attribute detection network combined with a user study and demonstrate state-of-the-art individual control over attributes in the output images."
Generating Thermal Image Data Samples using 3D Facial Modelling Techniques and Deep Learning Methodologies,"Methods for generating synthetic data have become of increasing importance to build large datasets required for Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) based deep learning techniques for a wide range of computer vision applications. In this work, we extend existing methodologies to show how 2D thermal facial data can be mapped to provide 3D facial models. For the proposed research work we have used tufts datasets for generating 3D varying face poses by using a single frontal face pose. The system works by refining the existing image quality by performing fusion based image preprocessing operations. The refined outputs have better contrast adjustments, decreased noise level and higher exposedness of the dark regions. It makes the facial landmarks and temperature patterns on the human face more discernible and visible when compared to original raw data. Different image quality metrics are used to compare the refined version of images with original images. In the next phase of the proposed study, the refined version of images is used to create 3D facial geometry structures by using Convolution Neural Networks (CNN). The generated outputs are then imported in blender software to finally extract the 3D thermal facial outputs of both males and females. The same technique is also used on our thermal face data acquired using prototype thermal camera (developed under Heliaus EU project) in an indoor lab environment which is then used for generating synthetic 3D face data along with varying yaw face angles and lastly facial depth map is generated."
Transforming and Projecting Images into Class-conditional Generative Networks,"We present a method for projecting an input image into the space of a class-conditional generative neural network. We propose a method that optimizes for transformation to counteract the model biases in generative neural networks. Specifically, we demonstrate that one can solve for image translation, scale, and global color transformation, during the projection optimization to address the object-center bias and color bias of a Generative Adversarial Network. This projection process poses a difficult optimization problem, and purely gradient-based optimizations fail to find good solutions. We describe a hybrid optimization strategy that finds good projections by estimating transformations and class parameters. We show the effectiveness of our method on real images and further demonstrate how the corresponding projections lead to better editability of these images."
Multi-Modality Generative Adversarial Networks with Tumor Consistency Loss for Brain MR Image Synthesis,"Magnetic Resonance (MR) images of different modalities can provide complementary information for clinical diagnosis, but whole modalities are often costly to access. Most existing methods only focus on synthesizing missing images between two modalities, which limits their robustness and efficiency when multiple modalities are missing. To address this problem, we propose a multi-modality generative adversarial network (MGAN) to synthesize three high-quality MR modalities (FLAIR, T1 and T1ce) from one MR modality T2 simultaneously. The experimental results show that the quality of the synthesized images by our proposed methods is better than the one synthesized by the baseline model, pix2pix. Besides, for MR brain image synthesis, it is important to preserve the critical tumor information in the generated modalities, so we further introduce a multi-modality tumor consistency loss to MGAN, called TC-MGAN. We use the synthesized modalities by TC-MGAN to boost the tumor segmentation accuracy, and the results demonstrate its effectiveness."
Differentially Private Generation of Small Images,"We explore the training of generative adversarial networks with differential privacy to anonymize image data sets. On MNIST, we numerically measure the privacy-utility trade-off using parameters from ε-δ differential privacy and the inception score. Our experiments uncover a saturated training regime where an increasing privacy budget adds little to the quality of generated images. We also explain analytically why differentially private Adam optimization is independent of the gradient clipping parameter. Furthermore, we highlight common errors in previous works on differentially private deep learning, which we uncovered in recent literature. Throughout the treatment of the subject, we hope to prevent erroneous estimates of anonymity in the future."
memeBot: Towards Automatic Image Meme Generation,"Image memes have become a widespread tool used by people for interacting and exchanging ideas over social media, blogs, and open messengers. This work proposes to treat automatic image meme generation as a translation process, and further present an end to end neural and probabilistic approach to generate an image-based meme for any given sentence using an encoder-decoder architecture. For a given input sentence, an image meme is generated by combining a meme template image and a text caption where the meme template image is selected from a set of popular candidates using a selection module, and the meme caption is generated by an encoder-decoder model. An encoder is used to map the selected meme template and the input sentence into a meme embedding and a decoder is used to decode the meme caption from the meme embedding. The generated natural language meme caption is conditioned on the input sentence and the selected meme template. The model learns the dependencies between the meme captions and the meme template images and generates new memes using the learned dependencies. The quality of the generated captions and the generated memes is evaluated through both automated and human evaluation. An experiment is designed to score how well the generated memes can represent the tweets from Twitter conversations. Experiments on Twitter data show the efficacy of the model in generating memes for sentences in online social interaction."
Residual Channel Attention Generative Adversarial Network for Image Super-Resolution and Noise Reduction,"Image super-resolution is one of the important computer vision techniques aiming to reconstruct high-resolution images from corresponding low-resolution ones. Most recently, deep learning-based approaches have been demonstrated for image super-resolution. However, as the deep networks go deeper, they become more difficult to train and more difficult to restore the finer texture details, especially under real-world settings. In this paper, we propose a Residual Channel Attention-Generative Adversarial Network(RCA-GAN) to solve these problems. Specifically, a novel residual channel attention block is proposed to form RCA-GAN, which consists of a set of residual blocks with shortcut connections, and a channel attention mechanism to model the interdependence and interaction of the feature representations among different channels. Besides, a generative adversarial network (GAN) is employed to further produce realistic and highly detailed results. Benefiting from these improvements, the proposed RCA-GAN yields consistently better visual quality with more detailed and natural textures than baseline models; and achieves comparable or better performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods for real-world image super-resolution."
Unsupervised Real Image Super-Resolution via Generative Variational AutoEncoder,"Benefited from the deep learning, image Super-Resolution has been one of the most developing research fields in computer vision. Depending upon whether using a discriminator or not, a deep convolutional neural network can provide an image with high fidelity or better perceptual quality. Due to the lack of ground truth images in real life, people prefer a photo-realistic image with low fidelity to a blurry image with high fidelity. In this paper, we revisit the classic example based image super-resolution approaches and come up with a novel generative model for perceptual image super-resolution. Given that real images contain various noise and artifacts, we propose a joint image denoising and super-resolution model via Variational AutoEncoder. We come up with a conditional variational autoencoder to encode the reference for dense feature vector which can then be transferred to the decoder for target image denoising. With the aid of the discriminator, an additional overhead of super-resolution subnetwork is attached to super-resolve the denoised image with photo-realistic visual quality. We participated the NTIRE2020 Real Image Super-Resolution Challenge. Experimental results show that by using the proposed approach, we can obtain enlarged images with clean and pleasant features compared to other supervised methods. We also compared our approach with state-of-the-art methods on various datasets to demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed unsupervised super-resolution model."
Disentangled Image Generation Through Structured Noise Injection,"We explore different design choices for injecting noise into generative adversarial networks (GANs) with the goal of disentangling the latent space. Instead of traditional approaches, we propose feeding multiple noise codes through separate fully-connected layers respectively. The aim is restricting the influence of each noise code to specific parts of the generated image. We show that disentanglement in the first layer of the generator network leads to disentanglement in the generated image. Through a grid-based structure, we achieve several aspects of disentanglement without complicating the network architecture and without requiring labels. We achieve spatial disentanglement, scale-space disentanglement, and disentanglement of the foreground object from the background style allowing fine-grained control over the generated images. Examples include changing facial expressions in face images, changing beak length in bird images, and changing car dimensions in car images. This empirically leads to better disentanglement scores than state-of-the-art methods on the FFHQ dataset."
Evaluation Metrics for Conditional Image Generation,"We present two new metrics for evaluating generative models in the class-conditional image generation setting. These metrics are obtained by generalizing the two most popular unconditional metrics: the Inception Score (IS) and the Fre'chet Inception Distance (FID). A theoretical analysis shows the motivation behind each proposed metric and links the novel metrics to their unconditional counterparts. The link takes the form of a product in the case of IS or an upper bound in the FID case. We provide an extensive empirical evaluation, comparing the metrics to their unconditional variants and to other metrics, and utilize them to analyze existing generative models, thus providing additional insights about their performance, from unlearned classes to mode collapse."
Stomach 3D Reconstruction Based on Virtual Chromoendoscopic Image Generation,"Gastric endoscopy is a standard clinical process that enables medical practitioners to diagnose various lesions inside a patient's stomach. If any lesion is found, it is very important to perceive the location of the lesion relative to the global view of the stomach. Our previous research showed that this could be addressed by reconstructing the whole stomach shape from chromoendoscopic images using a structure-from-motion (SfM) pipeline, in which indigo carmine (IC) blue dye sprayed images were used to increase feature matches for SfM by enhancing stomach surface's textures. However, spraying the IC dye to the whole stomach requires additional time, labor, and cost, which is not desirable for patients and practitioners. In this paper, we propose an alternative way to achieve whole stomach 3D reconstruction without the need of the IC dye by generating virtual IC-sprayed (VIC) images based on image-to-image style translation trained on unpaired real no-IC and IC-sprayed images. We have specifically investigated the effect of input and output color channel selection for generating the VIC images and found that translating no-IC green-channel images to IC-sprayed red-channel images gives the best SfM reconstruction result."
Disentangled and Controllable Face Image Generation via 3D Imitative-Contrastive Learning,"We propose DiscoFaceGAN, an approach for face image generation of virtual people with disentangled, precisely-controllable latent representations for identity of non-existing people, expression, pose, and illumination. We embed 3D priors into adversarial learning and train the network to imitate the image formation of an analytic 3D face deformation and rendering process. To deal with the generation freedom induced by the domain gap between real and rendered faces, we further introduce contrastive learning to promote disentanglement by comparing pairs of generated images. Experiments show that through our imitative-contrastive learning, the factor variations are very well disentangled and the properties of a generated face can be precisely controlled. We also analyze the learned latent space and present several meaningful properties supporting factor disentanglement. Our method can also be used to embed real images into the disentangled latent space. We hope our method could provide new understandings of the relationship between physical properties and deep image synthesis."
Red-GAN: Attacking class imbalance via conditioned generation. Yet another perspective on medical image synthesis for skin lesion dermoscopy and brain tumor MRI,"Exploiting learning algorithms under scarce data regimes is a limitation and a reality of the medical imaging field. In an attempt to mitigate the problem, we propose a data augmentation protocol based on generative adversarial networks. We condition the networks at a pixel-level (segmentation mask) and at a global-level information (acquisition environment or lesion type). Such conditioning provides immediate access to the image-label pairs while controlling global class specific appearance of the synthesized images. To stimulate synthesis of the features relevant for the segmentation task, an additional passive player in a form of segmentor is introduced into the adversarial game. We validate the approach on two medical datasets: BraTS, ISIC. By controlling the class distribution through injection of synthetic images into the training set we achieve control over the accuracy levels of the datasets' classes."
Generative Synthetic Augmentation using Label-to-Image Translation for Nuclei Image Segmentation,"In medical image diagnosis, pathology image analysis using semantic segmentation becomes important for efficient screening as a field of digital pathology. The spatial augmentation is ordinary used for semantic segmentation. Tumor images under malignant are rare and to annotate the labels of nuclei region takes much time-consuming. We require an effective use of dataset to maximize the segmentation accuracy. It is expected that some augmentation to transform generalized images influence the segmentation performance. We propose a synthetic augmentation using label-to-image translation, mapping from a semantic label with the edge structure to a real image. Exactly this paper deal with stain slides of nuclei in tumor. Actually, we demonstrate several segmentation algorithms applied to the initial dataset that contains real images and labels using synthetic augmentation in order to add their generalized images. We computes and reports that a proposed synthetic augmentation procedure improve their accuracy."
A generic ensemble based deep convolutional neural network for semi-supervised medical image segmentation,"Deep learning based image segmentation has achieved the state-of-the-art performance in many medical applications such as lesion quantification, organ detection, etc. However, most of the methods rely on supervised learning, which require a large set of high-quality labeled data. Data annotation is generally an extremely time-consuming process. To address this problem, we propose a generic semi-supervised learning framework for image segmentation based on a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN). An encoder-decoder based DCNN is initially trained using a few annotated training samples. This initially trained model is then copied into sub-models and improved iteratively using random subsets of unlabeled data with pseudo labels generated from models trained in the previous iteration. The number of sub-models is gradually decreased to one in the final iteration. We evaluate the proposed method on a public grand-challenge dataset for skin lesion segmentation. Our method is able to significantly improve beyond fully supervised model learning by incorporating unlabeled data."
On the use of Benford's law to detect GAN-generated images,"The advent of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architectures has given anyone the ability of generating incredibly realistic synthetic imagery. The malicious diffusion of GAN-generated images may lead to serious social and political consequences (e.g., fake news spreading, opinion formation, etc.). It is therefore important to regulate the widespread distribution of synthetic imagery by developing solutions able to detect them. In this paper, we study the possibility of using Benford's law to discriminate GAN-generated images from natural photographs. Benford's law describes the distribution of the most significant digit for quantized Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients. Extending and generalizing this property, we show that it is possible to extract a compact feature vector from an image. This feature vector can be fed to an extremely simple classifier for GAN-generated image detection purpose."
Classify and Generate: Using Classification Latent Space Representations for Image Generations,"Utilization of classification latent space information for downstream reconstruction and generation is an intriguing and a relatively unexplored area. In general, discriminative representations are rich in class-specific features but are too sparse for reconstruction, whereas, in autoencoders the representations are dense but have limited indistinguishable class-specific features, making them less suitable for classification. In this work, we propose a discriminative modeling framework that employs manipulated supervised latent representations to reconstruct and generate new samples belonging to a given class. Unlike generative modeling approaches such as GANs and VAEs that aim to model the data manifold distribution, Representation based Generations (ReGene) directly represent the given data manifold in the classification space. Such supervised representations, under certain constraints, allow for reconstructions and controlled generations using an appropriate decoder without enforcing any prior distribution. Theoretically, given a class, we show that these representations when smartly manipulated using convex combinations retain the same class label. Furthermore, they also lead to the novel generation of visually realistic images. Extensive experiments on datasets of varying resolutions demonstrate that ReGene has higher classification accuracy than existing conditional generative models while being competitive in terms of FID."
Generalized Shortest Path-based Superpixels for Accurate Segmentation of Spherical Images,"Most of existing superpixel methods are designed to segment standard planar images as pre-processing for computer vision pipelines. Nevertheless, the increasing number of applications based on wide angle capture devices, mainly generating 360° spherical images, have enforced the need for dedicated superpixel approaches. In this paper, we introduce a new superpixel method for spherical images called SphSPS (for Spherical Shortest Path-based Superpixels). Our approach respects the spherical geometry and generalizes the notion of shortest path between a pixel and a superpixel center on the 3D spherical acquisition space. We show that the feature information on such path can be efficiently integrated into our clustering framework and jointly improves the respect of object contours and the shape regularity. To relevantly evaluate this last aspect in the spherical space, we also generalize a planar global regularity metric. Finally, the proposed SphSPS method obtains significantly better performance than both planar and recent spherical superpixel approaches on the reference 360° spherical panorama segmentation dataset."
Training End-to-end Single Image Generators without GANs,"We present AugurOne, a novel approach for training single image generative models. Our approach trains an upscaling neural network using non-affine augmentations of the (single) input image, particularly including non-rigid thin plate spline image warps. The extensive augmentations significantly increase the in-sample distribution for the upsampling network enabling the upscaling of highly variable inputs. A compact latent space is jointly learned allowing for controlled image synthesis. Differently from Single Image GAN, our approach does not require GAN training and takes place in an end-to-end fashion allowing fast and stable training. We experimentally evaluate our method and show that it obtains compelling novel animations of single-image, as well as, state-of-the-art performance on conditional generation tasks e.g. paint-to-image and edges-to-image."
Attentive Normalization for Conditional Image Generation,"Traditional convolution-based generative adversarial networks synthesize images based on hierarchical local operations, where long-range dependency relation is implicitly modeled with a Markov chain. It is still not sufficient for categories with complicated structures. In this paper, we characterize long-range dependence with attentive normalization (AN), which is an extension to traditional instance normalization. Specifically, the input feature map is softly divided into several regions based on its internal semantic similarity, which are respectively normalized. It enhances consistency between distant regions with semantic correspondence. Compared with self-attention GAN, our attentive normalization does not need to measure the correlation of all locations, and thus can be directly applied to large-size feature maps without much computational burden. Extensive experiments on class-conditional image generation and semantic inpainting verify the efficacy of our proposed module."
Deep Attentive Generative Adversarial Network for Photo-Realistic Image De-Quantization,"Most of current display devices are with eight or higher bit-depth. However, the quality of most multimedia tools cannot achieve this bit-depth standard for the generating images. De-quantization can improve the visual quality of low bit-depth image to display on high bit-depth screen. This paper proposes DAGAN algorithm to perform super-resolution on image intensity resolution, which is orthogonal to the spatial resolution, realizing photo-realistic de-quantization via an end-to-end learning pattern. Until now, this is the first attempt to apply Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework for image de-quantization. Specifically, we propose the Dense Residual Self-attention (DenseResAtt) module, which is consisted of dense residual blocks armed with self-attention mechanism, to pay more attention on high-frequency information. Moreover, the series connection of sequential DenseResAtt modules forms deep attentive network with superior discriminative learning ability in image de-quantization, modeling representative feature maps to recover as much useful information as possible. In addition, due to the adversarial learning framework can reliably produce high quality natural images, the specified content loss as well as the adversarial loss are back-propagated to optimize the training of model. Above all, DAGAN is able to generate the photo-realistic high bit-depth image without banding artifacts. Experiment results on several public benchmarks prove that the DAGAN algorithm possesses ability to achieve excellent visual effect and satisfied quantitative performance."
Open Domain Dialogue Generation with Latent Images,"We consider grounding open domain dialogues with images. Existing work assumes that both an image and a textual context are available, but image-grounded dialogues by nature are more difficult to obtain than textual dialogues. Thus, we propose learning a response generation model with both image-grounded dialogues and textual dialogues by assuming that the visual scene information at the time of a conversation can be represented by an image, and trying to recover the latent images of the textual dialogues through text-to-image generation techniques. The likelihood of the two types of dialogues is then formulated by a response generator and an image reconstructor that are learned within a conditional variational auto-encoding framework. Empirical studies are conducted in both image-grounded conversation and text-based conversation. In the first scenario, image-grounded dialogues, especially under a low-resource setting, can be effectively augmented by textual dialogues with latent images; while in the second scenario, latent images can enrich the content of responses and at the same time keep them relevant to contexts."
RANSAC-Flow: generic two-stage image alignment,"This paper considers the generic problem of dense alignment between two images, whether they be two frames of a video, two widely different views of a scene, two paintings depicting similar content, etc. Whereas each such task is typically addressed with a domain-specific solution, we show that a simple unsupervised approach performs surprisingly well across a range of tasks. Our main insight is that parametric and non-parametric alignment methods have complementary strengths. We propose a two-stage process: first, a feature-based parametric coarse alignment using one or more homographies, followed by non-parametric fine pixel-wise alignment. Coarse alignment is performed using RANSAC on off-the-shelf deep features. Fine alignment is learned in an unsupervised way by a deep network which optimizes a standard structural similarity metric (SSIM) between the two images, plus cycle-consistency. Despite its simplicity, our method shows competitive results on a range of tasks and datasets, including unsupervised optical flow on KITTI, dense correspondences on Hpatches, two-view geometry estimation on YFCC100M, localization on Aachen Day-Night, and, for the first time, fine alignment of artworks on the Brughel dataset. Our code and data are available at http://imagine.enpc.fr/~shenx/RANSAC-Flow/"
STAN-CT: Standardizing CT Image using Generative Adversarial Network,"Computed tomography (CT) plays an important role in lung malignancy diagnostics and therapy assessment and facilitating precision medicine delivery. However, the use of personalized imaging protocols poses a challenge in large-scale cross-center CT image radiomic studies. We present an end-to-end solution called STAN-CT for CT image standardization and normalization, which effectively reduces discrepancies in image features caused by using different imaging protocols or using different CT scanners with the same imaging protocol. STAN-CT consists of two components: 1) a novel Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) model that is capable of effectively learning the data distribution of a standard imaging protocol with only a few rounds of generator training, and 2) an automatic DICOM reconstruction pipeline with systematic image quality control that ensure the generation of high-quality standard DICOM images. Experimental results indicate that the training efficiency and model performance of STAN-CT have been significantly improved compared to the state-of-the-art CT image standardization and normalization algorithms."
"Object-Centric Image Generation with Factored Depths, Locations, and Appearances","We present a generative model of images that explicitly reasons over the set of objects they show. Our model learns a structured latent representation that separates objects from each other and from the background; unlike prior works, it explicitly represents the 2D position and depth of each object, as well as an embedding of its segmentation mask and appearance. The model can be trained from images alone in a purely unsupervised fashion without the need for object masks or depth information. Moreover, it always generates complete objects, even though a significant fraction of training images contain occlusions. Finally, we show that our model can infer decompositions of novel images into their constituent objects, including accurate prediction of depth ordering and segmentation of occluded parts."
Lesion Conditional Image Generation for Improved Segmentation of Intracranial Hemorrhage from CT Images,"Data augmentation can effectively resolve a scarcity of images when training machine-learning algorithms. It can make them more robust to unseen images. We present a lesion conditional Generative Adversarial Network LcGAN to generate synthetic Computed Tomography (CT) images for data augmentation. A lesion conditional image (segmented mask) is an input to both the generator and the discriminator of the LcGAN during training. The trained model generates contextual CT images based on input masks. We quantify the quality of the images by using a fully convolutional network (FCN) score and blurriness. We also train another classification network to select better synthetic images. These synthetic CT images are then augmented to our hemorrhagic lesion segmentation network. By applying this augmentation method on 2.5%, 10% and 25% of original data, segmentation improved by 12.8%, 6% and 1.6% respectively."
Exploiting Deep Generative Prior for Versatile Image Restoration and Manipulation,"Learning a good image prior is a long-term goal for image restoration and manipulation. While existing methods like deep image prior (DIP) capture low-level image statistics, there are still gaps toward an image prior that captures rich image semantics including color, spatial coherence, textures, and high-level concepts. This work presents an effective way to exploit the image prior captured by a generative adversarial network (GAN) trained on large-scale natural images. As shown in Fig.1, the deep generative prior (DGP) provides compelling results to restore missing semantics, e.g., color, patch, resolution, of various degraded images. It also enables diverse image manipulation including random jittering, image morphing, and category transfer. Such highly flexible restoration and manipulation are made possible through relaxing the assumption of existing GAN-inversion methods, which tend to fix the generator. Notably, we allow the generator to be fine-tuned on-the-fly in a progressive manner regularized by feature distance obtained by the discriminator in GAN. We show that these easy-to-implement and practical changes help preserve the reconstruction to remain in the manifold of nature image, and thus lead to more precise and faithful reconstruction for real images. Code is available at https://github.com/XingangPan/deep-generative-prior."
StrokeCoder: Path-Based Image Generation from Single Examples using Transformers,"This paper demonstrates how a Transformer Neural Network can be used to learn a Generative Model from a single path-based example image. We further show how a data set can be generated from the example image and how the model can be used to generate a large set of deviated images, which still represent the original image's style and concept."
Image Generation Via Minimizing Fréchet Distance in Discriminator Feature Space,"For a given image generation problem, the intrinsic image manifold is often low dimensional. We use the intuition that it is much better to train the GAN generator by minimizing the distributional distance between real and generated images in a small dimensional feature space representing such a manifold than on the original pixel-space. We use the feature space of the GAN discriminator for such a representation. For distributional distance, we employ one of two choices: the Fréchet distance or direct optimal transport (OT); these respectively lead us to two new GAN methods: Fréchet-GAN and OT-GAN. The idea of employing Fréchet distance comes from the success of Fréchet Inception Distance as a solid evaluation metric in image generation. Fréchet-GAN is attractive in several ways. We propose an efficient, numerically stable approach to calculate the Fréchet distance and its gradient. The Fréchet distance estimation requires a significantly less computation time than OT; this allows Fréchet-GAN to use much larger mini-batch size in training than OT. More importantly, we conduct experiments on a number of benchmark datasets and show that Fréchet-GAN (in particular) and OT-GAN have significantly better image generation capabilities than the existing representative primal and dual GAN approaches based on the Wasserstein distance."
Palm-GAN: Generating Realistic Palmprint Images Using Total-Variation Regularized GAN,"Generating realistic palmprint (more generally biometric) images has always been an interesting and, at the same time, challenging problem. Classical statistical models fail to generate realistic-looking palmprint images, as they are not powerful enough to capture the complicated texture representation of palmprint images. In this work, we present a deep learning framework based on generative adversarial networks (GAN), which is able to generate realistic palmprint images. To help the model learn more realistic images, we proposed to add a suitable regularization to the loss function, which imposes the line connectivity of generated palmprint images. This is very desirable for palmprints, as the principal lines in palm are usually connected. We apply this framework to a popular palmprint databases, and generate images which look very realistic, and similar to the samples in this database. Through experimental results, we show that the generated palmprint images look very realistic, have a good diversity, and are able to capture different parts of the prior distribution. We also report the Frechet Inception distance (FID) of the proposed model, and show that our model is able to achieve really good quantitative performance in terms of FID score."
Generating Chinese Poetry from Images via Concrete and Abstract Information,"In recent years, the automatic generation of classical Chinese poetry has made great progress. Besides focusing on improving the quality of the generated poetry, there is a new topic about generating poetry from an image. However, the existing methods for this topic still have the problem of topic drift and semantic inconsistency, and the image-poem pairs dataset is hard to be built when training these models. In this paper, we extract and integrate the Concrete and Abstract information from images to address those issues. We proposed an infilling-based Chinese poetry generation model which can infill the Concrete keywords into each line of poems in an explicit way, and an abstract information embedding to integrate the Abstract information into generated poems. In addition, we use non-parallel data during training and construct separate image datasets and poem datasets to train the different components in our framework. Both automatic and human evaluation results show that our approach can generate poems which have better consistency with images without losing the quality."
GIQA: Generated Image Quality Assessment,"Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have achieved impressive results today, but not all generated images are perfect. A number of quantitative criteria have recently emerged for generative model, but none of them are designed for a single generated image. In this paper, we propose a new research topic, Generated Image Quality Assessment (GIQA), which quantitatively evaluates the quality of each generated image. We introduce three GIQA algorithms from two perspectives: learning-based and data-based. We evaluate a number of images generated by various recent GAN models on different datasets and demonstrate that they are consistent with human assessments. Furthermore, GIQA is available to many applications, like separately evaluating the realism and diversity of generative models, and enabling online hard negative mining (OHEM) in the training of GANs to improve the results."
RADIOGAN: Deep Convolutional Conditional Generative adversarial Network To Generate PET Images,"One of the most challenges in medical imaging is the lack of data. It is proven that classical data augmentation methods are useful but still limited due to the huge variation in images. Using generative adversarial networks (GAN) is a promising way to address this problem, however, it is challenging to train one model to generate different classes of lesions. In this paper, we propose a deep convolutional conditional generative adversarial network to generate MIP positron emission tomography image (PET) which is a 2D image that represents a 3D volume for fast interpretation, according to different lesions or non lesion (normal). The advantage of our proposed method consists of one model that is capable of generating different classes of lesions trained on a small sample size for each class of lesion, and showing a very promising results. In addition, we show that a walk through a latent space can be used as a tool to evaluate the images generated."
Object-Centric Image Generation from Layouts,"Despite recent impressive results on single-object and single-domain image generation, the generation of complex scenes with multiple objects remains challenging. In this paper, we start with the idea that a model must be able to understand individual objects and relationships between objects in order to generate complex scenes well. Our layout-to-image-generation method, which we call Object-Centric Generative Adversarial Network (or OC-GAN), relies on a novel Scene-Graph Similarity Module (SGSM). The SGSM learns representations of the spatial relationships between objects in the scene, which lead to our model's improved layout-fidelity. We also propose changes to the conditioning mechanism of the generator that enhance its object instance-awareness. Apart from improving image quality, our contributions mitigate two failure modes in previous approaches: (1) spurious objects being generated without corresponding bounding boxes in the layout, and (2) overlapping bounding boxes in the layout leading to merged objects in images. Extensive quantitative evaluation and ablation studies demonstrate the impact of our contributions, with our model outperforming previous state-of-the-art approaches on both the COCO-Stuff and Visual Genome datasets. Finally, we address an important limitation of evaluation metrics used in previous works by introducing SceneFID -- an object-centric adaptation of the popular Fr{é}chet Inception Distance metric, that is better suited for multi-object images."
Semantic Pyramid for Image Generation,"We present a novel GAN-based model that utilizes the space of deep features learned by a pre-trained classification model. Inspired by classical image pyramid representations, we construct our model as a Semantic Generation Pyramid -- a hierarchical framework which leverages the continuum of semantic information encapsulated in such deep features; this ranges from low level information contained in fine features to high level, semantic information contained in deeper features. More specifically, given a set of features extracted from a reference image, our model generates diverse image samples, each with matching features at each semantic level of the classification model. We demonstrate that our model results in a versatile and flexible framework that can be used in various classic and novel image generation tasks. These include: generating images with a controllable extent of semantic similarity to a reference image, and different manipulation tasks such as semantically-controlled inpainting and compositing; all achieved with the same model, with no further training."
Deep Domain-Adversarial Image Generation for Domain Generalisation,"Machine learning models typically suffer from the domain shift problem when trained on a source dataset and evaluated on a target dataset of different distribution. To overcome this problem, domain generalisation (DG) methods aim to leverage data from multiple source domains so that a trained model can generalise to unseen domains. In this paper, we propose a novel DG approach based on \emph{Deep Domain-Adversarial Image Generation} (DDAIG). Specifically, DDAIG consists of three components, namely a label classifier, a domain classifier and a domain transformation network (DoTNet). The goal for DoTNet is to map the source training data to unseen domains. This is achieved by having a learning objective formulated to ensure that the generated data can be correctly classified by the label classifier while fooling the domain classifier. By augmenting the source training data with the generated unseen domain data, we can make the label classifier more robust to unknown domain changes. Extensive experiments on four DG datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."
Towards Photo-Realistic Virtual Try-On by Adaptively Generating\leftrightarrowPreserving Image Content,"Image visual try-on aims at transferring a target clothing image onto a reference person, and has become a hot topic in recent years. Prior arts usually focus on preserving the character of a clothing image (e.g. texture, logo, embroidery) when warping it to arbitrary human pose. However, it remains a big challenge to generate photo-realistic try-on images when large occlusions and human poses are presented in the reference person. To address this issue, we propose a novel visual try-on network, namely Adaptive Content Generating and Preserving Network (ACGPN). In particular, ACGPN first predicts semantic layout of the reference image that will be changed after try-on (e.g. long sleeve shirt\rightarrowarm, arm\rightarrowjacket), and then determines whether its image content needs to be generated or preserved according to the predicted semantic layout, leading to photo-realistic try-on and rich clothing details. ACGPN generally involves three major modules. First, a semantic layout generation module utilizes semantic segmentation of the reference image to progressively predict the desired semantic layout after try-on. Second, a clothes warping module warps clothing images according to the generated semantic layout, where a second-order difference constraint is introduced to stabilize the warping process during training. Third, an inpainting module for content fusion integrates all information (e.g. reference image, semantic layout, warped clothes) to adaptively produce each semantic part of human body. In comparison to the state-of-the-art methods, ACGPN can generate photo-realistic images with much better perceptual quality and richer fine-details."
SynCGAN: Using learnable class specific priors to generate synthetic data for improving classifier performance on cytological images,"One of the most challenging aspects of medical image analysis is the lack of a high quantity of annotated data. This makes it difficult for deep learning algorithms to perform well due to a lack of variations in the input space. While generative adversarial networks have shown promise in the field of synthetic data generation, but without a carefully designed prior the generation procedure can not be performed well. In the proposed approach we have demonstrated the use of automatically generated segmentation masks as learnable class-specific priors to guide a conditional GAN for the generation of patho-realistic samples for cytology image. We have observed that augmentation of data using the proposed pipeline called ""SynCGAN"" improves the performance of state of the art classifiers such as ResNet-152, DenseNet-161, Inception-V3 significantly."
LC-GAN: Image-to-image Translation Based on Generative Adversarial Network for Endoscopic Images,"Intelligent vision is appealing in computer-assisted and robotic surgeries. Vision-based analysis with deep learning usually requires large labeled datasets, but manual data labeling is expensive and time-consuming in medical problems. We investigate a novel cross-domain strategy to reduce the need for manual data labeling by proposing an image-to-image translation model live-cadaver GAN (LC-GAN) based on generative adversarial networks (GANs). We consider a situation when a labeled cadaveric surgery dataset is available while the task is instrument segmentation on an unlabeled live surgery dataset. We train LC-GAN to learn the mappings between the cadaveric and live images. For live image segmentation, we first translate the live images to fake-cadaveric images with LC-GAN and then perform segmentation on the fake-cadaveric images with models trained on the real cadaveric dataset. The proposed method fully makes use of the labeled cadaveric dataset for live image segmentation without the need to label the live dataset. LC-GAN has two generators with different architectures that leverage the deep feature representation learned from the cadaveric image based segmentation task. Moreover, we propose the structural similarity loss and segmentation consistency loss to improve the semantic consistency during translation. Our model achieves better image-to-image translation and leads to improved segmentation performance in the proposed cross-domain segmentation task."
Distilling portable Generative Adversarial Networks for Image Translation,"Despite Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been widely used in various image-to-image translation tasks, they can be hardly applied on mobile devices due to their heavy computation and storage cost. Traditional network compression methods focus on visually recognition tasks, but never deal with generation tasks. Inspired by knowledge distillation, a student generator of fewer parameters is trained by inheriting the low-level and high-level information from the original heavy teacher generator. To promote the capability of student generator, we include a student discriminator to measure the distances between real images, and images generated by student and teacher generators. An adversarial learning process is therefore established to optimize student generator and student discriminator. Qualitative and quantitative analysis by conducting experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can learn portable generative models with strong performance."
MatchingGAN: Matching-based Few-shot Image Generation,"To generate new images for a given category, most deep generative models require abundant training images from this category, which are often too expensive to acquire. To achieve the goal of generation based on only a few images, we propose matching-based Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for few-shot generation, which includes a matching generator and a matching discriminator. Matching generator can match random vectors with a few conditional images from the same category and generate new images for this category based on the fused features. The matching discriminator extends conventional GAN discriminator by matching the feature of generated image with the fused feature of conditional images. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method."
Generating Embroidery Patterns Using Image-to-Image Translation,"In many scenarios in computer vision, machine learning, and computer graphics, there is a requirement to learn the mapping from an image of one domain to an image of another domain, called Image-to-image translation. For example, style transfer, object transfiguration, visually altering the appearance of weather conditions in an image, changing the appearance of a day image into a night image or vice versa, photo enhancement, to name a few. In this paper, we propose two machine learning techniques to solve the embroidery image-to-image translation. Our goal is to generate a preview image which looks similar to an embroidered image, from a user-uploaded image. Our techniques are modifications of two existing techniques, neural style transfer, and cycle-consistent generative-adversarial network. Neural style transfer renders the semantic content of an image from one domain in the style of a different image in another domain, whereas a cycle-consistent generative adversarial network learns the mapping from an input image to output image without any paired training data, and also learn a loss function to train this mapping. Furthermore, the techniques we propose are independent of any embroidery attributes, such as elevation of the image, light-source, start, and endpoints of a stitch, type of stitch used, fabric type, etc. Given the user image, our techniques can generate a preview image which looks similar to an embroidered image. We train and test our propose techniques on an embroidery dataset which consist of simple 2D images. To do so, we prepare an unpaired embroidery dataset with more than 8000 user-uploaded images along with embroidered images. Empirical results show that these techniques successfully generate an approximate preview of an embroidered version of a user image, which can help users in decision making."
SketchyCOCO: Image Generation from Freehand Scene Sketches,"We introduce the first method for automatic image generation from scene-level freehand sketches. Our model allows for controllable image generation by specifying the synthesis goal via freehand sketches. The key contribution is an attribute vector bridged Generative Adversarial Network called EdgeGAN, which supports high visual-quality object-level image content generation without using freehand sketches as training data. We have built a large-scale composite dataset called SketchyCOCO to support and evaluate the solution. We validate our approach on the tasks of both object-level and scene-level image generation on SketchyCOCO. Through quantitative, qualitative results, human evaluation and ablation studies, we demonstrate the method's capacity to generate realistic complex scene-level images from various freehand sketches."
GANwriting: Content-Conditioned Generation of Styled Handwritten Word Images,"Although current image generation methods have reached impressive quality levels, they are still unable to produce plausible yet diverse images of handwritten words. On the contrary, when writing by hand, a great variability is observed across different writers, and even when analyzing words scribbled by the same individual, involuntary variations are conspicuous. In this work, we take a step closer to producing realistic and varied artificially rendered handwritten words. We propose a novel method that is able to produce credible handwritten word images by conditioning the generative process with both calligraphic style features and textual content. Our generator is guided by three complementary learning objectives: to produce realistic images, to imitate a certain handwriting style and to convey a specific textual content. Our model is unconstrained to any predefined vocabulary, being able to render whatever input word. Given a sample writer, it is also able to mimic its calligraphic features in a few-shot setup. We significantly advance over prior art and demonstrate with qualitative, quantitative and human-based evaluations the realistic aspect of our synthetically produced images."
Creating High Resolution Images with a Latent Adversarial Generator,"Generating realistic images is difficult, and many formulations for this task have been proposed recently. If we restrict the task to that of generating a particular class of images, however, the task becomes more tractable. That is to say, instead of generating an arbitrary image as a sample from the manifold of natural images, we propose to sample images from a particular ""subspace"" of natural images, directed by a low-resolution image from the same subspace. The problem we address, while close to the formulation of the single-image super-resolution problem, is in fact rather different. Single image super-resolution is the task of predicting the image closest to the ground truth from a relatively low resolution image. We propose to produce samples of high resolution images given extremely small inputs with a new method called Latent Adversarial Generator (LAG). In our generative sampling framework, we only use the input (possibly of very low-resolution) to direct what class of samples the network should produce. As such, the output of our algorithm is not a unique image that relates to the input, but rather a possible se} of related images sampled from the manifold of natural images. Our method learns exclusively in the latent space of the adversary using perceptual loss -- it does not have a pixel loss."
XGPT: Cross-modal Generative Pre-Training for Image Captioning,"While many BERT-based cross-modal pre-trained models produce excellent results on downstream understanding tasks like image-text retrieval and VQA, they cannot be applied to generation tasks directly. In this paper, we propose XGPT, a new method of Cross-modal Generative Pre-Training for Image Captioning that is designed to pre-train text-to-image caption generators through three novel generation tasks, including Image-conditioned Masked Language Modeling (IMLM), Image-conditioned Denoising Autoencoding (IDA), and Text-conditioned Image Feature Generation (TIFG). As a result, the pre-trained XGPT can be fine-tuned without any task-specific architecture modifications to create state-of-the-art models for image captioning. Experiments show that XGPT obtains new state-of-the-art results on the benchmark datasets, including COCO Captions and Flickr30k Captions. We also use XGPT to generate new image captions as data augmentation for the image retrieval task and achieve significant improvement on all recall metrics."
Fully Convolutional Networks for Automatically Generating Image Masks to Train Mask R-CNN,"This paper proposes a novel automatically generating image masks method for the state-of-the-art Mask R-CNN deep learning method. The Mask R-CNN method achieves the best results in object detection until now, however, it is very time-consuming and laborious to get the object Masks for training, the proposed method is composed by a two-stage design, to automatically generating image masks, the first stage implements a fully convolutional networks (FCN) based segmentation network, the second stage network, a Mask R-CNN based object detection network, which is trained on the object image masks from FCN output, the original input image, and additional label information. Through experimentation, our proposed method can obtain the image masks automatically to train Mask R-CNN, and it can achieve very high classification accuracy with an over 90% mean of average precision (mAP) for segmentation"
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Mammogram Image Classification: A Promising Tool for Model Generalization,"Generalization is one of the key challenges in the clinical validation and application of deep learning models to medical images. Studies have shown that such models trained on publicly available datasets often do not work well on real-world clinical data due to the differences in patient population and image device configurations. Also, manually annotating clinical images is expensive. In this work, we propose an unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) method using Cycle-GAN to improve the generalization ability of the model without using any additional manual annotations."
Unlimited Resolution Image Generation with R2D2-GANs,"In this paper we present a novel simulation technique for generating high quality images of any predefined resolution. This method can be used to synthesize sonar scans of size equivalent to those collected during a full-length mission, with across track resolutions of any chosen magnitude. In essence, our model extends Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) based architecture into a conditional recursive setting, that facilitates the continuity of the generated images. The data produced is continuous, realistically-looking, and can also be generated at least two times faster than the real speed of acquisition for the sonars with higher resolutions, such as EdgeTech. The seabed topography can be fully controlled by the user. The visual assessment tests demonstrate that humans cannot distinguish the simulated images from real. Moreover, experimental results suggest that in the absence of real data the autonomous recognition systems can benefit greatly from training with the synthetic data, produced by the R2D2-GANs."
Realistic River Image Synthesis using Deep Generative Adversarial Networks,"In this paper, we demonstrated a practical application of realistic river image generation using deep learning. Specifically, we explored a generative adversarial network (GAN) model capable of generating high-resolution and realistic river images that can be used to support modeling and analysis in surface water estimation, river meandering, wetland loss, and other hydrological research studies. First, we have created an extensive repository of overhead river images to be used in training. Second, we incorporated the Progressive Growing GAN (PGGAN), a network architecture that iteratively trains smaller-resolution GANs to gradually build up to a very high resolution to generate high quality (i.e., 1024x1024) synthetic river imagery. With simpler GAN architectures, difficulties arose in terms of exponential increase of training time and vanishing/exploding gradient issues, which the PGGAN implementation seemed to significantly reduce. The results presented in this study show great promise in generating high-quality images and capturing the details of river structure and flow to support hydrological research, which often requires extensive imagery for model performance."
Deep Image Spatial Transformation for Person Image Generation,"Pose-guided person image generation is to transform a source person image to a target pose. This task requires spatial manipulations of source data. However, Convolutional Neural Networks are limited by the lack of ability to spatially transform the inputs. In this paper, we propose a differentiable global-flow local-attention framework to reassemble the inputs at the feature level. Specifically, our model first calculates the global correlations between sources and targets to predict flow fields. Then, the flowed local patch pairs are extracted from the feature maps to calculate the local attention coefficients. Finally, we warp the source features using a content-aware sampling method with the obtained local attention coefficients. The results of both subjective and objective experiments demonstrate the superiority of our model. Besides, additional results in video animation and view synthesis show that our model is applicable to other tasks requiring spatial transformation. Our source code is available at https://github.com/RenYurui/Global-Flow-Local-Attention."
Say As You Wish: Fine-grained Control of Image Caption Generation with Abstract Scene Graphs,"Humans are able to describe image contents with coarse to fine details as they wish. However, most image captioning models are intention-agnostic which can not generate diverse descriptions according to different user intentions initiatively. In this work, we propose the Abstract Scene Graph (ASG) structure to represent user intention in fine-grained level and control what and how detailed the generated description should be. The ASG is a directed graph consisting of three types of \textbf{abstract nodes} (object, attribute, relationship) grounded in the image without any concrete semantic labels. Thus it is easy to obtain either manually or automatically. From the ASG, we propose a novel ASG2Caption model, which is able to recognise user intentions and semantics in the graph, and therefore generate desired captions according to the graph structure. Our model achieves better controllability conditioning on ASGs than carefully designed baselines on both VisualGenome and MSCOCO datasets. It also significantly improves the caption diversity via automatically sampling diverse ASGs as control signals."
Understanding the Intrinsic Robustness of Image Distributions using Conditional Generative Models,"Starting with Gilmer et al. (2018), several works have demonstrated the inevitability of adversarial examples based on different assumptions about the underlying input probability space. It remains unclear, however, whether these results apply to natural image distributions. In this work, we assume the underlying data distribution is captured by some conditional generative model, and prove intrinsic robustness bounds for a general class of classifiers, which solves an open problem in Fawzi et al. (2018). Building upon the state-of-the-art conditional generative models, we study the intrinsic robustness of two common image benchmarks under \ell_2 perturbations, and show the existence of a large gap between the robustness limits implied by our theory and the adversarial robustness achieved by current state-of-the-art robust models. Code for all our experiments is available at https://github.com/xiaozhanguva/Intrinsic-Rob."
A Novel Measure to Evaluate Generative Adversarial Networks Based on Direct Analysis of Generated Images,"The Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is a state-of-the-art technique in the field of deep learning. A number of recent papers address the theory and applications of GANs in various fields of image processing. Fewer studies, however, have directly evaluated GAN outputs. Those that have been conducted focused on using classification performance, e.g., Inception Score (IS) and statistical metrics, e.g., Fréchet Inception Distance (FID). Here, we consider a fundamental way to evaluate GANs by directly analyzing the images they generate, instead of using them as inputs to other classifiers. We characterize the performance of a GAN as an image generator according to three aspects: 1) Creativity: non-duplication of the real images. 2) Inheritance: generated images should have the same style, which retains key features of the real images. 3) Diversity: generated images are different from each other. A GAN should not generate a few different images repeatedly. Based on the three aspects of ideal GANs, we have designed the Likeness Score (LS) to evaluate GAN performance, and have applied it to evaluate several typical GANs. We compared our proposed measure with two commonly used GAN evaluation methods: IS and FID, and four additional measures. Furthermore, we discuss how these evaluations could help us deepen our understanding of GANs and improve their performance."
Performance Evaluation of Deep Generative Models for Generating Hand-Written Character Images,"There have been many work in the literature on generation of various kinds of images such as Hand-Written characters (MNIST dataset), scene images (CIFAR-10 dataset), various objects images (ImageNet dataset), road signboard images (SVHN dataset) etc. Unfortunately, there have been very limited amount of work done in the domain of document image processing. Automatic image generation can lead to the enormous increase of labeled datasets with the help of only limited amount of labeled data. Various kinds of Deep generative models can be primarily divided into two categories. First category is auto-encoder (AE) and the second one is Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). In this paper, we have evaluated various kinds of AE as well as GANs and have compared their performances on hand-written digits dataset (MNIST) and also on historical hand-written character dataset of Indonesian BALI language. Moreover, these generated characters are recognized by using character recognition tool for calculating the statistical performance of these generated characters with respect to original character images."
Generalized ODIN: Detecting Out-of-distribution Image without Learning from Out-of-distribution Data,"Deep neural networks have attained remarkable performance when applied to data that comes from the same distribution as that of the training set, but can significantly degrade otherwise. Therefore, detecting whether an example is out-of-distribution (OoD) is crucial to enable a system that can reject such samples or alert users. Recent works have made significant progress on OoD benchmarks consisting of small image datasets. However, many recent methods based on neural networks rely on training or tuning with both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data. The latter is generally hard to define a-priori, and its selection can easily bias the learning. We base our work on a popular method ODIN, proposing two strategies for freeing it from the needs of tuning with OoD data, while improving its OoD detection performance. We specifically propose to decompose confidence scoring as well as a modified input pre-processing method. We show that both of these significantly help in detection performance. Our further analysis on a larger scale image dataset shows that the two types of distribution shifts, specifically semantic shift and non-semantic shift, present a significant difference in the difficulty of the problem, providing an analysis of when ODIN-like strategies do or do not work."
Generalized Product Quantization Network for Semi-supervised Image Retrieval,"Image retrieval methods that employ hashing or vector quantization have achieved great success by taking advantage of deep learning. However, these approaches do not meet expectations unless expensive label information is sufficient. To resolve this issue, we propose the first quantization-based semi-supervised image retrieval scheme: Generalized Product Quantization (GPQ) network. We design a novel metric learning strategy that preserves semantic similarity between labeled data, and employ entropy regularization term to fully exploit inherent potentials of unlabeled data. Our solution increases the generalization capacity of the quantization network, which allows overcoming previous limitations in the retrieval community. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that GPQ yields state-of-the-art performance on large-scale real image benchmark datasets."
Co-VeGAN: Complex-Valued Generative Adversarial Network for Compressive Sensing MR Image Reconstruction,"Compressive sensing (CS) is widely used to reduce the acquisition time of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Although state-of-the-art deep learning based methods have been able to obtain fast, high-quality reconstruction of CS-MR images, their main drawback is that they treat complex-valued MRI data as real-valued entities. Most methods either extract the magnitude from the complex-valued entities or concatenate them as two real-valued channels. In both the cases, the phase content, which links the real and imaginary parts of the complex-valued entities, is discarded. In order to address the fundamental problem of real-valued deep networks, i.e. their inability to process complex-valued data, we propose a novel framework based on a complex-valued generative adversarial network (Co-VeGAN). Our model can process complex-valued input, which enables it to perform high-quality reconstruction of the CS-MR images. Further, considering that phase is a crucial component of complex-valued entities, we propose a novel complex-valued activation function, which is sensitive to the phase of the input. Extensive evaluation of the proposed approach on different datasets using various sampling masks demonstrates that the proposed model significantly outperforms the existing CS-MRI reconstruction techniques in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio as well as structural similarity index. Further, it uses significantly fewer trainable parameters to do so, as compared to the real-valued deep learning based methods."
Generalized Octave Convolutions for Learned Multi-Frequency Image Compression,"Learned image compression has recently shown the potential to outperform the standard codecs. State-of-the-art rate-distortion (R-D) performance has been achieved by context-adaptive entropy coding approaches in which hyperprior and autoregressive models are jointly utilized to effectively capture the spatial dependencies in the latent representations. However, the latents are feature maps of the same spatial resolution in previous works, which contain some redundancies that affect the R-D performance. In this paper, we propose the first learned multi-frequency image compression and entropy coding approach that is based on the recently developed octave convolutions to factorize the latents into high and low frequency (resolution) components, where the low frequency is represented by a lower resolution. Therefore, its spatial redundancy is reduced, which improves the R-D performance. Novel generalized octave convolution and octave transposed-convolution architectures with internal activation layers are also proposed to preserve more spatial structure of the information. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme not only outperforms all existing learned methods as well as standard codecs such as the next-generation video coding standard VVC (4:2:0) on the Kodak dataset in both PSNR and MS-SSIM. We also show that the proposed generalized octave convolution can improve the performance of other auto-encoder-based computer vision tasks such as semantic segmentation and image denoising."
PCSGAN: Perceptual Cyclic-Synthesized Generative Adversarial Networks for Thermal and NIR to Visible Image Transformation,"In many real world scenarios, it is difficult to capture the images in the visible light spectrum (VIS) due to bad lighting conditions. However, the images can be captured in such scenarios using Near-Infrared (NIR) and Thermal (THM) cameras. The NIR and THM images contain the limited details. Thus, there is a need to transform the images from THM/NIR to VIS for better understanding. However, it is non-trivial task due to the large domain discrepancies and lack of abundant datasets. Nowadays, Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is able to transform the images from one domain to another domain. Most of the available GAN based methods use the combination of the adversarial and the pixel-wise losses (like L_1 or L_2) as the objective function for training. The quality of transformed images in case of THM/NIR to VIS transformation is still not up to the mark using such objective function. Thus, better objective functions are needed to improve the quality, fine details and realism of the transformed images. A new model for THM/NIR to VIS image transformation called Perceptual Cyclic-Synthesized Generative Adversarial Network (PCSGAN) is introduced to address these issues. The PCSGAN uses the combination of the perceptual (i.e., feature based) losses along with the pixel-wise and the adversarial losses. Both the quantitative and qualitative measures are used to judge the performance of the PCSGAN model over the WHU-IIP face and the RGB-NIR scene datasets. The proposed PCSGAN outperforms the state-of-the-art image transformation models, including Pix2pix, DualGAN, CycleGAN, PS2GAN, and PAN in terms of the SSIM, MSE, PSNR and LPIPS evaluation measures. The code is available at https://github.com/KishanKancharagunta/PCSGAN."
Unsupervised Image-generation Enhanced Adaptation for Object Detection in Thermal images,"Object detection in thermal images is an important computer vision task and has many applications such as unmanned vehicles, robotics, surveillance and night vision. Deep learning based detectors have achieved major progress, which usually need large amount of labelled training data. However, labelled data for object detection in thermal images is scarce and expensive to collect. How to take advantage of the large number labelled visible images and adapt them into thermal image domain, is expected to solve. This paper proposes an unsupervised image-generation enhanced adaptation method for object detection in thermal images. To reduce the gap between visible domain and thermal domain, the proposed method manages to generate simulated fake thermal images that are similar to the target images, and preserves the annotation information of the visible source domain. The image generation includes a CycleGAN based image-to-image translation and an intensity inversion transformation. Generated fake thermal images are used as renewed source domain. And then the off-the-shelf Domain Adaptive Faster RCNN is utilized to reduce the gap between generated intermediate domain and the thermal target domain. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method."
Generator From Edges: Reconstruction of Facial Images,"Applications that involve supervised training require paired images. Researchers of single image super-resolution (SISR) create such images by artificially generating blurry input images from the corresponding ground truth. Similarly we can create paired images with the canny edge. We propose Generator From Edges (GFE) [Figure 2]. Our aim is to determine the best architecture for GFE, along with reviews of perceptual loss [1, 2]. To this end, we conducted three experiments. First, we explored the effects of the adversarial loss often used in SISR. In particular, we uncovered that it is not an essential component to form a perceptual loss. Eliminating adversarial loss will lead to a more effective architecture from the perspective of hardware resource. It also means that considerations for the problems pertaining to generative adversarial network (GAN) [3], such as mode collapse, are not necessary. Second, we reexamined VGG loss and found that the mid-layers yield the best results. By extracting the full potential of VGG loss, the overall performance of perceptual loss improves significantly. Third, based on the findings of the first two experiments, we reevaluated the dense network to construct GFE. Using GFE as an intermediate process, reconstructing a facial image from a pencil sketch can become an easy task."
Manifold-based Test Generation for Image Classifiers,"Neural networks used for image classification tasks in critical applications must be tested with sufficient realistic data to assure their correctness. To effectively test an image classification neural network, one must obtain realistic test data adequate enough to inspire confidence that differences between the implicit requirements and the learned model would be exposed. This raises two challenges: first, an adequate subset of the data points must be carefully chosen to inspire confidence, and second, the implicit requirements must be meaningfully extrapolated to data points beyond those in the explicit training set. This paper proposes a novel framework to address these challenges. Our approach is based on the premise that patterns in a large input data space can be effectively captured in a smaller manifold space, from which similar yet novel test cases---both the input and the label---can be sampled and generated. A variant of Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) is used for capturing this manifold with a generative function, and a search technique is applied on this manifold space to efficiently find fault-revealing inputs. Experiments show that this approach enables generation of thousands of realistic yet fault-revealing test cases efficiently even for well-trained models."
Generative-based Airway and Vessel Morphology Quantification on Chest CT Images,"Accurately and precisely characterizing the morphology of small pulmonary structures from Computed Tomography (CT) images, such as airways and vessels, is becoming of great importance for diagnosis of pulmonary diseases. The smaller conducting airways are the major site of increased airflow resistance in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), while accurately sizing vessels can help identify arterial and venous changes in lung regions that may determine future disorders. However, traditional methods are often limited due to image resolution and artifacts.  We propose a Convolutional Neural Regressor (CNR) that provides cross-sectional measurement of airway lumen, airway wall thickness, and vessel radius. CNR is trained with data created by a generative model of synthetic structures which is used in combination with Simulated and Unsupervised Generative Adversarial Network (SimGAN) to create simulated and refined airways and vessels with known ground-truth.  For validation, we first use synthetically generated airways and vessels produced by the proposed generative model to compute the relative error and directly evaluate the accuracy of CNR in comparison with traditional methods. Then, in-vivo validation is performed by analyzing the association between the percentage of the predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1\%) and the value of the Pi10 parameter, two well-known measures of lung function and airway disease, for airways. For vessels, we assess the correlation between our estimate of the small-vessel blood volume and the lungs' diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO).  The results demonstrate that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) provide a promising direction for accurately measuring vessels and airways on chest CT images with physiological correlates."
GANILLA: Generative Adversarial Networks for Image to Illustration Translation,"In this paper, we explore illustrations in children's books as a new domain in unpaired image-to-image translation. We show that although the current state-of-the-art image-to-image translation models successfully transfer either the style or the content, they fail to transfer both at the same time. We propose a new generator network to address this issue and show that the resulting network strikes a better balance between style and content.  There are no well-defined or agreed-upon evaluation metrics for unpaired image-to-image translation. So far, the success of image translation models has been based on subjective, qualitative visual comparison on a limited number of images. To address this problem, we propose a new framework for the quantitative evaluation of image-to-illustration models, where both content and style are taken into account using separate classifiers. In this new evaluation framework, our proposed model performs better than the current state-of-the-art models on the illustrations dataset. Our code and pretrained models can be found at https://github.com/giddyyupp/ganilla."
Fast Generation of High Fidelity RGB-D Images by Deep-Learning with Adaptive Convolution,"Using the raw data from consumer-level RGB-D cameras as input, we propose a deep-learning based approach to efficiently generate RGB-D images with completed information in high resolution. To process the input images in low resolution with missing regions, new operators for adaptive convolution are introduced in our deep-learning network that consists of three cascaded modules -- the completion module, the refinement module and the super-resolution module. The completion module is based on an architecture of encoder-decoder, where the features of input raw RGB-D will be automatically extracted by the encoding layers of a deep neural-network. The decoding layers are applied to reconstruct the completed depth map, which is followed by a refinement module to sharpen the boundary of different regions. For the super-resolution module, we generate RGB-D images in high resolution by multiple layers for feature extraction and a layer for up-sampling. Benefited from the adaptive convolution operators newly proposed in this paper, our results outperform the existing deep-learning based approaches for RGB-D image complete and super-resolution. As an end-to-end approach, high fidelity RGB-D images can be generated efficiently at the rate of around 21 frames per second."
Cross-Modality Paired-Images Generation for RGB-Infrared Person Re-Identification,"RGB-Infrared (IR) person re-identification is very challenging due to the large cross-modality variations between RGB and IR images. The key solution is to learn aligned features to the bridge RGB and IR modalities. However, due to the lack of correspondence labels between every pair of RGB and IR images, most methods try to alleviate the variations with set-level alignment by reducing the distance between the entire RGB and IR sets. However, this set-level alignment may lead to misalignment of some instances, which limits the performance for RGB-IR Re-ID. Different from existing methods, in this paper, we propose to generate cross-modality paired-images and perform both global set-level and fine-grained instance-level alignments. Our proposed method enjoys several merits. First, our method can perform set-level alignment by disentangling modality-specific and modality-invariant features. Compared with conventional methods, ours can explicitly remove the modality-specific features and the modality variation can be better reduced. Second, given cross-modality unpaired-images of a person, our method can generate cross-modality paired images from exchanged images. With them, we can directly perform instance-level alignment by minimizing distances of every pair of images. Extensive experimental results on two standard benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed model favourably against state-of-the-art methods. Especially, on SYSU-MM01 dataset, our model can achieve a gain of 9.2% and 7.7% in terms of Rank-1 and mAP. Code is available at https://github.com/wangguanan/JSIA-ReID."
Exocentric to Egocentric Image Generation via Parallel Generative Adversarial Network,"Cross-view image generation has been recently proposed to generate images of one view from another dramatically different view. In this paper, we investigate exocentric (third-person) view to egocentric (first-person) view image generation. This is a challenging task since egocentric view sometimes is remarkably different from exocentric view. Thus, transforming the appearances across the two views is a non-trivial task. To this end, we propose a novel Parallel Generative Adversarial Network (P-GAN) with a novel cross-cycle loss to learn the shared information for generating egocentric images from exocentric view. We also incorporate a novel contextual feature loss in the learning procedure to capture the contextual information in images. Extensive experiments on the Exo-Ego datasets show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches."
Domain Embedded Multi-model Generative Adversarial Networks for Image-based Face Inpainting,"Prior knowledge of face shape and structure plays an important role in face inpainting. However, traditional face inpainting methods mainly focus on the generated image resolution of the missing portion without consideration of the special particularities of the human face explicitly and generally produce discordant facial parts. To solve this problem, we present a domain embedded multi-model generative adversarial model for inpainting of face images with large cropped regions. We firstly represent only face regions using the latent variable as the domain knowledge and combine it with the non-face parts textures to generate high-quality face images with plausible contents. Two adversarial discriminators are finally used to judge whether the generated distribution is close to the real distribution or not. It can not only synthesize novel image structures but also explicitly utilize the embedded face domain knowledge to generate better predictions with consistency on structures and appearance. Experiments on both CelebA and CelebA-HQ face datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach achieved state-of-the-art performance and generates higher quality inpainting results than existing ones."
Synthetic Magnetic Resonance Images with Generative Adversarial Networks,"Data augmentation is essential for medical research to increase the size of training datasets and achieve better results. In this work, we experiment three GAN architectures with different loss functions to generate new brain MRIs. The results show the importance of hyperparameter tuning and the use of mini-batch similarity layer in the Discriminator and gradient penalty in the loss function to achieve convergence with high quality and realism. Moreover, huge computation time is needed to generate indistinguishable images from the original dataset."
Generating Interpretable Poverty Maps using Object Detection in Satellite Images,"Accurate local-level poverty measurement is an essential task for governments and humanitarian organizations to track the progress towards improving livelihoods and distribute scarce resources. Recent computer vision advances in using satellite imagery to predict poverty have shown increasing accuracy, but they do not generate features that are interpretable to policymakers, inhibiting adoption by practitioners. Here we demonstrate an interpretable computational framework to accurately predict poverty at a local level by applying object detectors to high resolution (30cm) satellite images. Using the weighted counts of objects as features, we achieve 0.539 Pearson's r^2 in predicting village-level poverty in Uganda, a 31% improvement over existing (and less interpretable) benchmarks. Feature importance and ablation analysis reveal intuitive relationships between object counts and poverty predictions. Our results suggest that interpretability does not have to come at the cost of performance, at least in this important domain."
Pixel-wise Conditioned Generative Adversarial Networks for Image Synthesis and Completion,"Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have proven successful for unsupervised image generation. Several works have extended GANs to image inpainting by conditioning the generation with parts of the image to be reconstructed. Despite their success, these methods have limitations in settings where only a small subset of the image pixels is known beforehand. In this paper we investigate the effectiveness of conditioning GANs when very few pixel values are provided. We propose a modelling framework which results in adding an explicit cost term to the GAN objective function to enforce pixel-wise conditioning. We investigate the influence of this regularization term on the quality of the generated images and the fulfillment of the given pixel constraints. Using the recent PacGAN technique, we ensure that we keep diversity in the generated samples. Conducted experiments on FashionMNIST show that the regularization term effectively controls the trade-off between quality of the generated images and the conditioning. Experimental evaluation on the CIFAR-10 and CelebA datasets evidences that our method achieves accurate results both visually and quantitatively in term of Fréchet Inception Distance, while still enforcing the pixel conditioning. We also evaluate our method on a texture image generation task using fully-convolutional networks. As a final contribution, we apply the method to a classical geological simulation application."
Adversarial Color Enhancement: Generating Unrestricted Adversarial Images by Optimizing a Color Filter,"We introduce an approach that enhances images using a color filter in order to create adversarial effects, which fool neural networks into misclassification. Our approach, Adversarial Color Enhancement (ACE), generates unrestricted adversarial images by optimizing the color filter via gradient descent. The novelty of ACE is its incorporation of established practice for image enhancement in a transparent manner. Experimental results validate the white-box adversarial strength and black-box transferability of ACE. A range of examples demonstrates the perceptual quality of images that ACE produces. ACE makes an important contribution to recent work that moves beyond L_p imperceptibility and focuses on unrestricted adversarial modifications that yield large perceptible perturbations, but remain non-suspicious, to the human eye. The future potential of filter-based adversaries is also explored in two directions: guiding ACE with common enhancement practices (e.g., Instagram filters) towards specific attractive image styles and adapting ACE to image semantics. Code is available at https://github.com/ZhengyuZhao/ACE."
A Hybrid Quantum enabled RBM Advantage: Convolutional Autoencoders For Quantum Image Compression and Generative Learning,"Understanding how the D-Wave quantum computer could be used for machine learning problems is of growing interest. Our work evaluates the feasibility of using the D-Wave as a sampler for machine learning. We describe a hybrid system that combines a classical deep neural network autoencoder with a quantum annealing Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) using the D-Wave. We evaluate our hybrid autoencoder algorithm using two datasets, the MNIST dataset and MNIST Fashion dataset. We evaluate the quality of this method by using a downstream classification method where the training is based on quantum RBM-generated samples. Our method overcomes two key limitations in the current 2000-qubit D-Wave processor, namely the limited number of qubits available to accommodate typical problem sizes for fully connected quantum objective functions and samples that are binary pixel representations. As a consequence of these limitations we are able to show how we achieved nearly a 22-fold compression factor of grayscale 28 x 28 sized images to binary 6 x 6 sized images with a lossy recovery of the original 28 x 28 grayscale images. We further show how generating samples from the D-Wave after training the RBM, resulted in 28 x 28 images that were variations of the original input data distribution, as opposed to recreating the training samples. We formulated an MNIST classification problem using a deep convolutional neural network that used samples from a quantum RBM to train the MNIST classifier and compared the results with an MNIST classifier trained with the original MNIST training data set, as well as an MNIST classifier trained using classical RBM samples. Our hybrid autoencoder approach indicates advantage for RBM results relative to the use of a current RBM classical computer implementation for image-based machine learning and even more promising results for the next generation D-Wave quantum system."
Adversarial Code Learning for Image Generation,"We introduce the ""adversarial code learning"" (ACL) module that improves overall image generation performance to several types of deep models. Instead of performing a posterior distribution modeling in the pixel spaces of generators, ACLs aim to jointly learn a latent code with another image encoder/inference net, with a prior noise as its input. We conduct the learning in an adversarial learning process, which bears a close resemblance to the original GAN but again shifts the learning from image spaces to prior and latent code spaces. ACL is a portable module that brings up much more flexibility and possibilities in generative model designs. First, it allows flexibility to convert non-generative models like Autoencoders and standard classification models to decent generative models. Second, it enhances existing GANs' performance by generating meaningful codes and images from any part of the prior. We have incorporated our ACL module with the aforementioned frameworks and have performed experiments on synthetic, MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CelebA datasets. Our models have achieved significant improvements which demonstrated the generality for image generation tasks."
Optimized Feature Space Learning for Generating Efficient Binary Codes for Image Retrieval,"In this paper we propose an approach for learning low dimensional optimized feature space with minimum intra-class variance and maximum inter-class variance. We address the problem of high-dimensionality of feature vectors extracted from neural networks by taking care of the global statistics of feature space. Classical approach of Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is generally used for generating an optimized low dimensional feature space for single-labeled images. Since, image retrieval involves both multi-labeled and single-labeled images, we utilize the equivalence between LDA and Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) to generate an optimized feature space for single-labeled images and use CCA to generate an optimized feature space for multi-labeled images. Our approach correlates the projections of feature vectors with label vectors in our CCA based network architecture. The neural network minimize a loss function which maximizes the correlation coefficients. We binarize our generated feature vectors with the popular Iterative Quantization (ITQ) approach and also propose an ensemble network to generate binary codes of desired bit length for image retrieval. Our measurement of mean average precision shows competitive results on other state-of-the-art single-labeled and multi-labeled image retrieval datasets."
Just Noticeable Difference for Machines to Generate Adversarial Images,"One way of designing a robust machine learning algorithm is to generate authentic adversarial images which can trick the algorithms as much as possible. In this study, we propose a new method to generate adversarial images which are very similar to true images, yet, these images are discriminated from the original ones and are assigned into another category by the model. The proposed method is based on a popular concept of experimental psychology, called, Just Noticeable Difference. We define Just Noticeable Difference for a machine learning model and generate a least perceptible difference for adversarial images which can trick a model. The suggested model iteratively distorts a true image by gradient descent method until the machine learning algorithm outputs a false label. Deep Neural Networks are trained for object detection and classification tasks. The cost function includes regularization terms to generate just noticeably different adversarial images which can be detected by the model. The adversarial images generated in this study looks more natural compared to the output of state of the art adversarial image generators."
Multimodal Story Generation on Plural Images,"Traditionally, text generation models take in a sequence of text as input, and iteratively generate the next most probable word using pre-trained parameters. In this work, we propose the architecture to use images instead of text as the input of the text generation model, called StoryGen. In the architecture, we design a Relational Text Data Generator algorithm that relates different features from multiple images. The output samples from the model demonstrate the ability to generate meaningful paragraphs of text containing the extracted features from the input images. This is an undergraduate project report. Completed Dec. 2019 at the Cooper Union."
Medical image reconstruction with image-adaptive priors learned by use of generative adversarial networks,"Medical image reconstruction is typically an ill-posed inverse problem. In order to address such ill-posed problems, the prior distribution of the sought after object property is usually incorporated by means of some sparsity-promoting regularization. Recently, prior distributions for images estimated using generative adversarial networks (GANs) have shown great promise in regularizing some of these image reconstruction problems. In this work, we apply an image-adaptive GAN-based reconstruction method (IAGAN) to reconstruct high fidelity images from incomplete medical imaging data. It is observed that the IAGAN method can potentially recover fine structures in the object that are relevant for medical diagnosis but may be oversmoothed in reconstructions with traditional sparsity-promoting regularization."
Using Simulated Data to Generate Images of Climate Change,"Generative adversarial networks (GANs) used in domain adaptation tasks have the ability to generate images that are both realistic and personalized, transforming an input image while maintaining its identifiable characteristics. However, they often require a large quantity of training data to produce high-quality images in a robust way, which limits their usability in cases when access to data is limited. In our paper, we explore the potential of using images from a simulated 3D environment to improve a domain adaptation task carried out by the MUNIT architecture, aiming to use the resulting images to raise awareness of the potential future impacts of climate change."
A One-Shot Learning Framework for Assessment of Fibrillar Collagen from Second Harmonic Generation Images of an Infarcted Myocardium,"Myocardial infarction (MI) is a scientific term that refers to heart attack. In this study, we infer highly relevant second harmonic generation (SHG) cues from collagen fibers exhibiting highly non-centrosymmetric assembly together with two-photon excited cellular autofluorescence in infarcted mouse heart to quantitatively probe fibrosis, especially targeted at an early stage after MI. We present a robust one-shot machine learning algorithm that enables determination of 2D assembly of collagen with high spatial resolution along with its structural arrangement in heart tissues post-MI with spectral specificity and sensitivity. Detection, evaluation, and precise quantification of fibrosis extent at early stage would guide one to develop treatment therapies that may prevent further progression and determine heart transplant needs for patient survival."
Optimizing Generative Adversarial Networks for Image Super Resolution via Latent Space Regularization,"Natural images can be regarded as residing in a manifold that is embedded in a higher dimensional Euclidean space. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) try to learn the distribution of the real images in the manifold to generate samples that look real. But the results of existing methods still exhibit many unpleasant artifacts and distortions even for the cases where the desired ground truth target images are available for supervised learning such as in single image super resolution (SISR). We probe for ways to alleviate these problems for supervised GANs in this paper. We explicitly apply the Lipschitz Continuity Condition (LCC) to regularize the GAN. An encoding network that maps the image space to a new optimal latent space is derived from the LCC, and it is used to augment the GAN as a coupling component. The LCC is also converted to new regularization terms in the generator loss function to enforce local invariance. The GAN is optimized together with the encoding network in an attempt to make the generator converge to a more ideal and disentangled mapping that can generate samples more faithful to the target images. When the proposed models are applied to the single image super resolution problem, the results outperform the state of the art."
A versatile anomaly detection method for medical images with a flow-based generative model in semi-supervision setting,"Oversight in medical images is a crucial problem, and timely reporting of medical images is desired. Therefore, an all-purpose anomaly detection method that can detect virtually all types of lesions/diseases in a given image is strongly desired. However, few commercially available and versatile anomaly detection methods for medical images have been provided so far. Recently, anomaly detection methods built upon deep learning methods have been rapidly growing in popularity, and these methods seem to provide reasonable solutions to the problem. However, the workload to label the images necessary for training in deep learning remains heavy. In this study, we present an anomaly detection method based on two trained flow-based generative models. With this method, the posterior probability can be computed as a normality metric for any given image. The training of the generative models requires two sets of images: a set containing only normal images and another set containing both normal and abnormal images without any labels. In the latter set, each sample does not have to be labeled as normal or abnormal; therefore, any mixture of images (e.g., all cases in a hospital) can be used as the dataset without cumbersome manual labeling. The method was validated with two types of medical images: chest X-ray radiographs (CXRs) and brain computed tomographies (BCTs). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves for logarithm posterior probabilities of CXRs (0.868 for pneumonia-like opacities) and BCTs (0.904 for infarction) were comparable to those in previous studies with other anomaly detection methods. This result showed the versatility of our method."
FD-GAN: Generative Adversarial Networks with Fusion-discriminator for Single Image Dehazing,"Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved great improvements in single image dehazing and attained much attention in research. Most existing learning-based dehazing methods are not fully end-to-end, which still follow the traditional dehazing procedure: first estimate the medium transmission and the atmospheric light, then recover the haze-free image based on the atmospheric scattering model. However, in practice, due to lack of priors and constraints, it is hard to precisely estimate these intermediate parameters. Inaccurate estimation further degrades the performance of dehazing, resulting in artifacts, color distortion and insufficient haze removal. To address this, we propose a fully end-to-end Generative Adversarial Networks with Fusion-discriminator (FD-GAN) for image dehazing. With the proposed Fusion-discriminator which takes frequency information as additional priors, our model can generator more natural and realistic dehazed images with less color distortion and fewer artifacts. Moreover, we synthesize a large-scale training dataset including various indoor and outdoor hazy images to boost the performance and we reveal that for learning-based dehazing methods, the performance is strictly influenced by the training data. Experiments have shown that our method reaches state-of-the-art performance on both public synthetic datasets and real-world images with more visually pleasing dehazed results."
Text-to-Image Generation with Attention Based Recurrent Neural Networks,"Conditional image modeling based on textual descriptions is a relatively new domain in unsupervised learning. Previous approaches use a latent variable model and generative adversarial networks. While the formers are approximated by using variational auto-encoders and rely on the intractable inference that can hamper their performance, the latter is unstable to train due to Nash equilibrium based objective function. We develop a tractable and stable caption-based image generation model. The model uses an attention-based encoder to learn word-to-pixel dependencies. A conditional autoregressive based decoder is used for learning pixel-to-pixel dependencies and generating images. Experimentations are performed on Microsoft COCO, and MNIST-with-captions datasets and performance is evaluated by using the Structural Similarity Index. Results show that the proposed model performs better than contemporary approaches and generate better quality images. Keywords: Generative image modeling, autoregressive image modeling, caption-based image generation, neural attention, recurrent neural networks."
CDGAN: Cyclic Discriminative Generative Adversarial Networks for Image-to-Image Transformation,"Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have facilitated a new direction to tackle the image-to-image transformation problem. Different GANs use generator and discriminator networks with different losses in the objective function. Still there is a gap to fill in terms of both the quality of the generated images and close to the ground truth images. In this work, we introduce a new Image-to-Image Transformation network named Cyclic Discriminative Generative Adversarial Networks (CDGAN) that fills the above mentioned gaps. The proposed CDGAN generates high quality and more realistic images by incorporating the additional discriminator networks for cycled images in addition to the original architecture of the CycleGAN. The proposed CDGAN is tested over three image-to-image transformation datasets. The quantitative and qualitative results are analyzed and compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The proposed CDGAN method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods when compared over the three baseline Image-to-Image transformation datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/KishanKancharagunta/CDGAN."
Can Giraffes Become Birds? An Evaluation of Image-to-image Translation for Data Generation,"There is an increasing interest in image-to-image translation with applications ranging from generating maps from satellite images to creating entire clothes' images from only contours. In the present work, we investigate image-to-image translation using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for generating new data, taking as a case study the morphing of giraffes images into bird images. Morphing a giraffe into a bird is a challenging task, as they have different scales, textures, and morphology. An unsupervised cross-domain translator entitled InstaGAN was trained on giraffes and birds, along with their respective masks, to learn translation between both domains. A dataset of synthetic bird images was generated using translation from originally giraffe images while preserving the original spatial arrangement and background. It is important to stress that the generated birds do not exist, being only the result of a latent representation learned by InstaGAN. Two subsets of common literature datasets were used for training the GAN and generating the translated images: COCO and Caltech-UCSD Birds 200-2011. To evaluate the realness and quality of the generated images and masks, qualitative and quantitative analyses were made. For the quantitative analysis, a pre-trained Mask R-CNN was used for the detection and segmentation of birds on Pascal VOC, Caltech-UCSD Birds 200-2011, and our new dataset entitled FakeSet. The generated dataset achieved detection and segmentation results close to the real datasets, suggesting that the generated images are realistic enough to be detected and segmented by a state-of-the-art deep neural network."
Spherical Image Generation from a Single Normal Field of View Image by Considering Scene Symmetry,"Spherical images taken in all directions (360 degrees) allow representing the surroundings of the subject and the space itself, providing an immersive experience to the viewers. Generating a spherical image from a single normal-field-of-view (NFOV) image is convenient and considerably expands the usage scenarios because there is no need to use a specific panoramic camera or take images from multiple directions; however, it is still a challenging and unsolved problem. The primary challenge is controlling the high degree of freedom involved in generating a wide area that includes the all directions of the desired plausible spherical image. On the other hand, scene symmetry is a basic property of the global structure of the spherical images, such as rotation symmetry, plane symmetry and asymmetry. We propose a method to generate spherical image from a single NFOV image, and control the degree of freedom of the generated regions using scene symmetry. We incorporate scene-symmetry parameters as latent variables into conditional variational autoencoders, following which we learn the conditional probability of spherical images for NFOV images and scene symmetry. Furthermore, the probability density functions are represented using neural networks, and scene symmetry is implemented using both circular shift and flip of the hidden variables. Our experiments show that the proposed method can generate various plausible spherical images, controlled from symmetric to asymmetric."
Deep OCT Angiography Image Generation for Motion Artifact Suppression,"Eye movements, blinking and other motion during the acquisition of optical coherence tomography (OCT) can lead to artifacts, when processed to OCT angiography (OCTA) images. Affected scans emerge as high intensity (white) or missing (black) regions, resulting in lost information. The aim of this research is to fill these gaps using a deep generative model for OCT to OCTA image translation relying on a single intact OCT scan. Therefore, a U-Net is trained to extract the angiographic information from OCT patches. At inference, a detection algorithm finds outlier OCTA scans based on their surroundings, which are then replaced by the trained network. We show that generative models can augment the missing scans. The augmented volumes could then be used for 3-D segmentation or increase the diagnostic value."
A Generalized Deep Learning Framework for Whole-Slide Image Segmentation and Analysis,"Histopathology tissue analysis is considered the gold standard in cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Given the large size of these images and the increase in the number of potential cancer cases, an automated solution as an aid to histopathologists is highly desirable. In the recent past, deep learning-based techniques have provided state of the art results in a wide variety of image analysis tasks, including analysis of digitized slides. However, the size of images and variability in histopathology tasks makes it a challenge to develop an integrated framework for histopathology image analysis. We propose a deep learning-based framework for histopathology tissue analysis. We demonstrate the generalizability of our framework, including training and inference, on several open-source datasets, which include CAMELYON (breast cancer metastases), DigestPath (colon cancer), and PAIP (liver cancer) datasets. We discuss multiple types of uncertainties pertaining to data and model, namely aleatoric and epistemic, respectively. Simultaneously, we demonstrate our model generalization across different data distribution by evaluating some samples on TCGA data. On CAMELYON16 test data (n=139) for the task of lesion detection, the FROC score achieved was 0.86 and in the CAMELYON17 test-data (n=500) for the task of pN-staging the Cohen's kappa score achieved was 0.9090 (third in the open leaderboard). On DigestPath test data (n=212) for the task of tumor segmentation, a Dice score of 0.782 was achieved (fourth in the challenge). On PAIP test data (n=40) for the task of viable tumor segmentation, a Jaccard Index of 0.75 (third in the challenge) was achieved, and for viable tumor burden, a score of 0.633 was achieved (second in the challenge). Our entire framework and related documentation are freely available at GitHub and PyPi."
"OneGAN: Simultaneous Unsupervised Learning of Conditional Image Generation, Foreground Segmentation, and Fine-Grained Clustering","We present a method for simultaneously learning, in an unsupervised manner, (i) a conditional image generator, (ii) foreground extraction and segmentation, (iii) clustering into a two-level class hierarchy, and (iv) object removal and background completion, all done without any use of annotation. The method combines a Generative Adversarial Network and a Variational Auto-Encoder, with multiple encoders, generators and discriminators, and benefits from solving all tasks at once. The input to the training scheme is a varied collection of unlabeled images from the same domain, as well as a set of background images without a foreground object. In addition, the image generator can mix the background from one image, with a foreground that is conditioned either on that of a second image or on the index of a desired cluster. The method obtains state of the art results in comparison to the literature methods, when compared to the current state of the art in each of the tasks."
Transfer Learning in General Lensless Imaging through Scattering Media,"Recently deep neural networks (DNNs) have been successfully introduced to the field of lensless imaging through scattering media. By solving an inverse problem in computational imaging, DNNs can overcome several shortcomings in the conventional lensless imaging through scattering media methods, namely, high cost, poor quality, complex control, and poor anti-interference. However, for training, a large number of training samples on various datasets have to be collected, with a DNN trained on one dataset generally performing poorly for recovering images from another dataset. The underlying reason is that lensless imaging through scattering media is a high dimensional regression problem and it is difficult to obtain an analytical solution. In this work, transfer learning is proposed to address this issue. Our main idea is to train a DNN on a relatively complex dataset using a large number of training samples and fine-tune the last few layers using very few samples from other datasets. Instead of the thousands of samples required to train from scratch, transfer learning alleviates the problem of costly data acquisition. Specifically, considering the difference in sample sizes and similarity among datasets, we propose two DNN architectures, namely LISMU-FCN and LISMU-OCN, and a balance loss function designed for balancing smoothness and sharpness. LISMU-FCN, with much fewer parameters, can achieve imaging across similar datasets while LISMU-OCN can achieve imaging across significantly different datasets. What's more, we establish a set of simulation algorithms which are close to the real experiment, and it is of great significance and practical value in the research on lensless scattering imaging. In summary, this work provides a new solution for lensless imaging through scattering media using transfer learning in DNNs."
Local Class-Specific and Global Image-Level Generative Adversarial Networks for Semantic-Guided Scene Generation,"In this paper, we address the task of semantic-guided scene generation. One open challenge in scene generation is the difficulty of the generation of small objects and detailed local texture, which has been widely observed in global image-level generation methods. To tackle this issue, in this work we consider learning the scene generation in a local context, and correspondingly design a local class-specific generative network with semantic maps as a guidance, which separately constructs and learns sub-generators concentrating on the generation of different classes, and is able to provide more scene details. To learn more discriminative class-specific feature representations for the local generation, a novel classification module is also proposed. To combine the advantage of both the global image-level and the local class-specific generation, a joint generation network is designed with an attention fusion module and a dual-discriminator structure embedded. Extensive experiments on two scene image generation tasks show superior generation performance of the proposed model. The state-of-the-art results are established by large margins on both tasks and on challenging public benchmarks. The source code and trained models are available at https://github.com/Ha0Tang/LGGAN."
Approximating Human Judgment of Generated Image Quality,"Generative models have made immense progress in recent years, particularly in their ability to generate high quality images. However, that quality has been difficult to evaluate rigorously, with evaluation dominated by heuristic approaches that do not correlate well with human judgment, such as the Inception Score and Fréchet Inception Distance. Real human labels have also been used in evaluation, but are inefficient and expensive to collect for each image. Here, we present a novel method to automatically evaluate images based on their quality as perceived by humans. By not only generating image embeddings from Inception network activations and comparing them to the activations for real images, of which other methods perform a variant, but also regressing the activation statistics to match gold standard human labels, we demonstrate 66% accuracy in predicting human scores of image realism, matching the human inter-rater agreement rate. Our approach also generalizes across generative models, suggesting the potential for capturing a model-agnostic measure of image quality. We open source our dataset of human labels for the advancement of research and techniques in this area."
Scalable Fine-grained Generated Image Classification Based on Deep Metric Learning,"Recently, generated images could reach very high quality, even human eyes could not tell them apart from real images. Although there are already some methods for detecting generated images in current forensic community, most of these methods are used to detect a single type of generated images. The new types of generated images are emerging one after another, and the existing detection methods cannot cope well. These problems prompted us to propose a scalable framework for multi-class classification based on deep metric learning, which aims to classify the generated images finer. In addition, we have increased the scalability of our framework to cope with the constant emergence of new types of generated images, and through fine-tuning to make the model obtain better detection performance on the new type of generated data."
CNN-generated images are surprisingly easy to spot... for now,"In this work we ask whether it is possible to create a ""universal"" detector for telling apart real images from these generated by a CNN, regardless of architecture or dataset used. To test this, we collect a dataset consisting of fake images generated by 11 different CNN-based image generator models, chosen to span the space of commonly used architectures today (ProGAN, StyleGAN, BigGAN, CycleGAN, StarGAN, GauGAN, DeepFakes, cascaded refinement networks, implicit maximum likelihood estimation, second-order attention super-resolution, seeing-in-the-dark). We demonstrate that, with careful pre- and post-processing and data augmentation, a standard image classifier trained on only one specific CNN generator (ProGAN) is able to generalize surprisingly well to unseen architectures, datasets, and training methods (including the just released StyleGAN2). Our findings suggest the intriguing possibility that today's CNN-generated images share some common systematic flaws, preventing them from achieving realistic image synthesis. Code and pre-trained networks are available at https://peterwang512.github.io/CNNDetection/ ."
Image Outpainting and Harmonization using Generative Adversarial Networks,"Although the inherently ambiguous task of predicting what resides beyond all four edges of an image has rarely been explored before, we demonstrate that GANs hold powerful potential in producing reasonable extrapolations. Two outpainting methods are proposed that aim to instigate this line of research: the first approach uses a context encoder inspired by common inpainting architectures and paradigms, while the second approach adds an extra post-processing step using a single-image generative model. This way, the hallucinated details are integrated with the style of the original image, in an attempt to further boost the quality of the result and possibly allow for arbitrary output resolutions to be supported."
Generalizing Deep Models for Overhead Image Segmentation Through Getis-Ord Gi* Pooling,"That most deep learning models are purely data driven is both a strength and a weakness. Given sufficient training data, the optimal model for a particular problem can be learned. However, this is usually not the case and so instead the model is either learned from scratch from a limited amount of training data or pre-trained on a different problem and then fine-tuned. Both of these situations are potentially suboptimal and limit the generalizability of the model. Inspired by this, we investigate methods to inform or guide deep learning models for geospatial image analysis to increase their performance when a limited amount of training data is available or when they are applied to scenarios other than which they were trained on. In particular, we exploit the fact that there are certain fundamental rules as to how things are distributed on the surface of the Earth and these rules do not vary substantially between locations. Based on this, we develop a novel feature pooling method for convolutional neural networks using Getis-Ord Gi* analysis from geostatistics. Experimental results show our proposed pooling function has significantly better generalization performance compared to a standard data-driven approach when applied to overhead image segmentation."
Destruction of Image Steganography using Generative Adversarial Networks,"Digital image steganalysis, or the detection of image steganography, has been studied in depth for years and is driven by Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups', such as APT37 Reaper, utilization of steganographic techniques to transmit additional malware to perform further post-exploitation activity on a compromised host. However, many steganalysis algorithms are constrained to work with only a subset of all possible images in the wild or are known to produce a high false positive rate. This results in blocking any suspected image being an unreasonable policy. A more feasible policy is to filter suspicious images prior to reception by the host machine. However, how does one optimally filter specifically to obfuscate or remove image steganography while avoiding degradation of visual image quality in the case that detection of the image was a false positive? We propose the Deep Digital Steganography Purifier (DDSP), a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) which is optimized to destroy steganographic content without compromising the perceptual quality of the original image. As verified by experimental results, our model is capable of providing a high rate of destruction of steganographic image content while maintaining a high visual quality in comparison to other state-of-the-art filtering methods. Additionally, we test the transfer learning capability of generalizing to to obfuscate real malware payloads embedded into different image file formats and types using an unseen steganographic algorithm and prove that our model can in fact be deployed to provide adequate results."
An Application of Generative Adversarial Networks for Super Resolution Medical Imaging,"Acquiring High Resolution (HR) Magnetic Resonance (MR) images requires the patient to remain still for long periods of time, which causes patient discomfort and increases the probability of motion induced image artifacts. A possible solution is to acquire low resolution (LR) images and to process them with the Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) to create an HR version. Acquiring LR images requires a lower scan time than acquiring HR images, which allows for higher patient comfort and scanner throughput. This work applies SRGAN to MR images of the prostate to improve the in-plane resolution by factors of 4 and 8. The term 'super resolution' in the context of this paper defines the post processing enhancement of medical images as opposed to 'high resolution' which defines native image resolution acquired during the MR acquisition phase. We also compare the SRGAN to three other models: SRCNN, SRResNet, and Sparse Representation. While the SRGAN results do not have the best Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) or Structural Similarity (SSIM) metrics, they are the visually most similar to the original HR images, as portrayed by the Mean Opinion Score (MOS) results."
Ambient Lighting Generation for Flash Images with Guided Conditional Adversarial Networks,"To cope with the challenges that low light conditions produce in images, photographers tend to use the light provided by the camera flash to get better illumination. Nevertheless, harsh shadows and non-uniform illumination can arise from using a camera flash, especially in low light conditions. Previous studies have focused on normalizing the lighting on flash images; however, to the best of our knowledge, no prior studies have examined the sideways shadows removal, reconstruction of overexposed areas, and the generation of synthetic ambient shadows or natural tone of scene objects. To provide more natural illumination on flash images and ensure high-frequency details, we propose a generative adversarial network in a guided conditional mode. We show that this approach not only generates natural illumination but also attenuates harsh shadows, simultaneously generating synthetic ambient shadows. Our approach achieves promising results on a custom FAID dataset, outperforming our baseline studies. We also analyze the components of our proposal and how they affect the overall performance and discuss the opportunities for future work."
CPGAN: Full-Spectrum Content-Parsing Generative Adversarial Networks for Text-to-Image Synthesis,"Typical methods for text-to-image synthesis seek to design effective generative architecture to model the text-to-image mapping directly. It is fairly arduous due to the cross-modality translation. In this paper we circumvent this problem by focusing on parsing the content of both the input text and the synthesized image thoroughly to model the text-to-image consistency in the semantic level. Particularly, we design a memory structure to parse the textual content by exploring semantic correspondence between each word in the vocabulary to its various visual contexts across relevant images during text encoding. Meanwhile, the synthesized image is parsed to learn its semantics in an object-aware manner. Moreover, we customize a conditional discriminator to model the fine-grained correlations between words and image sub-regions to push for the text-image semantic alignment. Extensive experiments on COCO dataset manifest that our model advances the state-of-the-art performance significantly (from 35.69 to 52.73 in Inception Score)."
Jointly Trained Image and Video Generation using Residual Vectors,"In this work, we propose a modeling technique for jointly training image and video generation models by simultaneously learning to map latent variables with a fixed prior onto real images and interpolate over images to generate videos. The proposed approach models the variations in representations using residual vectors encoding the change at each time step over a summary vector for the entire video. We utilize the technique to jointly train an image generation model with a fixed prior along with a video generation model lacking constraints such as disentanglement. The joint training enables the image generator to exploit temporal information while the video generation model learns to flexibly share information across frames. Moreover, experimental results verify our approach's compatibility with pre-training on videos or images and training on datasets containing a mixture of both. A comprehensive set of quantitative and qualitative evaluations reveal the improvements in sample quality and diversity over both video generation and image generation baselines. We further demonstrate the technique's capabilities of exploiting similarity in features across frames by applying it to a model based on decomposing the video into motion and content. The proposed model allows minor variations in content across frames while maintaining the temporal dependence through latent vectors encoding the pose or motion features."
Image Manipulation with Natural Language using Two-sidedAttentive Conditional Generative Adversarial Network,"Altering the content of an image with photo editing tools is a tedious task for an inexperienced user. Especially, when modifying the visual attributes of a specific object in an image without affecting other constituents such as background etc. To simplify the process of image manipulation and to provide more control to users, it is better to utilize a simpler interface like natural language. Therefore, in this paper, we address the challenge of manipulating images using natural language description. We propose the Two-sidEd Attentive conditional Generative Adversarial Network (TEA-cGAN) to generate semantically manipulated images while preserving other contents such as background intact. TEA-cGAN uses fine-grained attention both in the generator and discriminator of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based framework at different scales. Experimental results show that TEA-cGAN which generates 128x128 and 256x256 resolution images outperforms existing methods on CUB and Oxford-102 datasets both quantitatively and qualitatively."
Learning Canonical Representations for Scene Graph to Image Generation,"Generating realistic images of complex visual scenes becomes challenging when one wishes to control the structure of the generated images. Previous approaches showed that scenes with few entities can be controlled using scene graphs, but this approach struggles as the complexity of the graph (the number of objects and edges) increases. In this work, we show that one limitation of current methods is their inability to capture semantic equivalence in graphs. We present a novel model that addresses these issues by learning canonical graph representations from the data, resulting in improved image generation for complex visual scenes. Our model demonstrates improved empirical performance on large scene graphs, robustness to noise in the input scene graph, and generalization on semantically equivalent graphs. Finally, we show improved performance of the model on three different benchmarks: Visual Genome, COCO, and CLEVR."
C-Flow: Conditional Generative Flow Models for Images and 3D Point Clouds,"Flow-based generative models have highly desirable properties like exact log-likelihood evaluation and exact latent-variable inference, however they are still in their infancy and have not received as much attention as alternative generative models. In this paper, we introduce C-Flow, a novel conditioning scheme that brings normalizing flows to an entirely new scenario with great possibilities for multi-modal data modeling. C-Flow is based on a parallel sequence of invertible mappings in which a source flow guides the target flow at every step, enabling fine-grained control over the generation process. We also devise a new strategy to model unordered 3D point clouds that, in combination with the conditioning scheme, makes it possible to address 3D reconstruction from a single image and its inverse problem of rendering an image given a point cloud. We demonstrate our conditioning method to be very adaptable, being also applicable to image manipulation, style transfer and multi-modal image-to-image mapping in a diversity of domains, including RGB images, segmentation maps, and edge masks."
Asymmetric Generative Adversarial Networks for Image-to-Image Translation,"State-of-the-art models for unpaired image-to-image translation with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can learn the mapping from the source domain to the target domain using a cycle-consistency loss. The intuition behind these models is that if we translate from one domain to the other and back again we should arrive at where we started. However, existing methods always adopt a symmetric network architecture to learn both forward and backward cycles. Because of the task complexity and cycle input difference between the source and target image domains, the inequality in bidirectional forward-backward cycle translations is significant and the amount of information between two domains is different. In this paper, we analyze the limitation of the existing symmetric GAN models in asymmetric translation tasks, and propose an AsymmetricGAN model with both translation and reconstruction generators of unequal sizes and different parameter-sharing strategy to adapt to the asymmetric need in both unsupervised and supervised image-to-image translation tasks. Moreover, the training stage of existing methods has the common problem of model collapse that degrades the quality of the generated images, thus we explore different optimization losses for better training of AsymmetricGAN, and thus make image-to-image translation with higher consistency and better stability. Extensive experiments on both supervised and unsupervised generative tasks with several publicly available datasets demonstrate that the proposed AsymmetricGAN achieves superior model capacity and better generation performance compared with existing GAN models. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the asymmetric GAN framework on both unsupervised and supervised image-to-image translation tasks.

Cloud Removal in Satellite Images Using Spatiotemporal Generative Networks,"Satellite images hold great promise for continuous environmental monitoring and earth observation. Occlusions cast by clouds, however, can severely limit coverage, making ground information extraction more difficult. Existing pipelines typically perform cloud removal with simple temporal composites and hand-crafted filters. In contrast, we cast the problem of cloud removal as a conditional image synthesis challenge, and we propose a trainable spatiotemporal generator network (STGAN) to remove clouds. We train our model on a new large-scale spatiotemporal dataset that we construct, containing 97640 image pairs covering all continents. We demonstrate experimentally that the proposed STGAN model outperforms standard models and can generate realistic cloud-free images with high PSNR and SSIM values across a variety of atmospheric conditions, leading to improved performance in downstream tasks such as land cover classification."
Fast Image Caption Generation with Position Alignment,"Recent neural network models for image captioning usually employ an encoder-decoder architecture, where the decoder adopts a recursive sequence decoding way. However, such autoregressive decoding may result in sequential error accumulation and slow generation which limit the applications in practice. Non-autoregressive (NA) decoding has been proposed to cover these issues but suffers from language quality problem due to the indirect modeling of the target distribution. Towards that end, we propose an improved NA prediction framework to accelerate image captioning. Our decoding part consists of a position alignment to order the words that describe the content detected in the given image, and a fine non-autoregressive decoder to generate elegant descriptions. Furthermore, we introduce an inference strategy that regards position information as a latent variable to guide the further sentence generation. The Experimental results on public datasets show that our proposed model achieves better performance compared to general NA captioning models, while achieves comparable performance as autoregressive image captioning models with a significant speedup."
A Practical Solution for SAR Despeckling With Adversarial Learning Generated Speckled-to-Speckled Images,"In this letter, we aim to address a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) despeckling problem with the necessity of neither clean (speckle-free) SAR images nor independent speckled image pairs from the same scene, and a practical solution for SAR despeckling (PSD) is proposed. First, an adversarial learning framework is designed to generate speckled-to-speckled (S2S) image pairs from the same scene in the situation where only single speckled SAR images are available. Then, the S2S SAR image pairs are employed to train a modified despeckling Nested-UNet model using the Noise2Noise (N2N) strategy. Moreover, an iterative version of the PSD method (PSDi) is also presented. Experiments are conducted on both synthetic speckled and real SAR data to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods compared with several state-of-the-art methods. The results show that our methods can reach a good tradeoff between feature preservation and speckle suppression."
Unified Generative Adversarial Networks for Controllable Image-to-Image Translation,"We propose a unified Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for controllable image-to-image translation, i.e., transferring an image from a source to a target domain guided by controllable structures. In addition to conditioning on a reference image, we show how the model can generate images conditioned on controllable structures, e.g., class labels, object keypoints, human skeletons, and scene semantic maps. The proposed model consists of a single generator and a discriminator taking a conditional image and the target controllable structure as input. In this way, the conditional image can provide appearance information and the controllable structure can provide the structure information for generating the target result. Moreover, our model learns the image-to-image mapping through three novel losses, i.e., color loss, controllable structure guided cycle-consistency loss, and controllable structure guided self-content preserving loss. Also, we present the Fréchet ResNet Distance (FRD) to evaluate the quality of the generated images. Experiments on two challenging image translation tasks, i.e., hand gesture-to-gesture translation and cross-view image translation, show that our model generates convincing results, and significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on both tasks. Meanwhile, the proposed framework is a unified solution, thus it can be applied to solving other controllable structure guided image translation tasks such as landmark guided facial expression translation and keypoint guided person image generation. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to make one GAN framework work on all such controllable structure guided image translation tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/Ha0Tang/GestureGAN."
An Approach to Super-Resolution of Sentinel-2 Images Based on Generative Adversarial Networks,"This paper presents a generative adversarial network based super-resolution (SR) approach (which is called as S2GAN) to enhance the spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 spectral bands. The proposed approach consists of two main steps. The first step aims to increase the spatial resolution of the bands with 20m and 60m spatial resolutions by the scaling factors of 2 and 6, respectively. To this end, we introduce a generator network that performs SR on the lower resolution bands with the guidance of the bands associated to 10m spatial resolution by utilizing the convolutional layers with residual connections and a long skip-connection between inputs and outputs. The second step aims to distinguish SR bands from their ground truth bands. This is achieved by the proposed discriminator network, which alternately characterizes the high level features of the two sets of bands and applying binary classification on the extracted features. Then, we formulate the adversarial learning of the generator and discriminator networks as a min-max game. In this learning procedure, the generator aims to produce realistic SR bands as much as possible so that the discriminator incorrectly classifies SR bands. Experimental results obtained on different Sentinel-2 images show the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to both conventional and deep learning based SR approaches."
Towards Unsupervised Learning of Generative Models for 3D Controllable Image Synthesis,"In recent years, Generative Adversarial Networks have achieved impressive results in photorealistic image synthesis. This progress nurtures hopes that one day the classical rendering pipeline can be replaced by efficient models that are learned directly from images. However, current image synthesis models operate in the 2D domain where disentangling 3D properties such as camera viewpoint or object pose is challenging. Furthermore, they lack an interpretable and controllable representation. Our key hypothesis is that the image generation process should be modeled in 3D space as the physical world surrounding us is intrinsically three-dimensional. We define the new task of 3D controllable image synthesis and propose an approach for solving it by reasoning both in 3D space and in the 2D image domain. We demonstrate that our model is able to disentangle latent 3D factors of simple multi-object scenes in an unsupervised fashion from raw images. Compared to pure 2D baselines, it allows for synthesizing scenes that are consistent wrt. changes in viewpoint or object pose. We further evaluate various 3D representations in terms of their usefulness for this challenging task."
cFineGAN: Unsupervised multi-conditional fine-grained image generation,"We propose an unsupervised multi-conditional image generation pipeline: cFineGAN, that can generate an image conditioned on two input images such that the generated image preserves the texture of one and the shape of the other input. To achieve this goal, we extend upon the recently proposed work of FineGAN \citep{singh2018finegan} and make use of standard as well as shape-biased pre-trained ImageNet models. We demonstrate both qualitatively as well as quantitatively the benefit of using the shape-biased network. We present our image generation result across three benchmark datasets- CUB-200-2011, Stanford Dogs and UT Zappos50k."
DR-GAN: Conditional Generative Adversarial Network for Fine-Grained Lesion Synthesis on Diabetic Retinopathy Images,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a complication of diabetes that severely affects eyes. It can be graded into five levels of severity according to international protocol. However, optimizing a grading model to have strong generalizability requires a large amount of balanced training data, which is difficult to collect particularly for the high severity levels. Typical data augmentation methods, including random flipping and rotation, cannot generate data with high diversity. In this paper, we propose a diabetic retinopathy generative adversarial network (DR-GAN) to synthesize high-resolution fundus images which can be manipulated with arbitrary grading and lesion information. Thus, large-scale generated data can be used for more meaningful augmentation to train a DR grading and lesion segmentation model. The proposed retina generator is conditioned on the structural and lesion masks, as well as adaptive grading vectors sampled from the latent grading space, which can be adopted to control the synthesized grading severity. Moreover, a multi-scale spatial and channel attention module is devised to improve the generation ability to synthesize details. Multi-scale discriminators are designed to operate from large to small receptive fields, and joint adversarial losses are adopted to optimize the whole network in an end-to-end manner. With extensive experiments evaluated on the EyePACS dataset connected to Kaggle, as well as the FGADR dataset, we validate the effectiveness of our method, which can both synthesize highly realistic (1280 x 1280) controllable fundus images and contribute to the DR grading task."
Environment reconstruction on depth images using Generative Adversarial Networks,"Robust perception systems are essential for autonomous vehicle safety. To navigate in a complex urban environment, it is necessary precise sensors with reliable data. The task of understanding the surroundings is hard by itself; for intelligent vehicles, it is even more critical due to the high speed in which the vehicle navigates. To successfully navigate in an urban environment, the perception system must quickly receive, process, and execute an action to guarantee both passenger and pedestrian safety. Stereo cameras collect environment information at many levels, e.g., depth, color, texture, shape, which guarantee ample knowledge about the surroundings. Even so, when compared to human, computational methods lack the ability to deal with missing information, i.e., occlusions. For many perception tasks, this lack of data can be a hindrance due to the environment incomplete information. In this paper, we address this problem and discuss recent methods to deal with occluded areas inference. We then introduce a loss function focused on disparity and environment depth data reconstruction, and a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture able to deal with occluded information inference. Our results present a coherent reconstruction on depth maps, estimating regions occluded by different obstacles. Our final contribution is a loss function focused on disparity data and a GAN able to extract depth features and estimate depth data by inpainting disparity images."
Controlling Style and Semantics in Weakly-Supervised Image Generation,"We propose a weakly-supervised approach for conditional image generation of complex scenes where a user has fine control over objects appearing in the scene. We exploit sparse semantic maps to control object shapes and classes, as well as textual descriptions or attributes to control both local and global style. In order to condition our model on textual descriptions, we introduce a semantic attention module whose computational cost is independent of the image resolution. To further augment the controllability of the scene, we propose a two-step generation scheme that decomposes background and foreground. The label maps used to train our model are produced by a large-vocabulary object detector, which enables access to unlabeled data and provides structured instance information. In such a setting, we report better FID scores compared to fully-supervised settings where the model is trained on ground-truth semantic maps. We also showcase the ability of our model to manipulate a scene on complex datasets such as COCO and Visual Genome."
Generating Anthropomorphic Phantoms Using Fully Unsupervised Deformable Image Registration with Convolutional Neural Networks,"Objectives: Computerized phantoms play an essential role in various applications of medical imaging research. Although the existing computerized phantoms can model anatomical variations through organ and phantom scaling, this does not provide a way to fully reproduce anatomical variations seen in humans. However, having a population of phantoms that models the variations in patient anatomy and, in nuclear medicine, uptake realization is essential for comprehensive validation and training. In this work, we present a novel image registration method for creating highly anatomically detailed anthropomorphic phantoms from a single digital phantom. Methods: We propose a deep-learning-based registration algorithm to predict deformation parameters for warping an XCAT phantom to a patient CT scan. This proposed algorithm optimizes a novel SSIM-based objective function for a given image pair independently of the training data and thus is truly and fully unsupervised. We evaluate the proposed method on a publicly available low-dose CT dataset from TCIA. Results: The performance of the proposed model was compared with that of several state-of-the-art methods, and outperformed them by more than 8%, measured by the SSIM and less than 30%, by the MSE. Conclusion: A deep-learning-based unsupervised registration method was developed to create anthropomorphic phantoms while providing ""gold-standard"" anatomies that can be used as the basis for modeling organ properties. Significance: Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The resulting anthropomorphic phantom is highly realistic. Combined with realistic simulations of the image formation process, the generated phantoms could serve in many applications of medical imaging research."
PiiGAN: Generative Adversarial Networks for Pluralistic Image Inpainting,"The latest methods based on deep learning have achieved amazing results regarding the complex work of inpainting large missing areas in an image. But this type of method generally attempts to generate one single ""optimal"" result, ignoring many other plausible results. Considering the uncertainty of the inpainting task, one sole result can hardly be regarded as a desired regeneration of the missing area. In view of this weakness, which is related to the design of the previous algorithms, we propose a novel deep generative model equipped with a brand new style extractor which can extract the style feature (latent vector) from the ground truth. Once obtained, the extracted style feature and the ground truth are both input into the generator. We also craft a consistency loss that guides the generated image to approximate the ground truth. After iterations, our generator is able to learn the mapping of styles corresponding to multiple sets of vectors. The proposed model can generate a large number of results consistent with the context semantics of the image. Moreover, we evaluated the effectiveness of our model on three datasets, i.e., CelebA, PlantVillage, and MauFlex. Compared to state-of-the-art inpainting methods, this model is able to offer desirable inpainting results with both better quality and higher diversity. The code and model will be made available on https://github.com/vivitsai/PiiGAN."
Sparse-GAN: Sparsity-constrained Generative Adversarial Network for Anomaly Detection in Retinal OCT Image,"With the development of convolutional neural network, deep learning has shown its success for retinal disease detection from optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. However, deep learning often relies on large scale labelled data for training, which is oftentimes challenging especially for disease with low occurrence. Moreover, a deep learning system trained from data-set with one or a few diseases is unable to detect other unseen diseases, which limits the practical usage of the system in disease screening. To address the limitation, we propose a novel anomaly detection framework termed Sparsity-constrained Generative Adversarial Network (Sparse-GAN) for disease screening where only healthy data are available in the training set. The contributions of Sparse-GAN are two-folds: 1) The proposed Sparse-GAN predicts the anomalies in latent space rather than image-level; 2) Sparse-GAN is constrained by a novel Sparsity Regularization Net. Furthermore, in light of the role of lesions for disease screening, we present to leverage on an anomaly activation map to show the heatmap of lesions. We evaluate our proposed Sparse-GAN on a publicly available dataset, and the results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods."
AttentionGAN: Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation using Attention-Guided Generative Adversarial Networks,"State-of-the-art methods in image-to-image translation are capable of learning a mapping from a source domain to a target domain with unpaired image data. Though the existing methods have achieved promising results, they still produce visual artifacts, being able to translate low-level information but not high-level semantics of input images. One possible reason is that generators do not have the ability to perceive the most discriminative parts between the source and target domains, thus making the generated images low quality. In this paper, we propose a new Attention-Guided Generative Adversarial Networks (AttentionGAN) for the unpaired image-to-image translation task. AttentionGAN can identify the most discriminative foreground objects and minimize the change of the background. The attention-guided generators in AttentionGAN are able to produce attention masks, and then fuse the generation output with the attention masks to obtain high-quality target images. Accordingly, we also design a novel attention-guided discriminator which only considers attended regions. Extensive experiments are conducted on several generative tasks with eight public datasets, demonstrating that the proposed method is effective to generate sharper and more realistic images compared with existing competitive models. The code is available at https://github.com/Ha0Tang/AttentionGAN."
MixNMatch: Multifactor Disentanglement and Encoding for Conditional Image Generation,"We present MixNMatch, a conditional generative model that learns to disentangle and encode background, object pose, shape, and texture from real images with minimal supervision, for mix-and-match image generation. We build upon FineGAN, an unconditional generative model, to learn the desired disentanglement and image generator, and leverage adversarial joint image-code distribution matching to learn the latent factor encoders. MixNMatch requires bounding boxes during training to model background, but requires no other supervision. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate MixNMatch's ability to accurately disentangle, encode, and combine multiple factors for mix-and-match image generation, including sketch2color, cartoon2img, and img2gif applications. Our code/models/demo can be found at https://github.com/Yuheng-Li/MixNMatch"
Spectra2pix: Generating Nanostructure Images from Spectra,"The design of the nanostructures that are used in the field of nano-photonics has remained complex, very often relying on the intuition and expertise of the designer, ultimately limiting the reach and penetration of this groundbreaking approach. Recently, there has been an increasing number of studies suggesting to apply Machine Learning techniques for the design of nanostructures. Most of these studies engage Deep Learning techniques, which entails training a Deep Neural Network (DNN) to approximate the highly non-linear function of the underlying physical process between spectra and nanostructures. At the end of the training, the DNN allows an on-demand design of nanostructures, i.e. the model can infer nanostructure geometries for desired spectra. In this work, we introduce spectra2pix, which is a model DNN trained to generate 2D images of the designed nanostructures. Our model architecture is not limited to a closed set of nanostructure shapes, and can be trained for the design of any geometry. We show, for the first time, a successful generalization ability by designing a completely unseen sub-family of geometries. This generalization capability highlights the importance of our model architecture, and allows higher applicability for real-world design problems."
Fine-grained Attention and Feature-sharing Generative Adversarial Networks for Single Image Super-Resolution,"The traditional super-resolution methods that aim to minimize the mean square error usually produce the images with over-smoothed and blurry edges, due to the lose of high-frequency details. In this paper, we propose two novel techniques in the generative adversarial networks to produce photo-realistic images for image super-resolution. Firstly, instead of producing a single score to discriminate images between real and fake, we propose a variant, called Fine-grained Attention Generative Adversarial Network for image super-resolution (FASRGAN), to discriminate each pixel between real and fake. FASRGAN adopts a Unet-like network as the discriminator with two outputs: an image score and an image score map. The score map has the same spatial size as the HR/SR images, serving as the fine-grained attention to represent the degree of reconstruction difficulty for each pixel. Secondly, instead of using different networks for the generator and the discriminator in the SR problem, we use a feature-sharing network (Fs-SRGAN) for both the generator and the discriminator. By network sharing, certain information is shared between the generator and the discriminator, which in turn can improve the ability of producing high-quality images. Quantitative and visual comparisons with the state-of-the-art methods on the benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our methods. The application of super-resolution images to object recognition further proves that the proposed methods endow the power to reconstruction capabilities and the excellent super-resolution effects."
Injecting Prior Knowledge into Image Caption Generation,"Automatically generating natural language descriptions from an image is a challenging problem in artificial intelligence that requires a good understanding of the visual and textual signals and the correlations between them. The state-of-the-art methods in image captioning struggles to approach human level performance, especially when data is limited. In this paper, we propose to improve the performance of the state-of-the-art image captioning models by incorporating two sources of prior knowledge: (i) a conditional latent topic attention, that uses a set of latent variables (topics) as an anchor to generate highly probable words and, (ii) a regularization technique that exploits the inductive biases in syntactic and semantic structure of captions and improves the generalization of image captioning models. Our experiments validate that our method produces more human interpretable captions and also leads to significant improvements on the MSCOCO dataset in both the full and low data regimes."
Reinforcing an Image Caption Generator Using Off-Line Human Feedback,"Human ratings are currently the most accurate way to assess the quality of an image captioning model, yet most often the only used outcome of an expensive human rating evaluation is a few overall statistics over the evaluation dataset. In this paper, we show that the signal from instance-level human caption ratings can be leveraged to improve captioning models, even when the amount of caption ratings is several orders of magnitude less than the caption training data. We employ a policy gradient method to maximize the human ratings as rewards in an off-policy reinforcement learning setting, where policy gradients are estimated by samples from a distribution that focuses on the captions in a caption ratings dataset. Our empirical evidence indicates that the proposed method learns to generalize the human raters' judgments to a previously unseen set of images, as judged by a different set of human judges, and additionally on a different, multi-dimensional side-by-side human evaluation procedure."
Nonconvex Nonsmooth Low-Rank Minimization for Generalized Image Compressed Sensing via Group Sparse Representation,"Group sparse representation (GSR) based method has led to great successes in various image recovery tasks, which can be converted into a low-rank matrix minimization problem. As a widely used surrogate function of low-rank, the nuclear norm based convex surrogate usually leads to over-shrinking problem, since the standard soft-thresholding operator shrinks all singular values equally. To improve traditional sparse representation based image compressive sensing (CS) performance, we propose a generalized CS framework based on GSR model, which leads to a nonconvex nonsmooth low-rank minimization problem. The popular L_2-norm and M-estimator are employed for standard image CS and robust CS problem to fit the data respectively. For the better approximation of the rank of group-matrix, a family of nuclear norms are employed to address the over-shrinking problem. Moreover, we also propose a flexible and effective iteratively-weighting strategy to control the weighting and contribution of each singular value. Then we develop an iteratively reweighted nuclear norm algorithm for our generalized framework via an alternating direction method of multipliers framework, namely, GSR-AIR. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed CS framework can achieve favorable reconstruction performance compared with current state-of-the-art methods and the robust CS framework can suppress the outliers effectively."
DermGAN: Synthetic Generation of Clinical Skin Images with Pathology,"Despite the recent success in applying supervised deep learning to medical imaging tasks, the problem of obtaining large and diverse expert-annotated datasets required for the development of high performant models remains particularly challenging. In this work, we explore the possibility of using Generative Adverserial Networks (GAN) to synthesize clinical images with skin condition. We propose DermGAN, an adaptation of the popular Pix2Pix architecture, to create synthetic images for a pre-specified skin condition while being able to vary its size, location and the underlying skin color. We demonstrate that the generated images are of high fidelity using objective GAN evaluation metrics. In a Human Turing test, we note that the synthetic images are not only visually similar to real images, but also embody the respective skin condition in dermatologists' eyes. Finally, when using the synthetic images as a data augmentation technique for training a skin condition classifier, we observe that the model performs comparably to the baseline model overall while improving on rare but malignant conditions."
Constrained R-CNN: A general image manipulation detection model,"Recently, deep learning-based models have exhibited remarkable performance for image manipulation detection. However, most of them suffer from poor universality of handcrafted or predetermined features. Meanwhile, they only focus on manipulation localization and overlook manipulation classification. To address these issues, we propose a coarse-to-fine architecture named Constrained R-CNN for complete and accurate image forensics. First, the learnable manipulation feature extractor learns a unified feature representation directly from data. Second, the attention region proposal network effectively discriminates manipulated regions for the next manipulation classification and coarse localization. Then, the skip structure fuses low-level and high-level information to refine the global manipulation features. Finally, the coarse localization information guides the model to further learn the finer local features and segment out the tampered region. Experimental results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance. Especially, the F1 score is increased by 28.4%, 73.2%, 13.3% on the NIST16, COVERAGE, and Columbia dataset."
Estimation of Orientation and Camera Parameters from Cryo-Electron Microscopy Images with Variational Autoencoders and Generative Adversarial Networks,"Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is capable of producing reconstructed 3D images of biomolecules at near-atomic resolution. As such, it represents one of the most promising imaging techniques in structural biology. However, raw cryo-EM images are only highly corrupted - noisy and band-pass filtered - 2D projections of the target 3D biomolecules. Reconstructing the 3D molecular shape starts with the removal of image outliers, the estimation of the orientation of the biomolecule that has produced the given 2D image, and the estimation of camera parameters to correct for intensity defects. Current techniques performing these tasks are often computationally expensive, while the dataset sizes keep growing. There is a need for next-generation algorithms that preserve accuracy while improving speed and scalability. In this paper, we combine variational autoencoders (VAEs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to learn a low-dimensional latent representation of cryo-EM images. We perform an exploratory analysis of the obtained latent space, that is shown to have a structure of ""orbits"", in the sense of Lie group theory, consistent with the acquisition procedure of cryo-EM images. This analysis leads us to design an estimation method for orientation and camera parameters of single-particle cryo-EM images, together with an outliers detection procedure. As such, it opens the door to geometric approaches for unsupervised estimations of orientations and camera parameters, making possible fast cryo-EM biomolecule reconstruction."
VITON-GAN: Virtual Try-on Image Generator Trained with Adversarial Loss,"Generating a virtual try-on image from in-shop clothing images and a model person's snapshot is a challenging task because the human body and clothes have high flexibility in their shapes. In this paper, we develop a Virtual Try-on Generative Adversarial Network (VITON-GAN), that generates virtual try-on images using images of in-shop clothing and a model person. This method enhances the quality of the generated image when occlusion is present in a model person's image (e.g., arms crossed in front of the clothes) by adding an adversarial mechanism in the training pipeline."
Modeling Gestalt Visual Reasoning on the Raven's Progressive Matrices Intelligence Test Using Generative Image Inpainting Techniques,"Psychologists recognize Raven's Progressive Matrices as a very effective test of general human intelligence. While many computational models have been developed by the AI community to investigate different forms of top-down, deliberative reasoning on the test, there has been less research on bottom-up perceptual processes, like Gestalt image completion, that are also critical in human test performance. In this work, we investigate how Gestalt visual reasoning on the Raven's test can be modeled using generative image inpainting techniques from computer vision. We demonstrate that a self-supervised inpainting model trained only on photorealistic images of objects achieves a score of 27/36 on the Colored Progressive Matrices, which corresponds to average performance for nine-year-old children. We also show that models trained on other datasets (faces, places, and textures) do not perform as well. Our results illustrate how learning visual regularities in real-world images can translate into successful reasoning about artificial test stimuli. On the flip side, our results also highlight the limitations of such transfer, which may explain why intelligence tests like the Raven's are often sensitive to people's individual sociocultural backgrounds."
3D Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks to enable large-scale seismic image enhancement,"We propose GAN-based image enhancement models for frequency enhancement of 2D and 3D seismic images. Seismic imagery is used to understand and characterize the Earth's subsurface for energy exploration. Because these images often suffer from resolution limitations and noise contamination, our proposed method performs large-scale seismic volume frequency enhancement and denoising. The enhanced images reduce uncertainty and improve decisions about issues, such as optimal well placement, that often rely on low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) seismic volumes. We explored the impact of adding lithology class information to the models, resulting in improved performance on PSNR and SSIM metrics over a baseline model with no conditional information."
Fourier Spectrum Discrepancies in Deep Network Generated Images,"Advancements in deep generative models such as generative adversarial networks and variational autoencoders have resulted in the ability to generate realistic images that are visually indistinguishable from real images, which raises concerns about their potential malicious usage. In this paper, we present an analysis of the high-frequency Fourier modes of real and deep network generated images and show that deep network generated images share an observable, systematic shortcoming in replicating the attributes of these high-frequency modes. Using this, we propose a detection method based on the frequency spectrum of the images which is able to achieve an accuracy of up to 99.2% in classifying real and deep network generated images from various GAN and VAE architectures on a dataset of 5000 images with as few as 8 training examples. Furthermore, we show the impact of image transformations such as compression, cropping, and resolution reduction on the classification accuracy and suggest a method for modifying the high-frequency attributes of deep network generated images to mimic real images."
Question-Conditioned Counterfactual Image Generation for VQA,"While Visual Question Answering (VQA) models continue to push the state-of-the-art forward, they largely remain black-boxes - failing to provide insight into how or why an answer is generated. In this ongoing work, we propose addressing this shortcoming by learning to generate counterfactual images for a VQA model - i.e. given a question-image pair, we wish to generate a new image such that i) the VQA model outputs a different answer, ii) the new image is minimally different from the original, and iii) the new image is realistic. Our hope is that providing such counterfactual examples allows users to investigate and understand the VQA model's internal mechanisms."
Rotation Differential Invariants of Images Generated by Two Fundamental Differential Operators,"In this paper, we design two fundamental differential operators for the derivation of rotation differential invariants of images. Each differential invariant obtained by using the new method can be expressed as a homogeneous polynomial of image partial derivatives, which preserve their values when the image is rotated by arbitrary angles. We produce all possible instances of homogeneous invariants up to the given order and degree, and discuss the independence of them in detail. As far as we know, no previous papers have published so many explicit forms of high-order rotation differential invariants of images. In the experimental part, texture classification and image patch verification are carried out on popular real databases. These rotation differential invariants are used as image feature vector. We mainly evaluate the effects of various factors on the performance of them. The experimental results also validate that they have better performance than some commonly used image features in some cases."
Perception-oriented Single Image Super-Resolution via Dual Relativistic Average Generative Adversarial Networks,"The presence of residual and dense neural networks which greatly promotes the development of image Super-Resolution(SR) have witnessed a lot of impressive results. Depending on our observation, although more layers and connections could always improve performance, the increase of model parameters is not conducive to launch application of SR algorithms. Furthermore, algorithms supervised by L1/L2 loss can achieve considerable performance on traditional metrics such as PSNR and SSIM, yet resulting in blurry and over-smoothed outputs without sufficient high-frequency details, namely low perceptual index(PI). Regarding the issues, this paper develops a perception-oriented single image SR algorithm via dual relativistic average generative adversarial networks. In the generator part, a novel residual channel attention block is proposed to recalibrate significance of specific channels, further increasing feature expression capabilities. Parameters of convolutional layers within each block are shared to expand receptive fields while maintain the amount of tunable parameters unchanged. The feature maps are subsampled using sub-pixel convolution to obtain reconstructed high-resolution images. The discriminator part consists of two relativistic average discriminators that work in pixel domain and feature domain, respectively, fully exploiting the prior that half of data in a mini-batch are fake. Different weighted combinations of perceptual loss and adversarial loss are utilized to supervise the generator to equilibrate perceptual quality and objective results. Experimental results and ablation studies show that our proposed algorithm can rival state-of-the-art SR algorithms, both perceptually(PI-minimization) and objectively(PSNR-maximization) with fewer parameters."
Collapse Resistant Deep Convolutional GAN for Multi-Object Image Generation,"This work introduces a novel system for the generation of images that contain multiple classes of objects. Recent work in Generative Adversarial Networks have produced high quality images, but many focus on generating images of a single object or set of objects. Our system addresses the task of image generation conditioned on a list of desired classes to be included in a single image. This enables our system to generate images with any given combination of objects, all composed into a visually realistic natural image. The system learns the interrelationships of all classes represented in a dataset, and can generate diverse samples including a set of these classes. It displays the ability to arrange these objects together, accounting for occlusions and inter-object spatial relations that characterize complex natural images. To accomplish this, we introduce a novel architecture based on Conditional Deep Convolutional GANs that is stabilized against collapse relative to both mode and condition. The system learns to rectify mode collapse during training, self-correcting to avoid suboptimal generation modes."
This dataset does not exist: training models from generated images,"Current generative networks are increasingly proficient in generating high-resolution realistic images. These generative networks, especially the conditional ones, can potentially become a great tool for providing new image datasets. This naturally brings the question: Can we train a classifier only on the generated data? This potential availability of nearly unlimited amounts of training data challenges standard practices for training machine learning models, which have been crafted across the years for limited and fixed size datasets. In this work we investigate this question and its related challenges. We identify ways to improve significantly the performance over naive training on randomly generated images with regular heuristics. We propose three standalone techniques that can be applied at different stages of the pipeline, i.e., data generation, training on generated data, and deploying on real data. We evaluate our proposed approaches on a subset of the ImageNet dataset and show encouraging results compared to classifiers trained on real images."
"One Network to Segment Them All: A General, Lightweight System for Accurate 3D Medical Image Segmentation","Many recent medical segmentation systems rely on powerful deep learning models to solve highly specific tasks. To maximize performance, it is standard practice to evaluate numerous pipelines with varying model topologies, optimization parameters, pre- & postprocessing steps, and even model cascades. It is often not clear how the resulting pipeline transfers to different tasks. We propose a simple and thoroughly evaluated deep learning framework for segmentation of arbitrary medical image volumes. The system requires no task-specific information, no human interaction and is based on a fixed model topology and a fixed hyperparameter set, eliminating the process of model selection and its inherent tendency to cause method-level over-fitting. The system is available in open source and does not require deep learning expertise to use. Without task-specific modifications, the system performed better than or similar to highly specialized deep learning methods across 3 separate segmentation tasks. In addition, it ranked 5-th and 6-th in the first and second round of the 2018 Medical Segmentation Decathlon comprising another 10 tasks. The system relies on multi-planar data augmentation which facilitates the application of a single 2D architecture based on the familiar U-Net. Multi-planar training combines the parameter efficiency of a 2D fully convolutional neural network with a systematic train- and test-time augmentation scheme, which allows the 2D model to learn a representation of the 3D image volume that fosters generalization."
Cali-Sketch: Stroke Calibration and Completion for High-Quality Face Image Generation from Human-Like Sketches,"Image generation has received increasing attention because of its wide application in security and entertainment. Sketch-based face generation brings more fun and better quality of image generation due to supervised interaction. However, when a sketch poorly aligned with the true face is given as input, existing supervised image-to-image translation methods often cannot generate acceptable photo-realistic face images. To address this problem, in this paper we propose Cali-Sketch, a human-like-sketch to photo-realistic-image generation method. Cali-Sketch explicitly models stroke calibration and image generation using two constituent networks: a Stroke Calibration Network (SCN), which calibrates strokes of facial features and enriches facial details while preserving the original intent features; and an Image Synthesis Network (ISN), which translates the calibrated and enriched sketches to photo-realistic face images. In this way, we manage to decouple a difficult cross-domain translation problem into two easier steps. Extensive experiments verify that the face photos generated by Cali-Sketch are both photo-realistic and faithful to the input sketches, compared with state-of-the-art methods."
Image-Conditioned Graph Generation for Road Network Extraction,"Deep generative models for graphs have shown great promise in the area of drug design, but have so far found little application beyond generating graph-structured molecules. In this work, we demonstrate a proof of concept for the challenging task of road network extraction from image data. This task can be framed as image-conditioned graph generation, for which we develop the Generative Graph Transformer (GGT), a deep autoregressive model that makes use of attention mechanisms for image conditioning and the recurrent generation of graphs. We benchmark GGT on the application of road network extraction from semantic segmentation data. For this, we introduce the Toulouse Road Network dataset, based on real-world publicly-available data. We further propose the StreetMover distance: a metric based on the Sinkhorn distance for effectively evaluating the quality of road network generation. The code and dataset are publicly available."
Semantic Object Accuracy for Generative Text-to-Image Synthesis,"Generative adversarial networks conditioned on textual image descriptions are capable of generating realistic-looking images. However, current methods still struggle to generate images based on complex image captions from a heterogeneous domain. Furthermore, quantitatively evaluating these text-to-image models is challenging, as most evaluation metrics only judge image quality but not the conformity between the image and its caption. To address these challenges we introduce a new model that explicitly models individual objects within an image and a new evaluation metric called Semantic Object Accuracy (SOA) that specifically evaluates images given an image caption. The SOA uses a pre-trained object detector to evaluate if a generated image contains objects that are mentioned in the image caption, e.g. whether an image generated from ""a car driving down the street"" contains a car. We perform a user study comparing several text-to-image models and show that our SOA metric ranks the models the same way as humans, whereas other metrics such as the Inception Score do not. Our evaluation also shows that models which explicitly model objects outperform models which only model global image characteristics."
Structure Matters: Towards Generating Transferable Adversarial Images,"Recent works on adversarial examples for image classification focus on directly modifying pixels with minor perturbations. The small perturbation requirement is imposed to ensure the generated adversarial examples being natural and realistic to humans, which, however, puts a curb on the attack space thus limiting the attack ability and transferability especially for systems protected by a defense mechanism. In this paper, we propose the novel concepts of structure patterns and structure-aware perturbations that relax the small perturbation constraint while still keeping images natural. The key idea of our approach is to allow perceptible deviation in adversarial examples while keeping structure patterns that are central to a human classifier. Built upon these concepts, we propose a \emph{structure-preserving attack (SPA)} for generating natural adversarial examples with extremely high transferability. Empirical results on the MNIST and the CIFAR10 datasets show that SPA exhibits strong attack ability in both the white-box and black-box setting even defenses are applied. Moreover, with the integration of PGD or CW attack, its attack ability escalates sharply under the white-box setting, without losing the outstanding transferability inherited from SPA."
Cascaded Generation of High-quality Color Visible Face Images from Thermal Captures,"Generating visible-like face images from thermal images is essential to perform manual and automatic cross-spectrum face recognition. We successfully propose a solution based on cascaded refinement network that, unlike previous works, produces high quality generated color images without the need for face alignment, large databases, data augmentation, polarimetric sensors, computationally-intense training, or unrealistic restriction on the generated resolution. The training of our solution is based on the contextual loss, making it inherently scale (face area) and rotation invariant. We present generated image samples of unknown individuals under different poses and occlusion conditions.We also prove the high similarity in image quality between ground-truth images and generated ones by comparing seven quality metrics. We compare our results with two state-of-the-art approaches proving the superiority of our proposed approach."
Image Difficulty Curriculum for Generative Adversarial Networks (CuGAN),"Despite the significant advances in recent years, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are still notoriously hard to train. In this paper, we propose three novel curriculum learning strategies for training GANs. All strategies are first based on ranking the training images by their difficulty scores, which are estimated by a state-of-the-art image difficulty predictor. Our first strategy is to divide images into gradually more difficult batches. Our second strategy introduces a novel curriculum loss function for the discriminator that takes into account the difficulty scores of the real images. Our third strategy is based on sampling from an evolving distribution, which favors the easier images during the initial training stages and gradually converges to a uniform distribution, in which samples are equally likely, regardless of difficulty. We compare our curriculum learning strategies with the classic training procedure on two tasks: image generation and image translation. Our experiments indicate that all strategies provide faster convergence and superior results. For example, our best curriculum learning strategy applied on spectrally normalized GANs (SNGANs) fooled human annotators in thinking that generated CIFAR-like images are real in 25.0% of the presented cases, while the SNGANs trained using the classic procedure fooled the annotators in only 18.4% cases. Similarly, in image translation, the human annotators preferred the images produced by the Cycle-consistent GAN (CycleGAN) trained using curriculum learning in 40.5% cases and those produced by CycleGAN based on classic training in only 19.8% cases, 39.7% cases being labeled as ties."
Generative Adversarial Networks And Domain Adaptation For Training Data Independent Image Registration,"Medical image registration is an important task in automated analysis of multi-modal images and temporal data involving multiple patient visits. Conventional approaches, although useful for different image types, are time consuming. Of late, deep learning (DL) based image registration methods have been proposed that outperform traditional methods in terms of accuracy and time. However,DL based methods are heavily dependent on training data and do not generalize well when presented with images of different scanners or anatomies. We present a DL based approach that can perform medical image registration of one image type despite being trained with images of a different type. This is achieved by unsupervised domain adaptation in the registration process and allows for easier application to different datasets without extensive retraining.To achieve our objective we train a network that transforms the given input image pair to a latent feature space vector using autoencoders. The resultant encoded feature space is used to generate the registered images with the help of generative adversarial networks (GANs). This feature transformation ensures greater invariance to the input image type. Experiments on chest Xray, retinal and brain MR images show that our method, trained on one dataset gives better registration performance for other datasets, outperforming conventional methods that do not incorporate domain adaptation"
Enforcing Linearity in DNN succours Robustness and Adversarial Image Generation,"Recent studies on the adversarial vulnerability of neural networks have shown that models trained with the objective of minimizing an upper bound on the worst-case loss over all possible adversarial perturbations improve robustness against adversarial attacks. Beside exploiting adversarial training framework, we show that by enforcing a Deep Neural Network (DNN) to be linear in transformed input and feature space improves robustness significantly. We also demonstrate that by augmenting the objective function with Local Lipschitz regularizer boost robustness of the model further. Our method outperforms most sophisticated adversarial training methods and achieves state of the art adversarial accuracy on MNIST, CIFAR10 and SVHN dataset. In this paper, we also propose a novel adversarial image generation method by leveraging Inverse Representation Learning and Linearity aspect of an adversarially trained deep neural network classifier."
Transform the Set: Memory Attentive Generation of Guided and Unguided Image Collages,"Cutting and pasting image segments feels intuitive: the choice of source templates gives artists flexibility in recombining existing source material. Formally, this process takes an image set as input and outputs a collage of the set elements. Such selection from sets of source templates does not fit easily in classical convolutional neural models requiring inputs of fixed size. Inspired by advances in attention and set-input machine learning, we present a novel architecture that can generate in one forward pass image collages of source templates using set-structured representations. This paper has the following contributions: (i) a novel framework for image generation called Memory Attentive Generation of Image Collages (MAGIC) which gives artists new ways to create digital collages; (ii) from the machine-learning perspective, we show a novel Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) architecture that uses Set-Transformer layers and set-pooling to blend sets of random image samples - a hybrid non-parametric approach."
Parameter-Transferred Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (PT-WGAN) for Low-Dose PET Image Denoising,"Due to the widespread use of positron emission tomography (PET) in clinical practice, the potential risk of PET-associated radiation dose to patients needs to be minimized. However, with the reduction in the radiation dose, the resultant images may suffer from noise and artifacts that compromise diagnostic performance. In this paper, we propose a parameter-transferred Wasserstein generative adversarial network (PT-WGAN) for low-dose PET image denoising. The contributions of this paper are twofold: i) a PT-WGAN framework is designed to denoise low-dose PET images without compromising structural details, and ii) a task-specific initialization based on transfer learning is developed to train PT-WGAN using trainable parameters transferred from a pretrained model, which significantly improves the training efficiency of PT-WGAN. The experimental results on clinical data show that the proposed network can suppress image noise more effectively while preserving better image fidelity than recently published state-of-the-art methods. We make our code available at https://github.com/90n9-yu/PT-WGAN."
A Method to Generate Synthetically Warped Document Image,"The digital camera captured document images may often be warped and distorted due to different camera angles or document surfaces. A robust technique is needed to solve this kind of distortion. The research on dewarping of the document suffers due to the limited availability of benchmark public dataset. In recent times, deep learning based approaches are used to solve the problems accurately. To train most of the deep neural networks a large number of document images is required and generating such a large volume of document images manually is difficult. In this paper, we propose a technique to generate a synthetic warped image from a flat-bedded scanned document image. It is done by calculating warping factors for each pixel position using two warping position parameters (WPP) and eight warping control parameters (WCP). These parameters can be specified as needed depending upon the desired warping. The results are compared with similar real captured images both qualitative and quantitative way."
Restoration of marker occluded hematoxylin and eosin stained whole slide histology images using generative adversarial networks,"It is common for pathologists to annotate specific regions of the tissue, such as tumor, directly on the glass slide with markers. Although this practice was helpful prior to the advent of histology whole slide digitization, it often occludes important details which are increasingly relevant to immuno-oncology due to recent advancements in digital pathology imaging techniques. The current work uses a generative adversarial network with cycle loss to remove these annotations while still maintaining the underlying structure of the tissue by solving an image-to-image translation problem. We train our network on up to 300 whole slide images with marker inks and show that 70% of the corrected image patches are indistinguishable from originally uncontaminated image tissue to a human expert. This portion increases 97% when we replace the human expert with a deep residual network. We demonstrated the fidelity of the method to the original image by calculating the correlation between image gradient magnitudes. We observed a revival of up to 94,000 nuclei per slide in our dataset, the majority of which were located on tissue border."
Direct Energy-resolving CT Imaging via Energy-integrating CT images using a Unified Generative Adversarial Network,"Energy-resolving computed tomography (ErCT) has the ability to acquire energy-dependent measurements simultaneously and quantitative material information with improved contrast-to-noise ratio. Meanwhile, ErCT imaging system is usually equipped with an advanced photon counting detector, which is expensive and technically complex. Therefore, clinical ErCT scanners are not yet commercially available, and they are in various stage of completion. This makes the researchers less accessible to the ErCT images. In this work, we investigate to produce ErCT images directly from existing energy-integrating CT (EiCT) images via deep neural network. Specifically, different from other networks that produce ErCT images at one specific energy, this model employs a unified generative adversarial network (uGAN) to concurrently train EiCT datasets and ErCT datasets with different energies and then performs image-to-image translation from existing EiCT images to multiple ErCT image outputs at various energy bins. In this study, the present uGAN generates ErCT images at 70keV, 90keV, 110keV, and 130keV simultaneously from EiCT images at140kVp. We evaluate the present uGAN model on a set of over 1380 CT image slices and show that the present uGAN model can produce promising ErCT estimation results compared with the ground truth qualitatively and quantitatively."
Generative Image Translation for Data Augmentation in Colorectal Histopathology Images,"We present an image translation approach to generate augmented data for mitigating data imbalances in a dataset of histopathology images of colorectal polyps, adenomatous tumors that can lead to colorectal cancer if left untreated. By applying cycle-consistent generative adversarial networks (CycleGANs) to a source domain of normal colonic mucosa images, we generate synthetic colorectal polyp images that belong to diagnostically less common polyp classes. Generated images maintain the general structure of their source image but exhibit adenomatous features that can be enhanced with our proposed filtration module, called Path-Rank-Filter. We evaluate the quality of generated images through Turing tests with four gastrointestinal pathologists, finding that at least two of the four pathologists could not identify generated images at a statistically significant level. Finally, we demonstrate that using CycleGAN-generated images to augment training data improves the AUC of a convolutional neural network for detecting sessile serrated adenomas by over 10%, suggesting that our approach might warrant further research for other histopathology image classification tasks."
Image Generation and Recognition (Emotions),"Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) were proposed in 2014 by Goodfellow et al., and have since been extended into multiple computer vision applications. This report provides a thorough survey of recent GAN research, outlining the various architectures and applications, as well as methods for training GANs and dealing with latent space. This is followed by a discussion of potential areas for future GAN research, including: evaluating GANs, better understanding GANs, and techniques for training GANs. The second part of this report outlines the compilation of a dataset of images `in the wild' representing each of the 7 basic human emotions, and analyses experiments done when training a StarGAN on this dataset combined with the FER2013 dataset."
Explaining image classifiers by removing input features using generative models,"Perturbation-based explanation methods often measure the contribution of an input feature to an image classifier's outputs by heuristically removing it via e.g. blurring, adding noise, or graying out, which often produce unrealistic, out-of-samples. Instead, we propose to integrate a generative inpainter into three representative attribution methods to remove an input feature. Our proposed change improved all three methods in (1) generating more plausible counterfactual samples under the true data distribution; (2) being more accurate according to three metrics: object localization, deletion, and saliency metrics; and (3) being more robust to hyperparameter changes. Our findings were consistent across both ImageNet and Places365 datasets and two different pairs of classifiers and inpainters."
Text-to-Image Synthesis Based on Machine Generated Captions,"Text to Image Synthesis refers to the process of automatic generation of a photo-realistic image starting from a given text and is revolutionizing many real-world applications. In order to perform such process it is necessary to exploit datasets containing captioned images, meaning that each image is associated with one (or more) captions describing it. Despite the abundance of uncaptioned images datasets, the number of captioned datasets is limited. To address this issue, in this paper we propose an approach capable of generating images starting from a given text using conditional GANs trained on uncaptioned images dataset. In particular, uncaptioned images are fed to an Image Captioning Module to generate the descriptions. Then, the GAN Module is trained on both the input image and the machine-generated caption. To evaluate the results, the performance of our solution is compared with the results obtained by the unconditional GAN. For the experiments, we chose to use the uncaptioned dataset LSUN bedroom. The results obtained in our study are preliminary but still promising."
Automated Enriched Medical Concept Generation for Chest X-ray Images,"Decision support tools that rely on supervised learning require large amounts of expert annotations. Using past radiological reports obtained from hospital archiving systems has many advantages as training data above manual single-class labels: they are expert annotations available in large quantities, covering a population-representative variety of pathologies, and they provide additional context to pathology diagnoses, such as anatomical location and severity. Learning to auto-generate such reports from images present many challenges such as the difficulty in representing and generating long, unstructured textual information, accounting for spelling errors and repetition/redundancy, and the inconsistency across different annotators. We therefore propose to first learn visually-informative medical concepts from raw reports, and, using the concept predictions as image annotations, learn to auto-generate structured reports directly from images. We validate our approach on the OpenI [2] chest x-ray dataset, which consists of frontal and lateral views of chest x-ray images, their corresponding raw textual reports and manual medical subject heading (MeSH ) annotations made by radiologists."
Generating Relevant Counter-Examples from a Positive Unlabeled Dataset for Image Classification,"With surge of available but unlabeled data, Positive Unlabeled (PU) learning is becoming a thriving challenge. This work deals with this demanding task for which recent GAN-based PU approaches have demonstrated promising results. Generative adversarial Networks (GANs) are not hampered by deterministic bias or need for specific dimensionality. However, existing GAN-based PU approaches also present some drawbacks such as sensitive dependence to prior knowledge, a cumbersome architecture or first-stage overfitting. To settle these issues, we propose to incorporate a biased PU risk within the standard GAN discriminator loss function. In this manner, the discriminator is constrained to request the generator to converge towards the unlabeled samples distribution while diverging from the positive samples distribution. This enables the proposed model, referred to as D-GAN, to exclusively learn the counter-examples distribution without prior knowledge. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art PU methods without prior by overcoming their issues."
Incremental learning for the detection and classification of GAN-generated images,"Current developments in computer vision and deep learning allow to automatically generate hyper-realistic images, hardly distinguishable from real ones. In particular, human face generation achieved a stunning level of realism, opening new opportunities for the creative industry but, at the same time, new scary scenarios where such content can be maliciously misused. Therefore, it is essential to develop innovative methodologies to automatically tell apart real from computer generated multimedia, possibly able to follow the evolution and continuous improvement of data in terms of quality and realism. In the last few years, several deep learning-based solutions have been proposed for this problem, mostly based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Although results are good in controlled conditions, it is not clear how such proposals can adapt to real-world scenarios, where learning needs to continuously evolve as new types of generated data appear. In this work, we tackle this problem by proposing an approach based on incremental learning for the detection and classification of GAN-generated images. Experiments on a dataset comprising images generated by several GAN-based architectures show that the proposed method is able to correctly perform discrimination when new GANs are presented to the network"
Improvement of Multiparametric MR Image Segmentation by Augmenting the Data with Generative Adversarial Networks for Glioma Patients,"Every year thousands of patients are diagnosed with a glioma, a type of malignant brain tumor. Physicians use MR images as a key tool in the diagnosis and treatment of these patients. Neural networks show great potential to aid physicians in the medical image analysis. This study investigates the use of varying amounts of synthetic brain T1-weighted (T1), post-contrast T1-weighted (T1Gd), T2-weighted (T2), and T2 Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) MR images created by a generative adversarial network to overcome the lack of annotated medical image data in training separate 2D U-Nets to segment enhancing tumor, peritumoral edema, and necrosis (non-enhancing tumor core) regions on gliomas. These synthetic MR images were assessed quantitively (SSIM=0.79) and qualitatively by a physician who found that the synthetic images seem stronger for delineation of structural boundaries but struggle more when gradient is significant, (e.g. edema signal in T2 modalities). Multiple 2D U-Nets were trained with original BraTS data and differing subsets of a quarter, half, three-quarters, and all synthetic MR images. There was not an obvious correlation between the improvement of values of the metrics in separate validation dataset for each structure and amount of synthetic data added, there is a strong correlation between the amount of synthetic data added and the number of best overall validation metrics. In summary, this study showed ability to generate high quality synthetic Flair, T2, T1, and T1CE MR images using the GAN. Using the synthetic MR images showed encouraging results to improve the U-Net segmentation performance which has the potential to address the scarcity of readily available medical images."
Unsupervised Generative 3D Shape Learning from Natural Images,"In this paper we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first method to learn a generative model of 3D shapes from natural images in a fully unsupervised way. For example, we do not use any ground truth 3D or 2D annotations, stereo video, and ego-motion during the training. Our approach follows the general strategy of Generative Adversarial Networks, where an image generator network learns to create image samples that are realistic enough to fool a discriminator network into believing that they are natural images. In contrast, in our approach the image generation is split into 2 stages. In the first stage a generator network outputs 3D objects. In the second, a differentiable renderer produces an image of the 3D objects from random viewpoints. The key observation is that a realistic 3D object should yield a realistic rendering from any plausible viewpoint. Thus, by randomizing the choice of the viewpoint our proposed training forces the generator network to learn an interpretable 3D representation disentangled from the viewpoint. In this work, a 3D representation consists of a triangle mesh and a texture map that is used to color the triangle surface by using the UV-mapping technique. We provide analysis of our learning approach, expose its ambiguities and show how to overcome them. Experimentally, we demonstrate that our method can learn realistic 3D shapes of faces by using only the natural images of the FFHQ dataset."
DSRGAN: Explicitly Learning Disentangled Representation of Underlying Structure and Rendering for Image Generation without Tuple Supervision,"We focus on explicitly learning disentangled representation for natural image generation, where the underlying spatial structure and the rendering on the structure can be independently controlled respectively, yet using no tuple supervision. The setting is significant since tuple supervision is costly and sometimes even unavailable. However, the task is highly unconstrained and thus ill-posed. To address this problem, we propose to introduce an auxiliary domain which shares a common underlying-structure space with the target domain, and we make a partially shared latent space assumption. The key idea is to encourage the partially shared latent variable to represent the similar underlying spatial structures in both domains, while the two domain-specific latent variables will be unavoidably arranged to present renderings of two domains respectively. This is achieved by designing two parallel generative networks with a common Progressive Rendering Architecture (PRA), which constrains both generative networks' behaviors to model shared underlying structure and to model spatially dependent relation between rendering and underlying structure. Thus, we propose DSRGAN (GANs for Disentangling Underlying Structure and Rendering) to instantiate our method. We also propose a quantitative criterion (the Normalized Disentanglability) to quantify disentanglability. Comparison to the state-of-the-art methods shows that DSRGAN can significantly outperform them in disentanglability."
Self-Paced Video Data Augmentation with Dynamic Images Generated by Generative Adversarial Networks,"There is an urgent need for an effective video classification method by means of a small number of samples. The deficiency of samples could be effectively alleviated by generating samples through Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), but the generation of videos on a typical category remains to be underexplored since the complex actions and the changeable viewpoints are difficult to simulate. In this paper, we propose a generative data augmentation method for temporal stream of the Temporal Segment Networks with the dynamic image. The dynamic image compresses the motion information of video into a still image, removing the interference factors such as the background. Thus it is easier to generate images with categorical motion information using GAN. We use the generated dynamic images to enhance the features, with regularization achieved as well, thereby to achieve the effect of video augmentation. In order to deal with the uneven quality of generated images, we propose a Self-Paced Selection (SPS) method, which automatically selects the high-quality generated samples to be added to the network training. Our method is verified on two benchmark datasets, HMDB51 and UCF101. The experimental results show that the method can improve the accuracy of video classification under the circumstance of sample insufficiency and sample imbalance."
Deeply Matting-based Dual Generative Adversarial Network for Image and Document Label Supervision,"Although many methods have been proposed to deal with nature image super-resolution (SR) and get impressive performance, the text images SR is not good due to their ignorance of document images. In this paper, we propose a matting-based dual generative adversarial network (mdGAN) for document image SR. Firstly, the input image is decomposed into document text, foreground and background layers using deep image matting. Then two parallel branches are constructed to recover text boundary information and color information respectively. Furthermore, in order to improve the restoration accuracy of characters in output image, we use the input image's corresponding ground truth text label as extra supervise information to refine the two-branch networks during training. Experiments on real text images demonstrate that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively."
mustGAN: Multi-Stream Generative Adversarial Networks for MR Image Synthesis,"Multi-contrast MRI protocols increase the level of morphological information available for diagnosis. Yet, the number and quality of contrasts is limited in practice by various factors including scan time and patient motion. Synthesis of missing or corrupted contrasts can alleviate this limitation to improve clinical utility. Common approaches for multi-contrast MRI involve either one-to-one and many-to-one synthesis methods. One-to-one methods take as input a single source contrast, and they learn a latent representation sensitive to unique features of the source. Meanwhile, many-to-one methods receive multiple distinct sources, and they learn a shared latent representation more sensitive to common features across sources. For enhanced image synthesis, here we propose a multi-stream approach that aggregates information across multiple source images via a mixture of multiple one-to-one streams and a joint many-to-one stream. The shared feature maps generated in the many-to-one stream and the complementary feature maps generated in the one-to-one streams are combined with a fusion block. The location of the fusion block is adaptively modified to maximize task-specific performance. Qualitative and quantitative assessments on T1-, T2-, PD-weighted and FLAIR images clearly demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method compared to previous state-of-the-art one-to-one and many-to-one methods."
Analysis of Generalized Entropies in Mutual Information Medical Image Registration,"Mutual information (MI) is the standard method used in image registration and the most studied one but can diverge and produce wrong results when used in an automated manner. In this study we compared the results of the ITK Mattes MI function, used in 3D Slicer and ITK derived software solutions, and our own MICUDA Shannon and Tsallis MI functions under the translation, rotation and scale transforms in a 3D mathematical space. This comparison allows to understand why registration fails in some circumstances and how to produce a more robust automated algorithm to register medical images. Since our algorithms were designed to use GPU computations we also have a huge gain in speed while improving the quality of registration."
Generating Geological Facies Models with Fidelity to Diversity and Statistics of Training Images using Improved Generative Adversarial Networks,"This paper presents a methodology and workflow that overcome the limitations of the conventional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for geological facies modeling. It attempts to improve the training stability and guarantee the diversity of the generated geology through interpretable latent vectors. The resulting samples are ensured to have the equal probability (or an unbiased distribution) as from the training dataset. This is critical when applying GANs to generate unbiased and representative geological models that can be further used to facilitate objective uncertainty evaluation and optimal decision-making in oil field exploration and development.  We proposed and implemented a new variant of GANs called Info-WGAN for the geological facies modeling that combines Information Maximizing Generative Adversarial Network (InfoGAN) with Wasserstein distance and Gradient Penalty (GP) for learning interpretable latent codes as well as generating stable and unbiased distribution from the training data. Different from the original GAN design, InfoGAN can use the training images with full, partial, or no labels to perform disentanglement of the complex sedimentary types exhibited in the training dataset to achieve the variety and diversity of the generated samples. This is accomplished by adding additional categorical variables that provide disentangled semantic representations besides the mere randomized latent vector used in the original GANs. By such means, a regularization term is used to maximize the mutual information between such latent categorical codes and the generated geological facies in the loss function.  Furthermore, the resulting unbiased sampling by Info-WGAN makes the data conditioning much easier than the conventional GANs in geological modeling because of the variety and diversity as well as the equal probability of the unconditional sampling by the generator."
Variational Conditional GAN for Fine-grained Controllable Image Generation,"In this paper, we propose a novel variational generator framework for conditional GANs to catch semantic details for improving the generation quality and diversity. Traditional generators in conditional GANs simply concatenate the conditional vector with the noise as the input representation, which is directly employed for upsampling operations. However, the hidden condition information is not fully exploited, especially when the input is a class label. Therefore, we introduce a variational inference into the generator to infer the posterior of latent variable only from the conditional input, which helps achieve a variable augmented representation for image generation. Qualitative and quantitative experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches and achieves the realistic controllable images."
Learning Visual Relation Priors for Image-Text Matching and Image Captioning with Neural Scene Graph Generators,"Grounding language to visual relations is critical to various language-and-vision applications. In this work, we tackle two fundamental language-and-vision tasks: image-text matching and image captioning, and demonstrate that neural scene graph generators can learn effective visual relation features to facilitate grounding language to visual relations and subsequently improve the two end applications. By combining relation features with the state-of-the-art models, our experiments show significant improvement on the standard Flickr30K and MSCOCO benchmarks. Our experimental results and analysis show that relation features improve downstream models' capability of capturing visual relations in end vision-and-language applications. We also demonstrate the importance of learning scene graph generators with visually relevant relations to the effectiveness of relation features."
IntersectGAN: Learning Domain Intersection for Generating Images with Multiple Attributes,"Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have demonstrated great success in generating various visual content. However, images generated by existing GANs are often of attributes (e.g., smiling expression) learned from one image domain. As a result, generating images of multiple attributes requires many real samples possessing multiple attributes which are very resource expensive to be collected. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN, namely IntersectGAN, to learn multiple attributes from different image domains through an intersecting architecture. For example, given two image domains X_1 and X_2 with certain attributes, the intersection X_1 \cap X_2 denotes a new domain where images possess the attributes from both X_1 and X_2 domains. The proposed IntersectGAN consists of two discriminators D_1 and D_2 to distinguish between generated and real samples of different domains, and three generators where the intersection generator is trained against both discriminators. And an overall adversarial loss function is defined over three generators. As a result, our proposed IntersectGAN can be trained on multiple domains of which each presents one specific attribute, and eventually eliminates the need of real sample images simultaneously possessing multiple attributes. By using the CelebFaces Attributes dataset, our proposed IntersectGAN is able to produce high quality face images possessing multiple attributes (e.g., a face with black hair and a smiling expression). Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations are conducted to compare our proposed IntersectGAN with other baseline methods. Besides, several different applications of IntersectGAN have been explored with promising results."
Controllable Text-to-Image Generation,"In this paper, we propose a novel controllable text-to-image generative adversarial network (ControlGAN), which can effectively synthesise high-quality images and also control parts of the image generation according to natural language descriptions. To achieve this, we introduce a word-level spatial and channel-wise attention-driven generator that can disentangle different visual attributes, and allow the model to focus on generating and manipulating subregions corresponding to the most relevant words. Also, a word-level discriminator is proposed to provide fine-grained supervisory feedback by correlating words with image regions, facilitating training an effective generator which is able to manipulate specific visual attributes without affecting the generation of other content. Furthermore, perceptual loss is adopted to reduce the randomness involved in the image generation, and to encourage the generator to manipulate specific attributes required in the modified text. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state of the art, and is able to effectively manipulate synthetic images using natural language descriptions. Code is available at https://github.com/mrlibw/ControlGAN."
Coupling Rendering and Generative Adversarial Networks for Artificial SAS Image Generation,"Acquisition of Synthetic Aperture Sonar (SAS) datasets is bottlenecked by the costly deployment of SAS imaging systems, and even when data acquisition is possible,the data is often skewed towards containing barren seafloor rather than objects of interest. We present a novel pipeline, called SAS GAN, which couples an optical renderer with a generative adversarial network (GAN) to synthesize realistic SAS images of targets on the seafloor. This coupling enables high levels of SAS image realism while enabling control over image geometry and parameters. We demonstrate qualitative results by presenting examples of images created with our pipeline. We also present quantitative results through the use of t-SNE and the Fréchet Inception Distance to argue that our generated SAS imagery potentially augments SAS datasets more effectively than an off-the-shelf GAN."
Reinforcing Medical Image Classifier to Improve Generalization on Small Datasets,"With the advents of deep learning, improved image classification with complex discriminative models has been made possible. However, such deep models with increased complexity require a huge set of labeled samples to generalize the training. Such classification models can easily overfit when applied for medical images because of limited training data, which is a common problem in the field of medical image analysis. This paper proposes and investigates a reinforced classifier for improving the generalization under a few available training data. Partially following the idea of reinforcement learning, the proposed classifier uses a generalization-feedback from a subset of the training data to update its parameter instead of only using the conventional cross-entropy loss about the training data. We evaluate the improvement of the proposed classifier by applying it on three different classification problems against the standard deep classifiers equipped with existing overfitting-prevention techniques. Besides an overall improvement in classification performance, the proposed classifier showed remarkable characteristics of generalized learning, which can have great potential in medical classification tasks."
Compositional Generalization in Image Captioning,"Image captioning models are usually evaluated on their ability to describe a held-out set of images, not on their ability to generalize to unseen concepts. We study the problem of compositional generalization, which measures how well a model composes unseen combinations of concepts when describing images. State-of-the-art image captioning models show poor generalization performance on this task. We propose a multi-task model to address the poor performance, that combines caption generation and image--sentence ranking, and uses a decoding mechanism that re-ranks the captions according their similarity to the image. This model is substantially better at generalizing to unseen combinations of concepts compared to state-of-the-art captioning models."
Neural Naturalist: Generating Fine-Grained Image Comparisons,"We introduce the new Birds-to-Words dataset of 41k sentences describing fine-grained differences between photographs of birds. The language collected is highly detailed, while remaining understandable to the everyday observer (e.g., ""heart-shaped face,"" ""squat body""). Paragraph-length descriptions naturally adapt to varying levels of taxonomic and visual distance---drawn from a novel stratified sampling approach---with the appropriate level of detail. We propose a new model called Neural Naturalist that uses a joint image encoding and comparative module to generate comparative language, and evaluate the results with humans who must use the descriptions to distinguish real images.  Our results indicate promising potential for neural models to explain differences in visual embedding space using natural language, as well as a concrete path for machine learning to aid citizen scientists in their effort to preserve biodiversity."
Stack-VS: Stacked Visual-Semantic Attention for Image Caption Generation,"Recently, automatic image caption generation has been an important focus of the work on multimodal translation task. Existing approaches can be roughly categorized into two classes, i.e., top-down and bottom-up, the former transfers the image information (called as visual-level feature) directly into a caption, and the later uses the extracted words (called as semanticlevel attribute) to generate a description. However, previous methods either are typically based one-stage decoder or partially utilize part of visual-level or semantic-level information for image caption generation. In this paper, we address the problem and propose an innovative multi-stage architecture (called as Stack-VS) for rich fine-gained image caption generation, via combining bottom-up and top-down attention models to effectively handle both visual-level and semantic-level information of an input image. Specifically, we also propose a novel well-designed stack decoder model, which is constituted by a sequence of decoder cells, each of which contains two LSTM-layers work interactively to re-optimize attention weights on both visual-level feature vectors and semantic-level attribute embeddings for generating a fine-gained image caption. Extensive experiments on the popular benchmark dataset MSCOCO show the significant improvements on different evaluation metrics, i.e., the improvements on BLEU-4/CIDEr/SPICE scores are 0.372, 1.226 and 0.216, respectively, as compared to the state-of-the-arts."
A Novel Loss Function Incorporating Imaging Acquisition Physics for PET Attenuation Map Generation using Deep Learning,"In PET/CT imaging, CT is used for PET attenuation correction (AC). Mismatch between CT and PET due to patient body motion results in AC artifacts. In addition, artifact caused by metal, beam-hardening and count-starving in CT itself also introduces inaccurate AC for PET. Maximum likelihood reconstruction of activity and attenuation (MLAA) was proposed to solve those issues by simultaneously reconstructing tracer activity (λ-MLAA) and attenuation map (μ-MLAA) based on the PET raw data only. However, μ-MLAA suffers from high noise and λ-MLAA suffers from large bias as compared to the reconstruction using the CT-based attenuation map (μ-CT). Recently, a convolutional neural network (CNN) was applied to predict the CT attenuation map (μ-CNN) from λ-MLAA and μ-MLAA, in which an image-domain loss (IM-loss) function between the μ-CNN and the ground truth μ-CT was used. However, IM-loss does not directly measure the AC errors according to the PET attenuation physics, where the line-integral projection of the attenuation map (μ) along the path of the two annihilation events, instead of the μ itself, is used for AC. Therefore, a network trained with the IM-loss may yield suboptimal performance in the μ generation. Here, we propose a novel line-integral projection loss (LIP-loss) function that incorporates the PET attenuation physics for μ generation. Eighty training and twenty testing datasets of whole-body 18F-FDG PET and paired ground truth μ-CT were used. Quantitative evaluations showed that the model trained with the additional LIP-loss was able to significantly outperform the model trained solely based on the IM-loss function."
Lund jet images from generative and cycle-consistent adversarial networks,"We introduce a generative model to simulate radiation patterns within a jet using the Lund jet plane. We show that using an appropriate neural network architecture with a stochastic generation of images, it is possible to construct a generative model which retrieves the underlying two-dimensional distribution to within a few percent. We compare our model with several alternative state-of-the-art generative techniques. Finally, we show how a mapping can be created between different categories of jets, and use this method to retroactively change simulation settings or the underlying process on an existing sample. These results provide a framework for significantly reducing simulation times through fast inference of the neural network as well as for data augmentation of physical measurements."
Few-Shot Generalization for Single-Image 3D Reconstruction via Priors,"Recent work on single-view 3D reconstruction shows impressive results, but has been restricted to a few fixed categories where extensive training data is available. The problem of generalizing these models to new classes with limited training data is largely open. To address this problem, we present a new model architecture that reframes single-view 3D reconstruction as learnt, category agnostic refinement of a provided, category-specific prior. The provided prior shape for a novel class can be obtained from as few as one 3D shape from this class. Our model can start reconstructing objects from the novel class using this prior without seeing any training image for this class and without any retraining. Our model outperforms category-agnostic baselines and remains competitive with more sophisticated baselines that finetune on the novel categories. Additionally, our network is capable of improving the reconstruction given multiple views despite not being trained on task of multi-view reconstruction."
Systematic Analysis of Image Generation using GANs,"Generative Adversarial Networks have been crucial in the developments made in unsupervised learning in recent times. Exemplars of image synthesis from text or other images, these networks have shown remarkable improvements over conventional methods in terms of performance. Trained on the adversarial training philosophy, these networks aim to estimate the potential distribution from the real data and then use this as input to generate the synthetic data. Based on this fundamental principle, several frameworks can be generated that are paragon implementations in several real-life applications such as art synthesis, generation of high resolution outputs and synthesis of images from human drawn sketches, to name a few. While theoretically GANs present better results and prove to be an improvement over conventional methods in many factors, the implementation of these frameworks for dedicated applications remains a challenge. This study explores and presents a taxonomy of these frameworks and their use in various image to image synthesis and text to image synthesis applications. The basic GANs, as well as a variety of different niche frameworks, are critically analyzed. The advantages of GANs for image generation over conventional methods as well their disadvantages amongst other frameworks are presented. The future applications of GANs in industries such as healthcare, art and entertainment are also discussed."
Flexible Conditional Image Generation of Missing Data with Learned Mental Maps,"Real-world settings often do not allow acquisition of high-resolution volumetric images for accurate morphological assessment and diagnostic. In clinical practice it is frequently common to acquire only sparse data (e.g. individual slices) for initial diagnostic decision making. Thereby, physicians rely on their prior knowledge (or mental maps) of the human anatomy to extrapolate the underlying 3D information. Accurate mental maps require years of anatomy training, which in the first instance relies on normative learning, i.e. excluding pathology. In this paper, we leverage Bayesian Deep Learning and environment mapping to generate full volumetric anatomy representations from none to a small, sparse set of slices. We evaluate proof of concept implementations based on Generative Query Networks (GQN) and Conditional BRUNO using abdominal CT and brain MRI as well as in a clinical application involving sparse, motion-corrupted MR acquisition for fetal imaging. Our approach allows to reconstruct 3D volumes from 1 to 4 tomographic slices, with a SSIM of 0.7+ and cross-correlation of 0.8+ compared to the 3D ground truth."
Generator evaluator-selector net for panoptic image segmentation and splitting unfamiliar objects into parts,"In machine learning and other fields, suggesting a good solution to a problem is usually a harder task than evaluating the quality of such a solution. This asymmetry is the basis for a large number of selection oriented methods that use a generator system to guess a set of solutions and an evaluator system to rank and select the best solutions. This work examines the use of this approach to the problem of panoptic image segmentation and class agnostic parts segmentation. The generator/evaluator approach for this case consists of two independent convolutional neural nets: a generator net that suggests variety segments corresponding to objects, stuff and parts regions in the image, and an evaluator net that chooses the best segments to be merged into the segmentation map. The result is a trial and error evolutionary approach in which a generator that guesses segments with low average accuracy, but with wide variability, can still produce good results when coupled with an accurate evaluator. The generator consists of a Pointer net that receives an image and a point in the image, and predicts the region of the segment containing the point. Generating and evaluating each segment separately is essential in this case since it demands exponentially fewer guesses compared to a system that guesses and evaluates the full segmentation map in each try. The classification of the selected segments is done by an independent region-specific classification net. This allows the segmentation to be class agnostic and hence, capable of segmenting unfamiliar categories that were not part of the training set. The method was examined on the COCO Panoptic segmentation benchmark and gave results comparable to those of the basic semantic segmentation and Mask-RCNN methods. In addition, the system was used for the task of splitting objects of unseen classes (that did not appear in the training set) into parts."
Generating High-Resolution Fashion Model Images Wearing Custom Outfits,"Visualizing an outfit is an essential part of shopping for clothes. Due to the combinatorial aspect of combining fashion articles, the available images are limited to a pre-determined set of outfits. In this paper, we broaden these visualizations by generating high-resolution images of fashion models wearing a custom outfit under an input body pose. We show that our approach can not only transfer the style and the pose of one generated outfit to another, but also create realistic images of human bodies and garments."
Blind Image Deconvolution using Pretrained Generative Priors,"This paper proposes a novel approach to regularize the ill-posed blind image deconvolution (blind image deblurring) problem using deep generative networks. We employ two separate deep generative models - one trained to produce sharp images while the other trained to generate blur kernels from lower dimensional parameters. To deblur, we propose an alternating gradient descent scheme operating in the latent lower-dimensional space of each of the pretrained generative models. Our experiments show excellent deblurring results even under large blurs and heavy noise. To improve the performance on rich image datasets not well learned by the generative networks, we present a modification of the proposed scheme that governs the deblurring process under both generative and classical priors."
Boundless: Generative Adversarial Networks for Image Extension,"Image extension models have broad applications in image editing, computational photography and computer graphics. While image inpainting has been extensively studied in the literature, it is challenging to directly apply the state-of-the-art inpainting methods to image extension as they tend to generate blurry or repetitive pixels with inconsistent semantics. We introduce semantic conditioning to the discriminator of a generative adversarial network (GAN), and achieve strong results on image extension with coherent semantics and visually pleasing colors and textures. We also show promising results in extreme extensions, such as panorama generation."
Learning Fixed Points in Generative Adversarial Networks: From Image-to-Image Translation to Disease Detection and Localization,"Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have ushered in a revolution in image-to-image translation. The development and proliferation of GANs raises an interesting question: can we train a GAN to remove an object, if present, from an image while otherwise preserving the image? Specifically, can a GAN ""virtually heal"" anyone by turning his medical image, with an unknown health status (diseased or healthy), into a healthy one, so that diseased regions could be revealed by subtracting those two images? Such a task requires a GAN to identify a minimal subset of target pixels for domain translation, an ability that we call fixed-point translation, which no GAN is equipped with yet. Therefore, we propose a new GAN, called Fixed-Point GAN, trained by (1) supervising same-domain translation through a conditional identity loss, and (2) regularizing cross-domain translation through revised adversarial, domain classification, and cycle consistency loss. Based on fixed-point translation, we further derive a novel framework for disease detection and localization using only image-level annotation. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state of the art in multi-domain image-to-image translation and that it surpasses predominant weakly-supervised localization methods in both disease detection and localization. Implementation is available at https://github.com/jlianglab/Fixed-Point-GAN."
Models Genesis: Generic Autodidactic Models for 3D Medical Image Analysis,"Transfer learning from natural image to medical image has established as one of the most practical paradigms in deep learning for medical image analysis. However, to fit this paradigm, 3D imaging tasks in the most prominent imaging modalities (e.g., CT and MRI) have to be reformulated and solved in 2D, losing rich 3D anatomical information and inevitably compromising the performance. To overcome this limitation, we have built a set of models, called Generic Autodidactic Models, nicknamed Models Genesis, because they are created ex nihilo (with no manual labeling), self-taught (learned by self-supervision), and generic (served as source models for generating application-specific target models). Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our Models Genesis significantly outperform learning from scratch in all five target 3D applications covering both segmentation and classification. More importantly, learning a model from scratch simply in 3D may not necessarily yield performance better than transfer learning from ImageNet in 2D, but our Models Genesis consistently top any 2D approaches including fine-tuning the models pre-trained from ImageNet as well as fine-tuning the 2D versions of our Models Genesis, confirming the importance of 3D anatomical information and significance of our Models Genesis for 3D medical imaging. This performance is attributed to our unified self-supervised learning framework, built on a simple yet powerful observation: the sophisticated yet recurrent anatomy in medical images can serve as strong supervision signals for deep models to learn common anatomical representation automatically via self-supervision. As open science, all pre-trained Models Genesis are available at https://github.com/MrGiovanni/ModelsGenesis."
Fully Automated Image De-fencing using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks,"Image de-fencing is one of the important aspects of recreational photography in which the objective is to remove the fence texture present in an image and generate an aesthetically pleasing version of the same image without the fence texture. In this paper, we aim to develop an automated and effective technique for fence removal and image reconstruction using conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs). These networks have been successfully applied in several domains of Computer Vision focusing on image generation and rendering. Our initial approach is based on a two-stage architecture involving two cGANs that generate the fence mask and the inpainted image, respectively. Training of these networks is carried out independently and, during evaluation, the input image is passed through the two generators in succession to obtain the de-fenced image. The results obtained from this approach are satisfactory, but the response time is long since the image has to pass through two sets of convolution layers. To reduce the response time, we propose a second approach involving only a single cGAN architecture that is trained using the ground-truth of fenced de-fenced image pairs along with the edge map of the fenced image produced by the Canny Filter. Incorporation of the edge map helps the network to precisely detect the edges present in the input image, and also imparts it an ability to carry out high quality de-fencing in an efficient manner, even in the presence of a fewer number of layers as compared to the two-stage network. Qualitative and quantitative experimental results reported in the manuscript reveal that the de-fenced images generated by the single-stage de-fencing network have similar visual quality to those produced by the two-stage network. Comparative performance analysis also emphasizes the effectiveness of our approach over state-of-the-art image de-fencing techniques."
RankSRGAN: Generative Adversarial Networks with Ranker for Image Super-Resolution,"Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have demonstrated the potential to recover realistic details for single image super-resolution (SISR). To further improve the visual quality of super-resolved results, PIRM2018-SR Challenge employed perceptual metrics to assess the perceptual quality, such as PI, NIQE, and Ma. However, existing methods cannot directly optimize these indifferentiable perceptual metrics, which are shown to be highly correlated with human ratings. To address the problem, we propose Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks with Ranker (RankSRGAN) to optimize generator in the direction of perceptual metrics. Specifically, we first train a Ranker which can learn the behavior of perceptual metrics and then introduce a novel rank-content loss to optimize the perceptual quality. The most appealing part is that the proposed method can combine the strengths of different SR methods to generate better results. Extensive experiments show that RankSRGAN achieves visually pleasing results and reaches state-of-the-art performance in perceptual metrics.

Neural Re-Simulation for Generating Bounces in Single Images,"We introduce a method to generate videos of dynamic virtual objects plausibly interacting via collisions with a still image's environment. Given a starting trajectory, physically simulated with the estimated geometry of a single, static input image, we learn to 'correct' this trajectory to a visually plausible one via a neural network. The neural network can then be seen as learning to 'correct' traditional simulation output, generated with incomplete and imprecise world information, to obtain context-specific, visually plausible re-simulated output, a process we call neural re-simulation. We train our system on a set of 50k synthetic scenes where a virtual moving object (ball) has been physically simulated. We demonstrate our approach on both our synthetic dataset and a collection of real-life images depicting everyday scenes, obtaining consistent improvement over baseline alternatives throughout."
Unpaired Cross-lingual Image Caption Generation with Self-Supervised Rewards,"Generating image descriptions in different languages is essential to satisfy users worldwide. However, it is prohibitively expensive to collect large-scale paired image-caption dataset for every target language which is critical for training descent image captioning models. Previous works tackle the unpaired cross-lingual image captioning problem through a pivot language, which is with the help of paired image-caption data in the pivot language and pivot-to-target machine translation models. However, such language-pivoted approach suffers from inaccuracy brought by the pivot-to-target translation, including disfluency and visual irrelevancy errors. In this paper, we propose to generate cross-lingual image captions with self-supervised rewards in the reinforcement learning framework to alleviate these two types of errors. We employ self-supervision from mono-lingual corpus in the target language to provide fluency reward, and propose a multi-level visual semantic matching model to provide both sentence-level and concept-level visual relevancy rewards. We conduct extensive experiments for unpaired cross-lingual image captioning in both English and Chinese respectively on two widely used image caption corpora. The proposed approach achieves significant performance improvement over state-of-the-art methods."
SkrGAN: Sketching-rendering Unconditional Generative Adversarial Networks for Medical Image Synthesis,"Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have the capability of synthesizing images, which have been successfully applied to medical image synthesis tasks. However, most of existing methods merely consider the global contextual information and ignore the fine foreground structures, e.g., vessel, skeleton, which may contain diagnostic indicators for medical image analysis. Inspired by human painting procedure, which is composed of stroking and color rendering steps, we propose a Sketching-rendering Unconditional Generative Adversarial Network (SkrGAN) to introduce a sketch prior constraint to guide the medical image generation. In our SkrGAN, a sketch guidance module is utilized to generate a high quality structural sketch from random noise, then a color render mapping is used to embed the sketch-based representations and resemble the background appearances. Experimental results show that the proposed SkrGAN achieves the state-of-the-art results in synthesizing images for various image modalities, including retinal color fundus, X-Ray, Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). In addition, we also show that the performances of medical image segmentation method have been improved by using our synthesized images as data augmentation."
Semi-Supervised Self-Growing Generative Adversarial Networks for Image Recognition,"Image recognition is an important topic in computer vision and image processing, and has been mainly addressed by supervised deep learning methods, which need a large set of labeled images to achieve promising performance. However, in most cases, labeled data are expensive or even impossible to obtain, while unlabeled data are readily available from numerous free on-line resources and have been exploited to improve the performance of deep neural networks. To better exploit the power of unlabeled data for image recognition, in this paper, we propose a semi-supervised and generative approach, namely the semi-supervised self-growing generative adversarial network (SGGAN). Label inference is a key step for the success of semi-supervised learning approaches. There are two main problems in label inference: how to measure the confidence of the unlabeled data and how to generalize the classifier. We address these two problems via the generative framework and a novel convolution-block-transformation technique, respectively. To stabilize and speed up the training process of SGGAN, we employ the metric Maximum Mean Discrepancy as the feature matching objective function and achieve larger gain than the standard semi-supervised GANs (SSGANs), narrowing the gap to the supervised methods. Experiments on several benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed SGGAN on image recognition and facial attribute recognition tasks. By using the training data with only 4% labeled facial attributes, the SGGAN approach can achieve comparable accuracy with leading supervised deep learning methods with all labeled facial attributes."
Towards Generating Stylized Image Captions via Adversarial Training,"While most image captioning aims to generate objective descriptions of images, the last few years have seen work on generating visually grounded image captions which have a specific style (e.g., incorporating positive or negative sentiment). However, because the stylistic component is typically the last part of training, current models usually pay more attention to the style at the expense of accurate content description. In addition, there is a lack of variability in terms of the stylistic aspects. To address these issues, we propose an image captioning model called ATTEND-GAN which has two core components: first, an attention-based caption generator to strongly correlate different parts of an image with different parts of a caption; and second, an adversarial training mechanism to assist the caption generator to add diverse stylistic components to the generated captions. Because of these components, ATTEND-GAN can generate correlated captions as well as more human-like variability of stylistic patterns. Our system outperforms the state-of-the-art as well as a collection of our baseline models. A linguistic analysis of the generated captions demonstrates that captions generated using ATTEND-GAN have a wider range of stylistic adjectives and adjective-noun pairs."
Addressing Data Bias Problems for Chest X-ray Image Report Generation,"Automatic medical report generation from chest X-ray images is one possibility for assisting doctors to reduce their workload. However, the different patterns and data distribution of normal and abnormal cases can bias machine learning models. Previous attempts did not focus on isolating the generation of the abnormal and normal sentences in order to increase the variability of generated paragraphs. To address this, we propose to separate abnormal and normal sentence generation by using two different word LSTMs in a hierarchical LSTM model. We conduct an analysis on the distinctiveness of generated sentences compared to the BLEU score, which increases when less distinct reports are generated. We hope our findings will help to encourage the development of new metrics to better verify methods of automatic medical report generation."
Visual-Relation Conscious Image Generation from Structured-Text,"We propose an end-to-end network for image generation from given structured-text that consists of the visual-relation layout module and the pyramid of GANs, namely stacking-GANs. Our visual-relation layout module uses relations among entities in the structured-text in two ways: comprehensive usage and individual usage. We comprehensively use all available relations together to localize initial bounding-boxes of all the entities. We also use individual relation separately to predict from the initial bounding-boxes relation-units for all the relations in the input text. We then unify all the relation-units to produce the visual-relation layout, i.e., bounding-boxes for all the entities so that each of them uniquely corresponds to each entity while keeping its involved relations. Our visual-relation layout reflects the scene structure given in the input text. The stacking-GANs is the stack of three GANs conditioned on the visual-relation layout and the output of previous GAN, consistently capturing the scene structure. Our network realistically renders entities' details in high resolution while keeping the scene structure. Experimental results on two public datasets show outperformances of our method against state-of-the-art methods."
A principled approach for generating adversarial images under non-smooth dissimilarity metrics,"Deep neural networks perform well on real world data but are prone to adversarial perturbations: small changes in the input easily lead to misclassification. In this work, we propose an attack methodology not only for cases where the perturbations are measured by \ell_p norms, but in fact any adversarial dissimilarity metric with a closed proximal form. This includes, but is not limited to, \ell_1, \ell_2, and \ell_\infty perturbations; the \ell_0 counting ""norm"" (i.e. true sparseness); and the total variation seminorm, which is a (non-\ell_p) convolutional dissimilarity measuring local pixel changes. Our approach is a natural extension of a recent adversarial attack method, and eliminates the differentiability requirement of the metric. We demonstrate our algorithm, ProxLogBarrier, on the MNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet-1k datasets. We consider undefended and defended models, and show that our algorithm easily transfers to various datasets. We observe that ProxLogBarrier outperforms a host of modern adversarial attacks specialized for the \ell_0 case. Moreover, by altering images in the total variation seminorm, we shed light on a new class of perturbations that exploit neighboring pixel information."
High Accuracy Tumor Diagnoses and Benchmarking of Hematoxylin and Eosin Stained Prostate Core Biopsy Images Generated by Explainable Deep Neural Networks,"Histopathological diagnoses of tumors in tissue biopsy after Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining is the gold standard for oncology care. H&E staining is slow and uses dyes, reagents and precious tissue samples that cannot be reused. Thousands of native nonstained RGB Whole Slide Image (RWSI) patches of prostate core tissue biopsies were registered with their H&E stained versions. Conditional Generative Adversarial Neural Networks (cGANs) that automate conversion of native nonstained RWSI to computational H&E stained images were then trained. High similarities between computational and H&E dye stained images with Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) 0.902, Pearsons Correlation Coefficient (CC) 0.962 and Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) 22.821 dB were calculated. A second cGAN performed accurate computational destaining of H&E dye stained images back to their native nonstained form with SSIM 0.9, CC 0.963 and PSNR 25.646 dB. A single-blind study computed more than 95% pixel-by-pixel overlap between prostate tumor annotations on computationally stained images, provided by five-board certified MD pathologists, with those on H&E dye stained counterparts. We report the first visualization and explanation of neural network kernel activation maps during H&E staining and destaining of RGB images by cGANs. High similarities between kernel activation maps of computational and H&E stained images (Mean-Squared Errors <0.0005) provide additional mathematical and mechanistic validation of the staining system. Our neural network framework thus is automated, explainable and performs high precision H&E staining and destaining of low cost native RGB images, and is computer vision and physician authenticated for rapid and accurate tumor diagnoses."
Cycle In Cycle Generative Adversarial Networks for Keypoint-Guided Image Generation,"In this work, we propose a novel Cycle In Cycle Generative Adversarial Network (C^2GAN) for the task of keypoint-guided image generation. The proposed C^2GAN is a cross-modal framework exploring a joint exploitation of the keypoint and the image data in an interactive manner. C^2GAN contains two different types of generators, i.e., keypoint-oriented generator and image-oriented generator. Both of them are mutually connected in an end-to-end learnable fashion and explicitly form three cycled sub-networks, i.e., one image generation cycle and two keypoint generation cycles. Each cycle not only aims at reconstructing the input domain, and also produces useful output involving in the generation of another cycle. By so doing, the cycles constrain each other implicitly, which provides complementary information from the two different modalities and brings extra supervision across cycles, thus facilitating more robust optimization of the whole network. Extensive experimental results on two publicly available datasets, i.e., Radboud Faces and Market-1501, demonstrate that our approach is effective to generate more photo-realistic images compared with state-of-the-art models."
Convolutional Auto-encoding of Sentence Topics for Image Paragraph Generation,"Image paragraph generation is the task of producing a coherent story (usually a paragraph) that describes the visual content of an image. The problem nevertheless is not trivial especially when there are multiple descriptive and diverse gists to be considered for paragraph generation, which often happens in real images. A valid question is how to encapsulate such gists/topics that are worthy of mention from an image, and then describe the image from one topic to another but holistically with a coherent structure. In this paper, we present a new design --- Convolutional Auto-Encoding (CAE) that purely employs convolutional and deconvolutional auto-encoding framework for topic modeling on the region-level features of an image. Furthermore, we propose an architecture, namely CAE plus Long Short-Term Memory (dubbed as CAE-LSTM), that novelly integrates the learnt topics in support of paragraph generation. Technically, CAE-LSTM capitalizes on a two-level LSTM-based paragraph generation framework with attention mechanism. The paragraph-level LSTM captures the inter-sentence dependency in a paragraph, while sentence-level LSTM is to generate one sentence which is conditioned on each learnt topic. Extensive experiments are conducted on Stanford image paragraph dataset, and superior results are reported when comparing to state-of-the-art approaches. More remarkably, CAE-LSTM increases CIDEr performance from 20.93% to 25.15%."
Generative Image Inpainting with Submanifold Alignment,"Image inpainting aims at restoring missing regions of corrupted images, which has many applications such as image restoration and object removal. However, current GAN-based generative inpainting models do not explicitly exploit the structural or textural consistency between restored contents and their surrounding contexts.To address this limitation, we propose to enforce the alignment (or closeness) between the local data submanifolds (or subspaces) around restored images and those around the original (uncorrupted) images during the learning process of GAN-based inpainting models. We exploit Local Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID) to measure, in deep feature space, the alignment between data submanifolds learned by a GAN model and those of the original data, from a perspective of both images (denoted as iLID) and local patches (denoted as pLID) of images. We then apply iLID and pLID as regularizations for GAN-based inpainting models to encourage two levels of submanifold alignment: 1) an image-level alignment for improving structural consistency, and 2) a patch-level alignment for improving textural details. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets show that our proposed model can generate more accurate results than state-of-the-art models."
Synthetic Image Augmentation for Improved Classification using Generative Adversarial Networks,"Object detection and recognition has been an ongoing research topic for a long time in the field of computer vision. Even in robotics, detecting the state of an object by a robot still remains a challenging task. Also, collecting data for each possible state is also not feasible. In this literature, we use a deep convolutional neural network with SVM as a classifier to help with recognizing the state of a cooking object. We also study how a generative adversarial network can be used for synthetic data augmentation and improving the classification accuracy. The main motivation behind this work is to estimate how well a robot could recognize the current state of an object"
Lung image segmentation by generative adversarial networks,Lung image segmentation plays an important role in computer-aid pulmonary diseases diagnosis and treatment. This paper proposed a lung image segmentation method by generative adversarial networks. We employed a variety of generative adversarial networks and use its capability of image translation to perform image segmentation. The generative adversarial networks was employed to translate the original lung image to the segmented image. The generative adversarial networks based segmentation method was test on real lung image data set. Experimental results shows that the proposed method is effective and outperform state-of-the art method.
Deep Learning architectures for generalized immunofluorescence based nuclear image segmentation,"Separating and labeling each instance of a nucleus (instance-aware segmentation) is the key challenge in segmenting single cell nuclei on fluorescence microscopy images. Deep Neural Networks can learn the implicit transformation of a nuclear image into a probability map indicating the class membership of each pixel (nucleus or background), but the use of post-processing steps to turn the probability map into a labeled object mask is error-prone. This especially accounts for nuclear images of tissue sections and nuclear images across varying tissue preparations. In this work, we aim to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art deep learning architectures to segment nuclei in fluorescence images of various tissue origins and sample preparation types without post-processing. We compare architectures that operate on pixel to pixel translation and an architecture that operates on object detection and subsequent locally applied segmentation. In addition, we propose a novel strategy to create artificial images to extend the training set. We evaluate the influence of ground truth annotation quality, image scale and segmentation complexity on segmentation performance. Results show that three out of four deep learning architectures (U-Net, U-Net with ResNet34 backbone, Mask R-CNN) can segment fluorescent nuclear images on most of the sample preparation types and tissue origins with satisfactory segmentation performance. Mask R-CNN, an architecture designed to address instance aware segmentation tasks, outperforms other architectures. Equal nuclear mean size, consistent nuclear annotations and the use of artificially generated images result in overall acceptable precision and recall across different tissues and sample preparation types."
A Two Stage GAN for High Resolution Retinal Image Generation and Segmentation,"In recent years, the use of deep learning is becoming increasingly popular in computer vision. However, the effective training of deep architectures usually relies on huge sets of annotated data. This is critical in the medical field where it is difficult and expensive to obtain annotated images. In this paper, we use Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for synthesizing high quality retinal images, along with the corresponding semantic label-maps, to be used instead of real images during the training process. Differently from other previous proposals, we suggest a two step approach: first, a progressively growing GAN is trained to generate the semantic label-maps, which describe the blood vessel structure (i.e. vasculature); second, an image-to-image translation approach is used to obtain realistic retinal images from the generated vasculature. By using only a handful of training samples, our approach generates realistic high resolution images, that can be effectively used to enlarge small available datasets. Comparable results have been obtained employing the generated images in place of real data during training. The practical viability of the proposed approach has been demonstrated by applying it on two well established benchmark sets for retinal vessel segmentation, both containing a very small number of training samples. Our method obtained better performances with respect to state-of-the-art techniques."
ET-Net: A Generic Edge-aTtention Guidance Network for Medical Image Segmentation,"Segmentation is a fundamental task in medical image analysis. However, most existing methods focus on primary region extraction and ignore edge information, which is useful for obtaining accurate segmentation. In this paper, we propose a generic medical segmentation method, called Edge-aTtention guidance Network (ET-Net), which embeds edge-attention representations to guide the segmentation network. Specifically, an edge guidance module is utilized to learn the edge-attention representations in the early encoding layers, which are then transferred to the multi-scale decoding layers, fused using a weighted aggregation module. The experimental results on four segmentation tasks (i.e., optic disc/cup and vessel segmentation in retinal images, and lung segmentation in chest X-Ray and CT images) demonstrate that preserving edge-attention representations contributes to the final segmentation accuracy, and our proposed method outperforms current state-of-the-art segmentation methods. The source code of our method is available at https://github.com/ZzzJzzZ/ETNet."
U-GAT-IT: Unsupervised Generative Attentional Networks with Adaptive Layer-Instance Normalization for Image-to-Image Translation,"We propose a novel method for unsupervised image-to-image translation, which incorporates a new attention module and a new learnable normalization function in an end-to-end manner. The attention module guides our model to focus on more important regions distinguishing between source and target domains based on the attention map obtained by the auxiliary classifier. Unlike previous attention-based method which cannot handle the geometric changes between domains, our model can translate both images requiring holistic changes and images requiring large shape changes. Moreover, our new AdaLIN (Adaptive Layer-Instance Normalization) function helps our attention-guided model to flexibly control the amount of change in shape and texture by learned parameters depending on datasets. Experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method compared to the existing state-of-the-art models with a fixed network architecture and hyper-parameters. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/taki0112/UGATIT or https://github.com/znxlwm/UGATIT-pytorch."
Image Super-Resolution Using a Wavelet-based Generative Adversarial Network,"In this paper, we consider the problem of super-resolution recons-truction. This is a hot topic because super-resolution reconstruction has a wide range of applications in the medical field, remote sensing monitoring, and criminal investigation. Compared with traditional algorithms, the current super-resolution reconstruction algorithm based on deep learning greatly improves the clarity of reconstructed pictures. Existing work like Super-Resolution Using a Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) can effectively restore the texture details of the image. However, experimentally verified that the texture details of the image recovered by the SRGAN are not robust. In order to get super-resolution reconstructed images with richer high-frequency details, we improve the network structure and propose a super-resolution reconstruction algorithm combining wavelet transform and Generative Adversarial Network. The proposed algorithm can efficiently reconstruct high-resolution images with rich global information and local texture details. We have trained our model by PyTorch framework and VOC2012 dataset, and tested it by Set5, Set14, BSD100 and Urban100 test datasets."
Lifelong GAN: Continual Learning for Conditional Image Generation,"Lifelong learning is challenging for deep neural networks due to their susceptibility to catastrophic forgetting. Catastrophic forgetting occurs when a trained network is not able to maintain its ability to accomplish previously learned tasks when it is trained to perform new tasks. We study the problem of lifelong learning for generative models, extending a trained network to new conditional generation tasks without forgetting previous tasks, while assuming access to the training data for the current task only. In contrast to state-of-the-art memory replay based approaches which are limited to label-conditioned image generation tasks, a more generic framework for continual learning of generative models under different conditional image generation settings is proposed in this paper. Lifelong GAN employs knowledge distillation to transfer learned knowledge from previous networks to the new network. This makes it possible to perform image-conditioned generation tasks in a lifelong learning setting. We validate Lifelong GAN for both image-conditioned and label-conditioned generation tasks, and provide qualitative and quantitative results to show the generality and effectiveness of our method."
A Generalized Framework for Edge-preserving and Structure-preserving Image Smoothing,"Image smoothing is a fundamental procedure in applications of both computer vision and graphics. The required smoothing properties can be different or even contradictive among different tasks. Nevertheless, the inherent smoothing nature of one smoothing operator is usually fixed and thus cannot meet the various requirements of different applications. In this paper, a non-convex non-smooth optimization framework is proposed to achieve diverse smoothing natures where even contradictive smoothing behaviors can be achieved. To this end, we first introduce the truncated Huber penalty function which has seldom been used in image smoothing. A robust framework is then proposed. When combined with the strong flexibility of the truncated Huber penalty function, our framework is capable of a range of applications and can outperform the state-of-the-art approaches in several tasks. In addition, an efficient numerical solution is provided and its convergence is theoretically guaranteed even the optimization framework is non-convex and non-smooth. The effectiveness and superior performance of our approach are validated through comprehensive experimental results in a range of applications."
Automatic Radiology Report Generation based on Multi-view Image Fusion and Medical Concept Enrichment,"Generating radiology reports is time-consuming and requires extensive expertise in practice. Therefore, reliable automatic radiology report generation is highly desired to alleviate the workload. Although deep learning techniques have been successfully applied to image classification and image captioning tasks, radiology report generation remains challenging in regards to understanding and linking complicated medical visual contents with accurate natural language descriptions. In addition, the data scales of open-access datasets that contain paired medical images and reports remain very limited. To cope with these practical challenges, we propose a generative encoder-decoder model and focus on chest x-ray images and reports with the following improvements. First, we pretrain the encoder with a large number of chest x-ray images to accurately recognize 14 common radiographic observations, while taking advantage of the multi-view images by enforcing the cross-view consistency. Second, we synthesize multi-view visual features based on a sentence-level attention mechanism in a late fusion fashion. In addition, in order to enrich the decoder with descriptive semantics and enforce the correctness of the deterministic medical-related contents such as mentions of organs or diagnoses, we extract medical concepts based on the radiology reports in the training data and fine-tune the encoder to extract the most frequent medical concepts from the x-ray images. Such concepts are fused with each decoding step by a word-level attention model. The experimental results conducted on the Indiana University Chest X-Ray dataset demonstrate that the proposed model achieves the state-of-the-art performance compared with other baseline approaches."
A General Decoupled Learning Framework for Parameterized Image Operators,"Many different deep networks have been used to approximate, accelerate or improve traditional image operators. Among these traditional operators, many contain parameters which need to be tweaked to obtain the satisfactory results, which we refer to as parameterized image operators. However, most existing deep networks trained for these operators are only designed for one specific parameter configuration, which does not meet the needs of real scenarios that usually require flexible parameters settings. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new decoupled learning algorithm to learn from the operator parameters to dynamically adjust the weights of a deep network for image operators, denoted as the base network. The learned algorithm is formed as another network, namely the weight learning network, which can be end-to-end jointly trained with the base network. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework can be successfully applied to many traditional parameterized image operators. To accelerate the parameter tuning for practical scenarios, the proposed framework can be further extended to dynamically change the weights of only one single layer of the base network while sharing most computation cost. We demonstrate that this cheap parameter-tuning extension of the proposed decoupled learning framework even outperforms the state-of-the-art alternative approaches."
A General Framework for Complex Network-Based Image Segmentation,"With the recent advances in complex networks theory, graph-based techniques for image segmentation has attracted great attention recently. In order to segment the image into meaningful connected components, this paper proposes an image segmentation general framework using complex networks based community detection algorithms. If we consider regions as communities, using community detection algorithms directly can lead to an over-segmented image. To address this problem, we start by splitting the image into small regions using an initial segmentation. The obtained regions are used for building the complex network. To produce meaningful connected components and detect homogeneous communities, some combinations of color and texture based features are employed in order to quantify the regions similarities. To sum up, the network of regions is constructed adaptively to avoid many small regions in the image, and then, community detection algorithms are applied on the resulting adaptive similarity matrix to obtain the final segmented image. Experiments are conducted on Berkeley Segmentation Dataset and four of the most influential community detection algorithms are tested. Experimental results have shown that the proposed general framework increases the segmentation performances compared to some existing methods."
Correlation via synthesis: end-to-end nodule image generation and radiogenomic map learning based on generative adversarial network,"Radiogenomic map linking image features and gene expression profiles is useful for noninvasively identifying molecular properties of a particular type of disease. Conventionally, such map is produced in three separate steps: 1) gene-clustering to ""metagenes"", 2) image feature extraction, and 3) statistical correlation between metagenes and image features. Each step is independently performed and relies on arbitrary measurements. In this work, we investigate the potential of an end-to-end method fusing gene data with image features to generate synthetic image and learn radiogenomic map simultaneously. To achieve this goal, we develop a generative adversarial network (GAN) conditioned on both background images and gene expression profiles, synthesizing the corresponding image. Image and gene features are fused at different scales to ensure the realism and quality of the synthesized image. We tested our method on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) dataset. Results demonstrate that the proposed method produces realistic synthetic images, and provides a promising way to find gene-image relationship in a holistic end-to-end manner."
Unified Attentional Generative Adversarial Network for Brain Tumor Segmentation From Multimodal Unpaired Images,"In medical applications, the same anatomical structures may be observed in multiple modalities despite the different image characteristics. Currently, most deep models for multimodal segmentation rely on paired registered images. However, multimodal paired registered images are difficult to obtain in many cases. Therefore, developing a model that can segment the target objects from different modalities with unpaired images is significant for many clinical applications. In this work, we propose a novel two-stream translation and segmentation unified attentional generative adversarial network (UAGAN), which can perform any-to-any image modality translation and segment the target objects simultaneously in the case where two or more modalities are available. The translation stream is used to capture modality-invariant features of the target anatomical structures. In addition, to focus on segmentation-related features, we add attentional blocks to extract valuable features from the translation stream. Experiments on three-modality brain tumor segmentation indicate that UAGAN outperforms the existing methods in most cases."
Generating large labeled data sets for laparoscopic image processing tasks using unpaired image-to-image translation,"In the medical domain, the lack of large training data sets and benchmarks is often a limiting factor for training deep neural networks. In contrast to expensive manual labeling, computer simulations can generate large and fully labeled data sets with a minimum of manual effort. However, models that are trained on simulated data usually do not translate well to real scenarios. To bridge the domain gap between simulated and real laparoscopic images, we exploit recent advances in unpaired image-to-image translation. We extent an image-to-image translation method to generate a diverse multitude of realistically looking synthetic images based on images from a simple laparoscopy simulation. By incorporating means to ensure that the image content is preserved during the translation process, we ensure that the labels given for the simulated images remain valid for their realistically looking translations. This way, we are able to generate a large, fully labeled synthetic data set of laparoscopic images with realistic appearance. We show that this data set can be used to train models for the task of liver segmentation of laparoscopic images. We achieve average dice scores of up to 0.89 in some patients without manually labeling a single laparoscopic image and show that using our synthetic data to pre-train models can greatly improve their performance. The synthetic data set will be made publicly available, fully labeled with segmentation maps, depth maps, normal maps, and positions of tools and camera (http://opencas.dkfz.de/image2image)."
Degenerative Adversarial NeuroImage Nets: Generating Images that Mimic Disease Progression,"Simulating images representative of neurodegenerative diseases is important for predicting patient outcomes and for validation of computational models of disease progression. This capability is valuable for secondary prevention clinical trials where outcomes and screening criteria involve neuroimaging. Traditional computational methods are limited by imposing a parametric model for atrophy and are extremely resource-demanding. Recent advances in deep learning have yielded data-driven models for longitudinal studies (e.g., face ageing) that are capable of generating synthetic images in real-time. Similar solutions can be used to model trajectories of atrophy in the brain, although new challenges need to be addressed to ensure accurate disease progression modelling. Here we propose Degenerative Adversarial NeuroImage Net (DaniNet) --- a new deep learning approach that learns to emulate the effect of neurodegeneration on MRI by simulating atrophy as a function of ages, and disease progression. DaniNet uses an underlying set of Support Vector Regressors (SVRs) trained to capture the patterns of regional intensity changes that accompany disease progression. DaniNet produces whole output images, consisting of 2D-MRI slices that are constrained to match regional predictions from the SVRs. DaniNet is also able to maintain the unique brain morphology of individuals. Adversarial training ensures realistic brain images and smooth temporal progression. We train our model using 9652 T1-weighted (longitudinal) MRI extracted from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. We perform quantitative and qualitative evaluations on a separate test set of 1283 images (also from ADNI) demonstrating the ability of DaniNet to produce accurate and convincing synthetic images that emulate disease progression."
Guided Image Generation with Conditional Invertible Neural Networks,"In this work, we address the task of natural image generation guided by a conditioning input. We introduce a new architecture called conditional invertible neural network (cINN). The cINN combines the purely generative INN model with an unconstrained feed-forward network, which efficiently preprocesses the conditioning input into useful features. All parameters of the cINN are jointly optimized with a stable, maximum likelihood-based training procedure. By construction, the cINN does not experience mode collapse and generates diverse samples, in contrast to e.g. cGANs. At the same time our model produces sharp images since no reconstruction loss is required, in contrast to e.g. VAEs. We demonstrate these properties for the tasks of MNIST digit generation and image colorization. Furthermore, we take advantage of our bi-directional cINN architecture to explore and manipulate emergent properties of the latent space, such as changing the image style in an intuitive way."
Next Generation Radiogenomics Sequencing for Prediction of EGFR and KRAS Mutation Status in NSCLC Patients Using Multimodal Imaging and Machine Learning Approaches,"Aim: In the present work, we aimed to evaluate a comprehensive radiomics framework that enabled prediction of EGFR and KRAS mutation status in NSCLC cancer patients based on PET and CT multi-modalities radiomic features and machine learning (ML) algorithms. Methods: Our study involved 211 NSCLC cancer patient with PET and CTD images. More than twenty thousand radiomic features from different image-feature sets were extracted Feature value was normalized to obtain Z-scores, followed by student t-test students for comparison, high correlated features were eliminated and the False discovery rate (FDR) correction were performed Six feature selection methods and twelve classifiers were used to predict gene status in patient and model evaluation was reported on independent validation sets (68 patients). Results: The best predictive power of conventional PET parameters was achieved by SUVpeak (AUC: 0.69, P-value = 0.0002) and MTV (AUC: 0.55, P-value = 0.0011) for EGFR and KRAS, respectively. Univariate analysis of radiomics features improved prediction power up to AUC: 75 (q-value: 0.003, Short Run Emphasis feature of GLRLM from LOG preprocessed image of PET with sigma value 1.5) and AUC: 0.71 (q-value 0.00005, The Large Dependence Low Gray Level Emphasis from GLDM in LOG preprocessed image of CTD sigma value 5) for EGFR and KRAS, respectively. Furthermore, the machine learning algorithm improved the perdition power up to AUC: 0.82 for EGFR (LOG preprocessed of PET image set with sigma 3 with VT feature selector and SGD classifier) and AUC: 0.83 for KRAS (CT image set with sigma 3.5 with SM feature selector and SGD classifier). Conclusion: We demonstrated that radiomic features extracted from different image-feature sets could be used for EGFR and KRAS mutation status prediction in NSCLC patients, and showed that they have more predictive power than conventional imaging parameters."
Recent Advances of Image Steganography with Generative Adversarial Networks,"In the past few years, the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) which proposed in 2014 has achieved great success. GAN has achieved many research results in the field of computer vision and natural language processing. Image steganography is dedicated to hiding secret messages in digital images, and has achieved the purpose of covert communication. Recently, research on image steganography has demonstrated great potential for using GAN and neural networks. In this paper we review different strategies for steganography such as cover modification, cover selection and cover synthesis by GANs, and discuss the characteristics of these methods as well as evaluation metrics and provide some possible future research directions in image steganography."
Learning to Predict Robot Keypoints Using Artificially Generated Images,"This work considers robot keypoint estimation on color images as a supervised machine learning task. We propose the use of probabilistically created renderings to overcome the lack of labeled real images. Rather than sampling from stationary distributions, our approach introduces a feedback mechanism that constantly adapts probability distributions according to current training progress. Initial results show, our approach achieves near-human-level accuracy on real images. Additionally, we demonstrate that feedback leads to fewer required training steps, while maintaining the same model quality on synthetic data sets."
Semi-supervised Image Attribute Editing using Generative Adversarial Networks,"Image attribute editing is a challenging problem that has been recently studied by many researchers using generative networks. The challenge is in the manipulation of selected attributes of images while preserving the other details. The method to achieve this goal is to find an accurate latent vector representation of an image and a direction corresponding to the attribute. Almost all the works in the literature use labeled datasets in a supervised setting for this purpose. In this study, we introduce an architecture called Cyclic Reverse Generator (CRG), which allows learning the inverse function of the generator accurately via an encoder in an unsupervised setting by utilizing cyclic cost minimization. Attribute editing is then performed using the CRG models for finding desired attribute representations in the latent space. In this work, we use two arbitrary reference images, with and without desired attributes, to compute an attribute direction for editing. We show that the proposed approach performs better in terms of image reconstruction compared to the existing end-to-end generative models both quantitatively and qualitatively. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results on both real images and generated images in CelebA dataset."
Multi-scale GANs for Memory-efficient Generation of High Resolution Medical Images,"Currently generative adversarial networks (GANs) are rarely applied to medical images of large sizes, especially 3D volumes, due to their large computational demand. We propose a novel multi-scale patch-based GAN approach to generate large high resolution 2D and 3D images. Our key idea is to first learn a low-resolution version of the image and then generate patches of successively growing resolutions conditioned on previous scales. In a domain translation use-case scenario, 3D thorax CTs of size 512x512x512 and thorax X-rays of size 2048x2048 are generated and we show that, due to the constant GPU memory demand of our method, arbitrarily large images of high resolution can be generated. Moreover, compared to common patch-based approaches, our multi-resolution scheme enables better image quality and prevents patch artifacts."
Adversarial Pixel-Level Generation of Semantic Images,"Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have obtained extraordinary success in the generation of realistic images, a domain where a lower pixel-level accuracy is acceptable. We study the problem, not yet tackled in the literature, of generating semantic images starting from a prior distribution. Intuitively this problem can be approached using standard methods and architectures. However, a better-suited approach is needed to avoid generating blurry, hallucinated and thus unusable images since tasks like semantic segmentation require pixel-level exactness. In this work, we present a novel architecture for learning to generate pixel-level accurate semantic images, namely Semantic Generative Adversarial Networks (SemGANs). The experimental evaluation shows that our architecture outperforms standard ones from both a quantitative and a qualitative point of view in many semantic image generation tasks."
Style Generator Inversion for Image Enhancement and Animation,"One of the main motivations for training high quality image generative models is their potential use as tools for image manipulation. Recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been able to generate images of remarkable quality. Unfortunately, adversarially-trained unconditional generator networks have not been successful as image priors. One of the main requirements for a network to act as a generative image prior, is being able to generate every possible image from the target distribution. Adversarial learning often experiences mode-collapse, which manifests in generators that cannot generate some modes of the target distribution. Another requirement often not satisfied is invertibility i.e. having an efficient way of finding a valid input latent code given a required output image. In this work, we show that differently from earlier GANs, the very recently proposed style-generators are quite easy to invert. We use this important observation to propose style generators as general purpose image priors. We show that style generators outperform other GANs as well as Deep Image Prior as priors for image enhancement tasks. The latent space spanned by style-generators satisfies linear identity-pose relations. The latent space linearity, combined with invertibility, allows us to animate still facial images without supervision. Extensive experiments are performed to support the main contributions of this paper."
Inspirational Adversarial Image Generation,"The task of image generation started to receive some attention from artists and designers to inspire them in new creations. However, exploiting the results of deep generative models such as Generative Adversarial Networks can be long and tedious given the lack of existing tools. In this work, we propose a simple strategy to inspire creators with new generations learned from a dataset of their choice, while providing some control on them. We design a simple optimization method to find the optimal latent parameters corresponding to the closest generation to any input inspirational image. Specifically, we allow the generation given an inspirational image of the user choice by performing several optimization steps to recover optimal parameters from the model's latent space. We tested several exploration methods starting with classic gradient descents to gradient-free optimizers. Many gradient-free optimizers just need comparisons (better/worse than another image), so that they can even be used without numerical criterion, without inspirational image, but with only with human preference. Thus, by iterating on one's preferences we could make robust Facial Composite or Fashion Generation algorithms. High resolution of the produced design generations are obtained using progressive growing of GANs. Our results on four datasets of faces, fashion images, and textures show that satisfactory images are effectively retrieved in most cases."
Interactive Optimization of Generative Image Modeling using Sequential Subspace Search and Content-based Guidance,"Generative image modeling techniques such as GAN demonstrate highly convincing image generation result. However, user interaction is often necessary to obtain the desired results. Existing attempts add interactivity but require either tailored architectures or extra data. We present a human-in-the-optimization method that allows users to directly explore and search the latent vector space of generative image modeling. Our system provides multiple candidates by sampling the latent vector space, and the user selects the best blending weights within the subspace using multiple sliders. In addition, the user can express their intention through image editing tools. The system samples latent vectors based on inputs and presents new candidates to the user iteratively. An advantage of our formulation is that one can apply our method to arbitrary pre-trained model without developing specialized architecture or data. We demonstrate our method with various generative image modeling applications, and show superior performance in a comparative user study with prior art iGAN."
Model-based Deep Medical Imaging: the roadmap of generalizing iterative reconstruction model using deep learning,"Medical imaging is playing a more and more important role in clinics. However, there are several issues in different imaging modalities such as slow imaging speed in MRI, radiation injury in CT and PET. Therefore, accelerating MRI, reducing radiation dose in CT and PET have been ongoing research topics since their invention. Usually, acquiring less data is a direct but important strategy to address these issues. However, less acquisition usually results in aliasing artifacts in reconstructions. Recently, deep learning (DL) has been introduced in medical image reconstruction and shown potential on significantly speeding up MR reconstruction and reducing radiation dose. In this paper, we propose a general framework on combining the reconstruction model with deep learning to maximize the potential of deep learning and model-based reconstruction, and give the examples to demonstrate the performance and requirements of unrolling different algorithms using deep learning."
SemanticAdv: Generating Adversarial Examples via Attribute-conditional Image Editing,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved great success in various applications due to their strong expressive power. However, recent studies have shown that DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial examples which are manipulated instances targeting to mislead DNNs to make incorrect predictions. Currently, most such adversarial examples try to guarantee ""subtle perturbation"" by limiting the L_p norm of the perturbation. In this paper, we aim to explore the impact of semantic manipulation on DNNs predictions by manipulating the semantic attributes of images and generate ""unrestricted adversarial examples"".  In particular, we propose an algorithm \emph{SemanticAdv} which leverages disentangled semantic factors to generate adversarial perturbation by altering controlled semantic attributes to fool the learner towards various ""adversarial"" targets. We conduct extensive experiments to show that the semantic based adversarial examples can not only fool different learning tasks such as face verification and landmark detection, but also achieve high targeted attack success rate against \emph{real-world black-box} services such as Azure face verification service based on transferability.  To further demonstrate the applicability of \emph{SemanticAdv} beyond face recognition domain, we also generate semantic perturbations on street-view images. Such adversarial examples with controlled semantic manipulation can shed light on further understanding about vulnerabilities of DNNs as well as potential defensive approaches."
The Cells Out of Sample (COOS) dataset and benchmarks for measuring out-of-sample generalization of image classifiers,"Understanding if classifiers generalize to out-of-sample datasets is a central problem in machine learning. Microscopy images provide a standardized way to measure the generalization capacity of image classifiers, as we can image the same classes of objects under increasingly divergent, but controlled factors of variation. We created a public dataset of 132,209 images of mouse cells, COOS-7 (Cells Out Of Sample 7-Class). COOS-7 provides a classification setting where four test datasets have increasing degrees of covariate shift: some images are random subsets of the training data, while others are from experiments reproduced months later and imaged by different instruments. We benchmarked a range of classification models using different representations, including transferred neural network features, end-to-end classification with a supervised deep CNN, and features from a self-supervised CNN. While most classifiers perform well on test datasets similar to the training dataset, all classifiers failed to generalize their performance to datasets with greater covariate shifts. These baselines highlight the challenges of covariate shifts in image data, and establish metrics for improving the generalization capacity of image classifiers."
Pose Guided Fashion Image Synthesis Using Deep Generative Model,"Generating a photorealistic image with intended human pose is a promising yet challenging research topic for many applications such as smart photo editing, movie making, virtual try-on, and fashion display. In this paper, we present a novel deep generative model to transfer an image of a person from a given pose to a new pose while keeping fashion item consistent. In order to formulate the framework, we employ one generator and two discriminators for image synthesis. The generator includes an image encoder, a pose encoder and a decoder. The two encoders provide good representation of visual and geometrical context which will be utilized by the decoder in order to generate a photorealistic image. Unlike existing pose-guided image generation models, we exploit two discriminators to guide the synthesis process where one discriminator differentiates between generated image and real images (training samples), and another discriminator verifies the consistency of appearance between a target pose and a generated image. We perform end-to-end training of the network to learn the parameters through back-propagation given ground-truth images. The proposed generative model is capable of synthesizing a photorealistic image of a person given a target pose. We have demonstrated our results by conducting rigorous experiments on two data sets, both quantitatively and qualitatively."
Active Generative Adversarial Network for Image Classification,"Sufficient supervised information is crucial for any machine learning models to boost performance. However, labeling data is expensive and sometimes difficult to obtain. Active learning is an approach to acquire annotations for data from a human oracle by selecting informative samples with a high probability to enhance performance. In recent emerging studies, a generative adversarial network (GAN) has been integrated with active learning to generate good candidates to be presented to the oracle. In this paper, we propose a novel model that is able to obtain labels for data in a cheaper manner without the need to query an oracle. In the model, a novel reward for each sample is devised to measure the degree of uncertainty, which is obtained from a classifier trained with existing labeled data. This reward is used to guide a conditional GAN to generate informative samples with a higher probability for a certain label. With extensive evaluations, we have confirmed the effectiveness of the model, showing that the generated samples are capable of improving the classification performance in popular image classification tasks."
Single Image Super-resolution via Dense Blended Attention Generative Adversarial Network for Clinical Diagnosis,"During training phase, more connections (e.g. channel concatenation in last layer of DenseNet) means more occupied GPU memory and lower GPU utilization, requiring more training time. The increase of training time is also not conducive to launch application of SR algorithms. This's why we abandoned DenseNet as basic network. Futhermore, we abandoned this paper due to its limitation only applied on medical images.Please view our lastest work applied on general images at arXiv:1911.03464."
Low-light Image Enhancement Algorithm Based on Retinex and Generative Adversarial Network,"Low-light image enhancement is generally regarded as a challenging task in image processing, especially for the complex visual tasks at night or weakly illuminated. In order to reduce the blurs or noises on the low-light images, a large number of papers have contributed to applying different technologies. Regretfully, most of them had served little purposes in coping with the extremely poor illumination parts of images or test in practice. In this work, the authors propose a novel approach for processing low-light images based on the Retinex theory and generative adversarial network (GAN), which is composed of the decomposition part for splitting the image into illumination image and reflected image, and the enhancement part for generating high-quality image. Such a discriminative network is expected to make the generated image clearer. Couples of experiments have been implemented under the circumstance of different lighting strength on the basis of Converted See-In-the-Dark (CSID) datasets, and the satisfactory results have been achieved with exceeding expectation that much encourages the authors. In a word, the proposed GAN-based network and employed Retinex theory in this work have proven to be effective in dealing with the low-light image enhancement problems, which will benefit the image processing with no doubt."
GANPOP: Generative Adversarial Network Prediction of Optical Properties from Single Snapshot Wide-field Images,"We present a deep learning framework for wide-field, content-aware estimation of absorption and scattering coefficients of tissues, called Generative Adversarial Network Prediction of Optical Properties (GANPOP). Spatial frequency domain imaging is used to obtain ground-truth optical properties from in vivo human hands, freshly resected human esophagectomy samples and homogeneous tissue phantoms. Images of objects with either flat-field or structured illumination are paired with registered optical property maps and are used to train conditional generative adversarial networks that estimate optical properties from a single input image. We benchmark this approach by comparing GANPOP to a single-snapshot optical property (SSOP) technique, using a normalized mean absolute error (NMAE) metric. In human gastrointestinal specimens, GANPOP estimates both reduced scattering and absorption coefficients at 660 nm from a single 0.2/mm spatial frequency illumination image with 58% higher accuracy than SSOP. When applied to both in vivo and ex vivo swine tissues, a GANPOP model trained solely on human specimens and phantoms estimates optical properties with approximately 43% improvement over SSOP, indicating adaptability to sample variety. Moreover, we demonstrate that GANPOP estimates optical properties from flat-field illumination images with similar error to SSOP, which requires structured-illumination. Given a training set that appropriately spans the target domain, GANPOP has the potential to enable rapid and accurate wide-field measurements of optical properties, even from conventional imaging systems with flat-field illumination."
A Hybrid Approach Between Adversarial Generative Networks and Actor-Critic Policy Gradient for Low Rate High-Resolution Image Compression,"Image compression is an essential approach for decreasing the size in bytes of the image without deteriorating the quality of it. Typically, classic algorithms are used but recently deep-learning has been successfully applied. In this work, is presented a deep super-resolution work-flow for image compression that maps low-resolution JPEG image to the high-resolution. The pipeline consists of two components: first, an encoder-decoder neural network learns how to transform the downsampling JPEG images to high resolution. Second, a combination between Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and reinforcement learning Actor-Critic (A3C) loss pushes the encoder-decoder to indirectly maximize High Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). Although PSNR is a fully differentiable metric, this work opens the doors to new solutions for maximizing non-differential metrics through an end-to-end approach between encoder-decoder networks and reinforcement learning policy gradient methods."
Synthesizing 3D Shapes from Silhouette Image Collections using Multi-projection Generative Adversarial Networks,"We present a new weakly supervised learning-based method for generating novel category-specific 3D shapes from unoccluded image collections. Our method is weakly supervised and only requires silhouette annotations from unoccluded, category-specific objects. Our method does not require access to the object's 3D shape, multiple observations per object from different views, intra-image pixel-correspondences, or any view annotations. Key to our method is a novel multi-projection generative adversarial network (MP-GAN) that trains a 3D shape generator to be consistent with multiple 2D projections of the 3D shapes, and without direct access to these 3D shapes. This is achieved through multiple discriminators that encode the distribution of 2D projections of the 3D shapes seen from a different views. Additionally, to determine the view information for each silhouette image, we also train a view prediction network on visualizations of 3D shapes synthesized by the generator. We iteratively alternate between training the generator and training the view prediction network. We validate our multi-projection GAN on both synthetic and real image datasets. Furthermore, we also show that multi-projection GANs can aid in learning other high-dimensional distributions from lower dimensional training datasets, such as material-class specific spatially varying reflectance properties from images."
Do Image Classifiers Generalize Across Time?,"We study the robustness of image classifiers to temporal perturbations derived from videos. As part of this study, we construct two datasets, ImageNet-Vid-Robust and YTBB-Robust , containing a total 57,897 images grouped into 3,139 sets of perceptually similar images. Our datasets were derived from ImageNet-Vid and Youtube-BB respectively and thoroughly re-annotated by human experts for image similarity. We evaluate a diverse array of classifiers pre-trained on ImageNet and show a median classification accuracy drop of 16 and 10 on our two datasets. Additionally, we evaluate three detection models and show that natural perturbations induce both classification as well as localization errors, leading to a median drop in detection mAP of 14 points. Our analysis demonstrates that perturbations occurring naturally in videos pose a substantial and realistic challenge to deploying convolutional neural networks in environments that require both reliable and low-latency predictions"
Y-GAN: A Generative Adversarial Network for Depthmap Estimation from Multi-camera Stereo Images,"Depth perception is a key component for autonomous systems that interact in the real world, such as delivery robots, warehouse robots, and self-driving cars. Tasks in autonomous robotics such as 3D object recognition, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), path planning and navigation, require some form of 3D spatial information. Depth perception is a long-standing research problem in computer vision and robotics and has had a long history. Many approaches using deep learning, ranging from structure from motion, shape-from-X, monocular, binocular, and multi-view stereo, have yielded acceptable results. However, there are several shortcomings of these methods such as requiring expensive hardware, needing supervised training data, no ground truth data for comparison, and disregard for occlusion. In order to address these shortcomings, this work proposes a new deep convolutional generative adversarial network architecture, called Y-GAN, that uses data from three cameras to estimate a depth map for each frame in a multi-camera video stream."
Generating Diverse High-Fidelity Images with VQ-VAE-2,"We explore the use of Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE) models for large scale image generation. To this end, we scale and enhance the autoregressive priors used in VQ-VAE to generate synthetic samples of much higher coherence and fidelity than possible before. We use simple feed-forward encoder and decoder networks, making our model an attractive candidate for applications where the encoding and/or decoding speed is critical. Additionally, VQ-VAE requires sampling an autoregressive model only in the compressed latent space, which is an order of magnitude faster than sampling in the pixel space, especially for large images. We demonstrate that a multi-scale hierarchical organization of VQ-VAE, augmented with powerful priors over the latent codes, is able to generate samples with quality that rivals that of state of the art Generative Adversarial Networks on multifaceted datasets such as ImageNet, while not suffering from GAN's known shortcomings such as mode collapse and lack of diversity."
GANchors: Realistic Image Perturbation Distributions for Anchors Using Generative Models,"We extend and improve the work of Model Agnostic Anchors for explanations on image classification through the use of generative adversarial networks (GANs). Using GANs, we generate samples from a more realistic perturbation distribution, by optimizing under a lower dimensional latent space. This increases the trust in an explanation, as results now come from images that are more likely to be found in the original training set of a classifier, rather than an overlay of random images. A large drawback to our method is the computational complexity of sampling through optimization; to address this, we implement more efficient algorithms, including a diverse encoder. Lastly, we share results from the MNIST and CelebA datasets, and note that our explanations can lead to smaller and higher precision anchors."
Applying Generative Adversarial Networks to Intelligent Subsurface Imaging and Identification,"To augment training data for machine learning models in Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) data classification and identification, this thesis focuses on the generation of realistic GPR data using Generative Adversarial Networks. An innovative GAN architecture is proposed for generating GPR B-scans, which is, to the author's knowledge, the first successful application of GAN to GPR B-scans. As one of the major contributions, a novel loss function is formulated by merging frequency domain with time domain features. To test the efficacy of generated B-scans, a real time object classifier is proposed to measure the performance gain derived from augmented B-Scan images. The numerical experiment illustrated that, based on the augmented training data, the proposed GAN architecture demonstrated a significant increase (from 82% to 98%) in the accuracy of the object classifier."
Generative Imaging and Image Processing via Generative Encoder,"This paper introduces a novel generative encoder (GE) model for generative imaging and image processing with applications in compressed sensing and imaging, image compression, denoising, inpainting, deblurring, and super-resolution. The GE model consists of a pre-training phase and a solving phase. In the pre-training phase, we separately train two deep neural networks: a generative adversarial network (GAN) with a generator \G that captures the data distribution of a given image set, and an auto-encoder (AE) network with an encoder \EN that compresses images following the estimated distribution by GAN. In the solving phase, given a noisy image x=\mathcal{P}(x^*), where x^* is the target unknown image, \mathcal{P} is an operator adding an addictive, or multiplicative, or convolutional noise, or equivalently given such an image x in the compressed domain, i.e., given m=\EN(x), we solve the optimization problem    z^*=\underset{z}{\mathrm{argmin}} \|\EN(\G(z))-m\|_2^2+λ\|z\|_2^2   to recover the image x^* in a generative way via \hat{x}:=\G(z^*)\approx x^*, where λ>0 is a hyperparameter. The GE model unifies the generative capacity of GANs and the stability of AEs in an optimization framework above instead of stacking GANs and AEs into a single network or combining their loss functions into one as in existing literature. Numerical experiments show that the proposed model outperforms several state-of-the-art algorithms."
Blocksworld Revisited: Learning and Reasoning to Generate Event-Sequences from Image Pairs,"The process of identifying changes or transformations in a scene along with the ability of reasoning about their causes and effects, is a key aspect of intelligence. In this work we go beyond recent advances in computational perception, and introduce a more challenging task, Image-based Event-Sequencing (IES). In IES, the task is to predict a sequence of actions required to rearrange objects from the configuration in an input source image to the one in the target image. IES also requires systems to possess inductive generalizability. Motivated from evidence in cognitive development, we compile the first IES dataset, the Blocksworld Image Reasoning Dataset (BIRD) which contains images of wooden blocks in different configurations, and the sequence of moves to rearrange one configuration to the other. We first explore the use of existing deep learning architectures and show that these end-to-end methods under-perform in inferring temporal event-sequences and fail at inductive generalization. We then propose a modular two-step approach: Visual Perception followed by Event-Sequencing, and demonstrate improved performance by combining learning and reasoning. Finally, by showing an extension of our approach on natural images, we seek to pave the way for future research on event sequencing for real world scenes."
Image Alignment in Unseen Domains via Domain Deep Generalization,"Image alignment across domains has recently become one of the realistic and popular topics in the research community. In this problem, a deep learning-based image alignment method is usually trained on an available largescale database. During the testing steps, this trained model is deployed on unseen images collected under different camera conditions and modalities. The delivered deep network models are unable to be updated, adapted or fine-tuned in these scenarios. Thus, recent deep learning techniques, e.g. domain adaptation, feature transferring, and fine-tuning, are unable to be deployed. This paper presents a novel deep learning based approach to tackle the problem of across unseen modalities. The proposed network is then applied to image alignment as an illustration. The proposed approach is designed as an end-to-end deep convolutional neural network to optimize the deep models to improve the performance. The proposed network has been evaluated in digit recognition when the model is trained on MNIST and then tested on unseen domain MNIST-M. Finally, the proposed method is benchmarked in image alignment problem when training on RGB images and testing on Depth and X-Ray images."
GAN2GAN: Generative Noise Learning for Blind Denoising with Single Noisy Images,"We tackle a challenging blind image denoising problem, in which only single distinct noisy images are available for training a denoiser, and no information about noise is known, except for it being zero-mean, additive, and independent of the clean image. In such a setting, which often occurs in practice, it is not possible to train a denoiser with the standard discriminative training or with the recently developed Noise2Noise (N2N) training; the former requires the underlying clean image for the given noisy image, and the latter requires two independently realized noisy image pair for a clean image. To that end, we propose GAN2GAN (Generated-Artificial-Noise to Generated-Artificial-Noise) method that first learns a generative model that can 1) simulate the noise in the given noisy images and 2) generate a rough, noisy estimates of the clean images, then 3) iteratively trains a denoiser with subsequently synthesized noisy image pairs (as in N2N), obtained from the generative model. In results, we show the denoiser trained with our GAN2GAN achieves an impressive denoising performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets for the blind denoising setting; it almost approaches the performance of the standard discriminatively-trained or N2N-trained models that have more information than ours, and it significantly outperforms the recent baseline for the same setting, \textit{e.g.}, Noise2Void, and a more conventional yet strong one, BM3D. The official code of our method is available at https://github.com/csm9493/GAN2GAN."
Dilated Spatial Generative Adversarial Networks for Ergodic Image Generation,"Generative models have recently received renewed attention as a result of adversarial learning. Generative adversarial networks consist of samples generation model and a discrimination model able to distinguish between genuine and synthetic samples. In combination with convolutional (for the discriminator) and de-convolutional (for the generator) layers, they are particularly suitable for image generation, especially of natural scenes. However, the presence of fully connected layers adds global dependencies in the generated images. This may lead to high and global variations in the generated sample for small local variations in the input noise. In this work we propose to use architec-tures based on fully convolutional networks (including among others dilated layers), architectures specifically designed to generate globally ergodic images, that is images without global dependencies. Conducted experiments reveal that these architectures are well suited for generating natural textures such as geologic structures ."
Generative Modeling and Inverse Imaging of Cardiac Transmembrane Potential,"Noninvasive reconstruction of cardiac transmembrane potential (TMP) from surface electrocardiograms (ECG) involves an ill-posed inverse problem. Model-constrained regularization is powerful for incorporating rich physiological knowledge about spatiotemporal TMP dynamics. These models are controlled by high-dimensional physical parameters which, if fixed, can introduce model errors and reduce the accuracy of TMP reconstruction. Simultaneous adaptation of these parameters during TMP reconstruction, however, is difficult due to their high dimensionality. We introduce a novel model-constrained inference framework that replaces conventional physiological models with a deep generative model trained to generate TMP sequences from low-dimensional generative factors. Using a variational auto-encoder (VAE) with long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, we train the VAE decoder to learn the conditional likelihood of TMP, while the encoder learns the prior distribution of generative factors. These two components allow us to develop an efficient algorithm to simultaneously infer the generative factors and TMP signals from ECG data. Synthetic and real-data experiments demonstrate that the presented method significantly improve the accuracy of TMP reconstruction compared with methods constrained by conventional physiological models or without physiological constraints."
Generative Adversarial Networks and Conditional Random Fields for Hyperspectral Image Classification,"In this paper, we address the hyperspectral image (HSI) classification task with a generative adversarial network and conditional random field (GAN-CRF) -based framework, which integrates a semi-supervised deep learning and a probabilistic graphical model, and make three contributions. First, we design four types of convolutional and transposed convolutional layers that consider the characteristics of HSIs to help with extracting discriminative features from limited numbers of labeled HSI samples. Second, we construct semi-supervised GANs to alleviate the shortage of training samples by adding labels to them and implicitly reconstructing real HSI data distribution through adversarial training. Third, we build dense conditional random fields (CRFs) on top of the random variables that are initialized to the softmax predictions of the trained GANs and are conditioned on HSIs to refine classification maps. This semi-supervised framework leverages the merits of discriminative and generative models through a game-theoretical approach. Moreover, even though we used very small numbers of labeled training HSI samples from the two most challenging and extensively studied datasets, the experimental results demonstrated that spectral-spatial GAN-CRF (SS-GAN-CRF) models achieved top-ranking accuracy for semi-supervised HSI classification."
"Ink removal from histopathology whole slide images by combining classification, detection and image generation models","Histopathology slides are routinely marked by pathologists using permanent ink markers that should not be removed as they form part of the medical record. Often tumour regions are marked up for the purpose of highlighting features or other downstream processing such an gene sequencing. Once digitised there is no established method for removing this information from the whole slide images limiting its usability in research and study. Removal of marker ink from these high-resolution whole slide images is non-trivial and complex problem as they contaminate different regions and in an inconsistent manner. We propose an efficient pipeline using convolution neural networks that results in ink-free images without compromising information and image resolution. Our pipeline includes a sequential classical convolution neural network for accurate classification of contaminated image tiles, a fast region detector and a domain adaptive cycle consistent adversarial generative model for restoration of foreground pixels. Both quantitative and qualitative results on four different whole slide images show that our approach yields visually coherent ink-free whole slide images."
Interactive Image Generation Using Scene Graphs,Recent years have witnessed some exciting developments in the domain of generating images from scene-based text descriptions. These approaches have primarily focused on generating images from a static text description and are limited to generating images in a single pass. They are unable to generate an image interactively based on an incrementally additive text description (something that is more intuitive and similar to the way we describe an image). We propose a method to generate an image incrementally based on a sequence of graphs of scene descriptions (scene-graphs). We propose a recurrent network architecture that preserves the image content generated in previous steps and modifies the cumulative image as per the newly provided scene information. Our model utilizes Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) to cater to variable-sized scene graphs along with Generative Adversarial image translation networks to generate realistic multi-object images without needing any intermediate supervision during training. We experiment with Coco-Stuff dataset which has multi-object images along with annotations describing the visual scene and show that our model significantly outperforms other approaches on the same dataset in generating visually consistent images for incrementally growing scene graphs.
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation using Generative Adversarial Networks for Semantic Segmentation of Aerial Images,"Segmenting aerial images is being of great potential in surveillance and scene understanding of urban areas. It provides a mean for automatic reporting of the different events that happen in inhabited areas. This remarkably promotes public safety and traffic management applications. After the wide adoption of convolutional neural networks methods, the accuracy of semantic segmentation algorithms could easily surpass 80% if a robust dataset is provided. Despite this success, the deployment of a pre-trained segmentation model to survey a new city that is not included in the training set significantly decreases the accuracy. This is due to the domain shift between the source dataset on which the model is trained and the new target domain of the new city images. In this paper, we address this issue and consider the challenge of domain adaptation in semantic segmentation of aerial images. We design an algorithm that reduces the domain shift impact using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). In the experiments, we test the proposed methodology on the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS) semantic segmentation dataset and found that our method improves the overall accuracy from 35% to 52% when passing from Potsdam domain (considered as source domain) to Vaihingen domain (considered as target domain). In addition, the method allows recovering efficiently the inverted classes due to sensor variation. In particular, it improves the average segmentation accuracy of the inverted classes due to sensor variation from 14% to 61%."
Generative Reversible Data Hiding by Image to Image Translation via GANs,"The traditional reversible data hiding technique is based on cover image modification which inevitably leaves some traces of rewriting that can be more easily analyzed and attacked by the warder. Inspired by the cover synthesis steganography based generative adversarial networks, in this paper, a novel generative reversible data hiding scheme (GRDH) by image translation is proposed. First, an image generator is used to obtain a realistic image, which is used as an input to the image-to-image translation model with CycleGAN. After image translation, a stego image with different semantic information will be obtained. The secret message and the original input image can be recovered separately by a well-trained message extractor and the inverse transform of the image translation. Experimental results have verified the effectiveness of the scheme."
Attention-based Fusion for Multi-source Human Image Generation,"We present a generalization of the person-image generation task, in which a human image is generated conditioned on a target pose and a set X of source appearance images. In this way, we can exploit multiple, possibly complementary images of the same person which are usually available at training and at testing time. The solution we propose is mainly based on a local attention mechanism which selects relevant information from different source image regions, avoiding the necessity to build specific generators for each specific cardinality of X. The empirical evaluation of our method shows the practical interest of addressing the person-image generation problem in a multi-source setting."
Caveats in Generating Medical Imaging Labels from Radiology Reports,"Acquiring high-quality annotations in medical imaging is usually a costly process. Automatic label extraction with natural language processing (NLP) has emerged as a promising workaround to bypass the need of expert annotation. Despite the convenience, the limitation of such an approximation has not been carefully examined and is not well understood. With a challenging set of 1,000 chest X-ray studies and their corresponding radiology reports, we show that there exists a surprisingly large discrepancy between what radiologists visually perceive and what they clinically report. Furthermore, with inherently flawed report as ground truth, the state-of-the-art medical NLP fails to produce high-fidelity labels."
GETNET: A General End-to-end Two-dimensional CNN Framework for Hyperspectral Image Change Detection,"Change detection (CD) is an important application of remote sensing, which provides timely change information about large-scale Earth surface. With the emergence of hyperspectral imagery, CD technology has been greatly promoted, as hyperspectral data with the highspectral resolution are capable of detecting finer changes than using the traditional multispectral imagery. Nevertheless, the high dimension of hyperspectral data makes it difficult to implement traditional CD algorithms. Besides, endmember abundance information at subpixel level is often not fully utilized. In order to better handle high dimension problem and explore abundance information, this paper presents a General End-to-end Two-dimensional CNN (GETNET) framework for hyperspectral image change detection (HSI-CD). The main contributions of this work are threefold: 1) Mixed-affinity matrix that integrates subpixel representation is introduced to mine more cross-channel gradient features and fuse multi-source information; 2) 2-D CNN is designed to learn the discriminative features effectively from multi-source data at a higher level and enhance the generalization ability of the proposed CD algorithm; 3) A new HSI-CD data set is designed for the objective comparison of different methods. Experimental results on real hyperspectral data sets demonstrate the proposed method outperforms most of the state-of-the-arts."
PasteGAN: A Semi-Parametric Method to Generate Image from Scene Graph,"Despite some exciting progress on high-quality image generation from structured(scene graphs) or free-form(sentences) descriptions, most of them only guarantee the image-level semantical consistency, i.e. the generated image matching the semantic meaning of the description. They still lack the investigations on synthesizing the images in a more controllable way, like finely manipulating the visual appearance of every object. Therefore, to generate the images with preferred objects and rich interactions, we propose a semi-parametric method, PasteGAN, for generating the image from the scene graph and the image crops, where spatial arrangements of the objects and their pair-wise relationships are defined by the scene graph and the object appearances are determined by the given object crops. To enhance the interactions of the objects in the output, we design a Crop Refining Network and an Object-Image Fuser to embed the objects as well as their relationships into one map. Multiple losses work collaboratively to guarantee the generated images highly respecting the crops and complying with the scene graphs while maintaining excellent image quality. A crop selector is also proposed to pick the most-compatible crops from our external object tank by encoding the interactions around the objects in the scene graph if the crops are not provided. Evaluated on Visual Genome and COCO-Stuff dataset, our proposed method significantly outperforms the SOTA methods on Inception Score, Diversity Score and Fréchet Inception Distance. Extensive experiments also demonstrate our method's ability to generate complex and diverse images with given objects."
SinGAN: Learning a Generative Model from a Single Natural Image,"We introduce SinGAN, an unconditional generative model that can be learned from a single natural image. Our model is trained to capture the internal distribution of patches within the image, and is then able to generate high quality, diverse samples that carry the same visual content as the image. SinGAN contains a pyramid of fully convolutional GANs, each responsible for learning the patch distribution at a different scale of the image. This allows generating new samples of arbitrary size and aspect ratio, that have significant variability, yet maintain both the global structure and the fine textures of the training image. In contrast to previous single image GAN schemes, our approach is not limited to texture images, and is not conditional (i.e. it generates samples from noise). User studies confirm that the generated samples are commonly confused to be real images. We illustrate the utility of SinGAN in a wide range of image manipulation tasks."
Estimation of Tissue Oxygen Saturation from RGB images and Sparse Hyperspectral Signals based on Conditional Generative Adversarial Network,"Purpose: Intra-operative measurement of tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) is important in the detection of ischemia, monitoring perfusion and identifying disease. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) measures the optical reflectance spectrum of the tissue and uses this information to quantify its composition, including StO2. However, real-time monitoring is difficult due to the capture rate and data processing time. Methods: An endoscopic system based on a multi-fiber probe was previously developed to sparsely capture HSI data (sHSI). These were combined with RGB images, via a deep neural network, to generate high-resolution hypercubes and calculate StO2. To improve accuracy and processing speed, we propose a dual-input conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN), Dual2StO2, to directly estimate StO2 by fusing features from both RGB and sHSI. Results: Validation experiments were carried out on in vivo porcine bowel data, where the ground truth StO2 was generated from the HSI camera. The performance was also compared to our previous super-spectral-resolution network, SSRNet in terms of mean StO2 prediction accuracy and structural similarity metrics. Dual2StO2 was also tested using simulated probe data with varying fiber number. Conclusions: StO2 estimation by Dual2StO2 is visually closer to ground truth in general structure, achieves higher prediction accuracy and faster processing speed than SSRNet. Simulations showed that results improved when a greater number of fibers are used in the probe. Future work will include refinement of the network architecture, hardware optimization based on simulation results, and evaluation of the technique in clinical applications beyond StO2 estimation."
Appearance and Pose-Conditioned Human Image Generation using Deformable GANs,"In this paper, we address the problem of generating person images conditioned on both pose and appearance information. Specifically, given an image xa of a person and a target pose P(xb), extracted from a different image xb, we synthesize a new image of that person in pose P(xb), while preserving the visual details in xa. In order to deal with pixel-to-pixel misalignments caused by the pose differences between P(xa) and P(xb), we introduce deformable skip connections in the generator of our Generative Adversarial Network. Moreover, a nearest-neighbour loss is proposed instead of the common L1 and L2 losses in order to match the details of the generated image with the target image. Quantitative and qualitative results, using common datasets and protocols recently proposed for this task, show that our approach is competitive with respect to the state of the art. Moreover, we conduct an extensive evaluation using off-the-shell person re-identification (Re-ID) systems trained with person-generation based augmented data, which is one of the main important applications for this task. Our experiments show that our Deformable GANs can significantly boost the Re-ID accuracy and are even better than data-augmentation methods specifically trained using Re-ID losses."
Accurate and Robust Alignment of Variable-stained Histologic Images Using a General-purpose Greedy Diffeomorphic Registration Tool,"Variously stained histology slices are routinely used by pathologists to assess extracted tissue samples from various anatomical sites and determine the presence or extent of a disease. Evaluation of sequential slides is expected to enable a better understanding of the spatial arrangement and growth patterns of cells and vessels. In this paper we present a practical two-step approach based on diffeomorphic registration to align digitized sequential histopathology stained slides to each other, starting with an initial affine step followed by the estimation of a detailed deformation field."
Face Video Generation from a Single Image and Landmarks,"In this paper we are concerned with the challenging problem of producing a full image sequence of a deformable face given only an image and generic facial motions encoded by a set of sparse landmarks. To this end we build upon recent breakthroughs in image-to-image translation such as pix2pix, CycleGAN and StarGAN which learn Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) that learn to map aligned pairs or images between different domains (i.e., having different labels) and propose a new architecture which is not driven any more by labels but by spatial maps, facial landmarks. In particular, we propose the MotionGAN which transforms an input face image into a new one according to a heatmap of target landmarks. We show that it is possible to create very realistic face videos using a single image and a set of target landmarks. Furthermore, our method can be used to edit a facial image with arbitrary motions according to landmarks (e.g., expression, speech, etc.). This provides much more flexibility to face editing, expression transfer, facial video creation, etc. than models based on discrete expressions, audios or action units."
The utility of a convolutional neural network for generating a myelin volume index map from rapid simultaneous relaxometry imaging,"Background and Purpose: A current algorithm to obtain a synthetic myelin volume fraction map (SyMVF) from rapid simultaneous relaxometry imaging (RSRI) has a potential problem, that it does not incorporate information from surrounding pixels. The purpose of this study was to develop a method that utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) to overcome this problem. Methods: RSRI and magnetization transfer images from 20 healthy volunteers were included. A CNN was trained to reconstruct RSRI-related metric maps into a myelin volume-related index (generated myelin volume index: GenMVI) map using the myelin volume index map calculated from magnetization transfer images (MTMVI) as reference. The SyMVF and GenMVI maps were statistically compared by testing how well they correlated with the MTMVI map. The correlations were evaluated based on: (i) averaged values obtained from 164 atlas-based ROIs, and (ii) pixel-based comparison for ROIs defined in four different tissue types (cortical and subcortical gray matter, white matter, and whole brain). Results: For atlas-based ROIs, the overall correlation with the MTMVI map was higher for the GenMVI map than for the SyMVF map. In the pixel-based comparison, correlation with the MTMVI map was stronger for the GenMVI map than for the SyMVF map, and the difference in the distribution for the volunteers was significant (Wilcoxon sign-rank test, P<.001) in all tissue types. Conclusion: The proposed method is useful, as it can incorporate more specific information about local tissue properties than the existing method."
Improving benchmarks for autonomous vehicles testing using synthetically generated images,"Nowadays autonomous technologies are a very heavily explored area and particularly computer vision as the main component of vehicle perception. The quality of the whole vision system based on neural networks relies on the dataset it was trained on. It is extremely difficult to find traffic sign datasets from most of the counties of the world. Meaning autonomous vehicle from the USA will not be able to drive though Lithuania recognizing all road signs on the way. In this paper, we propose a solution on how to update model using a small dataset from the country vehicle will be used in. It is important to mention that is not panacea, rather small upgrade which can boost autonomous car development in countries with limited data access. We achieved about 10 percent quality raise and expect even better results during future experiments."
Three dimensional blind image deconvolution for fluorescence microscopy using generative adversarial networks,"Due to image blurring image deconvolution is often used for studying biological structures in fluorescence microscopy. Fluorescence microscopy image volumes inherently suffer from intensity inhomogeneity, blur, and are corrupted by various types of noise which exacerbate image quality at deeper tissue depth. Therefore, quantitative analysis of fluorescence microscopy in deeper tissue still remains a challenge. This paper presents a three dimensional blind image deconvolution method for fluorescence microscopy using 3-way spatially constrained cycle-consistent adversarial networks. The restored volumes of the proposed deconvolution method and other well-known deconvolution methods, denoising methods, and an inhomogeneity correction method are visually and numerically evaluated. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method can restore and improve the quality of blurred and noisy deep depth microscopy image visually and quantitatively."
3G structure for image caption generation,"It is a big challenge of computer vision to make machine automatically describe the content of an image with a natural language sentence. Previous works have made great progress on this task, but they only use the global or local image feature, which may lose some important subtle or global information of an image. In this paper, we propose a model with 3-gated model which fuses the global and local image features together for the task of image caption generation. The model mainly has three gated structures. 1) Gate for the global image feature, which can adaptively decide when and how much the global image feature should be imported into the sentence generator. 2) The gated recurrent neural network (RNN) is used as the sentence generator. 3) The gated feedback method for stacking RNN is employed to increase the capability of nonlinearity fitting. More specially, the global and local image features are combined together in this paper, which makes full use of the image information. The global image feature is controlled by the first gate and the local image feature is selected by the attention mechanism. With the latter two gates, the relationship between image and text can be well explored, which improves the performance of the language part as well as the multi-modal embedding part. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art for image caption generation."
Generating Training Data for Denoising Real RGB Images via Camera Pipeline Simulation,"Image reconstruction techniques such as denoising often need to be applied to the RGB output of cameras and cellphones. Unfortunately, the commonly used additive white noise (AWGN) models do not accurately reproduce the noise and the degradation encountered on these inputs. This is particularly important for learning-based techniques, because the mismatch between training and real world data will hurt their generalization. This paper aims to accurately simulate the degradation and noise transformation performed by camera pipelines. This allows us to generate realistic degradation in RGB images that can be used to train machine learning models. We use our simulation to study the importance of noise modeling for learning-based denoising. Our study shows that a realistic noise model is required for learning to denoise real JPEG images. A neural network trained on realistic noise outperforms the one trained with AWGN by 3 dB. An ablation study of our pipeline shows that simulating denoising and demosaicking is important to this improvement and that realistic demosaicking algorithms, which have been rarely considered, is needed. We believe this simulation will also be useful for other image reconstruction tasks, and we will distribute our code publicly."
Generative Model for Zero-Shot Sketch-Based Image Retrieval,"We present a probabilistic model for Sketch-Based Image Retrieval (SBIR) where, at retrieval time, we are given sketches from novel classes, that were not present at training time. Existing SBIR methods, most of which rely on learning class-wise correspondences between sketches and images, typically work well only for previously seen sketch classes, and result in poor retrieval performance on novel classes. To address this, we propose a generative model that learns to generate images, conditioned on a given novel class sketch. This enables us to reduce the SBIR problem to a standard image-to-image search problem. Our model is based on an inverse auto-regressive flow based variational autoencoder, with a feedback mechanism to ensure robust image generation. We evaluate our model on two very challenging datasets, Sketchy, and TU Berlin, with novel train-test split. The proposed approach significantly outperforms various baselines on both the datasets."
Saliency Prediction on Omnidirectional Images with Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning,"When watching omnidirectional images (ODIs), subjects can access different viewports by moving their heads. Therefore, it is necessary to predict subjects' head fixations on ODIs. Inspired by generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL), this paper proposes a novel approach to predict saliency of head fixations on ODIs, named SalGAIL. First, we establish a dataset for attention on ODIs (AOI). In contrast to traditional datasets, our AOI dataset is large-scale, which contains the head fixations of 30 subjects viewing 600 ODIs. Next, we mine our AOI dataset and determine three findings: (1) The consistency of head fixations are consistent among subjects, and it grows alongside the increased subject number; (2) The head fixations exist with a front center bias (FCB); and (3) The magnitude of head movement is similar across subjects. According to these findings, our SalGAIL approach applies deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to predict the head fixations of one subject, in which GAIL learns the reward of DRL, rather than the traditional human-designed reward. Then, multi-stream DRL is developed to yield the head fixations of different subjects, and the saliency map of an ODI is generated via convoluting predicted head fixations. Finally, experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach in predicting saliency maps of ODIs, significantly better than 10 state-of-the-art approaches."
Towards Photographic Image Manipulation with Balanced Growing of Generative Autoencoders,"We present a generative autoencoder that provides fast encoding, faithful reconstructions (eg. retaining the identity of a face), sharp generated/reconstructed samples in high resolutions, and a well-structured latent space that supports semantic manipulation of the inputs. There are no current autoencoder or GAN models that satisfactorily achieve all of these. We build on the progressively growing autoencoder model PIONEER, for which we completely alter the training dynamics based on a careful analysis of recently introduced normalization schemes. We show significantly improved visual and quantitative results for face identity conservation in CelebAHQ. Our model achieves state-of-the-art disentanglement of latent space, both quantitatively and via realistic image attribute manipulations. On the LSUN Bedrooms dataset, we improve the disentanglement performance of the vanilla PIONEER, despite having a simpler model. Overall, our results indicate that the PIONEER networks provide a way towards photorealistic face manipulation."
Extreme Image Coding via Multiscale Autoencoders With Generative Adversarial Optimization,"We propose a MultiScale AutoEncoder(MSAE) based extreme image compression framework to offer visually pleasing reconstruction at a very low bitrate. Our method leverages the ""priors"" at different resolution scale to improve the compression efficiency, and also employs the generative adversarial network(GAN) with multiscale discriminators to perform the end-to-end trainable rate-distortion optimization. We compare the perceptual quality of our reconstructions with traditional compression algorithms using High-Efficiency Video Coding(HEVC) based Intra Profile and JPEG2000 on the public Cityscapes and ADE20K datasets, demonstrating the significant subjective quality improvement."
Unsupervised Person Image Generation with Semantic Parsing Transformation,"In this paper, we address unsupervised pose-guided person image generation, which is known challenging due to non-rigid deformation. Unlike previous methods learning a rock-hard direct mapping between human bodies, we propose a new pathway to decompose the hard mapping into two more accessible subtasks, namely, semantic parsing transformation and appearance generation. Firstly, a semantic generative network is proposed to transform between semantic parsing maps, in order to simplify the non-rigid deformation learning. Secondly, an appearance generative network learns to synthesize semantic-aware textures. Thirdly, we demonstrate that training our framework in an end-to-end manner further refines the semantic maps and final results accordingly. Our method is generalizable to other semantic-aware person image generation tasks, eg, clothing texture transfer and controlled image manipulation. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method on DeepFashion and Market-1501 datasets, especially in keeping the clothing attributes and better body shapes."
Progressive Pose Attention Transfer for Person Image Generation,"This paper proposes a new generative adversarial network for pose transfer, i.e., transferring the pose of a given person to a target pose. The generator of the network comprises a sequence of Pose-Attentional Transfer Blocks that each transfers certain regions it attends to, generating the person image progressively. Compared with those in previous works, our generated person images possess better appearance consistency and shape consistency with the input images, thus significantly more realistic-looking. The efficacy and efficiency of the proposed network are validated both qualitatively and quantitatively on Market-1501 and DeepFashion. Furthermore, the proposed architecture can generate training images for person re-identification, alleviating data insufficiency. Codes and models are available at: https://github.com/tengteng95/Pose-Transfer.git."
UU-Nets Connecting Discriminator and Generator for Image to Image Translation,"Adversarial generative model have successfully manifest itself in image synthesis. However, the performance deteriorate and unstable, because discriminator is far stable than generator, and it is hard to control the game between the two modules. Various methods have been introduced to tackle the problem such as WGAN, Relativistic GAN and their successors by adding or restricting the loss function, which certainly help balance the min-max game, but they all focused on the loss function ignoring the intrinsic structure limitation. We present a UU-Net architecture inspired by U-net bridging the encoder and the decoder, UU-Net composed by two U-Net liked modules respectively served as generator and discriminator. Because the modules in U-net are symmetrical, therefore it shares weights easily between all four components. Thanks to UU-net's modules identical and symmetric property, we could not only carried the features from inner generator's encoder to its decoder, but also to the discriminator's encoder and decoder. By this design, it give us more control and condition flexibility to intervene the process between the generator and the discriminator."
Constrained Generative Adversarial Networks for Interactive Image Generation,"Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have received a great deal of attention due in part to recent success in generating original, high-quality samples from visual domains. However, most current methods only allow for users to guide this image generation process through limited interactions. In this work we develop a novel GAN framework that allows humans to be ""in-the-loop"" of the image generation process. Our technique iteratively accepts relative constraints of the form ""Generate an image more like image A than image B"". After each constraint is given, the user is presented with new outputs from the GAN, informing the next round of feedback. This feedback is used to constrain the output of the GAN with respect to an underlying semantic space that can be designed to model a variety of different notions of similarity (e.g. classes, attributes, object relationships, color, etc.). In our experiments, we show that our GAN framework is able to generate images that are of comparable quality to equivalent unsupervised GANs while satisfying a large number of the constraints provided by users, effectively changing a GAN into one that allows users interactive control over image generation without sacrificing image quality."
Learning Physics-Based Manipulation in Clutter: Combining Image-Based Generalization and Look-Ahead Planning,"Physics-based manipulation in clutter involves complex interaction between multiple objects. In this paper, we consider the problem of learning, from interaction in a physics simulator, manipulation skills to solve this multi-step sequential decision making problem in the real world. Our approach has two key properties: (i) the ability to generalize and transfer manipulation skills (over the type, shape, and number of objects in the scene) using an abstract image-based representation that enables a neural network to learn useful features; and (ii) the ability to perform look-ahead planning in the image space using a physics simulator, which is essential for such multi-step problems. We show, in sets of simulated and real-world experiments (video available on https://youtu.be/EmkUQfyvwkY), that by learning to evaluate actions in an abstract image-based representation of the real world, the robot can generalize and adapt to the object shapes in challenging real-world environments."
Conditional Adversarial Generative Flow for Controllable Image Synthesis,"Flow-based generative models show great potential in image synthesis due to its reversible pipeline and exact log-likelihood target, yet it suffers from weak ability for conditional image synthesis, especially for multi-label or unaware conditions. This is because the potential distribution of image conditions is hard to measure precisely from its latent variable z. In this paper, based on modeling a joint probabilistic density of an image and its conditions, we propose a novel flow-based generative model named conditional adversarial generative flow (CAGlow). Instead of disentangling attributes from latent space, we blaze a new trail for learning an encoder to estimate the mapping from condition space to latent space in an adversarial manner. Given a specific condition c, CAGlow can encode it to a sampled z, and then enable robust conditional image synthesis in complex situations like combining person identity with multiple attributes. The proposed CAGlow can be implemented in both supervised and unsupervised manners, thus can synthesize images with conditional information like categories, attributes, and even some unknown properties. Extensive experiments show that CAGlow ensures the independence of different conditions and outperforms regular Glow to a significant extent."
Image Generation From Small Datasets via Batch Statistics Adaptation,"Thanks to the recent development of deep generative models, it is becoming possible to generate high-quality images with both fidelity and diversity. However, the training of such generative models requires a large dataset. To reduce the amount of data required, we propose a new method for transferring prior knowledge of the pre-trained generator, which is trained with a large dataset, to a small dataset in a different domain. Using such prior knowledge, the model can generate images leveraging some common sense that cannot be acquired from a small dataset. In this work, we propose a novel method focusing on the parameters for batch statistics, scale and shift, of the hidden layers in the generator. By training only these parameters in a supervised manner, we achieved stable training of the generator, and our method can generate higher quality images compared to previous methods without collapsing, even when the dataset is small (~100). Our results show that the diversity of the filters acquired in the pre-trained generator is important for the performance on the target domain. Our method makes it possible to add a new class or domain to a pre-trained generator without disturbing the performance on the original domain."
A Strong Baseline for Domain Adaptation and Generalization in Medical Imaging,"This work provides a strong baseline for the problem of multi-source multi-target domain adaptation and generalization in medical imaging. Using a diverse collection of ten chest X-ray datasets, we empirically demonstrate the benefits of training medical imaging deep learning models on varied patient populations for generalization to out-of-sample domains."
Semantics Disentangling for Text-to-Image Generation,"Synthesizing photo-realistic images from text descriptions is a challenging problem. Previous studies have shown remarkable progresses on visual quality of the generated images. In this paper, we consider semantics from the input text descriptions in helping render photo-realistic images. However, diverse linguistic expressions pose challenges in extracting consistent semantics even they depict the same thing. To this end, we propose a novel photo-realistic text-to-image generation model that implicitly disentangles semantics to both fulfill the high-level semantic consistency and low-level semantic diversity. To be specific, we design (1) a Siamese mechanism in the discriminator to learn consistent high-level semantics, and (2) a visual-semantic embedding strategy by semantic-conditioned batch normalization to find diverse low-level semantics. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on CUB and MS-COCO datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in comparison to state-of-the-art methods."
DM-GAN: Dynamic Memory Generative Adversarial Networks for Text-to-Image Synthesis,"In this paper, we focus on generating realistic images from text descriptions. Current methods first generate an initial image with rough shape and color, and then refine the initial image to a high-resolution one. Most existing text-to-image synthesis methods have two main problems. (1) These methods depend heavily on the quality of the initial images. If the initial image is not well initialized, the following processes can hardly refine the image to a satisfactory quality. (2) Each word contributes a different level of importance when depicting different image contents, however, unchanged text representation is used in existing image refinement processes. In this paper, we propose the Dynamic Memory Generative Adversarial Network (DM-GAN) to generate high-quality images. The proposed method introduces a dynamic memory module to refine fuzzy image contents, when the initial images are not well generated. A memory writing gate is designed to select the important text information based on the initial image content, which enables our method to accurately generate images from the text description. We also utilize a response gate to adaptively fuse the information read from the memories and the image features. We evaluate the DM-GAN model on the Caltech-UCSD Birds 200 dataset and the Microsoft Common Objects in Context dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our DM-GAN model performs favorably against the state-of-the-art approaches."
k-Same-Siamese-GAN: k-Same Algorithm with Generative Adversarial Network for Facial Image De-identification with Hyperparameter Tuning and Mixed Precision Training,"For a data holder, such as a hospital or a government entity, who has a privately held collection of personal data, in which the revealing and/or processing of the personal identifiable data is restricted and prohibited by law. Then, ""how can we ensure the data holder does conceal the identity of each individual in the imagery of personal data while still preserving certain useful aspects of the data after de-identification?"" becomes a challenge issue. In this work, we propose an approach towards high-resolution facial image de-identification, called k-Same-Siamese-GAN, which leverages the k-Same-Anonymity mechanism, the Generative Adversarial Network, and the hyperparameter tuning methods. Moreover, to speed up model training and reduce memory consumption, the mixed precision training technique is also applied to make kSS-GAN provide guarantees regarding privacy protection on close-form identities and be trained much more efficiently as well. Finally, to validate its applicability, the proposed work has been applied to actual datasets - RafD and CelebA for performance testing. Besides protecting privacy of high-resolution facial images, the proposed system is also justified for its ability in automating parameter tuning and breaking through the limitation of the number of adjustable parameters."
Scene Graph Generation with External Knowledge and Image Reconstruction,"Scene graph generation has received growing attention with the advancements in image understanding tasks such as object detection, attributes and relationship prediction,~\etc. However, existing datasets are biased in terms of object and relationship labels, or often come with noisy and missing annotations, which makes the development of a reliable scene graph prediction model very challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel scene graph generation algorithm with external knowledge and image reconstruction loss to overcome these dataset issues. In particular, we extract commonsense knowledge from the external knowledge base to refine object and phrase features for improving generalizability in scene graph generation. To address the bias of noisy object annotations, we introduce an auxiliary image reconstruction path to regularize the scene graph generation network. Extensive experiments show that our framework can generate better scene graphs, achieving the state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets: Visual Relationship Detection and Visual Genome datasets."
Attention-Guided Generative Adversarial Networks for Unsupervised Image-to-Image Translation,"The state-of-the-art approaches in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are able to learn a mapping function from one image domain to another with unpaired image data. However, these methods often produce artifacts and can only be able to convert low-level information, but fail to transfer high-level semantic part of images. The reason is mainly that generators do not have the ability to detect the most discriminative semantic part of images, which thus makes the generated images with low-quality. To handle the limitation, in this paper we propose a novel Attention-Guided Generative Adversarial Network (AGGAN), which can detect the most discriminative semantic object and minimize changes of unwanted part for semantic manipulation problems without using extra data and models. The attention-guided generators in AGGAN are able to produce attention masks via a built-in attention mechanism, and then fuse the input image with the attention mask to obtain a target image with high-quality. Moreover, we propose a novel attention-guided discriminator which only considers attended regions. The proposed AGGAN is trained by an end-to-end fashion with an adversarial loss, cycle-consistency loss, pixel loss and attention loss. Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that our approach is effective to generate sharper and more accurate images than existing models. The code is available at https://github.com/Ha0Tang/AttentionGAN."
Auto-Embedding Generative Adversarial Networks for High Resolution Image Synthesis,"Generating images via the generative adversarial network (GAN) has attracted much attention recently. However, most of the existing GAN-based methods can only produce low-resolution images of limited quality. Directly generating high-resolution images using GANs is nontrivial, and often produces problematic images with incomplete objects. To address this issue, we develop a novel GAN called Auto-Embedding Generative Adversarial Network (AEGAN), which simultaneously encodes the global structure features and captures the fine-grained details. In our network, we use an autoencoder to learn the intrinsic high-level structure of real images and design a novel denoiser network to provide photo-realistic details for the generated images. In the experiments, we are able to produce 512x512 images of promising quality directly from the input noise. The resultant images exhibit better perceptual photo-realism, i.e., with sharper structure and richer details, than other baselines on several datasets, including Oxford-102 Flowers, Caltech-UCSD Birds (CUB), High-Quality Large-scale CelebFaces Attributes (CelebA-HQ), Large-scale Scene Understanding (LSUN) and ImageNet."
"Knowledge-driven Encode, Retrieve, Paraphrase for Medical Image Report Generation","Generating long and semantic-coherent reports to describe medical images poses great challenges towards bridging visual and linguistic modalities, incorporating medical domain knowledge, and generating realistic and accurate descriptions. We propose a novel Knowledge-driven Encode, Retrieve, Paraphrase (KERP) approach which reconciles traditional knowledge- and retrieval-based methods with modern learning-based methods for accurate and robust medical report generation. Specifically, KERP decomposes medical report generation into explicit medical abnormality graph learning and subsequent natural language modeling. KERP first employs an Encode module that transforms visual features into a structured abnormality graph by incorporating prior medical knowledge; then a Retrieve module that retrieves text templates based on the detected abnormalities; and lastly, a Paraphrase module that rewrites the templates according to specific cases. The core of KERP is a proposed generic implementation unit---Graph Transformer (GTR) that dynamically transforms high-level semantics between graph-structured data of multiple domains such as knowledge graphs, images and sequences. Experiments show that the proposed approach generates structured and robust reports supported with accurate abnormality description and explainable attentive regions, achieving the state-of-the-art results on two medical report benchmarks, with the best medical abnormality and disease classification accuracy and improved human evaluation performance."
Bilinear Representation for Language-based Image Editing Using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks,"The task of Language-Based Image Editing (LBIE) aims at generating a target image by editing the source image based on the given language description. The main challenge of LBIE is to disentangle the semantics in image and text and then combine them to generate realistic images. Therefore, the editing performance is heavily dependent on the learned representation. In this work, conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) is utilized for LBIE. We find that existing conditioning methods in cGAN lack of representation power as they cannot learn the second-order correlation between two conditioning vectors. To solve this problem, we propose an improved conditional layer named Bilinear Residual Layer (BRL) to learning more powerful representations for LBIE task. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons demonstrate that our method can generate images with higher quality when compared to previous LBIE techniques."
Detecting GAN generated Fake Images using Co-occurrence Matrices,"The advent of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) has brought about completely novel ways of transforming and manipulating pixels in digital images. GAN based techniques such as Image-to-Image translations, DeepFakes, and other automated methods have become increasingly popular in creating fake images. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to detect GAN generated fake images using a combination of co-occurrence matrices and deep learning. We extract co-occurrence matrices on three color channels in the pixel domain and train a model using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) framework. Experimental results on two diverse and challenging GAN datasets comprising more than 56,000 images based on unpaired image-to-image translations (cycleGAN [1]) and facial attributes/expressions (StarGAN [2]) show that our approach is promising and achieves more than 99% classification accuracy in both datasets. Further, our approach also generalizes well and achieves good results when trained on one dataset and tested on the other."
Generate What You Can't See - a View-dependent Image Generation,"In order to operate autonomously, a robot should explore the environment and build a model of each of the surrounding objects. A common approach is to carefully scan the whole workspace. This is time-consuming. It is also often impossible to reach all the viewpoints required to acquire full knowledge about the environment. Humans can perform shape completion of occluded objects by relying on past experience. Therefore, we propose a method that generates images of an object from various viewpoints using a single input RGB image. A deep neural network is trained to imagine the object appearance from many viewpoints. We present the whole pipeline, which takes a single RGB image as input and returns a sequence of RGB and depth images of the object. The method utilizes a CNN-based object detector to extract the object from the natural scene. Then, the proposed network generates a set of RGB and depth images. We show the results both on a synthetic dataset and on real images."
Phenotypic Profiling of High Throughput Imaging Screens with Generic Deep Convolutional Features,"While deep learning has seen many recent applications to drug discovery, most have focused on predicting activity or toxicity directly from chemical structure. Phenotypic changes exhibited in cellular images are also indications of the mechanism of action (MoA) of chemical compounds. In this paper, we show how pre-trained convolutional image features can be used to assist scientists in discovering interesting chemical clusters for further investigation. Our method reduces the dimensionality of raw fluorescent stained images from a high throughput imaging (HTI) screen, producing an embedding space that groups together images with similar cellular phenotypes. Running standard unsupervised clustering on this embedding space yields a set of distinct phenotypic clusters. This allows scientists to further select and focus on interesting clusters for downstream analyses. We validate the consistency of our embedding space qualitatively with t-sne visualizations, and quantitatively by measuring embedding variance among images that are known to be similar. Results suggested the usefulness of our proposed workflow using deep learning and clustering and it can lead to robust HTI screening and compound triage."
Unpaired image denoising using a generative adversarial network in X-ray CT,"This paper proposes a deep learning-based denoising method for noisy low-dose computerized tomography (CT) images in the absence of paired training data. The proposed method uses a fidelity-embedded generative adversarial network (GAN) to learn a denoising function from unpaired training data of low-dose CT (LDCT) and standard-dose CT (SDCT) images, where the denoising function is the optimal generator in the GAN framework. This paper analyzes the f-GAN objective to derive a suitable generator that is optimized by minimizing a weighted sum of two losses: the Kullback-Leibler divergence between an SDCT data distribution and a generated distribution, and the \ell_2 loss between the LDCT image and the corresponding generated images (or denoised image). The computed generator reflects the prior belief about SDCT data distribution through training. We observed that the proposed method allows the preservation of fine anomalous features while eliminating noise. The experimental results show that the proposed deep-learning method with unpaired datasets performs comparably to a method using paired datasets. A clinical experiment was also performed to show the validity of the proposed method for noise arising in the low-dose X-ray CT."
MirrorGAN: Learning Text-to-image Generation by Redescription,"Generating an image from a given text description has two goals: visual realism and semantic consistency. Although significant progress has been made in generating high-quality and visually realistic images using generative adversarial networks, guaranteeing semantic consistency between the text description and visual content remains very challenging. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a novel global-local attentive and semantic-preserving text-to-image-to-text framework called MirrorGAN. MirrorGAN exploits the idea of learning text-to-image generation by redescription and consists of three modules: a semantic text embedding module (STEM), a global-local collaborative attentive module for cascaded image generation (GLAM), and a semantic text regeneration and alignment module (STREAM). STEM generates word- and sentence-level embeddings. GLAM has a cascaded architecture for generating target images from coarse to fine scales, leveraging both local word attention and global sentence attention to progressively enhance the diversity and semantic consistency of the generated images. STREAM seeks to regenerate the text description from the generated image, which semantically aligns with the given text description. Thorough experiments on two public benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of MirrorGAN over other representative state-of-the-art methods."
Mode Seeking Generative Adversarial Networks for Diverse Image Synthesis,"Most conditional generation tasks expect diverse outputs given a single conditional context. However, conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) often focus on the prior conditional information and ignore the input noise vectors, which contribute to the output variations. Recent attempts to resolve the mode collapse issue for cGANs are usually task-specific and computationally expensive. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective regularization term to address the mode collapse issue for cGANs. The proposed method explicitly maximizes the ratio of the distance between generated images with respect to the corresponding latent codes, thus encouraging the generators to explore more minor modes during training. This mode seeking regularization term is readily applicable to various conditional generation tasks without imposing training overhead or modifying the original network structures. We validate the proposed algorithm on three conditional image synthesis tasks including categorical generation, image-to-image translation, and text-to-image synthesis with different baseline models. Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed regularization method for improving diversity without loss of quality."
A Skeleton-bridged Deep Learning Approach for Generating Meshes of Complex Topologies from Single RGB Images,"This paper focuses on the challenging task of learning 3D object surface reconstructions from single RGB images. Existing methods achieve varying degrees of success by using different geometric representations. However, they all have their own drawbacks, and cannot well reconstruct those surfaces of complex topologies. To this end, we propose in this paper a skeleton-bridged, stage-wise learning approach to address the challenge. Our use of skeleton is due to its nice property of topology preservation, while being of lower complexity to learn. To learn skeleton from an input image, we design a deep architecture whose decoder is based on a novel design of parallel streams respectively for synthesis of curve- and surface-like skeleton points. We use different shape representations of point cloud, volume, and mesh in our stage-wise learning, in order to take their respective advantages. We also propose multi-stage use of the input image to correct prediction errors that are possibly accumulated in each stage. We conduct intensive experiments to investigate the efficacy of our proposed approach. Qualitative and quantitative results on representative object categories of both simple and complex topologies demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing ones. We will make our ShapeNet-Skeleton dataset publicly available."
Generating superpixels using deep image representations,"Superpixel algorithms are a common pre-processing step for computer vision algorithms such as segmentation, object tracking and localization. Many superpixel methods only rely on colors features for segmentation, limiting performance in low-contrast regions and applicability to infrared or medical images where object boundaries have wide appearance variability. We study the inclusion of deep image features in the SLIC superpixel algorithm to exploit higher-level image representations. In addition, we devise a trainable superpixel algorithm, yielding an intermediate domain-specific image representation that can be applied to different tasks. A clustering-based superpixel algorithm is transformed into a pixel-wise classification task and superpixel training data is derived from semantic segmentation datasets. Our results demonstrate that this approach is able to improve superpixel quality consistently."
Investigation on Combining 3D Convolution of Image Data and Optical Flow to Generate Temporal Action Proposals,"In this paper, several variants of two-stream architectures for temporal action proposal generation in long, untrimmed videos are presented. Inspired by the recent advances in the field of human action recognition utilizing 3D convolutions in combination with two-stream networks and based on the Single-Stream Temporal Action Proposals (SST) architecture, four different two-stream architectures utilizing sequences of images on one stream and sequences of images of optical flow on the other stream are subsequently investigated. The four architectures fuse the two separate streams at different depths in the model; for each of them, a broad range of parameters is investigated systematically as well as an optimal parametrization is empirically determined. The experiments on the THUMOS'14 dataset show that all four two-stream architectures are able to outperform the original single-stream SST and achieve state of the art results. Additional experiments revealed that the improvements are not restricted to a single method of calculating optical flow by exchanging the formerly used method of Brox with FlowNet2 and still achieving improvements."
Improving Generalization of Deep Networks for Inverse Reconstruction of Image Sequences,"Deep learning networks have shown state-of-the-art performance in many image reconstruction problems. However, it is not well understood what properties of representation and learning may improve the generalization ability of the network. In this paper, we propose that the generalization ability of an encoder-decoder network for inverse reconstruction can be improved in two means. First, drawing from analytical learning theory, we theoretically show that a stochastic latent space will improve the ability of a network to generalize to test data outside the training distribution. Second, following the information bottleneck principle, we show that a latent representation minimally informative of the input data will help a network generalize to unseen input variations that are irrelevant to the output reconstruction. Therefore, we present a sequence image reconstruction network optimized by a variational approximation of the information bottleneck principle with stochastic latent space. In the application setting of reconstructing the sequence of cardiac transmembrane potential from bodysurface potential, we assess the two types of generalization abilities of the presented network against its deterministic counterpart. The results demonstrate that the generalization ability of an inverse reconstruction network can be improved by stochasticity as well as the information bottleneck."
High-Fidelity Image Generation With Fewer Labels,"Deep generative models are becoming a cornerstone of modern machine learning. Recent work on conditional generative adversarial networks has shown that learning complex, high-dimensional distributions over natural images is within reach. While the latest models are able to generate high-fidelity, diverse natural images at high resolution, they rely on a vast quantity of labeled data. In this work we demonstrate how one can benefit from recent work on self- and semi-supervised learning to outperform the state of the art on both unsupervised ImageNet synthesis, as well as in the conditional setting. In particular, the proposed approach is able to match the sample quality (as measured by FID) of the current state-of-the-art conditional model BigGAN on ImageNet using only 10% of the labels and outperform it using 20% of the labels."
DepthwiseGANs: Fast Training Generative Adversarial Networks for Realistic Image Synthesis,"Recent work has shown significant progress in the direction of synthetic data generation using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). GANs have been applied in many fields of computer vision including text-to-image conversion, domain transfer, super-resolution, and image-to-video applications. In computer vision, traditional GANs are based on deep convolutional neural networks. However, deep convolutional neural networks can require extensive computational resources because they are based on multiple operations performed by convolutional layers, which can consist of millions of trainable parameters. Training a GAN model can be difficult and it takes a significant amount of time to reach an equilibrium point. In this paper, we investigate the use of depthwise separable convolutions to reduce training time while maintaining data generation performance. Our results show that a DepthwiseGAN architecture can generate realistic images in shorter training periods when compared to a StarGan architecture, but that model capacity still plays a significant role in generative modelling. In addition, we show that depthwise separable convolutions perform best when only applied to the generator. For quality evaluation of generated images, we use the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), which compares the similarity between the generated image distribution and that of the training dataset."
Matching Thermal to Visible Face Images Using a Semantic-Guided Generative Adversarial Network,"Designing face recognition systems that are capable of matching face images obtained in the thermal spectrum with those obtained in the visible spectrum is a challenging problem. In this work, we propose the use of semantic-guided generative adversarial network (SG-GAN) to automatically synthesize visible face images from their thermal counterparts. Specifically, semantic labels, extracted by a face parsing network, are used to compute a semantic loss function to regularize the adversarial network during training. These semantic cues denote high-level facial component information associated with each pixel. Further, an identity extraction network is leveraged to generate multi-scale features to compute an identity loss function. To achieve photo-realistic results, a perceptual loss function is introduced during network training to ensure that the synthesized visible face is perceptually similar to the target visible face image. We extensively evaluate the benefits of individual loss functions, and combine them effectively to learn the mapping from thermal to visible face images. Experiments involving two multispectral face datasets show that the proposed method achieves promising results in both face synthesis and cross-spectral face matching."
Single Image Haze Removal Using Conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks,"We present a method to restore a clear image from a haze-affected image using a Wasserstein generative adversarial network. As the problem is ill-conditioned, previous methods have required a prior on natural images or multiple images of the same scene. We train a generative adversarial network to learn the probability distribution of clear images conditioned on the haze-affected images using the Wasserstein loss function, using a gradient penalty to enforce the Lipschitz constraint. The method is data-adaptive, end-to-end, and requires no further processing or tuning of parameters. We also incorporate the use of a texture-based loss metric and the L1 loss to improve results, and show that our results are better than the current state-of-the-art."
Adversarial Generation of Handwritten Text Images Conditioned on Sequences,"State-of-the-art offline handwriting text recognition systems tend to use neural networks and therefore require a large amount of annotated data to be trained. In order to partially satisfy this requirement, we propose a system based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to produce synthetic images of handwritten words. We use bidirectional LSTM recurrent layers to get an embedding of the word to be rendered, and we feed it to the generator network. We also modify the standard GAN by adding an auxiliary network for text recognition. The system is then trained with a balanced combination of an adversarial loss and a CTC loss. Together, these extensions to GAN enable to control the textual content of the generated word images. We obtain realistic images on both French and Arabic datasets, and we show that integrating these synthetic images into the existing training data of a text recognition system can slightly enhance its performance."
Two-phase Hair Image Synthesis by Self-Enhancing Generative Model,"Generating plausible hair image given limited guidance, such as sparse sketches or low-resolution image, has been made possible with the rise of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Traditional image-to-image translation networks can generate recognizable results, but finer textures are usually lost and blur artifacts commonly exist. In this paper, we propose a two-phase generative model for high-quality hair image synthesis. The two-phase pipeline first generates a coarse image by an existing image translation model, then applies a re-generating network with self-enhancing capability to the coarse image. The self-enhancing capability is achieved by a proposed structure extraction layer, which extracts the texture and orientation map from a hair image. Extensive experiments on two tasks, Sketch2Hair and Hair Super-Resolution, demonstrate that our approach is able to synthesize plausible hair image with finer details, and outperforms the state-of-the-art."
On the generalization of GAN image forensics,"Recently the GAN generated face images are more and more realistic with high-quality, even hard for human eyes to detect. On the other hand, the forensics community keeps on developing methods to detect these generated fake images and try to guarantee the credibility of visual contents. Although researchers have developed some methods to detect generated images, few of them explore the important problem of generalization ability of forensics model. As new types of GANs are emerging fast, the generalization ability of forensics models to detect new types of GAN images is absolutely an essential research topic. In this paper, we explore this problem and propose to use preprocessed images to train a forensic CNN model. By applying similar image level preprocessing to both real and fake training images, the forensics model is forced to learn more intrinsic features to classify the generated and real face images. Our experimental results also prove the effectiveness of the proposed method."
A Generative Map for Image-based Camera Localization,"In image-based camera localization systems, information about the environment is usually stored in some representation, which can be referred to as a map. Conventionally, most maps are built upon hand-crafted features. Recently, neural networks have attracted attention as a data-driven map representation, and have shown promising results in visual localization. However, these neural network maps are generally hard to interpret by human. A readable map is not only accessible to humans, but also provides a way to be verified when the ground truth pose is unavailable. To tackle this problem, we propose Generative Map, a new framework for learning human-readable neural network maps, by combining a generative model with the Kalman filter, which also allows it to incorporate additional sensor information such as stereo visual odometry. For evaluation, we use real world images from the 7-Scenes and Oxford RobotCar datasets. We demonstrate that our Generative Map can be queried with a pose of interest from the test sequence to predict an image, which closely resembles the true scene. For localization, we show that Generative Map achieves comparable performance with current regression models. Moreover, our framework is trained completely from scratch, unlike regression models which rely on large ImageNet pretrained networks."
Semi-Supervised Multitask Learning on Multispectral Satellite Images Using Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for Predicting Poverty,"Obtaining reliable data describing local poverty metrics at a granularity that is informative to policy-makers requires expensive and logistically difficult surveys, particularly in the developing world. Not surprisingly, the poverty stricken regions are also the ones which have a high probability of being a war zone, have poor infrastructure and sometimes have governments that do not cooperate with internationally funded development efforts. We train a CNN on free and publicly available daytime satellite images of the African continent from Landsat 7 to build a model for predicting local economic livelihoods. Only 5% of the satellite images can be associated with labels (which are obtained from DHS Surveys) and thus a semi-supervised approach using a GAN (similar to the approach of Salimans, et al. (2016)), albeit with a more stable-to-train flavor of GANs called the Wasserstein GAN regularized with gradient penalty(Gulrajani, et al. (2017)) is used. The method of multitask learning is employed to regularize the network and also create an end-to-end model for the prediction of multiple poverty metrics."
Generative Collaborative Networks for Single Image Super-Resolution,"A common issue of deep neural networks-based methods for the problem of Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR), is the recovery of finer texture details when super-resolving at large upscaling factors. This issue is particularly related to the choice of the objective loss function. In particular, recent works proposed the use of a VGG loss which consists in minimizing the error between the generated high resolution images and ground-truth in the feature space of a Convolutional Neural Network (VGG19), pre-trained on the very ""large"" ImageNet dataset. When considering the problem of super-resolving images with a distribution ""far"" from the ImageNet images distribution (\textit{e.g.,} satellite images), their proposed \textit{fixed} VGG loss is no longer relevant. In this paper, we present a general framework named \textit{Generative Collaborative Networks} (GCN), where the idea consists in optimizing the \textit{generator} (the mapping of interest) in the feature space of a \textit{features extractor} network. The two networks (generator and extractor) are \textit{collaborative} in the sense that the latter ""helps"" the former, by constructing discriminative and relevant features (not necessarily \textit{fixed} and possibly learned \textit{mutually} with the generator). We evaluate the GCN framework in the context of SISR, and we show that it results in a method that is adapted to super-resolution domains that are ""far"" from the ImageNet domain."
Efficient Fully Convolution Neural Network for Generating Pixel Wise Robotic Grasps With High Resolution Images,"This paper presents an efficient neural network model to generate robotic grasps with high resolution images. The proposed model uses fully convolution neural network to generate robotic grasps for each pixel using 400 \times 400 high resolution RGB-D images. It first down-sample the images to get features and then up-sample those features to the original size of the input as well as combines local and global features from different feature maps. Compared to other regression or classification methods for detecting robotic grasps, our method looks more like the segmentation methods which solves the problem through pixel-wise ways. We use Cornell Grasp Dataset to train and evaluate the model and get high accuracy about 94.42% for image-wise and 91.02% for object-wise and fast prediction time about 8ms. We also demonstrate that without training on the multiple objects dataset, our model can directly output robotic grasps candidates for different objects because of the pixel wise implementation."
A Dictionary-Based Generalization of Robust PCA with Applications to Target Localization in Hyperspectral Imaging,"We consider the decomposition of a data matrix assumed to be a superposition of a low-rank matrix and a component which is sparse in a known dictionary, using a convex demixing method. We consider two sparsity structures for the sparse factor of the dictionary sparse component, namely entry-wise and column-wise sparsity, and provide a unified analysis, encompassing both undercomplete and the overcomplete dictionary cases, to show that the constituent matrices can be successfully recovered under some relatively mild conditions on incoherence, sparsity, and rank. We leverage these results to localize targets of interest in a hyperspectral (HS) image based on their spectral signature(s) using the a priori known characteristic spectral responses of the target. We corroborate our theoretical results and analyze target localization performance of our approach via experimental evaluations and comparisons to related techniques."
Vibrotactile Signal Generation from Texture Images or Attributes using Generative Adversarial Network,"Providing vibrotactile feedback that corresponds to the state of the virtual texture surfaces allows users to sense haptic properties of them. However, hand-tuning such vibrotactile stimuli for every state of the texture takes much time. Therefore, we propose a new approach to create models that realize the automatic vibrotactile generation from texture images or attributes. In this paper, we make the first attempt to generate the vibrotactile stimuli leveraging the power of deep generative adversarial training. Specifically, we use conditional generative adversarial networks (GANs) to achieve generation of vibration during moving a pen on the surface. The preliminary user study showed that users could not discriminate generated signals and genuine ones and users felt realism for generated signals. Thus our model could provide the appropriate vibration according to the texture images or the attributes of them. Our approach is applicable to any case where the users touch the various surfaces in a predefined way."
Generative Adversarial Networks Synthesize Realistic OCT Images of the Retina,"We report, to our knowledge, the first end-to-end application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) towards the synthesis of Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images of the retina. Generative models have gained recent attention for the increasingly realistic images they can synthesize, given a sampling of a data type. In this paper, we apply GANs to a sampling distribution of OCTs of the retina. We observe the synthesis of realistic OCT images depicting recognizable pathology such as macular holes, choroidal neovascular membranes, myopic degeneration, cystoid macular edema, and central serous retinopathy amongst others. This represents the first such report of its kind. Potential applications of this new technology include for surgical simulation, for treatment planning, for disease prognostication, and for accelerating the development of new drugs and surgical procedures to treat retinal disease."
Detecting Colorized Images via Convolutional Neural Networks: Toward High Accuracy and Good Generalization,"Image colorization achieves more and more realistic results with the increasing computation power of recent deep learning techniques. It becomes more difficult to identify the fake colorized images by human eyes. In this work, we propose a novel forensic method to distinguish between natural images (NIs) and colorized images (CIs) based on convolutional neural network (CNN). Our method is able to achieve high classification accuracy and cope with the challenging scenario of blind detection, i.e., no training sample is available from ""unknown"" colorization algorithm that we may encounter during the testing phase. This blind detection performance can be regarded as a generalization performance. First, we design and implement a base network, which can attain better performance in terms of classification accuracy and generalization (in most cases) compared with state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we design a new branch, which analyzes smaller regions of extracted features, and insert it into the above base network. Consequently, our network can not only improve the classification accuracy, but also enhance the generalization in the vast majority of cases. To further improve the performance of blind detection, we propose to automatically construct negative samples through linear interpolation of paired natural and colorized images. Then, we progressively insert these negative samples into the original training dataset and continue to train the network. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve stable and high generalization performance when tested against different state-of-the-art colorization algorithms."
Quick and Easy Time Series Generation with Established Image-based GANs,"In the recent years Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have demonstrated significant progress in generating authentic looking data. In this work we introduce our simple method to exploit the advancements in well established image-based GANs to synthesise single channel time series data. We implement Wasserstein GANs (WGANs) with gradient penalty due to their stability in training to synthesise three different types of data; sinusoidal data, photoplethysmograph (PPG) data and electrocardiograph (ECG) data. The length of the returned time series data is limited only by the image resolution, we use an image size of 64x64 pixels which yields 4096 data points. We present both visual and quantitative evidence that our novel method can successfully generate time series data using image-based GANs."
GeoGAN: A Conditional GAN with Reconstruction and Style Loss to Generate Standard Layer of Maps from Satellite Images,"Automatically generating maps from satellite images is an important task. There is a body of literature which tries to address this challenge. We created a more expansive survey of the task by experimenting with different models and adding new loss functions to improve results. We created a database of pairs of satellite images and the corresponding map of the area. Our model translates the satellite image to the corresponding standard layer map image using three main model architectures: (i) a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) which compresses the images down to a learned embedding, (ii) a generator which is trained as a normalizing flow (RealNVP) model, and (iii) a conditional GAN where the generator translates via a series of convolutions to the standard layer of a map and the discriminator input is the concatenation of the real/generated map and the satellite image. Model (iii) was by far the most promising of three models. To improve the results we also added a reconstruction loss and style transfer loss in addition to the GAN losses. The third model architecture produced the best quality of sampled images. In contrast to the other generative model where evaluation of the model is a challenging problem. since we have access to the real map for a given satellite image, we are able to assign a quantitative metric to the quality of the generated images in addition to inspecting them visually. While we are continuing to work on increasing the accuracy of the model, one challenge has been the coarse resolution of the data which upper-bounds the quality of the results of our model. Nevertheless, as will be seen in the results, the generated map is more accurate in the features it produces since the generator architecture demands a pixel-wise image translation/pixel-wise coloring.

Adversarially Approximated Autoencoder for Image Generation and Manipulation,"Regularized autoencoders learn the latent codes, a structure with the regularization under the distribution, which enables them the capability to infer the latent codes given observations and generate new samples given the codes. However, they are sometimes ambiguous as they tend to produce reconstructions that are not necessarily faithful reproduction of the inputs. The main reason is to enforce the learned latent code distribution to match a prior distribution while the true distribution remains unknown. To improve the reconstruction quality and learn the latent space a manifold structure, this work present a novel approach using the adversarially approximated autoencoder (AAAE) to investigate the latent codes with adversarial approximation. Instead of regularizing the latent codes by penalizing on the distance between the distributions of the model and the target, AAAE learns the autoencoder flexibly and approximates the latent space with a simpler generator. The ratio is estimated using generative adversarial network (GAN) to enforce the similarity of the distributions. Additionally, the image space is regularized with an additional adversarial regularizer. The proposed approach unifies two deep generative models for both latent space inference and diverse generation. The learning scheme is realized without regularization on the latent codes, which also encourages faithful reconstruction. Extensive validation experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of AAAE. In comparison to the state-of-the-art approaches, AAAE generates samples with better quality and shares the properties of regularized autoencoder with a nice latent manifold structure."
Realistic Image Generation using Region-phrase Attention,"The Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) has recently been applied to generate synthetic images from text. Despite significant advances, most current state-of-the-art algorithms are regular-grid region based; when attention is used, it is mainly applied between individual regular-grid regions and a word. These approaches are sufficient to generate images that contain a single object in its foreground, such as a ""bird"" or ""flower"". However, natural languages often involve complex foreground objects and the background may also constitute a variable portion of the generated image. Therefore, the regular-grid based image attention weights may not necessarily concentrate on the intended foreground region(s), which in turn, results in an unnatural looking image. Additionally, individual words such as ""a"", ""blue"" and ""shirt"" do not necessarily provide a full visual context unless they are applied together. For this reason, in our paper, we proposed a novel method in which we introduced an additional set of attentions between true-grid regions and word phrases. The true-grid region is derived using a set of auxiliary bounding boxes. These auxiliary bounding boxes serve as superior location indicators to where the alignment and attention should be drawn with the word phrases. Word phrases are derived from analysing Part-of-Speech (POS) results. We perform experiments on this novel network architecture using the Microsoft Common Objects in Context (MSCOCO) dataset and the model generates 256 \times 256 conditioned on a short sentence description. Our proposed approach is capable of generating more realistic images compared with the current state-of-the-art algorithms."
Progressively Growing Generative Adversarial Networks for High Resolution Semantic Segmentation of Satellite Images,"Machine learning has proven to be useful in classification and segmentation of images. In this paper, we evaluate a training methodology for pixel-wise segmentation on high resolution satellite images using progressive growing of generative adversarial networks. We apply our model to segmenting building rooftops and compare these results to conventional methods for rooftop segmentation. We present our findings using the SpaceNet version 2 dataset. Progressive GAN training achieved a test accuracy of 93% compared to 89% for traditional GAN training."
Unpriortized Autoencoder For Image Generation,"In this paper, we treat the image generation task using an autoencoder, a representative latent model. Unlike many studies regularizing the latent variable's distribution by assuming a manually specified prior, we approach the image generation task using an autoencoder by directly estimating the latent distribution. To this end, we introduce 'latent density estimator' which captures latent distribution explicitly and propose its structure. Through experiments, we show that our generative model generates images with the improved visual quality compared to previous autoencoder-based generative models."
A system for generating complex physically accurate sensor images for automotive applications,"We describe an open-source simulator that creates sensor irradiance and sensor images of typical automotive scenes in urban settings. The purpose of the system is to support camera design and testing for automotive applications. The user can specify scene parameters (e.g., scene type, road type, traffic density, time of day) to assemble a large number of random scenes from graphics assets stored in a database. The sensor irradiance is generated using quantitative computer graphics methods, and the sensor images are created using image systems sensor simulation. The synthetic sensor images have pixel level annotations; hence, they can be used to train and evaluate neural networks for imaging tasks, such as object detection and classification. The end-to-end simulation system supports quantitative assessment, from scene to camera to network accuracy, for automotive applications."
Synthesizing New Retinal Symptom Images by Multiple Generative Models,"Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is an asymptomatic retinal disease which may result in loss of vision. There is limited access to high-quality relevant retinal images and poor understanding of the features defining sub-classes of this disease. Motivated by recent advances in machine learning we specifically explore the potential of generative modeling, using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and style transferring, to facilitate clinical diagnosis and disease understanding by feature extraction. We design an analytic pipeline which first generates synthetic retinal images from clinical images; a subsequent verification step is applied. In the synthesizing step we merge GANs (DCGANs and WGANs architectures) and style transferring for the image generation, whereas the verified step controls the accuracy of the generated images. We find that the generated images contain sufficient pathological details to facilitate ophthalmologists' task of disease classification and in discovery of disease relevant features. In particular, our system predicts the drusen and geographic atrophy sub-classes of AMD. Furthermore, the performance using CFP images for GANs outperforms the classification based on using only the original clinical dataset. Our results are evaluated using existing classifier of retinal diseases and class activated maps, supporting the predictive power of the synthetic images and their utility for feature extraction. Our code examples are available online."
Depth-Map Generation using Pixel Matching in Stereoscopic Pair of Images,"Modern day multimedia content generation and dissemination is moving towards the presentation of more and more `realistic' scenarios. The switch from 2-dimensional (2D) to 3-dimensional (3D) has been a major driving force in that direction. Over the recent past, a large number of approaches have been proposed for creating 3D images/videos most of which are based on the generation of depth-maps. This paper presents a new algorithm for obtaining depth information pertaining to a depicted scene from a set of available pair of stereoscopic images. The proposed algorithm performs a pixel-to-pixel matching of the two images in the stereo pair for estimation of depth. It is shown that the obtained depth-maps show improvements over the reported counterparts."
Image Decomposition and Classification through a Generative Model,"We demonstrate in this paper that a generative model can be designed to perform classification tasks under challenging settings, including adversarial attacks and input distribution shifts. Specifically, we propose a conditional variational autoencoder that learns both the decomposition of inputs and the distributions of the resulting components. During test, we jointly optimize the latent variables of the generator and the relaxed component labels to find the best match between the given input and the output of the generator. The model demonstrates promising performance at recognizing overlapping components from the multiMNIST dataset, and novel component combinations from a traffic sign dataset. Experiments also show that the proposed model achieves high robustness on MNIST and NORB datasets, in particular for high-strength gradient attacks and non-gradient attacks."
Beholder-GAN: Generation and Beautification of Facial Images with Conditioning on Their Beauty Level,"Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. This maxim, emphasizing the subjectivity of the perception of beauty, has enjoyed a wide consensus since ancient times. In the digitalera, data-driven methods have been shown to be able to predict human-assigned beauty scores for facial images. In this work, we augment this ability and train a generative model that generates faces conditioned on a requested beauty score. In addition, we show how this trained generator can be used to beautify an input face image. By doing so, we achieve an unsupervised beautification model, in the sense that it relies on no ground truth target images."
Generative Image Translation for Data Augmentation of Bone Lesion Pathology,"Insufficient training data and severe class imbalance are often limiting factors when developing machine learning models for the classification of rare diseases. In this work, we address the problem of classifying bone lesions from X-ray images by increasing the small number of positive samples in the training set. We propose a generative data augmentation approach based on a cycle-consistent generative adversarial network that synthesizes bone lesions on images without pathology. We pose the generative task as an image-patch translation problem that we optimize specifically for distinct bones (humerus, tibia, femur). In experimental results, we confirm that the described method mitigates the class imbalance problem in the binary classification task of bone lesion detection. We show that the augmented training sets enable the training of superior classifiers achieving better performance on a held-out test set. Additionally, we demonstrate the feasibility of transfer learning and apply a generative model that was trained on one body part to another."
Progressive Generative Adversarial Networks for Medical Image Super resolution,"Anatomical landmark segmentation and pathology localization are important steps in automated analysis of medical images. They are particularly challenging when the anatomy or pathology is small, as in retinal images and cardiac MRI, or when the image is of low quality due to device acquisition parameters as in magnetic resonance (MR) scanners. We propose an image super-resolution method using progressive generative adversarial networks (P-GAN) that can take as input a low-resolution image and generate a high resolution image of desired scaling factor. The super resolved images can be used for more accurate detection of landmarks and pathology. Our primary contribution is in proposing a multistage model where the output image quality of one stage is progressively improved in the next stage by using a triplet loss function. The triplet loss enables stepwise image quality improvement by using the output of the previous stage as the baseline. This facilitates generation of super resolved images of high scaling factor while maintaining good image quality. Experimental results for image super-resolution show that our proposed multistage P-GAN outperforms competing methods and baseline GAN."
Medical Image Super-Resolution Using a Generative Adversarial Network,"During the growing popularity of electronic medical records, electronic medical record (EMR) data has exploded increasingly. It is very meaningful to retrieve high quality EMR in mass data. In this paper, an EMR value network with retrieval function is constructed by taking stroke disease as the research object. It mainly includes: 1) It establishes the electronic medical record database and corresponding stroke knowledge graph. 2) The strategy of similarity measurement is included three parts(patients' chief complaint, pathology results and medical images). Patients' chief complaints are text data, mainly describing patients' symptoms and expressed in words or phrases, and patients' chief complaints are input in independent tick of various symptoms. The data of the pathology results is a structured and digitized expression, so the input method is the same as the patient's chief complaint; Image similarity adopts content-based image retrieval(CBIR) technology. 3) The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is used to establish the weights of the three types of data and then synthesize them into an indicator. The accuracy rate of similarity in top 5 was more than 85\% based on EMR database with more 200 stroke records using leave-one-out method. It will be the good tool for assistant diagnosis and doctor training, as good quality records are colleted into the databases, like Doctor Watson, in the future."
Learning to navigate image manifolds induced by generative adversarial networks for unsupervised video generation,"In this work, we introduce a two-step framework for generative modeling of temporal data. Specifically, the generative adversarial networks (GANs) setting is employed to generate synthetic scenes of moving objects. To do so, we propose a two-step training scheme within which: a generator of static frames is trained first. Afterwards, a recurrent model is trained with the goal of providing a sequence of inputs to the previously trained frames generator, thus yielding scenes which look natural. The adversarial setting is employed in both training steps. However, with the aim of avoiding known training instabilities in GANs, a multiple discriminator approach is used to train both models. Results in the studied video dataset indicate that, by employing such an approach, the recurrent part is able to learn how to coherently navigate the image manifold induced by the frames generator, thus yielding more natural-looking scenes."
Generative Adversarial Network with Multi-Branch Discriminator for Cross-Species Image-to-Image Translation,"Current approaches have made great progress on image-to-image translation tasks benefiting from the success of image synthesis methods especially generative adversarial networks (GANs). However, existing methods are limited to handling translation tasks between two species while keeping the content matching on the semantic level. A more challenging task would be the translation among more than two species. To explore this new area, we propose a simple yet effective structure of a multi-branch discriminator for enhancing an arbitrary generative adversarial architecture (GAN), named GAN-MBD. It takes advantage of the boosting strategy to break a common discriminator into several smaller ones with fewer parameters, which can enhance the generation and synthesis abilities of GANs efficiently and effectively. Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed multi-branch discriminator can dramatically improve the performance of popular GANs on cross-species image-to-image translation tasks while reducing the number of parameters for computation. The code and some datasets are attached as supplementary materials for reference."
Evaluating Generalization Ability of Convolutional Neural Networks and Capsule Networks for Image Classification via Top-2 Classification,"Image classification is a challenging problem which aims to identify the category of object in the image. In recent years, deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been applied to handle this task, and impressive improvement has been achieved. However, some research showed the output of CNNs can be easily altered by adding relatively small perturbations to the input image, such as modifying few pixels. Recently, Capsule Networks (CapsNets) are proposed, which can help eliminating this limitation. Experiments on MNIST dataset revealed that capsules can better characterize the features of object than CNNs. But it's hard to find a suitable quantitative method to compare the generalization ability of CNNs and CapsNets. In this paper, we propose a new image classification task called Top-2 classification to evaluate the generalization ability of CNNs and CapsNets. The models are trained on single label image samples same as the traditional image classification task. But in the test stage, we randomly concatenate two test image samples which contain different labels, and then use the trained models to predict the top-2 labels on the unseen newly-created two label image samples. This task can provide us precise quantitative results to compare the generalization ability of CNNs and CapsNets. Back to the CapsNet, because it uses Full Connectivity (FC) mechanism among all capsules, it requires many parameters. To reduce the number of parameters, we introduce the Parameter-Sharing (PS) mechanism between capsules. Experiments on five widely used benchmark image datasets demonstrate the method significantly reduces the number of parameters, without losing the effectiveness of extracting features. Further, on the Top-2 classification task, the proposed PS CapsNets obtain impressive higher accuracy compared to the traditional CNNs and FC CapsNets by a large margin."
TGAN: Deep Tensor Generative Adversarial Nets for Large Image Generation,"Deep generative models have been successfully applied to many applications. However, existing works experience limitations when generating large images (the literature usually generates small images, e.g. 32 * 32 or 128 * 128). In this paper, we propose a novel scheme, called deep tensor adversarial generative nets (TGAN), that generates large high-quality images by exploring tensor structures. Essentially, the adversarial process of TGAN takes place in a tensor space. First, we impose tensor structures for concise image representation, which is superior in capturing the pixel proximity information and the spatial patterns of elementary objects in images, over the vectorization preprocess in existing works. Secondly, we propose TGAN that integrates deep convolutional generative adversarial networks and tensor super-resolution in a cascading manner, to generate high-quality images from random distributions. More specifically, we design a tensor super-resolution process that consists of tensor dictionary learning and tensor coefficients learning. Finally, on three datasets, the proposed TGAN generates images with more realistic textures, compared with state-of-the-art adversarial autoencoders. The size of the generated images is increased by over 8.5 times, namely 374 * 374 in PASCAL2."
Points2Pix: 3D Point-Cloud to Image Translation using conditional Generative Adversarial Networks,"We present the first approach for 3D point-cloud to image translation based on conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGAN). The model handles multi-modal information sources from different domains, i.e. raw point-sets and images. The generator is capable of processing three conditions, whereas the point-cloud is encoded as raw point-set and camera projection. An image background patch is used as constraint to bias environmental texturing. A global approximation function within the generator is directly applied on the point-cloud (Point-Net). Hence, the representative learning model incorporates global 3D characteristics directly at the latent feature space. Conditions are used to bias the background and the viewpoint of the generated image. This opens up new ways in augmenting or texturing 3D data to aim the generation of fully individual images. We successfully evaluated our method on the Kitti and SunRGBD dataset with an outstanding object detection inception score."
CT synthesis from MR images for orthopedic applications in the lower arm using a conditional generative adversarial network,"Purpose: To assess the feasibility of deep learning-based high resolution synthetic CT generation from MRI scans of the lower arm for orthopedic applications.  Methods: A conditional Generative Adversarial Network was trained to synthesize CT images from multi-echo MR images. A training set of MRI and CT scans of 9 ex vivo lower arms was acquired and the CT images were registered to the MRI images. Three-fold cross-validation was applied to generate independent results for the entire dataset. The synthetic CT images were quantitatively evaluated with the mean absolute error metric, and Dice similarity and surface to surface distance on cortical bone segmentations.  Results: The mean absolute error was 63.5 HU on the overall tissue volume and 144.2 HU on the cortical bone. The mean Dice similarity of the cortical bone segmentations was 0.86. The average surface to surface distance between bone on real and synthetic CT was 0.48 mm. Qualitatively, the synthetic CT images corresponded well with the real CT scans and partially maintained high resolution structures in the trabecular bone. The bone segmentations on synthetic CT images showed some false positives on tendons, but the general shape of the bone was accurately reconstructed.  Conclusions: This study demonstrates that high quality synthetic CT can be generated from MRI scans of the lower arm. The good correspondence of the bone segmentations demonstrates that synthetic CT could be competitive with real CT in applications that depend on such segmentations, such as planning of orthopedic surgery and 3D printing."
Toward Joint Image Generation and Compression using Generative Adversarial Networks,"In this paper, we present a generative adversarial network framework that generates compressed images instead of synthesizing raw RGB images and compressing them separately. In the real world, most images and videos are stored and transferred in a compressed format to save storage capacity and data transfer bandwidth. However, since typical generative adversarial networks generate raw RGB images, those generated images need to be compressed by a post-processing stage to reduce the data size. Among image compression methods, JPEG has been one of the most commonly used lossy compression methods for still images. Hence, we propose a novel framework that generates JPEG compressed images using generative adversarial networks. The novel generator consists of the proposed locally connected layers, chroma subsampling layers, quantization layers, residual blocks, and convolution layers. The locally connected layer is proposed to enable block-based operations. We also discuss training strategies for the proposed architecture including the loss function and the transformation between its generator and its discriminator. The proposed method is evaluated using the publicly available CIFAR-10 dataset and LSUN bedroom dataset. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is able to generate compressed data with competitive qualities. The proposed method is a promising baseline method for joint image generation and compression using generative adversarial networks."
Extension of Convolutional Neural Network with General Image Processing Kernels,"We applied pre-defined kernels also known as filters or masks developed for image processing to convolution neural network. Instead of letting neural networks find its own kernels, we used 41 different general-purpose kernels of blurring, edge detecting, sharpening, discrete cosine transformation, etc. for the first layer of the convolution neural networks. This architecture, thus named as general filter convolutional neural network (GFNN), can reduce training time by 30% with a better accuracy compared to the regular convolutional neural network (CNN). GFNN also can be trained to achieve 90% accuracy with only 500 samples. Furthermore, even though these kernels are not specialized for the MNIST dataset, we achieved 99.56% accuracy without ensemble nor any other special algorithms."
Generating Text Sequence Images for Recognition,"Recently, methods based on deep learning have dominated the field of text recognition. With a large number of training data, most of them can achieve the state-of-the-art performances. However, it is hard to harvest and label sufficient text sequence images from the real scenes. To mitigate this issue, several methods to synthesize text sequence images were proposed, yet they usually need complicated preceding or follow-up steps. In this work, we present a method which is able to generate infinite training data without any auxiliary pre/post-process. We tackle the generation task as an image-to-image translation one and utilize conditional adversarial networks to produce realistic text sequence images in the light of the semantic ones. Some evaluation metrics are involved to assess our method and the results demonstrate that the caliber of the data is satisfactory. The code and dataset will be publicly available soon."
"Learning single-image 3D reconstruction by generative modelling of shape, pose and shading","We present a unified framework tackling two problems: class-specific 3D reconstruction from a single image, and generation of new 3D shape samples. These tasks have received considerable attention recently; however, most existing approaches rely on 3D supervision, annotation of 2D images with keypoints or poses, and/or training with multiple views of each object instance. Our framework is very general: it can be trained in similar settings to existing approaches, while also supporting weaker supervision. Importantly, it can be trained purely from 2D images, without pose annotations, and with only a single view per instance. We employ meshes as an output representation, instead of voxels used in most prior work. This allows us to reason over lighting parameters and exploit shading information during training, which previous 2D-supervised methods cannot. Thus, our method can learn to generate and reconstruct concave object classes. We evaluate our approach in various settings, showing that: (i) it learns to disentangle shape from pose and lighting; (ii) using shading in the loss improves performance compared to just silhouettes; (iii) when using a standard single white light, our model outperforms state-of-the-art 2D-supervised methods, both with and without pose supervision, thanks to exploiting shading cues; (iv) performance improves further when using multiple coloured lights, even approaching that of state-of-the-art 3D-supervised methods; (v) shapes produced by our model capture smooth surfaces and fine details better than voxel-based approaches; and (vi) our approach supports concave classes such as bathtubs and sofas, which methods based on silhouettes cannot learn."
Red blood cell image generation for data augmentation using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks,"In this paper, we describe how to apply image-to-image translation techniques to medical blood smear data to generate new data samples and meaningfully increase small datasets. Specifically, given the segmentation mask of the microscopy image, we are able to generate photorealistic images of blood cells which are further used alongside real data during the network training for segmentation and object detection tasks. This image data generation approach is based on conditional generative adversarial networks which have proven capabilities to high-quality image synthesis. In addition to synthesizing blood images, we synthesize segmentation mask as well which leads to a diverse variety of generated samples. The effectiveness of the technique is thoroughly analyzed and quantified through a number of experiments on a manually collected and annotated dataset of blood smear taken under a microscope."
Dual Generator Generative Adversarial Networks for Multi-Domain Image-to-Image Translation,"State-of-the-art methods for image-to-image translation with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can learn a mapping from one domain to another domain using unpaired image data. However, these methods require the training of one specific model for every pair of image domains, which limits the scalability in dealing with more than two image domains. In addition, the training stage of these methods has the common problem of model collapse that degrades the quality of the generated images. To tackle these issues, we propose a Dual Generator Generative Adversarial Network (G^2GAN), which is a robust and scalable approach allowing to perform unpaired image-to-image translation for multiple domains using only dual generators within a single model. Moreover, we explore different optimization losses for better training of G^2GAN, and thus make unpaired image-to-image translation with higher consistency and better stability. Extensive experiments on six publicly available datasets with different scenarios, i.e., architectural buildings, seasons, landscape and human faces, demonstrate that the proposed G^2GAN achieves superior model capacity and better generation performance comparing with existing image-to-image translation GAN models."
Image Based Review Text Generation with Emotional Guidance,"In the current field of computer vision, automatically generating texts from given images has been a fully worked technique. Up till now, most works of this area focus on image content describing, namely image-captioning. However, rare researches focus on generating product review texts, which is ubiquitous in the online shopping malls and is crucial for online shopping selection and evaluation. Different from content describing, review texts include more subjective information of customers, which may bring difference to the results. Therefore, we aimed at a new field concerning generating review text from customers based on images together with the ratings of online shopping products, which appear as non-image attributes. We made several adjustments to the existing image-captioning model to fit our task, in which we should also take non-image features into consideration. We also did experiments based on our model and get effective primary results."
Using Scene Graph Context to Improve Image Generation,"Generating realistic images from scene graphs asks neural networks to be able to reason about object relationships and compositionality. As a relatively new task, how to properly ensure the generated images comply with scene graphs or how to measure task performance remains an open question. In this paper, we propose to harness scene graph context to improve image generation from scene graphs. We introduce a scene graph context network that pools features generated by a graph convolutional neural network that are then provided to both the image generation network and the adversarial loss. With the context network, our model is trained to not only generate realistic looking images, but also to better preserve non-spatial object relationships. We also define two novel evaluation metrics, the relation score and the mean opinion relation score, for this task that directly evaluate scene graph compliance. We use both quantitative and qualitative studies to demonstrate that our pro-posed model outperforms the state-of-the-art on this challenging task."
CSGAN: Cyclic-Synthesized Generative Adversarial Networks for Image-to-Image Transformation,"The primary motivation of Image-to-Image Transformation is to convert an image of one domain to another domain. Most of the research has been focused on the task of image transformation for a set of pre-defined domains. Very few works are reported that actually developed a common framework for image-to-image transformation for different domains. With the introduction of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) as a general framework for the image generation problem, there is a tremendous growth in the area of image-to-image transformation. Most of the research focuses over the suitable objective function for image-to-image transformation. In this paper, we propose a new Cyclic-Synthesized Generative Adversarial Networks (CSGAN) for image-to-image transformation. The proposed CSGAN uses a new objective function (loss) called Cyclic-Synthesized Loss (CS) between the synthesized image of one domain and cycled image of another domain. The performance of the proposed CSGAN is evaluated on two benchmark image-to-image transformation datasets, including CUHK Face dataset and CMP Facades dataset. The results are computed using the widely used evaluation metrics such as MSE, SSIM, PSNR, and LPIPS. The experimental results of the proposed CSGAN approach are compared with the latest state-of-the-art approaches such as GAN, Pix2Pix, DualGAN, CycleGAN and PS2GAN. The proposed CSGAN technique outperforms all the methods over CUHK dataset and exhibits the promising and comparable performance over Facades dataset in terms of both qualitative and quantitative measures. The code is available at https://github.com/KishanKancharagunta/CSGAN."
GILT: Generating Images from Long Text,"Creating an image reflecting the content of a long text is a complex process that requires a sense of creativity. For example, creating a book cover or a movie poster based on their summary or a food image based on its recipe. In this paper we present the new task of generating images from long text that does not describe the visual content of the image directly. For this, we build a system for generating high-resolution 256 \times 256 images of food conditioned on their recipes. The relation between the recipe text (without its title) to the visual content of the image is vague, and the textual structure of recipes is complex, consisting of two sections (ingredients and instructions) both containing multiple sentences.  We used the recipe1M dataset to train and evaluate our model that is based on a the StackGAN-v2 architecture."
Unpaired Pose Guided Human Image Generation,"This paper studies the task of full generative modelling of realistic images of humans, guided only by coarse sketch of the pose, while providing control over the specific instance or type of outfit worn by the user. This is a difficult problem because input and output domain are very different and direct image-to-image translation becomes infeasible. We propose an end-to-end trainable network under the generative adversarial framework, that provides detailed control over the final appearance while not requiring paired training data and hence allows us to forgo the challenging problem of fitting 3D poses to 2D images. The model allows to generate novel samples conditioned on either an image taken from the target domain or a class label indicating the style of clothing (e.g., t-shirt). We thoroughly evaluate the architecture and the contributions of the individual components experimentally. Finally, we show in a large scale perceptual study that our approach can generate realistic looking images and that participants struggle in detecting fake images versus real samples, especially if faces are blurred."
FIGR: Few-shot Image Generation with Reptile,"Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) boast impressive capacity to generate realistic images. However, like much of the field of deep learning, they require an inordinate amount of data to produce results, thereby limiting their usefulness in generating novelty. In the same vein, recent advances in meta-learning have opened the door to many few-shot learning applications. In the present work, we propose Few-shot Image Generation using Reptile (FIGR), a GAN meta-trained with Reptile. Our model successfully generates novel images on both MNIST and Omniglot with as little as 4 images from an unseen class. We further contribute FIGR-8, a new dataset for few-shot image generation, which contains 1,548,944 icons categorized in over 18,409 classes. Trained on FIGR-8, initial results show that our model can generalize to more advanced concepts (such as ""bird"" and ""knife"") from as few as 8 samples from a previously unseen class of images and as little as 10 training steps through those 8 images. This work demonstrates the potential of training a GAN for few-shot image generation and aims to set a new benchmark for future work in the domain."
Understanding the (un)interpretability of natural image distributions using generative models,"Probability density estimation is a classical and well studied problem, but standard density estimation methods have historically lacked the power to model complex and high-dimensional image distributions. More recent generative models leverage the power of neural networks to implicitly learn and represent probability models over complex images. We describe methods to extract explicit probability density estimates from GANs, and explore the properties of these image density functions. We perform sanity check experiments to provide evidence that these probabilities are reasonable. However, we also show that density functions of natural images are difficult to interpret and thus limited in use. We study reasons for this lack of interpretability, and show that we can get interpretability back by doing density estimation on latent representations of images."
Transfer learning from language models to image caption generators: Better models may not transfer better,"When designing a neural caption generator, a convolutional neural network can be used to extract image features. Is it possible to also use a neural language model to extract sentence prefix features? We answer this question by trying different ways to transfer the recurrent neural network and embedding layer from a neural language model to an image caption generator. We find that image caption generators with transferred parameters perform better than those trained from scratch, even when simply pre-training them on the text of the same captions dataset it will later be trained on. We also find that the best language models (in terms of perplexity) do not result in the best caption generators after transfer learning."
EdgeConnect: Generative Image Inpainting with Adversarial Edge Learning,"Over the last few years, deep learning techniques have yielded significant improvements in image inpainting. However, many of these techniques fail to reconstruct reasonable structures as they are commonly over-smoothed and/or blurry. This paper develops a new approach for image inpainting that does a better job of reproducing filled regions exhibiting fine details. We propose a two-stage adversarial model EdgeConnect that comprises of an edge generator followed by an image completion network. The edge generator hallucinates edges of the missing region (both regular and irregular) of the image, and the image completion network fills in the missing regions using hallucinated edges as a priori. We evaluate our model end-to-end over the publicly available datasets CelebA, Places2, and Paris StreetView, and show that it outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques quantitatively and qualitatively. Code and models available at: https://github.com/knazeri/edge-connect"
Finger-GAN: Generating Realistic Fingerprint Images Using Connectivity Imposed GAN,"Generating realistic biometric images has been an interesting and, at the same time, challenging problem. Classical statistical models fail to generate realistic-looking fingerprint images, as they are not powerful enough to capture the complicated texture representation in fingerprint images. In this work, we present a machine learning framework based on generative adversarial networks (GAN), which is able to generate fingerprint images sampled from a prior distribution (learned from a set of training images). We also add a suitable regularization term to the loss function, to impose the connectivity of generated fingerprint images. This is highly desirable for fingerprints, as the lines in each finger are usually connected. We apply this framework to two popular fingerprint databases, and generate images which look very realistic, and similar to the samples in those databases. Through experimental results, we show that the generated fingerprint images have a good diversity, and are able to capture different parts of the prior distribution. We also evaluate the Frechet Inception distance (FID) of our proposed model, and show that our model is able to achieve good quantitative performance in terms of this score."
Non-Adversarial Image Synthesis with Generative Latent Nearest Neighbors,"Unconditional image generation has recently been dominated by generative adversarial networks (GANs). GAN methods train a generator which regresses images from random noise vectors, as well as a discriminator that attempts to differentiate between the generated images and a training set of real images. GANs have shown amazing results at generating realistic looking images. Despite their success, GANs suffer from critical drawbacks including: unstable training and mode-dropping. The weaknesses in GANs have motivated research into alternatives including: variational auto-encoders (VAEs), latent embedding learning methods (e.g. GLO) and nearest-neighbor based implicit maximum likelihood estimation (IMLE). Unfortunately at the moment, GANs still significantly outperform the alternative methods for image generation. In this work, we present a novel method - Generative Latent Nearest Neighbors (GLANN) - for training generative models without adversarial training. GLANN combines the strengths of IMLE and GLO in a way that overcomes the main drawbacks of each method. Consequently, GLANN generates images that are far better than GLO and IMLE. Our method does not suffer from mode collapse which plagues GAN training and is much more stable. Qualitative results show that GLANN outperforms a baseline consisting of 800 GANs and VAEs on commonly used datasets. Our models are also shown to be effective for training truly non-adversarial unsupervised image translation."
Multi-component Image Translation for Deep Domain Generalization,"Domain adaption (DA) and domain generalization (DG) are two closely related methods which are both concerned with the task of assigning labels to an unlabeled data set. The only dissimilarity between these approaches is that DA can access the target data during the training phase, while the target data is totally unseen during the training phase in DG. The task of DG is challenging as we have no earlier knowledge of the target samples. If DA methods are applied directly to DG by a simple exclusion of the target data from training, poor performance will result for a given task. In this paper, we tackle the domain generalization challenge in two ways. In our first approach, we propose a novel deep domain generalization architecture utilizing synthetic data generated by a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The discrepancy between the generated images and synthetic images is minimized using existing domain discrepancy metrics such as maximum mean discrepancy or correlation alignment. In our second approach, we introduce a protocol for applying DA methods to a DG scenario by excluding the target data from the training phase, splitting the source data to training and validation parts, and treating the validation data as target data for DA. We conduct extensive experiments on four cross-domain benchmark datasets. Experimental results signify our proposed model outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods for DG."
Feature Fusion Effects of Tensor Product Representation on (De)Compositional Network for Caption Generation for Images,Progress in image captioning is gradually getting complex as researchers try to generalized the model and define the representation between visual features and natural language processing. This work tried to define such kind of relationship in the form of representation called Tensor Product Representation (TPR) which generalized the scheme of language modeling and structuring the linguistic attributes (related to grammar and parts of speech of language) which will provide a much better structure and grammatically correct sentence. TPR enables better and unique representation and structuring of the feature space and will enable better sentence composition from these representations. A large part of the different ways of defining and improving these TPR are discussed and their performance with respect to the traditional procedures and feature representations are evaluated for image captioning application. The new models achieved considerable improvement than the corresponding previous architectures.
Inverse Cooking: Recipe Generation from Food Images,"People enjoy food photography because they appreciate food. Behind each meal there is a story described in a complex recipe and, unfortunately, by simply looking at a food image we do not have access to its preparation process. Therefore, in this paper we introduce an inverse cooking system that recreates cooking recipes given food images. Our system predicts ingredients as sets by means of a novel architecture, modeling their dependencies without imposing any order, and then generates cooking instructions by attending to both image and its inferred ingredients simultaneously. We extensively evaluate the whole system on the large-scale Recipe1M dataset and show that (1) we improve performance w.r.t. previous baselines for ingredient prediction; (2) we are able to obtain high quality recipes by leveraging both image and ingredients; (3) our system is able to produce more compelling recipes than retrieval-based approaches according to human judgment. We make code and models publicly available."
Iris-GAN: Learning to Generate Realistic Iris Images Using Convolutional GAN,"Generating iris images which look realistic is both an interesting and challenging problem. Most of the classical statistical models are not powerful enough to capture the complicated texture representation in iris images, and therefore fail to generate iris images which look realistic. In this work, we present a machine learning framework based on generative adversarial network (GAN), which is able to generate iris images sampled from a prior distribution (learned from a set of training images). We apply this framework to two popular iris databases, and generate images which look very realistic, and similar to the image distribution in those databases. Through experimental results, we show that the generated iris images have a good diversity, and are able to capture different part of the prior distribution."
Visual Object Networks: Image Generation with Disentangled 3D Representation,"Recent progress in deep generative models has led to tremendous breakthroughs in image generation. However, while existing models can synthesize photorealistic images, they lack an understanding of our underlying 3D world. We present a new generative model, Visual Object Networks (VON), synthesizing natural images of objects with a disentangled 3D representation. Inspired by classic graphics rendering pipelines, we unravel our image formation process into three conditionally independent factors---shape, viewpoint, and texture---and present an end-to-end adversarial learning framework that jointly models 3D shapes and 2D images. Our model first learns to synthesize 3D shapes that are indistinguishable from real shapes. It then renders the object's 2.5D sketches (i.e., silhouette and depth map) from its shape under a sampled viewpoint. Finally, it learns to add realistic texture to these 2.5D sketches to generate natural images. The VON not only generates images that are more realistic than state-of-the-art 2D image synthesis methods, but also enables many 3D operations such as changing the viewpoint of a generated image, editing of shape and texture, linear interpolation in texture and shape space, and transferring appearance across different objects and viewpoints."
General-to-Detailed GAN for Infrequent Class Medical Images,"Deep learning has significant potential for medical imaging. However, since the incident rate of each disease varies widely, the frequency of classes in a medical image dataset is imbalanced, leading to poor accuracy for such infrequent classes. One possible solution is data augmentation of infrequent classes using synthesized images created by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), but conventional GANs also require certain amount of images to learn. To overcome this limitation, here we propose General-to-detailed GAN (GDGAN), serially connected two GANs, one for general labels and the other for detailed labels. GDGAN produced diverse medical images, and the network trained with an augmented dataset outperformed other networks using existing methods with respect to Area-Under-Curve (AUC) of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve."
Generating High Fidelity Images with Subscale Pixel Networks and Multidimensional Upscaling,"The unconditional generation of high fidelity images is a longstanding benchmark for testing the performance of image decoders. Autoregressive image models have been able to generate small images unconditionally, but the extension of these methods to large images where fidelity can be more readily assessed has remained an open problem. Among the major challenges are the capacity to encode the vast previous context and the sheer difficulty of learning a distribution that preserves both global semantic coherence and exactness of detail. To address the former challenge, we propose the Subscale Pixel Network (SPN), a conditional decoder architecture that generates an image as a sequence of sub-images of equal size. The SPN compactly captures image-wide spatial dependencies and requires a fraction of the memory and the computation required by other fully autoregressive models. To address the latter challenge, we propose to use Multidimensional Upscaling to grow an image in both size and depth via intermediate stages utilising distinct SPNs. We evaluate SPNs on the unconditional generation of CelebAHQ of size 256 and of ImageNet from size 32 to 256. We achieve state-of-the-art likelihood results in multiple settings, set up new benchmark results in previously unexplored settings and are able to generate very high fidelity large scale samples on the basis of both datasets."
Deep Inception Generative Network for Cognitive Image Inpainting,"Recent advances in deep learning have shown exciting promise in filling large holes and lead to another orientation for image inpainting. However, existing learning-based methods often create artifacts and fallacious textures because of insufficient cognition understanding. Previous generative networks are limited with single receptive type and give up pooling in consideration of detail sharpness. Human cognition is constant regardless of the target attribute. As multiple receptive fields improve the ability of abstract image characterization and pooling can keep feature invariant, specifically, deep inception learning is adopted to promote high-level feature representation and enhance model learning capacity for local patches. Moreover, approaches for generating diverse mask images are introduced and a random mask dataset is created. We benchmark our methods on ImageNet, Places2 dataset, and CelebA-HQ. Experiments for regular, irregular, and custom regions completion are all performed and free-style image inpainting is also presented. Quantitative comparisons with previous state-of-the-art methods show that ours obtain much more natural image completions."
Semantic Image Inpainting Through Improved Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks,"Image inpainting is the task of filling-in missing regions of a damaged or incomplete image. In this work we tackle this problem not only by using the available visual data but also by incorporating image semantics through the use of generative models. Our contribution is twofold: First, we learn a data latent space by training an improved version of the Wasserstein generative adversarial network, for which we incorporate a new generator and discriminator architecture. Second, the learned semantic information is combined with a new optimization loss for inpainting whose minimization infers the missing content conditioned by the available data. It takes into account powerful contextual and perceptual content inherent in the image itself. The benefits include the ability to recover large regions by accumulating semantic information even it is not fully present in the damaged image. Experiments show that the presented method obtains qualitative and quantitative top-tier results in different experimental situations and also achieves accurate photo-realism comparable to state-of-the-art works."
Image-based model parameter optimization using Model-Assisted Generative Adversarial Networks,"We propose and demonstrate the use of a model-assisted generative adversarial network (GAN) to produce fake images that accurately match true images through the variation of the parameters of the model that describes the features of the images. The generator learns the model parameter values that produce fake images that best match the true images. Two case studies show excellent agreement between the generated best match parameters and the true parameters. The best match model parameter values can be used to retune the default simulation to minimize any bias when applying image recognition techniques to fake and true images. In the case of a real-world experiment, the true images are experimental data with unknown true model parameter values, and the fake images are produced by a simulation that takes the model parameters as input. The model-assisted GAN uses a convolutional neural network to emulate the simulation for all parameter values that, when trained, can be used as a conditional generator for fast fake-image production."
FSNet: An Identity-Aware Generative Model for Image-based Face Swapping,"This paper presents FSNet, a deep generative model for image-based face swapping. Traditionally, face-swapping methods are based on three-dimensional morphable models (3DMMs), and facial textures are replaced between the estimated three-dimensional (3D) geometries in two images of different individuals. However, the estimation of 3D geometries along with different lighting conditions using 3DMMs is still a difficult task. We herein represent the face region with a latent variable that is assigned with the proposed deep neural network (DNN) instead of facial textures. The proposed DNN synthesizes a face-swapped image using the latent variable of the face region and another image of the non-face region. The proposed method is not required to fit to the 3DMM; additionally, it performs face swapping only by feeding two face images to the proposed network. Consequently, our DNN-based face swapping performs better than previous approaches for challenging inputs with different face orientations and lighting conditions. Through several experiments, we demonstrated that the proposed method performs face swapping in a more stable manner than the state-of-the-art method, and that its results are compatible with the method thereof."
Shape-conditioned Image Generation by Learning Latent Appearance Representation from Unpaired Data,"Conditional image generation is effective for diverse tasks including training data synthesis for learning-based computer vision. However, despite the recent advances in generative adversarial networks (GANs), it is still a challenging task to generate images with detailed conditioning on object shapes. Existing methods for conditional image generation use category labels and/or keypoints and are only give limited control over object categories. In this work, we present SCGAN, an architecture to generate images with a desired shape specified by an input normal map. The shape-conditioned image generation task is achieved by explicitly modeling the image appearance via a latent appearance vector. The network is trained using unpaired training samples of real images and rendered normal maps. This approach enables us to generate images of arbitrary object categories with the target shape and diverse image appearances. We show the effectiveness of our method through both qualitative and quantitative evaluation on training data generation tasks."
Coordinate-based Texture Inpainting for Pose-Guided Image Generation,"We present a new deep learning approach to pose-guided resynthesis of human photographs. At the heart of the new approach is the estimation of the complete body surface texture based on a single photograph. Since the input photograph always observes only a part of the surface, we suggest a new inpainting method that completes the texture of the human body. Rather than working directly with colors of texture elements, the inpainting network estimates an appropriate source location in the input image for each element of the body surface. This correspondence field between the input image and the texture is then further warped into the target image coordinate frame based on the desired pose, effectively establishing the correspondence between the source and the target view even when the pose change is drastic. The final convolutional network then uses the established correspondence and all other available information to synthesize the output image. A fully-convolutional architecture with deformable skip connections guided by the estimated correspondence field is used. We show state-of-the-art result for pose-guided image synthesis. Additionally, we demonstrate the performance of our system for garment transfer and pose-guided face resynthesis."
Image Generation from Layout,"Despite significant recent progress on generative models, controlled generation of images depicting multiple and complex object layouts is still a difficult problem. Among the core challenges are the diversity of appearance a given object may possess and, as a result, exponential set of images consistent with a specified layout. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach for layout-based image generation; we call it Layout2Im. Given the coarse spatial layout (bounding boxes + object categories), our model can generate a set of realistic images which have the correct objects in the desired locations. The representation of each object is disentangled into a specified/certain part (category) and an unspecified/uncertain part (appearance). The category is encoded using a word embedding and the appearance is distilled into a low-dimensional vector sampled from a normal distribution. Individual object representations are composed together using convolutional LSTM, to obtain an encoding of the complete layout, and then decoded to an image. Several loss terms are introduced to encourage accurate and diverse generation. The proposed Layout2Im model significantly outperforms the previous state of the art, boosting the best reported inception score by 24.66% and 28.57% on the very challenging COCO-Stuff and Visual Genome datasets, respectively. Extensive experiments also demonstrate our method's ability to generate complex and diverse images with multiple objects."
Class-Distinct and Class-Mutual Image Generation with GANs,"Class-conditional extensions of generative adversarial networks (GANs), such as auxiliary classifier GAN (AC-GAN) and conditional GAN (cGAN), have garnered attention owing to their ability to decompose representations into class labels and other factors and to boost the training stability. However, a limitation is that they assume that each class is separable and ignore the relationship between classes even though class overlapping frequently occurs in a real-world scenario when data are collected on the basis of diverse or ambiguous criteria. To overcome this limitation, we address a novel problem called class-distinct and class-mutual image generation, in which the goal is to construct a generator that can capture between-class relationships and generate an image selectively conditioned on the class specificity. To solve this problem without additional supervision, we propose classifier's posterior GAN (CP-GAN), in which we redesign the generator input and the objective function of AC-GAN for class-overlapping data. Precisely, we incorporate the classifier's posterior into the generator input and optimize the generator so that the classifier's posterior of generated data corresponds with that of real data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CP-GAN using both controlled and real-world class-overlapping data with a model configuration analysis and comparative study. Our code is available at https://github.com/takuhirok/CP-GAN/."
Perceptual Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks for End-to-End Image Colourization,"Colours are everywhere. They embody a significant part of human visual perception. In this paper, we explore the paradigm of hallucinating colours from a given gray-scale image. The problem of colourization has been dealt in previous literature but mostly in a supervised manner involving user-interference. With the emergence of Deep Learning methods numerous tasks related to computer vision and pattern recognition have been automatized and carried in an end-to-end fashion due to the availability of large data-sets and high-power computing systems. We investigate and build upon the recent success of Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) for Image-to-Image translations. In addition to using the training scheme in the basic cGAN, we propose an encoder-decoder generator network which utilizes the class-specific cross-entropy loss as well as the perceptual loss in addition to the original objective function of cGAN. We train our model on a large-scale dataset and present illustrative qualitative and quantitative analysis of our results. Our results vividly display the versatility and proficiency of our methods through life-like colourization outcomes."
PCGAN: Partition-Controlled Human Image Generation,"Human image generation is a very challenging task since it is affected by many factors. Many human image generation methods focus on generating human images conditioned on a given pose, while the generated backgrounds are often blurred.In this paper,we propose a novel Partition-Controlled GAN to generate human images according to target pose and background. Firstly, human poses in the given images are extracted, and foreground/background are partitioned for further use. Secondly, we extract and fuse appearance features, pose features and background features to generate the desired images. Experiments on Market-1501 and DeepFashion datasets show that our model not only generates realistic human images but also produce the human pose and background as we want. Extensive experiments on COCO and LIP datasets indicate the potential of our method."
Generating Realistic Training Images Based on Tonality-Alignment Generative Adversarial Networks for Hand Pose Estimation,"Hand pose estimation from a monocular RGB image is an important but challenging task. The main factor affecting its performance is the lack of a sufficiently large training dataset with accurate hand-keypoint annotations. In this work, we circumvent this problem by proposing an effective method for generating realistic hand poses and show that state-of-the-art algorithms for hand pose estimation can be greatly improved by utilizing the generated hand poses as training data. Specifically, we first adopt an augmented reality (AR) simulator to synthesize hand poses with accurate hand-keypoint labels. Although the synthetic hand poses come with precise joint labels, eliminating the need of manual annotations, they look unnatural and are not the ideal training data. To produce more realistic hand poses, we propose to blend a synthetic hand pose with a real background, such as arms and sleeves. To this end, we develop tonality-alignment generative adversarial networks (TAGANs), which align the tonality and color distributions between synthetic hand poses and real backgrounds, and can generate high quality hand poses. We evaluate TAGAN on three benchmarks, including the RHP, STB, and CMU-PS hand pose datasets. With the aid of the synthesized poses, our method performs favorably against the state-of-the-arts in both 2D and 3D hand pose estimations."
"Tell, Draw, and Repeat: Generating and Modifying Images Based on Continual Linguistic Instruction","Conditional text-to-image generation is an active area of research, with many possible applications. Existing research has primarily focused on generating a single image from available conditioning information in one step. One practical extension beyond one-step generation is a system that generates an image iteratively, conditioned on ongoing linguistic input or feedback. This is significantly more challenging than one-step generation tasks, as such a system must understand the contents of its generated images with respect to the feedback history, the current feedback, as well as the interactions among concepts present in the feedback history. In this work, we present a recurrent image generation model which takes into account both the generated output up to the current step as well as all past instructions for generation. We show that our model is able to generate the background, add new objects, and apply simple transformations to existing objects. We believe our approach is an important step toward interactive generation. Code and data is available at: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/generative-neural-visual-artist-geneva/ ."
IEGAN: Multi-purpose Perceptual Quality Image Enhancement Using Generative Adversarial Network,"Despite the breakthroughs in quality of image enhancement, an end-to-end solution for simultaneous recovery of the finer texture details and sharpness for degraded images with low resolution is still unsolved. Some existing approaches focus on minimizing the pixel-wise reconstruction error which results in a high peak signal-to-noise ratio. The enhanced images fail to provide high-frequency details and are perceptually unsatisfying, i.e., they fail to match the quality expected in a photo-realistic image. In this paper, we present Image Enhancement Generative Adversarial Network (IEGAN), a versatile framework capable of inferring photo-realistic natural images for both artifact removal and super-resolution simultaneously. Moreover, we propose a new loss function consisting of a combination of reconstruction loss, feature loss and an edge loss counterpart. The feature loss helps to push the output image to the natural image manifold and the edge loss preserves the sharpness of the output image. The reconstruction loss provides low-level semantic information to the generator regarding the quality of the generated images compared to the original. Our approach has been experimentally proven to recover photo-realistic textures from heavily compressed low-resolution images on public benchmarks and our proposed high-resolution World100 dataset."
Event-based High Dynamic Range Image and Very High Frame Rate Video Generation using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks,"Event cameras have a lot of advantages over traditional cameras, such as low latency, high temporal resolution, and high dynamic range. However, since the outputs of event cameras are the sequences of asynchronous events overtime rather than actual intensity images, existing algorithms could not be directly applied. Therefore, it is demanding to generate intensity images from events for other tasks. In this paper, we unlock the potential of event camera-based conditional generative adversarial networks to create images/videos from an adjustable portion of the event data stream. The stacks of space-time coordinates of events are used as inputs and the network is trained to reproduce images based on the spatio-temporal intensity changes. The usefulness of event cameras to generate high dynamic range(HDR) images even in extreme illumination conditions and also non blurred images under rapid motion is also shown.In addition, the possibility of generating very high frame rate videos is demonstrated, theoretically up to 1 million frames per second (FPS) since the temporal resolution of event cameras are about 1μs. Proposed methods are evaluated by comparing the results with the intensity images captured on the same pixel grid-line of events using online available real datasets and synthetic datasets produced by the event camera simulator."
Synthetic Lung Nodule 3D Image Generation Using Autoencoders,"One of the challenges of using machine learning techniques with medical data is the frequent dearth of source image data on which to train. A representative example is automated lung cancer diagnosis, where nodule images need to be classified as suspicious or benign. In this work we propose an automatic synthetic lung nodule image generator. Our 3D shape generator is designed to augment the variety of 3D images. Our proposed system takes root in autoencoder techniques, and we provide extensive experimental characterization that demonstrates its ability to produce quality synthetic images."
FD-GAN: Face-demorphing generative adversarial network for restoring accomplice's facial image,"Face morphing attack is proved to be a serious threat to the existing face recognition systems. Although a few face morphing detection methods have been put forward, the face morphing accomplice's facial restoration remains a challenging problem. In this paper, a face de-morphing generative adversarial network (FD-GAN) is proposed to restore the accomplice's facial image. It utilizes a symmetric dual network architecture and two levels of restoration losses to separate the identity feature of the morphing accomplice. By exploiting the captured facial image (containing the criminal's identity) from the face recognition system and the morphed image stored in the e-passport system (containing both criminal and accomplice's identities), the FD-GAN can effectively restore the accomplice's facial image. Experimental results and analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. It has great potential to be implemented for detecting the face morphing accomplice in a real identity verification scenario."
"SEIGAN: Towards Compositional Image Generation by Simultaneously Learning to Segment, Enhance, and Inpaint","We present a novel approach to image manipulation and understanding by simultaneously learning to segment object masks, paste objects to another background image, and remove them from original images. For this purpose, we develop a novel generative model for compositional image generation, SEIGAN (Segment-Enhance-Inpaint Generative Adversarial Network), which learns these three operations together in an adversarial architecture with additional cycle consistency losses. To train, SEIGAN needs only bounding box supervision and does not require pairing or ground truth masks. SEIGAN produces better generated images (evaluated by human assessors) than other approaches and produces high-quality segmentation masks, improving over other adversarially trained approaches and getting closer to the results of fully supervised training."
ProstateGAN: Mitigating Data Bias via Prostate Diffusion Imaging Synthesis with Generative Adversarial Networks,"Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown considerable promise for mitigating the challenge of data scarcity when building machine learning-driven analysis algorithms. Specifically, a number of studies have shown that GAN-based image synthesis for data augmentation can aid in improving classification accuracy in a number of medical image analysis tasks, such as brain and liver image analysis. However, the efficacy of leveraging GANs for tackling prostate cancer analysis has not been previously explored. Motivated by this, in this study we introduce ProstateGAN, a GAN-based model for synthesizing realistic prostate diffusion imaging data. More specifically, in order to generate new diffusion imaging data corresponding to a particular cancer grade (Gleason score), we propose a conditional deep convolutional GAN architecture that takes Gleason scores into consideration during the training process. Experimental results show that high-quality synthetic prostate diffusion imaging data can be generated using the proposed ProstateGAN for specified Gleason scores."
An Interpretable Generative Model for Handwritten Digit Image Synthesis,"An interpretable generative model for handwritten digits synthesis is proposed in this work. Modern image generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), are trained by backpropagation (BP). The training process is complex and the underlying mechanism is difficult to explain. We propose an interpretable multi-stage PCA method to achieve the same goal and use handwritten digit images synthesis as an illustrative example. First, we derive principal-component-analysis-based (PCA-based) transform kernels at each stage based on the covariance of its inputs. This results in a sequence of transforms that convert input images of correlated pixels to spectral vectors of uncorrelated components. In other words, it is a whitening process. Then, we can synthesize an image based on random vectors and multi-stage transform kernels through a coloring process. The generative model is a feedforward (FF) design since no BP is used in model parameter determination. Its design complexity is significantly lower, and the whole design process is explainable. Finally, we design an FF generative model using the MNIST dataset, compare synthesis results with those obtained by state-of-the-art GAN and VAE methods, and show that the proposed generative model achieves comparable performance."
Innovative 3D Depth Map Generation From A Holoscopic 3D Image Based on Graph Cut Technique,"Holoscopic 3D imaging is a promising technique for capturing full colour spatial 3D images using a single aperture holoscopic 3D camera. It mimics fly's eye technique with a microlens array, which views the scene at a slightly different angle to its adjacent lens that records three dimensional information onto a two dimensional surface. This paper proposes a method of depth map generation from a holoscopic 3D image based on graph cut technique. The principal objective of this study is to estimate the depth information presented in a holoscopic 3D image with high precision. As such, depth map extraction is measured from a single still holoscopic 3D image which consists of multiple viewpoint images. The viewpoints are extracted and utilised for disparity calculation via disparity space image technique and pixels displacement is measured with sub pixel accuracy to overcome the issue of the narrow baseline between the viewpoint images for stereo matching. In addition, cost aggregation is used to correlate the matching costs within a particular neighbouring region using sum of absolute difference SAD combined with gradient-based metric and winner takes all algorithm is employed to select the minimum elements in the array as optimal disparity value. Finally, the optimal depth map is obtained using graph cut technique. The proposed method extends the utilisation of holoscopic 3D imaging system and enables the expansion of the technology for various applications of autonomous robotics, medical, inspection, AR VR, security and entertainment where 3D depth sensing and measurement are a concern."
Use of Neural Signals to Evaluate the Quality of Generative Adversarial Network Performance in Facial Image Generation,"There is a growing interest in using generative adversarial networks (GANs) to produce image content that is indistinguishable from real images as judged by a typical person. A number of GAN variants for this purpose have been proposed, however, evaluating GANs performance is inherently difficult because current methods for measuring the quality of their output are not always consistent with what a human perceives. We propose a novel approach that combines a brain-computer interface (BCI) with GANs to generate a measure we call Neuroscore, which closely mirrors the behavioral ground truth measured from participants tasked with discerning real from synthetic images. This technique we call a neuro-AI interface, as it provides an interface between a human's neural systems and an AI process. In this paper, we first compare the three most widely used metrics in the literature for evaluating GANs in terms of visual quality and compare their outputs with human judgments. Secondly we propose and demonstrate a novel approach using neural signals and rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) that directly measures a human perceptual response to facial production quality, independent of a behavioral response measurement. The correlation between our proposed Neuroscore and human perceptual judgments has Pearson correlation statistics: \mathrm{r}(48) = -0.767, \mathrm{p} = 2.089e-10. We also present the bootstrap result for the correlation i.e., \mathrm{p}\leq 0.0001. Results show that our Neuroscore is more consistent with human judgment compared to the conventional metrics we evaluated. We conclude that neural signals have potential applications for high quality, rapid evaluation of GANs in the context of visual image synthesis."
Computational Histological Staining and Destaining of Prostate Core Biopsy RGB Images with Generative Adversarial Neural Networks,"Histopathology tissue samples are widely available in two states: paraffin-embedded unstained and non-paraffin-embedded stained whole slide RGB images (WSRI). Hematoxylin and eosin stain (H&E) is one of the principal stains in histology but suffers from several shortcomings related to tissue preparation, staining protocols, slowness and human error. We report two novel approaches for training machine learning models for the computational H&E staining and destaining of prostate core biopsy RGB images. The staining model uses a conditional generative adversarial network that learns hierarchical non-linear mappings between whole slide RGB image (WSRI) pairs of prostate core biopsy before and after H&E staining. The trained staining model can then generate computationally H&E-stained prostate core WSRIs using previously unseen non-stained biopsy images as input. The destaining model, by learning mappings between an H&E stained WSRI and a non-stained WSRI of the same biopsy, can computationally destain previously unseen H&E-stained images. Structural and anatomical details of prostate tissue and colors, shapes, geometries, locations of nuclei, stroma, vessels, glands and other cellular components were generated by both models with structural similarity indices of 0.68 (staining) and 0.84 (destaining). The proposed staining and destaining models can engender computational H&E staining and destaining of WSRI biopsies without additional equipment and devices."
Efficient Generation of Parallel Spin-images Using Dynamic Loop Scheduling,"High performance computing (HPC) systems underwent a significant increase in their processing capabilities. Modern HPC systems combine large numbers of homogeneous and heterogeneous computing resources. Scalability is, therefore, an essential aspect of scientific applications to efficiently exploit the massive parallelism of modern HPC systems. This work introduces an efficient version of the parallel spin-image algorithm (PSIA), called EPSIA. The PSIA is a parallel version of the spin-image algorithm (SIA). The (P)SIA is used in various domains, such as 3D object recognition, categorization, and 3D face recognition. EPSIA refers to the extended version of the PSIA that integrates various well-known dynamic loop scheduling (DLS) techniques. The present work: (1) Proposes EPSIA, a novel flexible version of PSIA; (2) Showcases the benefits of applying DLS techniques for optimizing the performance of the PSIA; (3) Assesses the performance of the proposed EPSIA by conducting several scalability experiments. The performance results are promising and show that using well-known DLS techniques, the performance of the EPSIA outperforms the performance of the PSIA by a factor of 1.2 and 2 for homogeneous and heterogeneous computing resources, respectively."
Examining Performance of Sketch-to-Image Translation Models with Multiclass Automatically Generated Paired Training Data,"Image translation is a computer vision task that involves translating one representation of the scene into another. Various approaches have been proposed and achieved highly desirable results. Nevertheless, its accomplishment requires abundant paired training data which are expensive to acquire. Therefore, models for translation are usually trained on a set of paired training data which are carefully and laboriously designed. Our work is focused on learning through automatically generated paired data. We propose a method to generate fake sketches from images using an adversarial network and then pair the images with corresponding fake sketches to form large-scale multi-class paired training data for training a sketch-to-image translation model. Our model is an encoder-decoder architecture where the encoder generates fake sketches from images and the decoder performs sketch-to-image translation. Qualitative results show that the encoder can be used for generating large-scale multi-class paired data under low supervision. Our current dataset now contains 61255 image and (fake) sketch pairs from 256 different categories. These figures can be greatly increased in the future thanks to our weak reliance on manually labeled data."
Attention-Aware Generalized Mean Pooling for Image Retrieval,"It has been shown that image descriptors extracted by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) achieve remarkable results for retrieval problems. In this paper, we apply attention mechanism to CNN, which aims at enhancing more relevant features that correspond to important keypoints in the input image. The generated attention-aware features are then aggregated by the previous state-of-the-art generalized mean (GeM) pooling followed by normalization to produce a compact global descriptor, which can be efficiently compared to other image descriptors by the dot product. An extensive comparison of our proposed approach with state-of-the-art methods is performed on the new challenging ROxford5k and RParis6k retrieval benchmarks. Results indicate significant improvement over previous work. In particular, our attention-aware GeM (AGeM) descriptor outperforms state-of-the-art method on ROxford5k under the `Hard' evaluation protocal."
Pixel Level Data Augmentation for Semantic Image Segmentation using Generative Adversarial Networks,"Semantic segmentation is one of the basic topics in computer vision, it aims to assign semantic labels to every pixel of an image. Unbalanced semantic label distribution could have a negative influence on segmentation accuracy. In this paper, we investigate using data augmentation approach to balance the semantic label distribution in order to improve segmentation performance. We propose using generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate realistic images for improving the performance of semantic segmentation networks. Experimental results show that the proposed method can not only improve segmentation performance on those classes with low accuracy, but also obtain 1.3% to 2.1% increase in average segmentation accuracy. It shows that this augmentation method can boost accuracy and be easily applicable to any other segmentation models."
Few-shot 3D Multi-modal Medical Image Segmentation using Generative Adversarial Learning,"We address the problem of segmenting 3D multi-modal medical images in scenarios where very few labeled examples are available for training. Leveraging the recent success of adversarial learning for semi-supervised segmentation, we propose a novel method based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to train a segmentation model with both labeled and unlabeled images. The proposed method prevents over-fitting by learning to discriminate between true and fake patches obtained by a generator network. Our work extends current adversarial learning approaches, which focus on 2D single-modality images, to the more challenging context of 3D volumes of multiple modalities. The proposed method is evaluated on the problem of segmenting brain MRI from the iSEG-2017 and MRBrainS 2013 datasets. Significant performance improvement is reported, compared to state-of-art segmentation networks trained in a fully-supervised manner. In addition, our work presents a comprehensive analysis of different GAN architectures for semi-supervised segmentation, showing recent techniques like feature matching to yield a higher performance than conventional adversarial training approaches. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/arnab39/FewShot_GAN-Unet3D"
Text-Adaptive Generative Adversarial Networks: Manipulating Images with Natural Language,"This paper addresses the problem of manipulating images using natural language description. Our task aims to semantically modify visual attributes of an object in an image according to the text describing the new visual appearance. Although existing methods synthesize images having new attributes, they do not fully preserve text-irrelevant contents of the original image. In this paper, we propose the text-adaptive generative adversarial network (TAGAN) to generate semantically manipulated images while preserving text-irrelevant contents. The key to our method is the text-adaptive discriminator that creates word-level local discriminators according to input text to classify fine-grained attributes independently. With this discriminator, the generator learns to generate images where only regions that correspond to the given text are modified. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing methods on CUB and Oxford-102 datasets, and our results were mostly preferred on a user study. Extensive analysis shows that our method is able to effectively disentangle visual attributes and produce pleasing outputs."
Generative adversarial networks and adversarial methods in biomedical image analysis,"Generative adversarial networks (GANs) and other adversarial methods are based on a game-theoretical perspective on joint optimization of two neural networks as players in a game. Adversarial techniques have been extensively used to synthesize and analyze biomedical images. We provide an introduction to GANs and adversarial methods, with an overview of biomedical image analysis tasks that have benefited from such methods. We conclude with a discussion of strengths and limitations of adversarial methods in biomedical image analysis, and propose potential future research directions."
Single Image Haze Removal using a Generative Adversarial Network,"Traditional methods to remove haze from images rely on estimating a transmission map. When dealing with single images, this becomes an ill-posed problem due to the lack of depth information. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end learning based approach which uses a modified conditional Generative Adversarial Network to directly remove haze from an image. We employ the usage of the Tiramisu model in place of the classic U-Net model as the generator owing to its higher parameter efficiency and performance. Moreover, a patch based discriminator was used to reduce artefacts in the output. To further improve the perceptual quality of the output, a hybrid weighted loss function was designed and used to train the model. Experiments on synthetic and real world hazy images demonstrates that our model performs competitively with the state of the art methods."
Generation of Virtual Dual Energy Images from Standard Single-Shot Radiographs using Multi-scale and Conditional Adversarial Network,"Dual-energy (DE) chest radiographs provide greater diagnostic information than standard radiographs by separating the image into bone and soft tissue, revealing suspicious lesions which may otherwise be obstructed from view. However, acquisition of DE images requires two physical scans, necessitating specialized hardware and processing, and images are prone to motion artifact. Generation of virtual DE images from standard, single-shot chest radiographs would expand the diagnostic value of standard radiographs without changing the acquisition procedure. We present a Multi-scale Conditional Adversarial Network (MCA-Net) which produces high-resolution virtual DE bone images from standard, single-shot chest radiographs. Our proposed MCA-Net is trained using the adversarial network so that it learns sharp details for the production of high-quality bone images. Then, the virtual DE soft tissue image is generated by processing the standard radiograph with the virtual bone image using a cross projection transformation. Experimental results from 210 patient DE chest radiographs demonstrated that the algorithm can produce high-quality virtual DE chest radiographs. Important structures were preserved, such as coronary calcium in bone images and lung lesions in soft tissue images. The average structure similarity index and the peak signal to noise ratio of the produced bone images in testing data were 96.4 and 41.5, which are significantly better than results from previous methods. Furthermore, our clinical evaluation results performed on the publicly available dataset indicates the clinical values of our algorithms. Thus, our algorithm can produce high-quality DE images that are potentially useful for radiologists, computer-aided diagnostics, and other diagnostic tasks."
Image Inpainting via Generative Multi-column Convolutional Neural Networks,"In this paper, we propose a generative multi-column network for image inpainting. This network synthesizes different image components in a parallel manner within one stage. To better characterize global structures, we design a confidence-driven reconstruction loss while an implicit diversified MRF regularization is adopted to enhance local details. The multi-column network combined with the reconstruction and MRF loss propagates local and global information derived from context to the target inpainting regions. Extensive experiments on challenging street view, face, natural objects and scenes manifest that our method produces visual compelling results even without previously common post-processing."
MsCGAN: Multi-scale Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks for Person Image Generation,"To synthesize high-quality person images with arbitrary poses is challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-scale Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (MsCGAN), aiming to convert the input conditional person image to a synthetic image of any given target pose, whose appearance and the texture are consistent with the input image. MsCGAN is a multi-scale adversarial network consisting of two generators and two discriminators. One generator transforms the conditional person image into a coarse image of the target pose globally, and the other is to enhance the detailed quality of the synthetic person image through a local reinforcement network. The outputs of the two generators are then merged into a synthetic, discriminant and high-resolution image. On the other hand, the synthetic image is downsampled to multiple resolutions as the input to multi-scale discriminator networks. The proposed multi-scale generators and discriminators handling different levels of visual features can benefit to synthesizing high-resolution person images with realistic appearance and texture. Experiments are conducted on the Market-1501 and DeepFashion datasets to evaluate the proposed model, and both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed MsCGAN."
Deep Learning from Shallow Dives: Sonar Image Generation and Training for Underwater Object Detection,"Among underwater perceptual sensors, imaging sonar has been highlighted for its perceptual robustness underwater. The major challenge of imaging sonar, however, arises from the difficulty in defining visual features despite limited resolution and high noise levels. Recent developments in deep learning provide a powerful solution for computer-vision researches using optical images. Unfortunately, deep learning-based approaches are not well established for imaging sonars, mainly due to the scant data in the training phase. Unlike the abundant publically available terrestrial images, obtaining underwater images is often costly, and securing enough underwater images for training is not straightforward. To tackle this issue, this paper presents a solution to this field's lack of data by introducing a novel end-to-end image-synthesizing method in the training image preparation phase. The proposed method present image synthesizing scheme to the images captured by an underwater simulator. Our synthetic images are based on the sonar imaging models and noisy characteristics to represent the real data obtained from the sea. We validate the proposed scheme by training using a simulator and by testing the simulated images with real underwater sonar images obtained from a water tank and the sea."
Improving Generalization of Sequence Encoder-Decoder Networks for Inverse Imaging of Cardiac Transmembrane Potential,"Deep learning models have shown state-of-the-art performance in many inverse reconstruction problems. However, it is not well understood what properties of the latent representation may improve the generalization ability of the network. Furthermore, limited models have been presented for inverse reconstructions over time sequences. In this paper, we study the generalization ability of a sequence encoder decoder model for solving inverse reconstructions on time sequences. Our central hypothesis is that the generalization ability of the network can be improved by 1) constrained stochasticity and 2) global aggregation of temporal information in the latent space. First, drawing from analytical learning theory, we theoretically show that a stochastic latent space will lead to an improved generalization ability. Second, we consider an LSTM encoder-decoder architecture that compresses a global latent vector from all last-layer units in the LSTM encoder. This model is compared with alternative LSTM encoder-decoder architectures, each in deterministic and stochastic versions. The results demonstrate that the generalization ability of an inverse reconstruction network can be improved by constrained stochasticity combined with global aggregation of temporal information in the latent space."
SingleGAN: Image-to-Image Translation by a Single-Generator Network using Multiple Generative Adversarial Learning,"Image translation is a burgeoning field in computer vision where the goal is to learn the mapping between an input image and an output image. However, most recent methods require multiple generators for modeling different domain mappings, which are inefficient and ineffective on some multi-domain image translation tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel method, SingleGAN, to perform multi-domain image-to-image translations with a single generator. We introduce the domain code to explicitly control the different generative tasks and integrate multiple optimization goals to ensure the translation. Experimental results on several unpaired datasets show superior performance of our model in translation between two domains. Besides, we explore variants of SingleGAN for different tasks, including one-to-many domain translation, many-to-many domain translation and one-to-one domain translation with multimodality. The extended experiments show the universality and extensibility of our model."
Conditional Generative Refinement Adversarial Networks for Unbalanced Medical Image Semantic Segmentation,"We propose a new generative adversarial architecture to mitigate imbalance data problem in medical image semantic segmentation where the majority of pixels belongs to a healthy region and few belong to lesion or non-health region. A model trained with imbalanced data tends to bias toward healthy data which is not desired in clinical applications and predicted outputs by these networks have high precision and low sensitivity. We propose a new conditional generative refinement network with three components: a generative, a discriminative, and a refinement network to mitigate unbalanced data problem through ensemble learning. The generative network learns to a segment at the pixel level by getting feedback from the discriminative network according to the true positive and true negative maps. On the other hand, the refinement network learns to predict the false positive and the false negative masks produced by the generative network that has significant value, especially in medical application. The final semantic segmentation masks are then composed by the output of the three networks. The proposed architecture shows state-of-the-art results on LiTS-2017 for liver lesion segmentation, and two microscopic cell segmentation datasets MDA231, PhC-HeLa. We have achieved competitive results on BraTS-2017 for brain tumour segmentation."
Generic Model-Agnostic Convolutional Neural Network for Single Image Dehazing,"Haze and smog are among the most common environmental factors impacting image quality and, therefore, image analysis. This paper proposes an end-to-end generative method for image dehazing. It is based on designing a fully convolutional neural network to recognize haze structures in input images and restore clear, haze-free images. The proposed method is agnostic in the sense that it does not explore the atmosphere scattering model. Somewhat surprisingly, it achieves superior performance relative to all existing state-of-the-art methods for image dehazing even on SOTS outdoor images, which are synthesized using the atmosphere scattering model.  Project detail and code can be found here: https://github.com/Seanforfun/GMAN_Net_Haze_Removal"
CanvasGAN: A simple baseline for text to image generation by incrementally patching a canvas,"We propose a new recurrent generative model for generating images from text captions while attending on specific parts of text captions. Our model creates images by incrementally adding patches on a ""canvas"" while attending on words from text caption at each timestep. Finally, the canvas is passed through an upscaling network to generate images. We also introduce a new method for generating visual-semantic sentence embeddings based on self-attention over text. We compare our model's generated images with those generated Reed et. al.'s model and show that our model is a stronger baseline for text to image generation tasks."
Generating Diffusion MRI scalar maps from T1 weighted images using generative adversarial networks,"Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (diffusion MRI) is a non-invasive microstructure assessment technique. Scalar measures, such as FA (fractional anisotropy) and MD (mean diffusivity), quantifying micro-structural tissue properties can be obtained using diffusion models and data processing pipelines. However, it is costly and time consuming to collect high quality diffusion data. Here, we therefore demonstrate how Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can be used to generate synthetic diffusion scalar measures from structural T1-weighted images in a single optimized step. Specifically, we train the popular CycleGAN model to learn to map a T1 image to FA or MD, and vice versa. As an application, we show that synthetic FA images can be used as a target for non-linear registration, to correct for geometric distortions common in diffusion MRI."
Generative Adversarial Network for Medical Images (MI-GAN),"Deep learning algorithms produces state-of-the-art results for different machine learning and computer vision tasks. To perform well on a given task, these algorithms require large dataset for training. However, deep learning algorithms lack generalization and suffer from over-fitting whenever trained on small dataset, especially when one is dealing with medical images. For supervised image analysis in medical imaging, having image data along with their corresponding annotated ground-truths is costly as well as time consuming since annotations of the data is done by medical experts manually. In this paper, we propose a new Generative Adversarial Network for Medical Imaging (MI-GAN). The MI-GAN generates synthetic medical images and their segmented masks, which can then be used for the application of supervised analysis of medical images. Particularly, we present MI-GAN for synthesis of retinal images. The proposed method generates precise segmented images better than the existing techniques. The proposed model achieves a dice coefficient of 0.837 on STARE dataset and 0.832 on DRIVE dataset which is state-of-the-art performance on both the datasets."
Semantically Invariant Text-to-Image Generation,"Image captioning has demonstrated models that are capable of generating plausible text given input images or videos. Further, recent work in image generation has shown significant improvements in image quality when text is used as a prior. Our work ties these concepts together by creating an architecture that can enable bidirectional generation of images and text. We call this network Multi-Modal Vector Representation (MMVR). Along with MMVR, we propose two improvements to the text conditioned image generation. Firstly, a n-gram metric based cost function is introduced that generalizes the caption with respect to the image. Secondly, multiple semantically similar sentences are shown to help in generating better images. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that MMVR improves upon existing text conditioned image generation results by over 20%, while integrating visual and text modalities."
Deep Generative Classifiers for Thoracic Disease Diagnosis with Chest X-ray Images,"Thoracic diseases are very serious health problems that plague a large number of people. Chest X-ray is currently one of the most popular methods to diagnose thoracic diseases, playing an important role in the healthcare workflow. However, reading the chest X-ray images and giving an accurate diagnosis remain challenging tasks for expert radiologists. With the success of deep learning in computer vision, a growing number of deep neural network architectures were applied to chest X-ray image classification. However, most of the previous deep neural network classifiers were based on deterministic architectures which are usually very noise-sensitive and are likely to aggravate the overfitting issue. In this paper, to make a deep architecture more robust to noise and to reduce overfitting, we propose using deep generative classifiers to automatically diagnose thorax diseases from the chest X-ray images. Unlike the traditional deterministic classifier, a deep generative classifier has a distribution middle layer in the deep neural network. A sampling layer then draws a random sample from the distribution layer and input it to the following layer for classification. The classifier is generative because the class label is generated from samples of a related distribution. Through training the model with a certain amount of randomness, the deep generative classifiers are expected to be robust to noise and can reduce overfitting and then achieve good performances. We implemented our deep generative classifiers based on a number of well-known deterministic neural network architectures, and tested our models on the chest X-ray14 dataset. The results demonstrated the superiority of deep generative classifiers compared with the corresponding deep deterministic classifiers."
Generative Adversarial Network in Medical Imaging: A Review,"Generative adversarial networks have gained a lot of attention in the computer vision community due to their capability of data generation without explicitly modelling the probability density function. The adversarial loss brought by the discriminator provides a clever way of incorporating unlabeled samples into training and imposing higher order consistency. This has proven to be useful in many cases, such as domain adaptation, data augmentation, and image-to-image translation. These properties have attracted researchers in the medical imaging community, and we have seen rapid adoption in many traditional and novel applications, such as image reconstruction, segmentation, detection, classification, and cross-modality synthesis. Based on our observations, this trend will continue and we therefore conducted a review of recent advances in medical imaging using the adversarial training scheme with the hope of benefiting researchers interested in this technique."
Generalized Content-Preserving Warps for Image Stitching,"Local misalignment caused by global homography is a common issue in image stitching task. Content-Preserving Warping (CPW) is a typical method to deal with this issue, in which geometric and photometric constraints are imposed to guide the warping process. One of its essential condition however, is colour consistency, and an elusive goal in real world applications. In this paper, we propose a Generalized Content-Preserving Warping (GCPW) method to alleviate this problem. GCPW extends the original CPW by applying a colour model that expresses the colour transformation between images locally, thus meeting the photometric constraint requirements for effective image stitching. We combine the photometric and geometric constraints and jointly estimate the colour transformation and the warped mesh vertexes, simultaneously. We align images locally with an optimal grid mesh generated by our GCPW method. Experiments on both synthetic and real images demonstrate that our new method is robust to colour variations, outperforming other state-of-the-art CPW-based image stitching methods."
Unsupervised Stylish Image Description Generation via Domain Layer Norm,"Most of the existing works on image description focus on generating expressive descriptions. The only few works that are dedicated to generating stylish (e.g., romantic, lyric, etc.) descriptions suffer from limited style variation and content digression. To address these limitations, we propose a controllable stylish image description generation model. It can learn to generate stylish image descriptions that are more related to image content and can be trained with the arbitrary monolingual corpus without collecting new paired image and stylish descriptions. Moreover, it enables users to generate various stylish descriptions by plugging in style-specific parameters to include new styles into the existing model. We achieve this capability via a novel layer normalization layer design, which we will refer to as the Domain Layer Norm (DLN). Extensive experimental validation and user study on various stylish image description generation tasks are conducted to show the competitive advantages of the proposed model."
SiftingGAN: Generating and Sifting Labeled Samples to Improve the Remote Sensing Image Scene Classification Baseline in vitro,"Lack of annotated samples greatly restrains the direct application of deep learning in remote sensing image scene classification. Although researches have been done to tackle this issue by data augmentation with various image transformation operations, they are still limited in quantity and diversity. Recently, the advent of the unsupervised learning based generative adversarial networks (GANs) bring us a new way to generate augmented samples. However, such GAN-generated samples are currently only served for training GANs model itself and for improving the performance of the discriminator in GANs internally (in vivo). It becomes a question of serious doubt whether the GAN-generated samples can help better improve the scene classification performance of other deep learning networks (in vitro), compared with the widely used transformed samples. To answer this question, this paper proposes a SiftingGAN approach to generate more numerous, more diverse and more authentic labeled samples for data augmentation. SiftingGAN extends traditional GAN framework with an Online-Output method for sample generation, a Generative-Model-Sifting method for model sifting, and a Labeled-Sample-Discriminating method for sample sifting. Experiments on the well-known AID dataset demonstrate that the proposed SiftingGAN method can not only effectively improve the performance of the scene classification baseline that is achieved without data augmentation, but also significantly excels the comparison methods based on traditional geometric/radiometric transformation operations."
Generative adversarial network-based image super-resolution using perceptual content losses,"In this paper, we propose a deep generative adversarial network for super-resolution considering the trade-off between perception and distortion. Based on good performance of a recently developed model for super-resolution, i.e., deep residual network using enhanced upscale modules (EUSR), the proposed model is trained to improve perceptual performance with only slight increase of distortion. For this purpose, together with the conventional content loss, i.e., reconstruction loss such as L1 or L2, we consider additional losses in the training phase, which are the discrete cosine transform coefficients loss and differential content loss. These consider perceptual part in the content loss, i.e., consideration of proper high frequency components is helpful for the trade-off problem in super-resolution. The experimental results show that our proposed model has good performance for both perception and distortion, and is effective in perceptual super-resolution applications."
RealPoint3D: Point Cloud Generation from a Single Image with Complex Background,"3D point cloud generation by the deep neural network from a single image has been attracting more and more researchers' attention. However, recently-proposed methods require the objects be captured with relatively clean backgrounds, fixed viewpoint, while this highly limits its application in the real environment. To overcome these drawbacks, we proposed to integrate the prior 3D shape knowledge into the network to guide the 3D generation. By taking additional 3D information, the proposed network can handle the 3D object generation from a single real image captured from any viewpoint and complex background. Specifically, giving a query image, we retrieve the nearest shape model from a pre-prepared 3D model database. Then, the image together with the retrieved shape model is fed into the proposed network to generate the fine-grained 3D point cloud. The effectiveness of our proposed framework has been verified on different kinds of datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art accuracy compared to other volumetric-based and point set generation methods. Furthermore, the proposed framework works well for real images in complex backgrounds with various view angles."
BubGAN: Bubble Generative Adversarial Networks for Synthesizing Realistic Bubbly Flow Images,"Bubble segmentation and size detection algorithms have been developed in recent years for their high efficiency and accuracy in measuring bubbly two-phase flows. In this work, we proposed an architecture called bubble generative adversarial networks (BubGAN) for the generation of realistic synthetic images which could be further used as training or benchmarking data for the development of advanced image processing algorithms. The BubGAN is trained initially on a labeled bubble dataset consisting of ten thousand images. By learning the distribution of these bubbles, the BubGAN can generate more realistic bubbles compared to the conventional models used in the literature. The trained BubGAN is conditioned on bubble feature parameters and has full control of bubble properties in terms of aspect ratio, rotation angle, circularity and edge ratio. A million bubble dataset is pre-generated using the trained BubGAN. One can then assemble realistic bubbly flow images using this dataset and associated image processing tool. These images contain detailed bubble information, therefore do not require additional manual labeling. This is more useful compared with the conventional GAN which generates images without labeling information. The tool could be used to provide benchmarking and training data for existing image processing algorithms and to guide the future development of bubble detecting algorithms."
Memory Replay GANs: learning to generate images from new categories without forgetting,"Previous works on sequential learning address the problem of forgetting in discriminative models. In this paper we consider the case of generative models. In particular, we investigate generative adversarial networks (GANs) in the task of learning new categories in a sequential fashion. We first show that sequential fine tuning renders the network unable to properly generate images from previous categories (i.e. forgetting). Addressing this problem, we propose Memory Replay GANs (MeRGANs), a conditional GAN framework that integrates a memory replay generator. We study two methods to prevent forgetting by leveraging these replays, namely joint training with replay and replay alignment. Qualitative and quantitative experimental results in MNIST, SVHN and LSUN datasets show that our memory replay approach can generate competitive images while significantly mitigating the forgetting of previous categories."
Bimodal network architectures for automatic generation of image annotation from text,"Medical image analysis practitioners have embraced big data methodologies. This has created a need for large annotated datasets. The source of big data is typically large image collections and clinical reports recorded for these images. In many cases, however, building algorithms aimed at segmentation and detection of disease requires a training dataset with markings of the areas of interest on the image that match with the described anomalies. This process of annotation is expensive and needs the involvement of clinicians. In this work we propose two separate deep neural network architectures for automatic marking of a region of interest (ROI) on the image best representing a finding location, given a textual report or a set of keywords. One architecture consists of LSTM and CNN components and is trained end to end with images, matching text, and markings of ROIs for those images. The output layer estimates the coordinates of the vertices of a polygonal region. The second architecture uses a network pre-trained on a large dataset of the same image types for learning feature representations of the findings of interest. We show that for a variety of findings from chest X-ray images, both proposed architectures learn to estimate the ROI, as validated by clinical annotations. There is a clear advantage obtained from the architecture with pre-trained imaging network. The centroids of the ROIs marked by this network were on average at a distance equivalent to 5.1% of the image width from the centroids of the ground truth ROIs."
Generating Highly Realistic Images of Skin Lesions with GANs,"As many other machine learning driven medical image analysis tasks, skin image analysis suffers from a chronic lack of labeled data and skewed class distributions, which poses problems for the training of robust and well-generalizing models. The ability to synthesize realistic looking images of skin lesions could act as a reliever for the aforementioned problems. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been successfully used to synthesize realistically looking medical images, however limited to low resolution, whereas machine learning models for challenging tasks such as skin lesion segmentation or classification benefit from much higher resolution data. In this work, we successfully synthesize realistically looking images of skin lesions with GANs at such high resolution. Therefore, we utilize the concept of progressive growing, which we both quantitatively and qualitatively compare to other GAN architectures such as the DCGAN and the LAPGAN. Our results show that with the help of progressive growing, we can synthesize highly realistic dermoscopic images of skin lesions that even expert dermatologists find hard to distinguish from real ones."
Diverse and Coherent Paragraph Generation from Images,"Paragraph generation from images, which has gained popularity recently, is an important task for video summarization, editing, and support of the disabled. Traditional image captioning methods fall short on this front, since they aren't designed to generate long informative descriptions. Moreover, the vanilla approach of simply concatenating multiple short sentences, possibly synthesized from a classical image captioning system, doesn't embrace the intricacies of paragraphs: coherent sentences, globally consistent structure, and diversity. To address those challenges, we propose to augment paragraph generation techniques with 'coherence vectors', 'global topic vectors', and modeling of the inherent ambiguity of associating paragraphs with images, via a variational auto-encoder formulation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed approach on two datasets, outperforming existing state-of-the-art techniques on both."
Unsupervised Image Super-Resolution using Cycle-in-Cycle Generative Adversarial Networks,"We consider the single image super-resolution problem in a more general case that the low-/high-resolution pairs and the down-sampling process are unavailable. Different from traditional super-resolution formulation, the low-resolution input is further degraded by noises and blurring. This complicated setting makes supervised learning and accurate kernel estimation impossible. To solve this problem, we resort to unsupervised learning without paired data, inspired by the recent successful image-to-image translation applications. With generative adversarial networks (GAN) as the basic component, we propose a Cycle-in-Cycle network structure to tackle the problem within three steps. First, the noisy and blurry input is mapped to a noise-free low-resolution space. Then the intermediate image is up-sampled with a pre-trained deep model. Finally, we fine-tune the two modules in an end-to-end manner to get the high-resolution output. Experiments on NTIRE2018 datasets demonstrate that the proposed unsupervised method achieves comparable results as the state-of-the-art supervised models."
"Gaussian Mixture Generative Adversarial Networks for Diverse Datasets, and the Unsupervised Clustering of Images","Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been shown to produce realistically looking synthetic images with remarkable success, yet their performance seems less impressive when the training set is highly diverse. In order to provide a better fit to the target data distribution when the dataset includes many different classes, we propose a variant of the basic GAN model, called Gaussian Mixture GAN (GM-GAN), where the probability distribution over the latent space is a mixture of Gaussians. We also propose a supervised variant which is capable of conditional sample synthesis. In order to evaluate the model's performance, we propose a new scoring method which separately takes into account two (typically conflicting) measures - diversity vs. quality of the generated data. Through a series of empirical experiments, using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we quantitatively show that GM-GANs outperform baselines, both when evaluated using the commonly used Inception Score, and when evaluated using our own alternative scoring method. In addition, we qualitatively demonstrate how the \textit{unsupervised} variant of GM-GAN tends to map latent vectors sampled from different Gaussians in the latent space to samples of different classes in the data space. We show how this phenomenon can be exploited for the task of unsupervised clustering, and provide quantitative evaluation showing the superiority of our method for the unsupervised clustering of image datasets. Finally, we demonstrate a feature which further sets our model apart from other GAN models: the option to control the quality-diversity trade-off by altering, post-training, the probability distribution of the latent space. This allows one to sample higher quality and lower diversity samples, or vice versa, according to one's needs."
Facial Information Recovery from Heavily Damaged Images using Generative Adversarial Network- PART 1,"Over the past decades, a large number of techniques have emerged in modern imaging systems to capture the exact information of the original scene regardless of shake, motion, lighting conditions and etc., These developments have progressively addressed the acquisition of images in high speed and high resolutions. However, the various ineradicable real-time factors cause the degradation of the information and the quality of the acquired images. The available techniques are not intelligent enough to generalize this complex phenomenon. Hence, it is necessary to develop an intellectual framework to recover the possible information presented in the original scene. In this article, we propose a kernel free framework based on conditional-GAN to recover the information from the heavily damaged images. The degradation of images is assumed to be occurred by the combination of a various blur. Learning parameter of the cGAN is optimized by multi-component loss function that includes improved wasserstein loss with regression loss function. The generator module of this network is developed by using U-Net architecture with local Residual connections and global skip connection. Local connections and a global skip connection are implemented for the utilization of all stages of features. Generated images show that the network has the potential to recover the probable information of blurred images from the learned features. This research work is carried out as a part of our IOP studio software 'Facial recognition module'."
simNet: Stepwise Image-Topic Merging Network for Generating Detailed and Comprehensive Image Captions,"The encode-decoder framework has shown recent success in image captioning. Visual attention, which is good at detailedness, and semantic attention, which is good at comprehensiveness, have been separately proposed to ground the caption on the image. In this paper, we propose the Stepwise Image-Topic Merging Network (simNet) that makes use of the two kinds of attention at the same time. At each time step when generating the caption, the decoder adaptively merges the attentive information in the extracted topics and the image according to the generated context, so that the visual information and the semantic information can be effectively combined. The proposed approach is evaluated on two benchmark datasets and reaches the state-of-the-art performances.(The code is available at https://github.com/lancopku/simNet)"
Single Image Dehazing Based on Generic Regularity,"This paper proposes a novel technique for single image dehazing. Most of the state-of-the-art methods for single image dehazing relies either on Dark Channel Prior (DCP) or on Color line. The proposed method combines the two different approaches. We initially compute the dark channel prior and then apply a Nearest-Neighbor (NN) based regularization technique to obtain a smooth transmission map of the hazy image. We consider the effect of airlight on the image by using the color line model to assess the commitment of airlight in each patch of the image and interpolate at the local neighborhood where the estimate is unreliable. The NN based regularization of the DCP can remove the haze, whereas, the color line based interpolation of airlight effect makes the proposed system robust against the variation of haze within an image due to multiple light sources. The proposed method is tested on benchmark datasets and shows promising results compared to the state-of-the-art, including the deep learning based methods, which require a huge computational setup. Moreover, the proposed method outperforms the recent deep learning based methods when applied on images with sky regions."
"Generating Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Imaging Data of Brain Tumours from Linear, Non-Linear and Deep Learning Models","Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) provides valuable information to help with the identification and understanding of brain tumors, yet MRS is not a widely available medical imaging modality. Aiming to counter this issue, this research draws on the advancements in machine learning techniques in other fields for the generation of artificial data. The generated methods were tested through the evaluation of their output against that of a real-world labelled MRS brain tumor data-set. Furthermore the resultant output from the generative techniques were each used to train separate traditional classifiers which were tested on a subset of the real MRS brain tumor dataset. The results suggest that there exist methods capable of producing accurate, ground truth based MRS voxels. These findings indicate that through generative techniques, large datasets can be made available for training deep, learning models for the use in brain tumor diagnosis."
Identification of Deep Network Generated Images Using Disparities in Color Components,"With the powerful deep network architectures, such as generative adversarial networks, one can easily generate photorealistic images. Although the generated images are not dedicated for fooling human or deceiving biometric authentication systems, research communities and public media have shown great concerns on the security issues caused by these images. This paper addresses the problem of identifying deep network generated (DNG) images. Taking the differences between camera imaging and DNG image generation into considerations, we analyze the disparities between DNG images and real images in different color components. We observe that the DNG images are more distinguishable from real ones in the chrominance components, especially in the residual domain. Based on these observations, we propose a feature set to capture color image statistics for identifying DNG images. Additionally, we evaluate several detection situations, including the training-testing data are matched or mismatched in image sources or generative models and detection with only real images. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method can accurately identify DNG images and outperforms existing methods when the training and testing data are mismatched. Moreover, when the GAN model is unknown, our methods also achieves good performance with one-class classification by using only real images for training."
Typhoon track prediction using satellite images in a Generative Adversarial Network,"Tracks of typhoons are predicted using satellite images as input for a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The satellite images have time gaps of 6 hours and are marked with a red square at the location of the typhoon center. The GAN uses images from the past to generate an image one time step ahead. The generated image shows the future location of the typhoon center, as well as the future cloud structures. The errors between predicted and real typhoon centers are measured quantitatively in kilometers. 42.4% of all typhoon center predictions have absolute errors of less than 80 km, 32.1% lie within a range of 80 - 120 km and the remaining 25.5% have accuracies above 120 km. The relative error sets the above mentioned absolute error in relation to the distance that has been traveled by a typhoon over the past 6 hours. High relative errors are found in three types of situations, when a typhoon moves on the open sea far away from land, when a typhoon changes its course suddenly and when a typhoon is about to hit the mainland. The cloud structure prediction is evaluated qualitatively. It is shown that the GAN is able to predict trends in cloud motion. In order to improve both, the typhoon center and cloud motion prediction, the present study suggests to add information about the sea surface temperature, surface pressure and velocity fields to the input data."
Pixel Objectness: Learning to Segment Generic Objects Automatically in Images and Videos,"We propose an end-to-end learning framework for segmenting generic objects in both images and videos. Given a novel image or video, our approach produces a pixel-level mask for all ""object-like"" regions---even for object categories never seen during training. We formulate the task as a structured prediction problem of assigning an object/background label to each pixel, implemented using a deep fully convolutional network. When applied to a video, our model further incorporates a motion stream, and the network learns to combine both appearance and motion and attempts to extract all prominent objects whether they are moving or not. Beyond the core model, a second contribution of our approach is how it leverages varying strengths of training annotations. Pixel-level annotations are quite difficult to obtain, yet crucial for training a deep network approach for segmentation. Thus we propose ways to exploit weakly labeled data for learning dense foreground segmentation. For images, we show the value in mixing object category examples with image-level labels together with relatively few images with boundary-level annotations. For video, we show how to bootstrap weakly annotated videos together with the network trained for image segmentation. Through experiments on multiple challenging image and video segmentation benchmarks, our method offers consistently strong results and improves the state-of-the-art for fully automatic segmentation of generic (unseen) objects. In addition, we demonstrate how our approach benefits image retrieval and image retargeting, both of which flourish when given our high-quality foreground maps. Code, models, and videos are at:http://vision.cs.utexas.edu/projects/pixelobjectness/"
Towards Audio to Scene Image Synthesis using Generative Adversarial Network,"Humans can imagine a scene from a sound. We want machines to do so by using conditional generative adversarial networks (GANs). By applying the techniques including spectral norm, projection discriminator and auxiliary classifier, compared with naive conditional GAN, the model can generate images with better quality in terms of both subjective and objective evaluations. Almost three-fourth of people agree that our model have the ability to generate images related to sounds. By inputting different volumes of the same sound, our model output different scales of changes based on the volumes, showing that our model truly knows the relationship between sounds and images to some extent."
Denoising of 3-D Magnetic Resonance Images Using a Residual Encoder-Decoder Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network,"Structure-preserved denoising of 3D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images is a critical step in medical image analysis. Over the past few years, many algorithms with impressive performances have been proposed. In this paper, inspired by the idea of deep learning, we introduce an MRI denoising method based on the residual encoder-decoder Wasserstein generative adversarial network (RED-WGAN). Specifically, to explore the structure similarity between neighboring slices, a 3D configuration is utilized as the basic processing unit. Residual autoencoders combined with deconvolution operations are introduced into the generator network. Furthermore, to alleviate the oversmoothing shortcoming of the traditional mean squared error (MSE) loss function, the perceptual similarity, which is implemented by calculating the distances in the feature space extracted by a pretrained VGG-19 network, is incorporated with the MSE and adversarial losses to form the new loss function. Extensive experiments are implemented to assess the performance of the proposed method. The experimental results show that the proposed RED-WGAN achieves performance superior to several state-of-the-art methods in both simulated and real clinical data. In particular, our method demonstrates powerful abilities in both noise suppression and structure preservation."
Image Inspired Poetry Generation in XiaoIce,"Vision is a common source of inspiration for poetry. The objects and the sentimental imprints that one perceives from an image may lead to various feelings depending on the reader. In this paper, we present a system of poetry generation from images to mimic the process. Given an image, we first extract a few keywords representing objects and sentiments perceived from the image. These keywords are then expanded to related ones based on their associations in human written poems. Finally, verses are generated gradually from the keywords using recurrent neural networks trained on existing poems. Our approach is evaluated by human assessors and compared to other generation baselines. The results show that our method can generate poems that are more artistic than the baseline methods. This is one of the few attempts to generate poetry from images. By deploying our proposed approach, XiaoIce has already generated more than 12 million poems for users since its release in July 2017. A book of its poems has been published by Cheers Publishing, which claimed that the book is the first-ever poetry collection written by an AI in human history."
Controllable Image-to-Video Translation: A Case Study on Facial Expression Generation,"The recent advances in deep learning have made it possible to generate photo-realistic images by using neural networks and even to extrapolate video frames from an input video clip. In this paper, for the sake of both furthering this exploration and our own interest in a realistic application, we study image-to-video translation and particularly focus on the videos of facial expressions. This problem challenges the deep neural networks by another temporal dimension comparing to the image-to-image translation. Moreover, its single input image fails most existing video generation methods that rely on recurrent models. We propose a user-controllable approach so as to generate video clips of various lengths from a single face image. The lengths and types of the expressions are controlled by users. To this end, we design a novel neural network architecture that can incorporate the user input into its skip connections and propose several improvements to the adversarial training method for the neural network. Experiments and user studies verify the effectiveness of our approach. Especially, we would like to highlight that even for the face images in the wild (downloaded from the Web and the authors' own photos), our model can generate high-quality facial expression videos of which about 50\% are labeled as real by Amazon Mechanical Turk workers."
Diverse Conditional Image Generation by Stochastic Regression with Latent Drop-Out Codes,"Recent advances in Deep Learning and probabilistic modeling have led to strong improvements in generative models for images. On the one hand, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have contributed a highly effective adversarial learning procedure, but still suffer from stability issues. On the other hand, Conditional Variational Auto-Encoders (CVAE) models provide a sound way of conditional modeling but suffer from mode-mixing issues. Therefore, recent work has turned back to simple and stable regression models that are effective at generation but give up on the sampling mechanism and the latent code representation. We propose a novel and efficient stochastic regression approach with latent drop-out codes that combines the merits of both lines of research. In addition, a new training objective increases coverage of the training distribution leading to improvements over the state of the art in terms of accuracy as well as diversity."
Hallucinating Agnostic Images to Generalize Across Domains,"The ability to generalize across visual domains is crucial for the robustness of artificial recognition systems. Although many training sources may be available in real contexts, the access to even unlabeled target samples cannot be taken for granted, which makes standard unsupervised domain adaptation methods inapplicable in the wild. In this work we investigate how to exploit multiple sources by hallucinating a deep visual domain composed of images, possibly unrealistic, able to maintain categorical knowledge while discarding specific source styles. The produced agnostic images are the result of a deep architecture that applies pixel adaptation on the original source data guided by two adversarial domain classifier branches at image and feature level. Our approach is conceived to learn only from source data, but it seamlessly extends to the use of unlabeled target samples. Remarkable results for both multi-source domain adaptation and domain generalization support the power of hallucinating agnostic images in this framework."
Physics-Based Generative Adversarial Models for Image Restoration and Beyond,"We present an algorithm to directly solve numerous image restoration problems (e.g., image deblurring, image dehazing, image deraining, etc.). These problems are highly ill-posed, and the common assumptions for existing methods are usually based on heuristic image priors. In this paper, we find that these problems can be solved by generative models with adversarial learning. However, the basic formulation of generative adversarial networks (GANs) does not generate realistic images, and some structures of the estimated images are usually not preserved well. Motivated by an interesting observation that the estimated results should be consistent with the observed inputs under the physics models, we propose a physics model constrained learning algorithm so that it can guide the estimation of the specific task in the conventional GAN framework. The proposed algorithm is trained in an end-to-end fashion and can be applied to a variety of image restoration and related low-level vision problems. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art algorithms."
Learning Collaborative Generation Correction Modules for Blind Image Deblurring and Beyond,"Blind image deblurring plays a very important role in many vision and multimedia applications. Most existing works tend to introduce complex priors to estimate the sharp image structures for blur kernel estimation. However, it has been verified that directly optimizing these models is challenging and easy to fall into degenerate solutions. Although several experience-based heuristic inference strategies, including trained networks and designed iterations, have been developed, it is still hard to obtain theoretically guaranteed accurate solutions. In this work, a collaborative learning framework is established to address the above issues. Specifically, we first design two modules, named Generator and Corrector, to extract the intrinsic image structures from the data-driven and knowledge-based perspectives, respectively. By introducing a collaborative methodology to cascade these modules, we can strictly prove the convergence of our image propagations to a deblurring-related optimal solution. As a nontrivial byproduct, we also apply the proposed method to address other related tasks, such as image interpolation and edge-preserved smoothing. Plenty of experiments demonstrate that our method can outperform the state-of-the-art approaches on both synthetic and real datasets."
"X2Face: A network for controlling face generation by using images, audio, and pose codes","The objective of this paper is a neural network model that controls the pose and expression of a given face, using another face or modality (e.g. audio). This model can then be used for lightweight, sophisticated video and image editing.  We make the following three contributions. First, we introduce a network, X2Face, that can control a source face (specified by one or more frames) using another face in a driving frame to produce a generated frame with the identity of the source frame but the pose and expression of the face in the driving frame. Second, we propose a method for training the network fully self-supervised using a large collection of video data. Third, we show that the generation process can be driven by other modalities, such as audio or pose codes, without any further training of the network.  The generation results for driving a face with another face are compared to state-of-the-art self-supervised/supervised methods. We show that our approach is more robust than other methods, as it makes fewer assumptions about the input data. We also show examples of using our framework for video face editing."
A general metric for identifying adversarial images,"It is well known that a determined adversary can fool a neural network by making imperceptible adversarial perturbations to an image. Recent studies have shown that these perturbations can be detected even without information about the neural network if the strategy taken by the adversary is known beforehand. Unfortunately, these studies suffer from the generalization limitation -- the detection method has to be recalibrated every time the adversary changes his strategy. In this study, we attempt to overcome the generalization limitation by deriving a metric which reliably identifies adversarial images even when the approach taken by the adversary is unknown. Our metric leverages key differences between the spectra of clean and adversarial images when an image is treated as a matrix. Our metric is able to detect adversarial images across different datasets and attack strategies without any additional re-calibration. In addition, our approach provides geometric insights into several unanswered questions about adversarial perturbations."
Medical Image Synthesis for Data Augmentation and Anonymization using Generative Adversarial Networks,"Data diversity is critical to success when training deep learning models. Medical imaging data sets are often imbalanced as pathologic findings are generally rare, which introduces significant challenges when training deep learning models. In this work, we propose a method to generate synthetic abnormal MRI images with brain tumors by training a generative adversarial network using two publicly available data sets of brain MRI. We demonstrate two unique benefits that the synthetic images provide. First, we illustrate improved performance on tumor segmentation by leveraging the synthetic images as a form of data augmentation. Second, we demonstrate the value of generative models as an anonymization tool, achieving comparable tumor segmentation results when trained on the synthetic data versus when trained on real subject data. Together, these results offer a potential solution to two of the largest challenges facing machine learning in medical imaging, namely the small incidence of pathological findings, and the restrictions around sharing of patient data."
AlphaGAN: Generative adversarial networks for natural image matting,"We present the first generative adversarial network (GAN) for natural image matting. Our novel generator network is trained to predict visually appealing alphas with the addition of the adversarial loss from the discriminator that is trained to classify well-composited images. Further, we improve existing encoder-decoder architectures to better deal with the spatial localization issues inherited in convolutional neural networks (CNN) by using dilated convolutions to capture global context information without downscaling feature maps and losing spatial information. We present state-of-the-art results on the alphamatting online benchmark for the gradient error and give comparable results in others. Our method is particularly well suited for fine structures like hair, which is of great importance in practical matting applications, e.g. in film/TV production."
Learning to Forecast and Refine Residual Motion for Image-to-Video Generation,"We consider the problem of image-to-video translation, where an input image is translated into an output video containing motions of a single object. Recent methods for such problems typically train transformation networks to generate future frames conditioned on the structure sequence. Parallel work has shown that short high-quality motions can be generated by spatiotemporal generative networks that leverage temporal knowledge from the training data. We combine the benefits of both approaches and propose a two-stage generation framework where videos are generated from structures and then refined by temporal signals. To model motions more efficiently, we train networks to learn residual motion between the current and future frames, which avoids learning motion-irrelevant details. We conduct extensive experiments on two image-to-video translation tasks: facial expression retargeting and human pose forecasting. Superior results over the state-of-the-art methods on both tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."
Explaining Image Classifiers by Counterfactual Generation,"When an image classifier makes a prediction, which parts of the image are relevant and why? We can rephrase this question to ask: which parts of the image, if they were not seen by the classifier, would most change its decision? Producing an answer requires marginalizing over images that could have been seen but weren't. We can sample plausible image in-fills by conditioning a generative model on the rest of the image. We then optimize to find the image regions that most change the classifier's decision after in-fill. Our approach contrasts with ad-hoc in-filling approaches, such as blurring or injecting noise, which generate inputs far from the data distribution, and ignore informative relationships between different parts of the image. Our method produces more compact and relevant saliency maps, with fewer artifacts compared to previous methods."
Generative Adversarial Networks for MR-CT Deformable Image Registration,"Deformable Image Registration (DIR) of MR and CT images is one of the most challenging registration task, due to the inherent structural differences of the modalities and the missing dense ground truth. Recently cycle Generative Adversarial Networks (cycle-GANs) have been used to learn the intensity relationship between these 2 modalities for unpaired brain data. Yet its usefulness for DIR was not assessed.  In this study we evaluate the DIR performance for thoracic and abdominal organs after synthesis by cycle-GAN. We show that geometric changes, which differentiate the two populations (e.g. inhale vs. exhale), are readily synthesized as well. This causes substantial problems for any application which relies on spatial correspondences being preserved between the real and the synthesized image (e.g. plan, segmentation, landmark propagation). To alleviate this problem, we investigated reducing the spatial information provided to the discriminator by decreasing the size of its receptive fields.  Image synthesis was learned from 17 unpaired subjects per modality. Registration performance was evaluated with respect to manual segmentations of 11 structures for 3 subjects from the VISERAL challenge. State-of-the-art DIR methods based on Normalized Mutual Information (NMI), Modality Independent Neighborhood Descriptor (MIND) and their novel combination achieved a mean segmentation overlap ratio of 76.7, 67.7, 76.9%, respectively. This dropped to 69.1% or less when registering images synthesized by cycle-GAN based on local correlation, due to the poor performance on the thoracic region, where large lung volume changes were synthesized. Performance for the abdominal region was similar to that of CT-MRI NMI registration (77.4 vs. 78.8%) when using 3D synthesizing MRIs (12 slices) and medium sized receptive fields for the discriminator."
CT Image Enhancement Using Stacked Generative Adversarial Networks and Transfer Learning for Lesion Segmentation Improvement,"Automated lesion segmentation from computed tomography (CT) is an important and challenging task in medical image analysis. While many advancements have been made, there is room for continued improvements. One hurdle is that CT images can exhibit high noise and low contrast, particularly in lower dosages. To address this, we focus on a preprocessing method for CT images that uses stacked generative adversarial networks (SGAN) approach. The first GAN reduces the noise in the CT image and the second GAN generates a higher resolution image with enhanced boundaries and high contrast. To make up for the absence of high quality CT images, we detail how to synthesize a large number of low- and high-quality natural images and use transfer learning with progressively larger amounts of CT images. We apply both the classic GrabCut method and the modern holistically nested network (HNN) to lesion segmentation, testing whether SGAN can yield improved lesion segmentation. Experimental results on the DeepLesion dataset demonstrate that the SGAN enhancements alone can push GrabCut performance over HNN trained on original images. We also demonstrate that HNN + SGAN performs best compared against four other enhancement methods, including when using only a single GAN."
Learning Generic Diffusion Processes for Image Restoration,"Image restoration problems are typical ill-posed problems where the regularization term plays an important role. The regularization term learned via generative approaches is easy to transfer to various image restoration, but offers inferior restoration quality compared with that learned via discriminative approaches. On the contrary, the regularization term learned via discriminative approaches are usually trained for a specific image restoration problem, and fail in the problem for which it is not trained. To address this issue, we propose a generic diffusion process (genericDP) to handle multiple Gaussian denoising problems based on the Trainable Non-linear Reaction Diffusion (TNRD) models. Instead of one model, which consists of a diffusion and a reaction term, for one Gaussian denoising problem in TNRD, we enforce multiple TNRD models to share one diffusion term. The trained genericDP model can provide both promising denoising performance and high training efficiency compared with the original TNRD models. We also transfer the trained diffusion term to non-blind deconvolution which is unseen in the training phase. Experiment results show that the trained diffusion term for multiple Gaussian denoising can be transferred to image non-blind deconvolution as an image prior and provide competitive performance."
A salt and pepper noise image denoising method based on the generative classification,"In this paper, an image denoising algorithm is proposed for salt and pepper noise. First, a generative model is built on a patch as a basic unit and then the algorithm locates the image noise within that patch in order to better describe the patch and obtain better subsequent clustering. Second, the algorithm classifies patches using a generative clustering method, thus providing additional similarity information for noise repair and suppressing the interference of noise, abandoning those categories that consist of a smaller number of patches. Finally, the algorithm builds a non-local switching filter to remove the salt and pepper noise. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm effectively denoises salt and pepper noise of various densities. It obtains a better visual quality and higher peak signal-to-noise ratio score than several state-of-the-art algorithms. In short, our algorithm uses a noisy patch as the basic unit, a patch clustering method to optimize the repair data set as well as obtain a better denoising effect, and provides a guideline for future denoising and repair methods."
Vehicle Image Generation Going Well with The Surroundings,"Since the generative neural networks have made a breakthrough in the image generation problem, lots of researches on their applications have been studied such as image restoration, style transfer and image completion. However, there has been few research generating objects in uncontrolled real-world environments. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for vehicle image generation in real-world scenes. Using a subnetwork based on a precedent work of image completion, our model makes the shape of an object. Details of objects are trained by an additional colorization and refinement subnetwork, resulting in a better quality of generated objects. Unlike many other works, our method does not require any segmentation layout but still makes a plausible vehicle in the image. We evaluate our method by using images from Berkeley Deep Drive (BDD) and Cityscape datasets, which are widely used for object detection and image segmentation problems. The adequacy of the generated images by the proposed method has also been evaluated using a widely utilized object detection algorithm and the FID score."
Generate the corresponding Image from Text Description using Modified GAN-CLS Algorithm,"Synthesizing images or texts automatically is a useful research area in the artificial intelligence nowadays. Generative adversarial networks (GANs), which are proposed by Goodfellow in 2014, make this task to be done more efficiently by using deep neural networks. We consider generating corresponding images from an input text description using a GAN. In this paper, we analyze the GAN-CLS algorithm, which is a kind of advanced method of GAN proposed by Scott Reed in 2016. First, we find the problem with this algorithm through inference. Then we correct the GAN-CLS algorithm according to the inference by modifying the objective function of the model. Finally, we do the experiments on the Oxford-102 dataset and the CUB dataset. As a result, our modified algorithm can generate images which are more plausible than the GAN-CLS algorithm in some cases. Also, some of the generated images match the input texts better."
Subject2Vec: Generative-Discriminative Approach from a Set of Image Patches to a Vector,"We propose an attention-based method that aggregates local image features to a subject-level representation for predicting disease severity. In contrast to classical deep learning that requires a fixed dimensional input, our method operates on a set of image patches; hence it can accommodate variable length input image without image resizing. The model learns a clinically interpretable subject-level representation that is reflective of the disease severity. Our model consists of three mutually dependent modules which regulate each other: (1) a discriminative network that learns a fixed-length representation from local features and maps them to disease severity; (2) an attention mechanism that provides interpretability by focusing on the areas of the anatomy that contribute the most to the prediction task; and (3) a generative network that encourages the diversity of the local latent features. The generative term ensures that the attention weights are non-degenerate while maintaining the relevance of the local regions to the disease severity. We train our model end-to-end in the context of a large-scale lung CT study of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Our model gives state-of-the art performance in predicting clinical measures of severity for COPD. The distribution of the attention provides the regional relevance of lung tissue to the clinical measurements."
Unsupervised Learning of Object Landmarks through Conditional Image Generation,"We propose a method for learning landmark detectors for visual objects (such as the eyes and the nose in a face) without any manual supervision. We cast this as the problem of generating images that combine the appearance of the object as seen in a first example image with the geometry of the object as seen in a second example image, where the two examples differ by a viewpoint change and/or an object deformation. In order to factorize appearance and geometry, we introduce a tight bottleneck in the geometry-extraction process that selects and distils geometry-related features. Compared to standard image generation problems, which often use generative adversarial networks, our generation task is conditioned on both appearance and geometry and thus is significantly less ambiguous, to the point that adopting a simple perceptual loss formulation is sufficient. We demonstrate that our approach can learn object landmarks from synthetic image deformations or videos, all without manual supervision, while outperforming state-of-the-art unsupervised landmark detectors. We further show that our method is applicable to a large variety of datasets - faces, people, 3D objects, and digits - without any modifications."
Generative Adversarial Networks for Image-to-Image Translation on Multi-Contrast MR Images - A Comparison of CycleGAN and UNIT,"In medical imaging, a general problem is that it is costly and time consuming to collect high quality data from healthy and diseased subjects. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) is a deep learning method that has been developed for synthesizing data. GANs can thereby be used to generate more realistic training data, to improve classification performance of machine learning algorithms. Another application of GANs is image-to-image translations, e.g. generating magnetic resonance (MR) images from computed tomography (CT) images, which can be used to obtain multimodal datasets from a single modality. Here, we evaluate two unsupervised GAN models (CycleGAN and UNIT) for image-to-image translation of T1- and T2-weighted MR images, by comparing generated synthetic MR images to ground truth images. We also evaluate two supervised models; a modification of CycleGAN and a pure generator model. A small perceptual study was also performed to evaluate how visually realistic the synthesized images are. It is shown that the implemented GAN models can synthesize visually realistic MR images (incorrectly labeled as real by a human). It is also shown that models producing more visually realistic synthetic images not necessarily have better quantitative error measurements, when compared to ground truth data. Code is available at https://github.com/simontomaskarlsson/GAN-MRI"
Task Driven Generative Modeling for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation: Application to X-ray Image Segmentation,"Automatic parsing of anatomical objects in X-ray images is critical to many clinical applications in particular towards image-guided invention and workflow automation. Existing deep network models require a large amount of labeled data. However, obtaining accurate pixel-wise labeling in X-ray images relies heavily on skilled clinicians due to the large overlaps of anatomy and the complex texture patterns. On the other hand, organs in 3D CT scans preserve clearer structures as well as sharper boundaries and thus can be easily delineated. In this paper, we propose a novel model framework for learning automatic X-ray image parsing from labeled CT scans. Specifically, a Dense Image-to-Image network (DI2I) for multi-organ segmentation is first trained on X-ray like Digitally Reconstructed Radiographs (DRRs) rendered from 3D CT volumes. Then we introduce a Task Driven Generative Adversarial Network (TD-GAN) architecture to achieve simultaneous style transfer and parsing for unseen real X-ray images. TD-GAN consists of a modified cycle-GAN substructure for pixel-to-pixel translation between DRRs and X-ray images and an added module leveraging the pre-trained DI2I to enforce segmentation consistency. The TD-GAN framework is general and can be easily adapted to other learning tasks. In the numerical experiments, we validate the proposed model on 815 DRRs and 153 topograms. While the vanilla DI2I without any adaptation fails completely on segmenting the topograms, the proposed model does not require any topogram labels and is able to provide a promising average dice of 85% which achieves the same level accuracy of supervised training (88%)."
The Neural Painter: Multi-Turn Image Generation,"In this work we combine two research threads from Vision/ Graphics and Natural Language Processing to formulate an image generation task conditioned on attributes in a multi-turn setting. By multiturn, we mean the image is generated in a series of steps of user-specified conditioning information. Our proposed approach is practically useful and offers insights into neural interpretability. We introduce a framework that includes a novel training algorithm as well as model improvements built for the multi-turn setting. We demonstrate that this framework generates a sequence of images that match the given conditioning information and that this task is useful for more detailed benchmarking and analysis of conditional image generation methods."
Efficient Active Learning for Image Classification and Segmentation using a Sample Selection and Conditional Generative Adversarial Network,"Training robust deep learning (DL) systems for medical image classification or segmentation is challenging due to limited images covering different disease types and severity. We propose an active learning (AL) framework to select most informative samples and add to the training data. We use conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) to generate realistic chest xray images with different disease characteristics by conditioning its generation on a real image sample. Informative samples to add to the training set are identified using a Bayesian neural network. Experiments show our proposed AL framework is able to achieve state of the art performance by using about 35% of the full dataset, thus saving significant time and effort over conventional methods."
Deep Generative Models in the Real-World: An Open Challenge from Medical Imaging,"Recent advances in deep learning led to novel generative modeling techniques that achieve unprecedented quality in generated samples and performance in learning complex distributions in imaging data. These new models in medical image computing have important applications that form clinically relevant and very challenging unsupervised learning problems. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using state-of-the-art auto-encoder-based deep generative models, such as variational and adversarial auto-encoders, for one such task: abnormality detection in medical imaging. We utilize typical, publicly available datasets with brain scans from healthy subjects and patients with stroke lesions and brain tumors. We use the data from healthy subjects to train different auto-encoder based models to learn the distribution of healthy images and detect pathologies as outliers. Models that can better learn the data distribution should be able to detect outliers more accurately. We evaluate the detection performance of deep generative models and compare them with non-deep learning based approaches to provide a benchmark of the current state of research. We conclude that abnormality detection is a challenging task for deep generative models and large room exists for improvement. In order to facilitate further research, we aim to provide carefully pre-processed imaging data available to the research community."
What Is It Like Down There? Generating Dense Ground-Level Views and Image Features From Overhead Imagery Using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks,"This paper investigates conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) to overcome a fundamental limitation of using geotagged media for geographic discovery, namely its sparse and uneven spatial distribution. We train a cGAN to generate ground-level views of a location given overhead imagery. We show the ""fake"" ground-level images are natural looking and are structurally similar to the real images. More significantly, we show the generated images are representative of the locations and that the representations learned by the cGANs are informative. In particular, we show that dense feature maps generated using our framework are more effective for land-cover classification than approaches which spatially interpolate features extracted from sparse ground-level images. To our knowledge, ours is the first work to use cGANs to generate ground-level views given overhead imagery and to explore the benefits of the learned representations."
Generative Adversarial Network Architectures For Image Synthesis Using Capsule Networks,"In this paper, we propose Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architectures that use Capsule Networks for image-synthesis. Based on the principal of positional-equivariance of features, Capsule Network's ability to encode spatial relationships between the features of the image helps it become a more powerful critic in comparison to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) used in current architectures for image synthesis. Our proposed GAN architectures learn the data manifold much faster and therefore, synthesize visually accurate images in significantly lesser number of training samples and training epochs in comparison to GANs and its variants that use CNNs. Apart from analyzing the quantitative results corresponding the images generated by different architectures, we also explore the reasons for the lower coverage and diversity explored by the GAN architectures that use CNN critics."
Generating Image Sequence from Description with LSTM Conditional GAN,"Generating images from word descriptions is a challenging task. Generative adversarial networks(GANs) are shown to be able to generate realistic images of real-life objects. In this paper, we propose a new neural network architecture of LSTM Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks to generate images of real-life objects. Our proposed model is trained on the Oxford-102 Flowers and Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 datasets. We demonstrate that our proposed model produces the better results surpassing other state-of-art approaches."
Generative Modeling by Inclusive Neural Random Fields with Applications in Image Generation and Anomaly Detection,"Neural random fields (NRFs), referring to a class of generative models that use neural networks to implement potential functions in random fields (a.k.a. energy-based models), are not new but receive less attention with slow progress. Different from various directed graphical models such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), NRFs provide an interesting family of undirected graphical models for generative modeling. In this paper we propose a new approach, the inclusive-NRF approach, to learning NRFs for continuous data (e.g. images), by introducing inclusive-divergence minimized auxiliary generators and developing stochastic gradient sampling in an augmented space. Based on the new approach, specific inclusive-NRF models are developed and thoroughly evaluated in two important generative modeling applications - image generation and anomaly detection. The proposed models consistently improve over state-of-the-art results in both applications. Remarkably, in addition to superior sample generation, one additional benefit of our inclusive-NRF approach is that, unlike GANs, it can directly provide (unnormalized) density estimate for sample evaluation. With these contributions and results, this paper significantly advances the learning and applications of NRFs to a new level, both theoretically and empirically, which have never been obtained before."
Why do deep convolutional networks generalize so poorly to small image transformations?,"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are commonly assumed to be invariant to small image transformations: either because of the convolutional architecture or because they were trained using data augmentation. Recently, several authors have shown that this is not the case: small translations or rescalings of the input image can drastically change the network's prediction. In this paper, we quantify this phenomena and ask why neither the convolutional architecture nor data augmentation are sufficient to achieve the desired invariance. Specifically, we show that the convolutional architecture does not give invariance since architectures ignore the classical sampling theorem, and data augmentation does not give invariance because the CNNs learn to be invariant to transformations only for images that are very similar to typical images from the training set. We discuss two possible solutions to this problem: (1) antialiasing the intermediate representations and (2) increasing data augmentation and show that they provide only a partial solution at best. Taken together, our results indicate that the problem of insuring invariance to small image transformations in neural networks while preserving high accuracy remains unsolved."
Object Detection using Domain Randomization and Generative Adversarial Refinement of Synthetic Images,"In this work, we present an application of domain randomization and generative adversarial networks (GAN) to train a near real-time object detector for industrial electric parts, entirely in a simulated environment. Large scale availability of labelled real world data is typically rare and difficult to obtain in many industrial settings. As such here, only a few hundred of unlabelled real images are used to train a Cyclic-GAN network, in combination with various degree of domain randomization procedures. We demonstrate that this enables robust translation of synthetic images to the real world domain. We show that a combination of the original synthetic (simulation) and GAN translated images, when used for training a Mask-RCNN object detection network achieves greater than 0.95 mean average precision in detecting and classifying a collection of industrial electric parts. We evaluate the performance across different combinations of training data."
Capturing Variabilities from Computed Tomography Images with Generative Adversarial Networks,"With the advent of Deep Learning (DL) techniques, especially Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), data augmentation and generation are quickly evolving domains that have raised much interest recently. However, the DL techniques are data demanding and since, medical data is not easily accessible, they suffer from data insufficiency. To deal with this limitation, different data augmentation techniques are used. Here, we propose a novel unsupervised data-driven approach for data augmentation that can generate 2D Computed Tomography (CT) images using a simple GAN. The generated CT images have good global and local features of a real CT image and can be used to augment the training datasets for effective learning. In this proof-of-concept study, we show that our proposed solution using GANs is able to capture some of the global and local CT variabilities. Our network is able to generate visually realistic CT images and we aim to further enhance its output by scaling it to a higher resolution and potentially from 2D to 3D."
Global Sum Pooling: A Generalization Trick for Object Counting with Small Datasets of Large Images,"In this paper, we explore the problem of training one-look regression models for counting objects in datasets comprising a small number of high-resolution, variable-shaped images. We illustrate that conventional global average pooling (GAP) based models are unreliable due to the patchwise cancellation of true overestimates and underestimates for patchwise inference. To overcome this limitation and reduce overfitting caused by the training on full-resolution images, we propose to employ global sum pooling (GSP) instead of GAP or fully connected (FC) layers at the backend of a convolutional network. Although computationally equivalent to GAP, we show through comprehensive experimentation that GSP allows convolutional networks to learn the counting task as a simple linear mapping problem generalized over the input shape and the number of objects present. This generalization capability allows GSP to avoid both patchwise cancellation and overfitting by training on small patches and inference on full-resolution images as a whole. We evaluate our approach on four different aerial image datasets - two car counting datasets (CARPK and COWC), one crowd counting dataset (ShanghaiTech; parts A and B) and one new challenging dataset for wheat spike counting. Our GSP models improve upon the state-of-the-art approaches on all four datasets with a simple architecture. Also, GSP architectures trained with smaller-sized image patches exhibit better localization property due to their focus on learning from smaller regions while training."
GLAC Net: GLocal Attention Cascading Networks for Multi-image Cued Story Generation,"The task of multi-image cued story generation, such as visual storytelling dataset (VIST) challenge, is to compose multiple coherent sentences from a given sequence of images. The main difficulty is how to generate image-specific sentences within the context of overall images. Here we propose a deep learning network model, GLAC Net, that generates visual stories by combining global-local (glocal) attention and context cascading mechanisms. The model incorporates two levels of attention, i.e., overall encoding level and image feature level, to construct image-dependent sentences. While standard attention configuration needs a large number of parameters, the GLAC Net implements them in a very simple way via hard connections from the outputs of encoders or image features onto the sentence generators. The coherency of the generated story is further improved by conveying (cascading) the information of the previous sentence to the next sentence serially. We evaluate the performance of the GLAC Net on the visual storytelling dataset (VIST) and achieve very competitive results compared to the state-of-the-art techniques. Our code and pre-trained models are available here."
Generative Adversarial Image Synthesis with Decision Tree Latent Controller,"This paper proposes the decision tree latent controller generative adversarial network (DTLC-GAN), an extension of a GAN that can learn hierarchically interpretable representations without relying on detailed supervision. To impose a hierarchical inclusion structure on latent variables, we incorporate a new architecture called the DTLC into the generator input. The DTLC has a multiple-layer tree structure in which the ON or OFF of the child node codes is controlled by the parent node codes. By using this architecture hierarchically, we can obtain the latent space in which the lower layer codes are selectively used depending on the higher layer ones. To make the latent codes capture salient semantic features of images in a hierarchically disentangled manner in the DTLC, we also propose a hierarchical conditional mutual information regularization and optimize it with a newly defined curriculum learning method that we propose as well. This makes it possible to discover hierarchically interpretable representations in a layer-by-layer manner on the basis of information gain by only using a single DTLC-GAN model. We evaluated the DTLC-GAN on various datasets, i.e., MNIST, CIFAR-10, Tiny ImageNet, 3D Faces, and CelebA, and confirmed that the DTLC-GAN can learn hierarchically interpretable representations with either unsupervised or weakly supervised settings. Furthermore, we applied the DTLC-GAN to image-retrieval tasks and showed its effectiveness in representation learning."
Cross Domain Image Generation through Latent Space Exploration with Adversarial Loss,"Conditional domain generation is a good way to interactively control sample generation process of deep generative models. However, once a conditional generative model has been created, it is often expensive to allow it to adapt to new conditional controls, especially the network structure is relatively deep. We propose a conditioned latent domain transfer framework across latent spaces of unconditional variational autoencoders(VAE). With this framework, we can allow unconditionally trained VAEs to generate images in its domain with conditionals provided by a latent representation of another domain. This framework does not assume commonalities between two domains. We demonstrate effectiveness and robustness of our model under widely used image datasets."
Hybrid Retrieval-Generation Reinforced Agent for Medical Image Report Generation,"Generating long and coherent reports to describe medical images poses challenges to bridging visual patterns with informative human linguistic descriptions. We propose a novel Hybrid Retrieval-Generation Reinforced Agent (HRGR-Agent) which reconciles traditional retrieval-based approaches populated with human prior knowledge, with modern learning-based approaches to achieve structured, robust, and diverse report generation. HRGR-Agent employs a hierarchical decision-making procedure. For each sentence, a high-level retrieval policy module chooses to either retrieve a template sentence from an off-the-shelf template database, or invoke a low-level generation module to generate a new sentence. HRGR-Agent is updated via reinforcement learning, guided by sentence-level and word-level rewards. Experiments show that our approach achieves the state-of-the-art results on two medical report datasets, generating well-balanced structured sentences with robust coverage of heterogeneous medical report contents. In addition, our model achieves the highest detection accuracy of medical terminologies, and improved human evaluation performance."
Improving Image Captioning with Conditional Generative Adversarial Nets,"In this paper, we propose a novel conditional-generative-adversarial-nets-based image captioning framework as an extension of traditional reinforcement-learning (RL)-based encoder-decoder architecture. To deal with the inconsistent evaluation problem among different objective language metrics, we are motivated to design some ""discriminator"" networks to automatically and progressively determine whether generated caption is human described or machine generated. Two kinds of discriminator architectures (CNN and RNN-based structures) are introduced since each has its own advantages. The proposed algorithm is generic so that it can enhance any existing RL-based image captioning framework and we show that the conventional RL training method is just a special case of our approach. Empirically, we show consistent improvements over all language evaluation metrics for different state-of-the-art image captioning models. In addition, the well-trained discriminators can also be viewed as objective image captioning evaluators"
SemStyle: Learning to Generate Stylised Image Captions using Unaligned Text,"Linguistic style is an essential part of written communication, with the power to affect both clarity and attractiveness. With recent advances in vision and language, we can start to tackle the problem of generating image captions that are both visually grounded and appropriately styled. Existing approaches either require styled training captions aligned to images or generate captions with low relevance. We develop a model that learns to generate visually relevant styled captions from a large corpus of styled text without aligned images. The core idea of this model, called SemStyle, is to separate semantics and style. One key component is a novel and concise semantic term representation generated using natural language processing techniques and frame semantics. In addition, we develop a unified language model that decodes sentences with diverse word choices and syntax for different styles. Evaluations, both automatic and manual, show captions from SemStyle preserve image semantics, are descriptive, and are style shifted. More broadly, this work provides possibilities to learn richer image descriptions from the plethora of linguistic data available on the web."
Image-derived generative modeling of pseudo-macromolecular structures - towards the statistical assessment of Electron CryoTomography template matching,"Cellular Electron CryoTomography (CECT) is a 3D imaging technique that captures information about the structure and spatial organization of macromolecular complexes within single cells, in near-native state and at sub-molecular resolution. Although template matching is often used to locate macromolecules in a CECT image, it is insufficient as it only measures the relative structural similarity. Therefore, it is preferable to assess the statistical credibility of the decision through hypothesis testing, requiring many templates derived from a diverse population of macromolecular structures. Due to the very limited number of known structures, we need a generative model to efficiently and reliably sample pseudo-structures from the complex distribution of macromolecular structures. To address this challenge, we propose a novel image-derived approach for performing hypothesis testing for template matching by constructing generative models using the generative adversarial network. Finally, we conducted hypothesis testing experiments for template matching on both simulated and experimental subtomograms, allowing us to conclude the identity of subtomograms with high statistical credibility and significantly reducing false positives."
Exploiting Images for Video Recognition with Hierarchical Generative Adversarial Networks,"Existing deep learning methods of video recognition usually require a large number of labeled videos for training. But for a new task, videos are often unlabeled and it is also time-consuming and labor-intensive to annotate them. Instead of human annotation, we try to make use of existing fully labeled images to help recognize those videos. However, due to the problem of domain shifts and heterogeneous feature representations, the performance of classifiers trained on images may be dramatically degraded for video recognition tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel method, called Hierarchical Generative Adversarial Networks (HiGAN), to enhance recognition in videos (i.e., target domain) by transferring knowledge from images (i.e., source domain). The HiGAN model consists of a \emph{low-level} conditional GAN and a \emph{high-level} conditional GAN. By taking advantage of these two-level adversarial learning, our method is capable of learning a domain-invariant feature representation of source images and target videos. Comprehensive experiments on two challenging video recognition datasets (i.e. UCF101 and HMDB51) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method when compared with the existing state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods."
Stingray Detection of Aerial Images Using Augmented Training Images Generated by A Conditional Generative Model,"In this paper, we present an object detection method that tackles the stingray detection problem based on aerial images. In this problem, the images are aerially captured on a sea-surface area by using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), and the stingrays swimming under (but close to) the sea surface are the target we want to detect and locate. To this end, we use a deep object detection method, faster RCNN, to train a stingray detector based on a limited training set of images. To boost the performance, we develop a new generative approach, conditional GLO, to increase the training samples of stingray, which is an extension of the Generative Latent Optimization (GLO) approach. Unlike traditional data augmentation methods that generate new data only for image classification, our proposed method that mixes foreground and background together can generate new data for an object detection task, and thus improve the training efficacy of a CNN detector. Experimental results show that satisfiable performance can be obtained by using our approach on stingray detection in aerial images."
PSGAN: A Generative Adversarial Network for Remote Sensing Image Pan-Sharpening,"This paper addresses the problem of remote sensing image pan-sharpening from the perspective of generative adversarial learning. We propose a novel deep neural network based method named PSGAN. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first attempts at producing high-quality pan-sharpened images with GANs. The PSGAN consists of two components: a generative network (i.e., generator) and a discriminative network (i.e., discriminator). The generator is designed to accept panchromatic (PAN) and multispectral (MS) images as inputs and maps them to the desired high-resolution (HR) MS images and the discriminator implements the adversarial training strategy for generating higher fidelity pan-sharpened images. In this paper, we evaluate several architectures and designs, namely two-stream input, stacking input, batch normalization layer, and attention mechanism to find the optimal solution for pan-sharpening. Extensive experiments on QuickBird, GaoFen-2, and WorldView-2 satellite images demonstrate that the proposed PSGANs not only are effective in generating high-quality HR MS images and superior to state-of-the-art methods and also generalize well to full-scale images."
High-resolution medical image synthesis using progressively grown generative adversarial networks,"Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a class of unsupervised machine learning algorithms that can produce realistic images from randomly-sampled vectors in a multi-dimensional space. Until recently, it was not possible to generate realistic high-resolution images using GANs, which has limited their applicability to medical images that contain biomarkers only detectable at native resolution. Progressive growing of GANs is an approach wherein an image generator is trained to initially synthesize low resolution synthetic images (8x8 pixels), which are then fed to a discriminator that distinguishes these synthetic images from real downsampled images. Additional convolutional layers are then iteratively introduced to produce images at twice the previous resolution until the desired resolution is reached. In this work, we demonstrate that this approach can produce realistic medical images in two different domains; fundus photographs exhibiting vascular pathology associated with retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), and multi-modal magnetic resonance images of glioma. We also show that fine-grained details associated with pathology, such as retinal vessels or tumor heterogeneity, can be preserved and enhanced by including segmentation maps as additional channels. We envisage several applications of the approach, including image augmentation and unsupervised classification of pathology."
MEGAN: Mixture of Experts of Generative Adversarial Networks for Multimodal Image Generation,"Recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have shown promising performance in generating realistic images. However, they often struggle in learning complex underlying modalities in a given dataset, resulting in poor-quality generated images. To mitigate this problem, we present a novel approach called mixture of experts GAN (MEGAN), an ensemble approach of multiple generator networks. Each generator network in MEGAN specializes in generating images with a particular subset of modalities, e.g., an image class. Instead of incorporating a separate step of handcrafted clustering of multiple modalities, our proposed model is trained through an end-to-end learning of multiple generators via gating networks, which is responsible for choosing the appropriate generator network for a given condition. We adopt the categorical reparameterization trick for a categorical decision to be made in selecting a generator while maintaining the flow of the gradients. We demonstrate that individual generators learn different and salient subparts of the data and achieve a multiscale structural similarity (MS-SSIM) score of 0.2470 for CelebA and a competitive unsupervised inception score of 8.33 in CIFAR-10."
Unpaired Multi-Domain Image Generation via Regularized Conditional GANs,"In this paper, we study the problem of multi-domain image generation, the goal of which is to generate pairs of corresponding images from different domains. With the recent development in generative models, image generation has achieved great progress and has been applied to various computer vision tasks. However, multi-domain image generation may not achieve the desired performance due to the difficulty of learning the correspondence of different domain images, especially when the information of paired samples is not given. To tackle this problem, we propose Regularized Conditional GAN (RegCGAN) which is capable of learning to generate corresponding images in the absence of paired training data. RegCGAN is based on the conditional GAN, and we introduce two regularizers to guide the model to learn the corresponding semantics of different domains. We evaluate the proposed model on several tasks for which paired training data is not given, including the generation of edges and photos, the generation of faces with different attributes, etc. The experimental results show that our model can successfully generate corresponding images for all these tasks, while outperforms the baseline methods. We also introduce an approach of applying RegCGAN to unsupervised domain adaptation."
Fast-converging Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks for Image Synthesis,"Building on top of the success of generative adversarial networks (GANs), conditional GANs attempt to better direct the data generation process by conditioning with certain additional information. Inspired by the most recent AC-GAN, in this paper we propose a fast-converging conditional GAN (FC-GAN). In addition to the real/fake classifier used in vanilla GANs, our discriminator has an advanced auxiliary classifier which distinguishes each real class from an extra `fake' class. The `fake' class avoids mixing generated data with real data, which can potentially confuse the classification of real data as AC-GAN does, and makes the advanced auxiliary classifier behave as another real/fake classifier. As a result, FC-GAN can accelerate the process of differentiation of all classes, thus boost the convergence speed. Experimental results on image synthesis demonstrate our model is competitive in the quality of images generated while achieving a faster convergence rate."
Transferring GANs: generating images from limited data,"Transferring the knowledge of pretrained networks to new domains by means of finetuning is a widely used practice for applications based on discriminative models. To the best of our knowledge this practice has not been studied within the context of generative deep networks. Therefore, we study domain adaptation applied to image generation with generative adversarial networks. We evaluate several aspects of domain adaptation, including the impact of target domain size, the relative distance between source and target domain, and the initialization of conditional GANs. Our results show that using knowledge from pretrained networks can shorten the convergence time and can significantly improve the quality of the generated images, especially when the target data is limited. We show that these conclusions can also be drawn for conditional GANs even when the pretrained model was trained without conditioning. Our results also suggest that density may be more important than diversity and a dataset with one or few densely sampled classes may be a better source model than more diverse datasets such as ImageNet or Places."
MC-GAN: Multi-conditional Generative Adversarial Network for Image Synthesis,"In this paper, we introduce a new method for generating an object image from text attributes on a desired location, when the base image is given. One step further to the existing studies on text-to-image generation mainly focusing on the object's appearance, the proposed method aims to generate an object image preserving the given background information, which is the first attempt in this field. To tackle the problem, we propose a multi-conditional GAN (MC-GAN) which controls both the object and background information jointly. As a core component of MC-GAN, we propose a synthesis block which disentangles the object and background information in the training stage. This block enables MC-GAN to generate a realistic object image with the desired background by controlling the amount of the background information from the given base image using the foreground information from the text attributes. From the experiments with Caltech-200 bird and Oxford-102 flower datasets, we show that our model is able to generate photo-realistic images with a resolution of 128 x 128. The source code of MC-GAN is released."
Perceptually Optimized Generative Adversarial Network for Single Image Dehazing,"Existing approaches towards single image dehazing including both model-based and learning-based heavily rely on the estimation of so-called transmission maps. Despite its conceptual simplicity, using transmission maps as an intermediate step often makes it more difficult to optimize the perceptual quality of reconstructed images. To overcome this weakness, we propose a direct deep learning approach toward image dehazing bypassing the step of transmission map estimation and facilitating end-to-end perceptual optimization. Our technical contributions are mainly three-fold. First, based on the analogy between dehazing and denoising, we propose to directly learn a nonlinear mapping from the space of degraded images to that of haze-free ones via recursive deep residual learning; Second, inspired by the success of generative adversarial networks (GAN), we propose to optimize the perceptual quality of dehazed images by introducing a discriminator and a loss function adaptive to hazy conditions; Third, we propose to remove notorious halo-like artifacts at large scene depth discontinuities by a novel application of guided filtering. Extensive experimental results have shown that the subjective qualities of dehazed images by the proposed perceptually optimized GAN (POGAN) are often more favorable than those by existing state-of-the-art approaches especially when hazy condition varies."
Text to Image Synthesis Using Generative Adversarial Networks,"Generating images from natural language is one of the primary applications of recent conditional generative models. Besides testing our ability to model conditional, highly dimensional distributions, text to image synthesis has many exciting and practical applications such as photo editing or computer-aided content creation. Recent progress has been made using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). This material starts with a gentle introduction to these topics and discusses the existent state of the art models. Moreover, I propose Wasserstein GAN-CLS, a new model for conditional image generation based on the Wasserstein distance which offers guarantees of stability. Then, I show how the novel loss function of Wasserstein GAN-CLS can be used in a Conditional Progressive Growing GAN. In combination with the proposed loss, the model boosts by 7.07% the best Inception Score (on the Caltech birds dataset) of the models which use only the sentence-level visual semantics. The only model which performs better than the Conditional Wasserstein Progressive Growing GAN is the recently proposed AttnGAN which uses word-level visual semantics as well."
Generating Synthetic X-ray Images of a Person from the Surface Geometry,"We present a novel framework that learns to predict human anatomy from body surface. Specifically, our approach generates a synthetic X-ray image of a person only from the person's surface geometry. Furthermore, the synthetic X-ray image is parametrized and can be manipulated by adjusting a set of body markers which are also generated during the X-ray image prediction. With the proposed framework, multiple synthetic X-ray images can easily be generated by varying surface geometry. By perturbing the parameters, several additional synthetic X-ray images can be generated from the same surface geometry. As a result, our approach offers a potential to overcome the training data barrier in the medical domain. This capability is achieved by learning a pair of networks - one learns to generate the full image from the partial image and a set of parameters, and the other learns to estimate the parameters given the full image. During training, the two networks are trained iteratively such that they would converge to a solution where the predicted parameters and the full image are consistent with each other. In addition to medical data enrichment, our framework can also be used for image completion as well as anomaly detection."
Customized Image Narrative Generation via Interactive Visual Question Generation and Answering,"Image description task has been invariably examined in a static manner with qualitative presumptions held to be universally applicable, regardless of the scope or target of the description. In practice, however, different viewers may pay attention to different aspects of the image, and yield different descriptions or interpretations under various contexts. Such diversity in perspectives is difficult to derive with conventional image description techniques. In this paper, we propose a customized image narrative generation task, in which the users are interactively engaged in the generation process by providing answers to the questions. We further attempt to learn the user's interest via repeating such interactive stages, and to automatically reflect the interest in descriptions for new images. Experimental results demonstrate that our model can generate a variety of descriptions from single image that cover a wider range of topics than conventional models, while being customizable to the target user of interaction."
Adversarial Training of Variational Auto-encoders for High Fidelity Image Generation,"Variational auto-encoders (VAEs) provide an attractive solution to image generation problem. However, they tend to produce blurred and over-smoothed images due to their dependence on pixel-wise reconstruction loss. This paper introduces a new approach to alleviate this problem in the VAE based generative models. Our model simultaneously learns to match the data, reconstruction loss and the latent distributions of real and fake images to improve the quality of generated samples. To compute the loss distributions, we introduce an auto-encoder based discriminator model which allows an adversarial learning procedure. The discriminator in our model also provides perceptual guidance to the VAE by matching the learned similarity metric of the real and fake samples in the latent space. To stabilize the overall training process, our model uses an error feedback approach to maintain the equilibrium between competing networks in the model. Our experiments show that the generated samples from our proposed model exhibit a diverse set of attributes and facial expressions and scale up to high-resolution images very well."
Beyond Narrative Description: Generating Poetry from Images by Multi-Adversarial Training,"Automatic generation of natural language from images has attracted extensive attention. In this paper, we take one step further to investigate generation of poetic language (with multiple lines) to an image for automatic poetry creation. This task involves multiple challenges, including discovering poetic clues from the image (e.g., hope from green), and generating poems to satisfy both relevance to the image and poeticness in language level. To solve the above challenges, we formulate the task of poem generation into two correlated sub-tasks by multi-adversarial training via policy gradient, through which the cross-modal relevance and poetic language style can be ensured. To extract poetic clues from images, we propose to learn a deep coupled visual-poetic embedding, in which the poetic representation from objects, sentiments and scenes in an image can be jointly learned. Two discriminative networks are further introduced to guide the poem generation, including a multi-modal discriminator and a poem-style discriminator. To facilitate the research, we have released two poem datasets by human annotators with two distinct properties: 1) the first human annotated image-to-poem pair dataset (with 8,292 pairs in total), and 2) to-date the largest public English poem corpus dataset (with 92,265 different poems in total). Extensive experiments are conducted with 8K images, among which 1.5K image are randomly picked for evaluation. Both objective and subjective evaluations show the superior performances against the state-of-the-art methods for poem generation from images. Turing test carried out with over 500 human subjects, among which 30 evaluators are poetry experts, demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach."
Spatial Image Steganography Based on Generative Adversarial Network,"With the recent development of deep learning on steganalysis, embedding secret information into digital images faces great challenges. In this paper, a secure steganography algorithm by using adversarial training is proposed. The architecture contain three component modules: a generator, an embedding simulator and a discriminator. A generator based on U-NET to translate a cover image into an embedding change probability is proposed. To fit the optimal embedding simulator and propagate the gradient, a function called Tanh-simulator is proposed. As for the discriminator, the selection-channel awareness (SCA) is incorporated to resist the SCA based steganalytic methods. Experimental results have shown that the proposed framework can increase the security performance dramatically over the recently reported method ASDL-GAN, while the training time is only 30% of that used by ASDL-GAN. Furthermore, it also performs better than the hand-crafted steganographic algorithm S-UNIWARD."
Entity-aware Image Caption Generation,"Current image captioning approaches generate descriptions which lack specific information, such as named entities that are involved in the images. In this paper we propose a new task which aims to generate informative image captions, given images and hashtags as input. We propose a simple but effective approach to tackle this problem. We first train a convolutional neural networks - long short term memory networks (CNN-LSTM) model to generate a template caption based on the input image. Then we use a knowledge graph based collective inference algorithm to fill in the template with specific named entities retrieved via the hashtags. Experiments on a new benchmark dataset collected from Flickr show that our model generates news-style image descriptions with much richer information. Our model outperforms unimodal baselines significantly with various evaluation metrics."
Graph-based Hypothesis Generation for Parallax-tolerant Image Stitching,"The seam-driven approach has been proven fairly effective for parallax-tolerant image stitching, whose strategy is to search for an invisible seam from finite representative hypotheses of local alignment. In this paper, we propose a graph-based hypothesis generation and a seam-guided local alignment for improving the effectiveness and the efficiency of the seam-driven approach. The experiment demonstrates the significant reduction of number of hypotheses and the improved quality of naturalness of final stitching results, comparing to the state-of-the-art method SEAGULL."
Generating a Fusion Image: One's Identity and Another's Shape,"Generating a novel image by manipulating two input images is an interesting research problem in the study of generative adversarial networks (GANs). We propose a new GAN-based network that generates a fusion image with the identity of input image x and the shape of input image y. Our network can simultaneously train on more than two image datasets in an unsupervised manner. We define an identity loss LI to catch the identity of image x and a shape loss LS to get the shape of y. In addition, we propose a novel training method called Min-Patch training to focus the generator on crucial parts of an image, rather than its entirety. We show qualitative results on the VGG Youtube Pose dataset, Eye dataset (MPIIGaze and UnityEyes), and the Photo-Sketch-Cartoon dataset."
Normal Image Manipulation for Bas-relief Generation with Hybrid Styles,"We introduce a normal-based bas-relief generation and stylization method which is motivated by the recent advancement in this topic. Creating bas-relief from normal images has successfully facilitated bas-relief modeling in image space. However, the use of normal images in previous work is often restricted to certain type of operations only. This paper is intended to extend normal-based methods and construct bas-reliefs from normal images in a versatile way. Our method can not only generate a new normal image by combining various frequencies of existing normal images and details transferring, but also build bas-reliefs from a single RGB image and its edge-based sketch image. In addition, we introduce an auxiliary function to represent a smooth base surface and generate a layered global shape. To integrate above considerations into our framework, we formulate the bas- relief generation as a variational problem which can be solved by a screened Poisson equation. Some advantages of our method are that it expands the bas-relief shape space and generates diversified styles of results, and that it is capable of transferring details from one region to other regions. Our method is easy to implement, and produces good-quality bas-relief models. We experiment our method on a range of normal images and it compares favorably to other popular classic and state-of-the-art methods."
Transformation on Computer-Generated Facial Image to Avoid Detection by Spoofing Detector,"Making computer-generated (CG) images more difficult to detect is an interesting problem in computer graphics and security. While most approaches focus on the image rendering phase, this paper presents a method based on increasing the naturalness of CG facial images from the perspective of spoofing detectors. The proposed method is implemented using a convolutional neural network (CNN) comprising two autoencoders and a transformer and is trained using a black-box discriminator without gradient information. Over 50% of the transformed CG images were not detected by three state-of-the-art spoofing detectors. This capability raises an alarm regarding the reliability of facial authentication systems, which are becoming widely used in daily life."
Generative Adversarial Training for MRA Image Synthesis Using Multi-Contrast MRI,"Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) has become an essential MR contrast for imaging and evaluation of vascular anatomy and related diseases. MRA acquisitions are typically ordered for vascular interventions, whereas in typical scenarios, MRA sequences can be absent in the patient scans. This motivates the need for a technique that generates inexistent MRA from existing MR multi-contrast, which could be a valuable tool in retrospective subject evaluations and imaging studies. In this paper, we present a generative adversarial network (GAN) based technique to generate MRA from T1-weighted and T2-weighted MRI images, for the first time to our knowledge. To better model the representation of vessels which the MRA inherently highlights, we design a loss term dedicated to a faithful reproduction of vascularities. To that end, we incorporate steerable filter responses of the generated and reference images inside a Huber function loss term. Extending the well- established generator-discriminator architecture based on the recent PatchGAN model with the addition of steerable filter loss, the proposed steerable GAN (sGAN) method is evaluated on the large public database IXI. Experimental results show that the sGAN outperforms the baseline GAN method in terms of an overlap score with similar PSNR values, while it leads to improved visual perceptual quality."
Coloring with Words: Guiding Image Colorization Through Text-based Palette Generation,"This paper proposes a novel approach to generate multiple color palettes that reflect the semantics of input text and then colorize a given grayscale image according to the generated color palette. In contrast to existing approaches, our model can understand rich text, whether it is a single word, a phrase, or a sentence, and generate multiple possible palettes from it. For this task, we introduce our manually curated dataset called Palette-and-Text (PAT). Our proposed model called Text2Colors consists of two conditional generative adversarial networks: the text-to-palette generation networks and the palette-based colorization networks. The former captures the semantics of the text input and produce relevant color palettes. The latter colorizes a grayscale image using the generated color palette. Our evaluation results show that people preferred our generated palettes over ground truth palettes and that our model can effectively reflect the given palette when colorizing an image."
Unsupervised and semi-supervised learning with Categorical Generative Adversarial Networks assisted by Wasserstein distance for dermoscopy image Classification,"Melanoma is a curable aggressive skin cancer if detected early. Typically, the diagnosis involves initial screening with subsequent biopsy and histopathological examination if necessary. Computer aided diagnosis offers an objective score that is independent of clinical experience and the potential to lower the workload of a dermatologist. In the recent past, success of deep learning algorithms in the field of general computer vision has motivated successful application of supervised deep learning methods in computer aided melanoma recognition. However, large quantities of labeled images are required to make further improvements on the supervised method. A good annotation generally requires clinical and histological confirmation, which requires significant effort. In an attempt to alleviate this constraint, we propose to use categorical generative adversarial network to automatically learn the feature representation of dermoscopy images in an unsupervised and semi-supervised manner. Thorough experiments on ISIC 2016 skin lesion chal- lenge demonstrate that the proposed feature learning method has achieved an average precision score of 0.424 with only 140 labeled images. Moreover, the proposed method is also capable of generating real-world like dermoscopy images."
Semi-supervised Adversarial Learning to Generate Photorealistic Face Images of New Identities from 3D Morphable Model,"We propose a novel end-to-end semi-supervised adversarial framework to generate photorealistic face images of new identities with wide ranges of expressions, poses, and illuminations conditioned by a 3D morphable model. Previous adversarial style-transfer methods either supervise their networks with large volume of paired data or use unpaired data with a highly under-constrained two-way generative framework in an unsupervised fashion. We introduce pairwise adversarial supervision to constrain two-way domain adaptation by a small number of paired real and synthetic images for training along with the large volume of unpaired data. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments are performed to validate our idea. Generated face images of new identities contain pose, lighting and expression diversity and qualitative results show that they are highly constraint by the synthetic input image while adding photorealism and retaining identity information. We combine face images generated by the proposed method with the real data set to train face recognition algorithms. We evaluated the model on two challenging data sets: LFW and IJB-A. We observe that the generated images from our framework consistently improves over the performance of deep face recognition network trained with Oxford VGG Face dataset and achieves comparable results to the state-of-the-art."
Generative Adversarial Networks for Extreme Learned Image Compression,"We present a learned image compression system based on GANs, operating at extremely low bitrates. Our proposed framework combines an encoder, decoder/generator and a multi-scale discriminator, which we train jointly for a generative learned compression objective. The model synthesizes details it cannot afford to store, obtaining visually pleasing results at bitrates where previous methods fail and show strong artifacts. Furthermore, if a semantic label map of the original image is available, our method can fully synthesize unimportant regions in the decoded image such as streets and trees from the label map, proportionally reducing the storage cost. A user study confirms that for low bitrates, our approach is preferred to state-of-the-art methods, even when they use more than double the bits."
Pixel2Mesh: Generating 3D Mesh Models from Single RGB Images,"We propose an end-to-end deep learning architecture that produces a 3D shape in triangular mesh from a single color image. Limited by the nature of deep neural network, previous methods usually represent a 3D shape in volume or point cloud, and it is non-trivial to convert them to the more ready-to-use mesh model. Unlike the existing methods, our network represents 3D mesh in a graph-based convolutional neural network and produces correct geometry by progressively deforming an ellipsoid, leveraging perceptual features extracted from the input image. We adopt a coarse-to-fine strategy to make the whole deformation procedure stable, and define various of mesh related losses to capture properties of different levels to guarantee visually appealing and physically accurate 3D geometry. Extensive experiments show that our method not only qualitatively produces mesh model with better details, but also achieves higher 3D shape estimation accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art."
Image Generation from Scene Graphs,"To truly understand the visual world our models should be able not only to recognize images but also generate them. To this end, there has been exciting recent progress on generating images from natural language descriptions. These methods give stunning results on limited domains such as descriptions of birds or flowers, but struggle to faithfully reproduce complex sentences with many objects and relationships. To overcome this limitation we propose a method for generating images from scene graphs, enabling explicitly reasoning about objects and their relationships. Our model uses graph convolution to process input graphs, computes a scene layout by predicting bounding boxes and segmentation masks for objects, and converts the layout to an image with a cascaded refinement network. The network is trained adversarially against a pair of discriminators to ensure realistic outputs. We validate our approach on Visual Genome and COCO-Stuff, where qualitative results, ablations, and user studies demonstrate our method's ability to generate complex images with multiple objects."
Image Generation and Translation with Disentangled Representations,"Generative models have made significant progress in the tasks of modeling complex data distributions such as natural images. The introduction of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and auto-encoders lead to the possibility of training on big data sets in an unsupervised manner. However, for many generative models it is not possible to specify what kind of image should be generated and it is not possible to translate existing images into new images of similar domains. Furthermore, models that can perform image-to-image translation often need distinct models for each domain, making it hard to scale these systems to multiple domain image-to-image translation. We introduce a model that can do both, controllable image generation and image-to-image translation between multiple domains. We split our image representation into two parts encoding unstructured and structured information respectively. The latter is designed in a disentangled manner, so that different parts encode different image characteristics. We train an encoder to encode images into these representations and use a small amount of labeled data to specify what kind of information should be encoded in the disentangled part. A generator is trained to generate images from these representations using the characteristics provided by the disentangled part of the representation. Through this we can control what kind of images the generator generates, translate images between different domains, and even learn unknown data-generating factors while only using one single model."
Random Polyhedral Scenes: An Image Generator for Active Vision System Experiments,"We present a Polyhedral Scene Generator system which creates a random scene based on a few user parameters, renders the scene from random view points and creates a dataset containing the renderings and corresponding annotation files. We hope that this generator will enable research on how a program could parse a scene if it had multiple viewpoints to consider. For ambiguous scenes, typically people move their head or change their position to see the scene from different angles as well as seeing how it changes while they move; this research field is called active perception. The random scene generator presented is designed to support research in this field by generating images of scenes with known complexity characteristics and with verifiable properties with respect to the distribution of features across a population. Thus, it is well-suited for research in active perception without the requirement of a live 3D environment and mobile sensing agent, including comparative performance evaluations. The system is publicly available at https://polyhedral.eecs.yorku.ca."
Regularizing Deep Hashing Networks Using GAN Generated Fake Images,"Recently, deep-networks-based hashing (deep hashing) has become a leading approach for large-scale image retrieval. It aims to learn a compact bitwise representation for images via deep networks, so that similar images are mapped to nearby hash codes. Since a deep network model usually has a large number of parameters, it may probably be too complicated for the training data we have, leading to model over-fitting. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a simple two-stage pipeline to learn deep hashing models, by regularizing the deep hashing networks using fake images. The first stage is to generate fake images from the original training set without extra data, via a generative adversarial network (GAN). In the second stage, we propose a deep architec- ture to learn hash functions, in which we use a maximum-entropy based loss to incorporate the newly created fake images by the GAN. We show that this loss acts as a strong regularizer of the deep architecture, by penalizing low-entropy output hash codes. This loss can also be interpreted as a model ensemble by simultaneously training many network models with massive weight sharing but over different training sets. Empirical evaluation results on several benchmark datasets show that the proposed method has superior performance gains over state-of-the-art hashing methods."
Distinguishing Computer-generated Graphics from Natural Images Based on Sensor Pattern Noise and Deep Learning,"Computer-generated graphics (CGs) are images generated by computer software. The~rapid development of computer graphics technologies has made it easier to generate photorealistic computer graphics, and these graphics are quite difficult to distinguish from natural images (NIs) with the naked eye. In this paper, we propose a method based on sensor pattern noise (SPN) and deep learning to distinguish CGs from NIs. Before being fed into our convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model, these images---CGs and NIs---are clipped into image patches. Furthermore, three high-pass filters (HPFs) are used to remove low-frequency signals, which represent the image content. These filters are also used to reveal the residual signal as well as SPN introduced by the digital camera device. Different from the traditional methods of distinguishing CGs from NIs, the proposed method utilizes a five-layer CNN to classify the input image patches. Based on the classification results of the image patches, we deploy a majority vote scheme to obtain the classification results for the full-size images. The~experiments have demonstrated that (1) the proposed method with three HPFs can achieve better results than that with only one HPF or no HPF and that (2) the proposed method with three HPFs achieves 100\% accuracy, although the NIs undergo a JPEG compression with a quality factor of 75."
Comparing Generative Adversarial Network Techniques for Image Creation and Modification,"Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have demonstrated to be successful at generating realistic real-world images. In this paper we compare various GAN techniques, both supervised and unsupervised. The effects on training stability of different objective functions are compared. We add an encoder to the network, making it possible to encode images to the latent space of the GAN. The generator, discriminator and encoder are parameterized by deep convolutional neural networks. For the discriminator network we experimented with using the novel Capsule Network, a state-of-the-art technique for detecting global features in images. Experiments are performed using a digit and face dataset, with various visualizations illustrating the results. The results show that using the encoder network it is possible to reconstruct images. With the conditional GAN we can alter visual attributes of generated or encoded images. The experiments with the Capsule Network as discriminator result in generated images of a lower quality, compared to a standard convolutional neural network."
BSD-GAN: Branched Generative Adversarial Network for Scale-Disentangled Representation Learning and Image Synthesis,"We introduce BSD-GAN, a novel multi-branch and scale-disentangled training method which enables unconditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to learn image representations at multiple scales, benefiting a wide range of generation and editing tasks. The key feature of BSD-GAN is that it is trained in multiple branches, progressively covering both the breadth and depth of the network, as resolutions of the training images increase to reveal finer-scale features. Specifically, each noise vector, as input to the generator network of BSD-GAN, is deliberately split into several sub-vectors, each corresponding to, and is trained to learn, image representations at a particular scale. During training, we progressively ""de-freeze"" the sub-vectors, one at a time, as a new set of higher-resolution images is employed for training and more network layers are added. A consequence of such an explicit sub-vector designation is that we can directly manipulate and even combine latent (sub-vector) codes which model different feature scales.Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our training method in scale-disentangled learning of image representations and synthesis of novel image contents, without any extra labels and without compromising quality of the synthesized high-resolution images. We further demonstrate several image generation and manipulation applications enabled or improved by BSD-GAN. Source codes are available at https://github.com/duxingren14/BSD-GAN."
Patch-Based Image Inpainting with Generative Adversarial Networks,"Area of image inpainting over relatively large missing regions recently advanced substantially through adaptation of dedicated deep neural networks. However, current network solutions still introduce undesired artifacts and noise to the repaired regions. We present an image inpainting method that is based on the celebrated generative adversarial network (GAN) framework. The proposed PGGAN method includes a discriminator network that combines a global GAN (G-GAN) architecture with a patchGAN approach. PGGAN first shares network layers between G-GAN and patchGAN, then splits paths to produce two adversarial losses that feed the generator network in order to capture both local continuity of image texture and pervasive global features in images. The proposed framework is evaluated extensively, and the results including comparison to recent state-of-the-art demonstrate that it achieves considerable improvements on both visual and quantitative evaluations."
Discrete Potts Model for Generating Superpixels on Noisy Images,"Many computer vision applications, such as object recognition and segmentation, increasingly build on superpixels. However, there have been so far few superpixel algorithms that systematically deal with noisy images. We propose to first decompose the image into equal-sized rectangular patches, which also sets the maximum superpixel size. Within each patch, a Potts model for simultaneous segmentation and denoising is applied, that guarantees connected and non-overlapping superpixels and also produces a denoised image. The corresponding optimization problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear program (MILP), and solved by a commercial solver. Extensive experiments on the BSDS500 dataset images with noises are compared with other state-of-the-art superpixel methods. Our method achieves the best result in terms of a combined score (OP) composed of the under-segmentation error, boundary recall and compactness."
Improved Part Segmentation Performance by Optimising Realism of Synthetic Images using Cycle Generative Adversarial Networks,"In this paper we report on improved part segmentation performance using convolutional neural networks to reduce the dependency on the large amount of manually annotated empirical images. This was achieved by optimising the visual realism of synthetic agricultural images.In Part I, a cycle consistent generative adversarial network was applied to synthetic and empirical images with the objective to generate more realistic synthetic images by translating them to the empirical domain. We first hypothesise and confirm that plant part image features such as color and texture become more similar to the empirical domain after translation of the synthetic images.Results confirm this with an improved mean color distribution correlation with the empirical data prior of 0.62 and post translation of 0.90. Furthermore, the mean image features of contrast, homogeneity, energy and entropy moved closer to the empirical mean, post translation. In Part II, 7 experiments were performed using convolutional neural networks with different combinations of synthetic, synthetic translated to empirical and empirical images. We hypothesised that the translated images can be used for (i) improved learning of empirical images, and (ii) that learning without any fine-tuning with empirical images is improved by bootstrapping with translated images over bootstrapping with synthetic images. Results confirm our second and third hypotheses. First a maximum intersection-over-union performance was achieved of 0.52 when bootstrapping with translated images and fine-tuning with empirical images; an 8% increase compared to only using synthetic images. Second, training without any empirical fine-tuning resulted in an average IOU of 0.31; a 55% performance increase over previous methods that only used synthetic images."
Image Colorization with Generative Adversarial Networks,"Over the last decade, the process of automatic image colorization has been of significant interest for several application areas including restoration of aged or degraded images. This problem is highly ill-posed due to the large degrees of freedom during the assignment of color information. Many of the recent developments in automatic colorization involve images that contain a common theme or require highly processed data such as semantic maps as input. In our approach, we attempt to fully generalize the colorization procedure using a conditional Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN), extend current methods to high-resolution images and suggest training strategies that speed up the process and greatly stabilize it. The network is trained over datasets that are publicly available such as CIFAR-10 and Places365. The results of the generative model and traditional deep neural networks are compared."
Correction by Projection: Denoising Images with Generative Adversarial Networks,"Generative adversarial networks (GANs) transform low-dimensional latent vectors into visually plausible images. If the real dataset contains only clean images, then ostensibly, the manifold learned by the GAN should contain only clean images. In this paper, we propose to denoise corrupted images by finding the nearest point on the GAN manifold, recovering latent vectors by minimizing distances in image space. We first demonstrate that given a corrupted version of an image that truly lies on the GAN manifold, we can approximately recover the latent vector and denoise the image, obtaining significantly higher quality, comparing with BM3D. Next, we demonstrate that latent vectors recovered from noisy images exhibit a consistent bias. By subtracting this bias before projecting back to image space, we improve denoising results even further. Finally, even for unseen images, our method performs better at denoising better than BM3D. Notably, the basic version of our method (without bias correction) requires no prior knowledge on the noise variance. To achieve the highest possible denoising quality, the best performing signal processing based methods, such as BM3D, require an estimate of the blur kernel."
An Introduction to Image Synthesis with Generative Adversarial Nets,"There has been a drastic growth of research in Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) in the past few years. Proposed in 2014, GAN has been applied to various applications such as computer vision and natural language processing, and achieves impressive performance. Among the many applications of GAN, image synthesis is the most well-studied one, and research in this area has already demonstrated the great potential of using GAN in image synthesis. In this paper, we provide a taxonomy of methods used in image synthesis, review different models for text-to-image synthesis and image-to-image translation, and discuss some evaluation metrics as well as possible future research directions in image synthesis with GAN."
Face2Text: Collecting an Annotated Image Description Corpus for the Generation of Rich Face Descriptions,"The past few years have witnessed renewed interest in NLP tasks at the interface between vision and language. One intensively-studied problem is that of automatically generating text from images. In this paper, we extend this problem to the more specific domain of face description. Unlike scene descriptions, face descriptions are more fine-grained and rely on attributes extracted from the image, rather than objects and relations. Given that no data exists for this task, we present an ongoing crowdsourcing study to collect a corpus of descriptions of face images taken `in the wild'. To gain a better understanding of the variation we find in face description and the possible issues that this may raise, we also conducted an annotation study on a subset of the corpus. Primarily, we found descriptions to refer to a mixture of attributes, not only physical, but also emotional and inferential, which is bound to create further challenges for current image-to-text methods."
How Images Inspire Poems: Generating Classical Chinese Poetry from Images with Memory Networks,"With the recent advances of neural models and natural language processing, automatic generation of classical Chinese poetry has drawn significant attention due to its artistic and cultural value. Previous works mainly focus on generating poetry given keywords or other text information, while visual inspirations for poetry have been rarely explored. Generating poetry from images is much more challenging than generating poetry from text, since images contain very rich visual information which cannot be described completely using several keywords, and a good poem should convey the image accurately. In this paper, we propose a memory based neural model which exploits images to generate poems. Specifically, an Encoder-Decoder model with a topic memory network is proposed to generate classical Chinese poetry from images. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work attempting to generate classical Chinese poetry from images with neural networks. A comprehensive experimental investigation with both human evaluation and quantitative analysis demonstrates that the proposed model can generate poems which convey images accurately."
ST-GAN: Spatial Transformer Generative Adversarial Networks for Image Compositing,"We address the problem of finding realistic geometric corrections to a foreground object such that it appears natural when composited into a background image. To achieve this, we propose a novel Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture that utilizes Spatial Transformer Networks (STNs) as the generator, which we call Spatial Transformer GANs (ST-GANs). ST-GANs seek image realism by operating in the geometric warp parameter space. In particular, we exploit an iterative STN warping scheme and propose a sequential training strategy that achieves better results compared to naive training of a single generator. One of the key advantages of ST-GAN is its applicability to high-resolution images indirectly since the predicted warp parameters are transferable between reference frames. We demonstrate our approach in two applications: (1) visualizing how indoor furniture (e.g. from product images) might be perceived in a room, (2) hallucinating how accessories like glasses would look when matched with real portraits."
Generating High Quality Visible Images from SAR Images Using CNNs,We propose a novel approach for generating high quality visible-like images from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architectures. The proposed approach is based on a cascaded network of convolutional neural nets (CNNs) for despeckling and image colorization. The cascaded structure results in faster convergence during training and produces high quality visible images from the corresponding SAR images. Experimental results on both simulated and real SAR images show that the proposed method can produce visible-like images better compared to the recent state-of-the-art deep learning-based methods.
Single-View Food Portion Estimation: Learning Image-to-Energy Mappings Using Generative Adversarial Networks,"Due to the growing concern of chronic diseases and other health problems related to diet, there is a need to develop accurate methods to estimate an individual's food and energy intake. Measuring accurate dietary intake is an open research problem. In particular, accurate food portion estimation is challenging since the process of food preparation and consumption impose large variations on food shapes and appearances. In this paper, we present a food portion estimation method to estimate food energy (kilocalories) from food images using Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). We introduce the concept of an ""energy distribution"" for each food image. To train the GAN, we design a food image dataset based on ground truth food labels and segmentation masks for each food image as well as energy information associated with the food image. Our goal is to learn the mapping of the food image to the food energy. We can then estimate food energy based on the energy distribution. We show that an average energy estimation error rate of 10.89% can be obtained by learning the image-to-energy mapping."
Constrained Image Generation Using Binarized Neural Networks with Decision Procedures,"We consider the problem of binary image generation with given properties. This problem arises in a number of practical applications, including generation of artificial porous medium for an electrode of lithium-ion batteries, for composed materials, etc. A generated image represents a porous medium and, as such, it is subject to two sets of constraints: topological constraints on the structure and process constraints on the physical process over this structure. To perform image generation we need to define a mapping from a porous medium to its physical process parameters. For a given geometry of a porous medium, this mapping can be done by solving a partial differential equation (PDE). However, embedding a PDE solver into the search procedure is computationally expensive. We use a binarized neural network to approximate a PDE solver. This allows us to encode the entire problem as a logical formula. Our main contribution is that, for the first time, we show that this problem can be tackled using decision procedures. Our experiments show that our model is able to produce random constrained images that satisfy both topological and process constraints."
ChatPainter: Improving Text to Image Generation using Dialogue,"Synthesizing realistic images from text descriptions on a dataset like Microsoft Common Objects in Context (MS COCO), where each image can contain several objects, is a challenging task. Prior work has used text captions to generate images. However, captions might not be informative enough to capture the entire image and insufficient for the model to be able to understand which objects in the images correspond to which words in the captions. We show that adding a dialogue that further describes the scene leads to significant improvement in the inception score and in the quality of generated images on the MS COCO dataset."
DA-GAN: Instance-level Image Translation by Deep Attention Generative Adversarial Networks (with Supplementary Materials),"Unsupervised image translation, which aims in translating two independent sets of images, is challenging in discovering the correct correspondences without paired data. Existing works build upon Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) such that the distribution of the translated images are indistinguishable from the distribution of the target set. However, such set-level constraints cannot learn the instance-level correspondences (e.g. aligned semantic parts in object configuration task). This limitation often results in false positives (e.g. geometric or semantic artifacts), and further leads to mode collapse problem. To address the above issues, we propose a novel framework for instance-level image translation by Deep Attention GAN (DA-GAN). Such a design enables DA-GAN to decompose the task of translating samples from two sets into translating instances in a highly-structured latent space. Specifically, we jointly learn a deep attention encoder, and the instancelevel correspondences could be consequently discovered through attending on the learned instance pairs. Therefore, the constraints could be exploited on both set-level and instance-level. Comparisons against several state-ofthe- arts demonstrate the superiority of our approach, and the broad application capability, e.g, pose morphing, data augmentation, etc., pushes the margin of domain translation problem."
Evolution of Images with Diversity and Constraints Using a Generator Network,"Evolutionary search has been extensively used to generate artistic images. Raw images have high dimensionality which makes a direct search for an image challenging. In previous work this problem has been addressed by using compact symbolic encodings or by constraining images with priors. Recent developments in deep learning have enabled a generation of compelling artistic images using generative networks that encode images with lower-dimensional latent spaces. To date this work has focused on the generation of images concordant with one or more classes and transfer of artistic styles. There is currently no work which uses search in this latent space to generate images scoring high or low aesthetic measures. In this paper we use evolutionary methods to search for images in two datasets, faces and butterflies, and demonstrate the effect of optimising aesthetic feature scores in one or two dimensions. The work gives a preliminary indication of which feature measures promote the most interesting images and how some of these measures interact."
A Novel Scheme to Improve Lossless Image Coders by Explicit Description of Generative Model Classes,"In this study, we propose a novel scheme for systematic improvement of lossless image compression coders from the point of view of the universal codes in information theory. In the proposed scheme, we describe a generative model class of images as a stochastic model. Using the Bayes codes, we are able to construct a lossless image compression coder which is optimal under the Bayes criterion for a model class described appropriately. Since the compression coder is optimal for the assumed model class, we are able to focus on the expansion of the model class. To validate the efficiency of the proposed scheme, we construct a lossless image compression coder which achieves approximately 19.7% reduction of average coding rates of previous coders."
Blind Image Deconvolution using Deep Generative Priors,"This paper proposes a novel approach to regularize the \textit{ill-posed} and \textit{non-linear} blind image deconvolution (blind deblurring) using deep generative networks as priors. We employ two separate generative models --- one trained to produce sharp images while the other trained to generate blur kernels from lower-dimensional parameters. To deblur, we propose an alternating gradient descent scheme operating in the latent lower-dimensional space of each of the pretrained generative models. Our experiments show promising deblurring results on images even under large blurs, and heavy noise. To address the shortcomings of generative models such as mode collapse, we augment our generative priors with classical image priors and report improved performance on complex image datasets. The deblurring performance depends on how well the range of the generator spans the image class. Interestingly, our experiments show that even an untrained structured (convolutional) generative networks acts as an image prior in the image deblurring context allowing us to extend our results to more diverse natural image datasets."
Generative Adversarial Networks and Probabilistic Graph Models for Hyperspectral Image Classification,"High spectral dimensionality and the shortage of annotations make hyperspectral image (HSI) classification a challenging problem. Recent studies suggest that convolutional neural networks can learn discriminative spatial features, which play a paramount role in HSI interpretation. However, most of these methods ignore the distinctive spectral-spatial characteristic of hyperspectral data. In addition, a large amount of unlabeled data remains an unexploited gold mine for efficient data use. Therefore, we proposed an integration of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and probabilistic graphical models for HSI classification. Specifically, we used a spectral-spatial generator and a discriminator to identify land cover categories of hyperspectral cubes. Moreover, to take advantage of a large amount of unlabeled data, we adopted a conditional random field to refine the preliminary classification results generated by GANs. Experimental results obtained using two commonly studied datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework achieved encouraging classification accuracy using a small number of data for training."
Generative ScatterNet Hybrid Deep Learning (G-SHDL) Network with Structural Priors for Semantic Image Segmentation,"This paper proposes a generative ScatterNet hybrid deep learning (G-SHDL) network for semantic image segmentation. The proposed generative architecture is able to train rapidly from relatively small labeled datasets using the introduced structural priors. In addition, the number of filters in each layer of the architecture is optimized resulting in a computationally efficient architecture. The G-SHDL network produces state-of-the-art classification performance against unsupervised and semi-supervised learning on two image datasets. Advantages of the G-SHDL network over supervised methods are demonstrated with experiments performed on training datasets of reduced size."
Spectral Image Visualization Using Generative Adversarial Networks,"Spectral images captured by satellites and radio-telescopes are analyzed to obtain information about geological compositions distributions, distant asters as well as undersea terrain. Spectral images usually contain tens to hundreds of continuous narrow spectral bands and are widely used in various fields. But the vast majority of those image signals are beyond the visible range, which calls for special visualization technique. The visualizations of spectral images shall convey as much information as possible from the original signal and facilitate image interpretation. However, most of the existing visualizatio methods display spectral images in false colors, which contradict with human's experience and expectation. In this paper, we present a novel visualization generative adversarial network (GAN) to display spectral images in natural colors. To achieve our goal, we propose a loss function which consists of an adversarial loss and a structure loss. The adversarial loss pushes our solution to the natural image distribution using a discriminator network that is trained to differentiate between false-color images and natural-color images. We also use a cycle loss as the structure constraint to guarantee structure consistency. Experimental results show that our method is able to generate structure-preserved and natural-looking visualizations."
Automated dataset generation for image recognition using the example of taxonomy,"This master thesis addresses the subject of automatically generating a dataset for image recognition, which takes a lot of time when being done manually. As the thesis was written with motivation from the context of the biodiversity workgroup at the City University of Applied Sciences Bremen, the classification of taxonomic entries was chosen as an exemplary use case. In order to automate the dataset creation, a prototype was conceptualized and implemented after working out knowledge basics and analyzing requirements for it. It makes use of an pre-trained abstract artificial intelligence which is able to sort out images that do not contain the desired content. Subsequent to the implementation and the automated dataset creation resulting from it, an evaluation was performed. Other, manually collected datasets were compared to the one the prototype produced in means of specifications and accuracy. The results were more than satisfactory and showed that automatically generating a dataset for image recognition is not only possible, but also might be a decent alternative to spending time and money in doing this task manually. At the very end of this work, an idea of how to use the principle of employing abstract artificial intelligences for step-by-step classification of deeper taxonomic layers in a productive system is presented and discussed."
Image denoising with generalized Gaussian mixture model patch priors,"Patch priors have become an important component of image restoration. A powerful approach in this category of restoration algorithms is the popular Expected Patch Log-Likelihood (EPLL) algorithm. EPLL uses a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) prior learned on clean image patches as a way to regularize degraded patches. In this paper, we show that a generalized Gaussian mixture model (GGMM) captures the underlying distribution of patches better than a GMM. Even though GGMM is a powerful prior to combine with EPLL, the non-Gaussianity of its components presents major challenges to be applied to a computationally intensive process of image restoration. Specifically, each patch has to undergo a patch classification step and a shrinkage step. These two steps can be efficiently solved with a GMM prior but are computationally impractical when using a GGMM prior. In this paper, we provide approximations and computational recipes for fast evaluation of these two steps, so that EPLL can embed a GGMM prior on an image with more than tens of thousands of patches. Our main contribution is to analyze the accuracy of our approximations based on thorough theoretical analysis. Our evaluations indicate that the GGMM prior is consistently a better fit formodeling image patch distribution and performs better on average in image denoising task."
Image Synthesis in Multi-Contrast MRI with Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks,"Acquiring images of the same anatomy with multiple different contrasts increases the diversity of diagnostic information available in an MR exam. Yet, scan time limitations may prohibit acquisition of certain contrasts, and images for some contrast may be corrupted by noise and artifacts. In such cases, the ability to synthesize unacquired or corrupted contrasts from remaining contrasts can improve diagnostic utility. For multi-contrast synthesis, current methods learn a nonlinear intensity transformation between the source and target images, either via nonlinear regression or deterministic neural networks. These methods can in turn suffer from loss of high-spatial-frequency information in synthesized images. Here we propose a new approach for multi-contrast MRI synthesis based on conditional generative adversarial networks. The proposed approach preserves high-frequency details via an adversarial loss; and it offers enhanced synthesis performance via a pixel-wise loss for registered multi-contrast images and a cycle-consistency loss for unregistered images. Information from neighboring cross-sections are utilized to further improved synthesis quality. Demonstrations on T1- and T2-weighted images from healthy subjects and patients clearly indicate the superior performance of the proposed approach compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. Our synthesis approach can help improve quality and versatility of multi-contrast MRI exams without the need for prolonged examinations."
Document Image Classification with Intra-Domain Transfer Learning and Stacked Generalization of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks,"In this work, a region-based Deep Convolutional Neural Network framework is proposed for document structure learning. The contribution of this work involves efficient training of region based classifiers and effective ensembling for document image classification. A primary level of `inter-domain' transfer learning is used by exporting weights from a pre-trained VGG16 architecture on the ImageNet dataset to train a document classifier on whole document images. Exploiting the nature of region based influence modelling, a secondary level of `intra-domain' transfer learning is used for rapid training of deep learning models for image segments. Finally, stacked generalization based ensembling is utilized for combining the predictions of the base deep neural network models. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of 92.2% on the popular RVL-CDIP document image dataset, exceeding benchmarks set by existing algorithms."
Generative Image Inpainting with Contextual Attention,"Recent deep learning based approaches have shown promising results for the challenging task of inpainting large missing regions in an image. These methods can generate visually plausible image structures and textures, but often create distorted structures or blurry textures inconsistent with surrounding areas. This is mainly due to ineffectiveness of convolutional neural networks in explicitly borrowing or copying information from distant spatial locations. On the other hand, traditional texture and patch synthesis approaches are particularly suitable when it needs to borrow textures from the surrounding regions. Motivated by these observations, we propose a new deep generative model-based approach which can not only synthesize novel image structures but also explicitly utilize surrounding image features as references during network training to make better predictions. The model is a feed-forward, fully convolutional neural network which can process images with multiple holes at arbitrary locations and with variable sizes during the test time. Experiments on multiple datasets including faces (CelebA, CelebA-HQ), textures (DTD) and natural images (ImageNet, Places2) demonstrate that our proposed approach generates higher-quality inpainting results than existing ones. Code, demo and models are available at: https://github.com/JiahuiYu/generative_inpainting."
Word Level Font-to-Font Image Translation using Convolutional Recurrent Generative Adversarial Networks,"Conversion of one font to another font is very useful in real life applications. In this paper, we propose a Convolutional Recurrent Generative model to solve the word level font transfer problem. Our network is able to convert the font style of any printed text images from its current font to the required font. The network is trained end-to-end for the complete word images. Thus it eliminates the necessary pre-processing steps, like character segmentations. We extend our model to conditional setting that helps to learn one-to-many mapping function. We employ a novel convolutional recurrent model architecture in the Generator that efficiently deals with the word images of arbitrary width. It also helps to maintain the consistency of the final images after concatenating the generated image patches of target font. Besides, the Generator and the Discriminator network, we employ a Classification network to classify the generated word images of converted font style to their subsequent font categories. Most of the earlier works related to image translation are performed on square images. Our proposed architecture is the first work which can handle images of varying widths. Word images generally have varying width depending on the number of characters present. Hence, we test our model on a synthetically generated font dataset. We compare our method with some of the state-of-the-art methods for image translation. The superior performance of our network on the same dataset proves the ability of our model to learn the font distributions."
Semi-supervised FusedGAN for Conditional Image Generation,"We present FusedGAN, a deep network for conditional image synthesis with controllable sampling of diverse images. Fidelity, diversity and controllable sampling are the main quality measures of a good image generation model. Most existing models are insufficient in all three aspects. The FusedGAN can perform controllable sampling of diverse images with very high fidelity. We argue that controllability can be achieved by disentangling the generation process into various stages. In contrast to stacked GANs, where multiple stages of GANs are trained separately with full supervision of labeled intermediate images, the FusedGAN has a single stage pipeline with a built-in stacking of GANs. Unlike existing methods, which requires full supervision with paired conditions and images, the FusedGAN can effectively leverage more abundant images without corresponding conditions in training, to produce more diverse samples with high fidelity. We achieve this by fusing two generators: one for unconditional image generation, and the other for conditional image generation, where the two partly share a common latent space thereby disentangling the generation. We demonstrate the efficacy of the FusedGAN in fine grained image generation tasks such as text-to-image, and attribute-to-face generation."
Generative Single Image Reflection Separation,"Single image reflection separation is an ill-posed problem since two scenes, a transmitted scene and a reflected scene, need to be inferred from a single observation. To make the problem tractable, in this work we assume that categories of two scenes are known. It allows us to address the problem by generating both scenes that belong to the categories while their contents are constrained to match with the observed image. A novel network architecture is proposed to render realistic images of both scenes based on adversarial learning. The network can be trained in a weakly supervised manner, i.e., it learns to separate an observed image without corresponding ground truth images of transmission and reflection scenes which are difficult to collect in practice. Experimental results on real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against existing methods."
Instance Map based Image Synthesis with a Denoising Generative Adversarial Network,"Semantic layouts based Image synthesizing, which has benefited from the success of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), has drawn much attention in these days. How to enhance the synthesis image equality while keeping the stochasticity of the GAN is still a challenge. We propose a novel denoising framework to handle this problem. The overlapped objects generation is another challenging task when synthesizing images from a semantic layout to a realistic RGB photo. To overcome this deficiency, we include a one-hot semantic label map to force the generator paying more attention on the overlapped objects generation. Furthermore, we improve the loss function of the discriminator by considering perturb loss and cascade layer loss to guide the generation process. We applied our methods on the Cityscapes, Facades and NYU datasets and demonstrate the image generation ability of our model."
Deformable GANs for Pose-based Human Image Generation,"In this paper we address the problem of generating person images conditioned on a given pose. Specifically, given an image of a person and a target pose, we synthesize a new image of that person in the novel pose. In order to deal with pixel-to-pixel misalignments caused by the pose differences, we introduce deformable skip connections in the generator of our Generative Adversarial Network. Moreover, a nearest-neighbour loss is proposed instead of the common L1 and L2 losses in order to match the details of the generated image with the target image. We test our approach using photos of persons in different poses and we compare our method with previous work in this area showing state-of-the-art results in two benchmarks. Our method can be applied to the wider field of deformable object generation, provided that the pose of the articulated object can be extracted using a keypoint detector."
Denoising of image gradients and total generalized variation denoising,"We revisit total variation denoising and study an augmented model where we assume that an estimate of the image gradient is available. We show that this increases the image reconstruction quality and derive that the resulting model resembles the total generalized variation denoising method, thus providing a new motivation for this model. Further, we propose to use a constraint denoising model and develop a variational denoising model that is basically parameter free, i.e. all model parameters are estimated directly from the noisy image.  Moreover, we use Chambolle-Pock's primal dual method as well as the Douglas-Rachford method for the new models. For the latter one has to solve large discretizations of partial differential equations. We propose to do this in an inexact manner using the preconditioned conjugate gradients method and derive preconditioners for this. Numerical experiments show that the resulting method has good denoising properties and also that preconditioning does increase convergence speed significantly. Finally we analyze the duality gap of different formulations of the TGV denoising problem and derive a simple stopping criterion."
Simulating Patho-realistic Ultrasound Images using Deep Generative Networks with Adversarial Learning,"Ultrasound imaging makes use of backscattering of waves during their interaction with scatterers present in biological tissues. Simulation of synthetic ultrasound images is a challenging problem on account of inability to accurately model various factors of which some include intra-/inter scanline interference, transducer to surface coupling, artifacts on transducer elements, inhomogeneous shadowing and nonlinear attenuation. Current approaches typically solve wave space equations making them computationally expensive and slow to operate. We propose a generative adversarial network (GAN) inspired approach for fast simulation of patho-realistic ultrasound images. We apply the framework to intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) simulation. A stage 0 simulation performed using pseudo B-mode ultrasound image simulator yields speckle mapping of a digitally defined phantom. The stage I GAN subsequently refines them to preserve tissue specific speckle intensities. The stage II GAN further refines them to generate high resolution images with patho-realistic speckle profiles. We evaluate patho-realism of simulated images with a visual Turing test indicating an equivocal confusion in discriminating simulated from real. We also quantify the shift in tissue specific intensity distributions of the real and simulated images to prove their similarity."
Exploring Models and Data for Remote Sensing Image Caption Generation,"Inspired by recent development of artificial satellite, remote sensing images have attracted extensive attention. Recently, noticeable progress has been made in scene classification and target detection.However, it is still not clear how to describe the remote sensing image content with accurate and concise sentences. In this paper, we investigate to describe the remote sensing images with accurate and flexible sentences. First, some annotated instructions are presented to better describe the remote sensing images considering the special characteristics of remote sensing images. Second, in order to exhaustively exploit the contents of remote sensing images, a large-scale aerial image data set is constructed for remote sensing image caption. Finally, a comprehensive review is presented on the proposed data set to fully advance the task of remote sensing caption. Extensive experiments on the proposed data set demonstrate that the content of the remote sensing image can be completely described by generating language descriptions. The data set is available at https://github.com/201528014227051/RSICD_optimal"
Deep Neural Generative Model of Functional MRI Images for Psychiatric Disorder Diagnosis,"Accurate diagnosis of psychiatric disorders plays a critical role in improving the quality of life for patients and potentially supports the development of new treatments. Many studies have been conducted on machine learning techniques that seek brain imaging data for specific biomarkers of disorders. These studies have encountered the following dilemma: A direct classification overfits to a small number of high-dimensional samples but unsupervised feature-extraction has the risk of extracting a signal of no interest. In addition, such studies often provided only diagnoses for patients without presenting the reasons for these diagnoses. This study proposed a deep neural generative model of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. The proposed model is conditioned by the assumption of the subject's state and estimates the posterior probability of the subject's state given the imaging data, using Bayes' rule. This study applied the proposed model to diagnose schizophrenia and bipolar disorders. Diagnostic accuracy was improved by a large margin over competitive approaches, namely classifications of functional connectivity, discriminative/generative models of region-wise signals, and those with unsupervised feature-extractors. The proposed model visualizes brain regions largely related to the disorders, thus motivating further biological investigation."
SRPGAN: Perceptual Generative Adversarial Network for Single Image Super Resolution,"Single image super resolution (SISR) is to reconstruct a high resolution image from a single low resolution image. The SISR task has been a very attractive research topic over the last two decades. In recent years, convolutional neural network (CNN) based models have achieved great performance on SISR task. Despite the breakthroughs achieved by using CNN models, there are still some problems remaining unsolved, such as how to recover high frequency details of high resolution images. Previous CNN based models always use a pixel wise loss, such as l2 loss. Although the high resolution images constructed by these models have high peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), they often tend to be blurry and lack high-frequency details, especially at a large scaling factor. In this paper, we build a super resolution perceptual generative adversarial network (SRPGAN) framework for SISR tasks. In the framework, we propose a robust perceptual loss based on the discriminator of the built SRPGAN model. We use the Charbonnier loss function to build the content loss and combine it with the proposed perceptual loss and the adversarial loss. Compared with other state-of-the-art methods, our method has demonstrated great ability to construct images with sharp edges and rich details. We also evaluate our method on different benchmarks and compare it with previous CNN based methods. The results show that our method can achieve much higher structural similarity index (SSIM) scores on most of the benchmarks than the previous state-of-art methods."
Dynamics Transfer GAN: Generating Video by Transferring Arbitrary Temporal Dynamics from a Source Video to a Single Target Image,"In this paper, we propose Dynamics Transfer GAN; a new method for generating video sequences based on generative adversarial learning. The spatial constructs of a generated video sequence are acquired from the target image. The dynamics of the generated video sequence are imported from a source video sequence, with arbitrary motion, and imposed onto the target image. To preserve the spatial construct of the target image, the appearance of the source video sequence is suppressed and only the dynamics are obtained before being imposed onto the target image. That is achieved using the proposed appearance suppressed dynamics feature. Moreover, the spatial and temporal consistencies of the generated video sequence are verified via two discriminator networks. One discriminator validates the fidelity of the generated frames appearance, while the other validates the dynamic consistency of the generated video sequence. Experiments have been conducted to verify the quality of the video sequences generated by the proposed method. The results verified that Dynamics Transfer GAN successfully transferred arbitrary dynamics of the source video sequence onto a target image when generating the output video sequence. The experimental results also showed that Dynamics Transfer GAN maintained the spatial constructs (appearance) of the target image while generating spatially and temporally consistent video sequences."
Disentangled Person Image Generation,"Generating novel, yet realistic, images of persons is a challenging task due to the complex interplay between the different image factors, such as the foreground, background and pose information. In this work, we aim at generating such images based on a novel, two-stage reconstruction pipeline that learns a disentangled representation of the aforementioned image factors and generates novel person images at the same time. First, a multi-branched reconstruction network is proposed to disentangle and encode the three factors into embedding features, which are then combined to re-compose the input image itself. Second, three corresponding mapping functions are learned in an adversarial manner in order to map Gaussian noise to the learned embedding feature space, for each factor respectively. Using the proposed framework, we can manipulate the foreground, background and pose of the input image, and also sample new embedding features to generate such targeted manipulations, that provide more control over the generation process. Experiments on Market-1501 and Deepfashion datasets show that our model does not only generate realistic person images with new foregrounds, backgrounds and poses, but also manipulates the generated factors and interpolates the in-between states. Another set of experiments on Market-1501 shows that our model can also be beneficial for the person re-identification task."
Pose-Normalized Image Generation for Person Re-identification,"Person Re-identification (re-id) faces two major challenges: the lack of cross-view paired training data and learning discriminative identity-sensitive and view-invariant features in the presence of large pose variations. In this work, we address both problems by proposing a novel deep person image generation model for synthesizing realistic person images conditional on the pose. The model is based on a generative adversarial network (GAN) designed specifically for pose normalization in re-id, thus termed pose-normalization GAN (PN-GAN). With the synthesized images, we can learn a new type of deep re-id feature free of the influence of pose variations. We show that this feature is strong on its own and complementary to features learned with the original images. Importantly, under the transfer learning setting, we show that our model generalizes well to any new re-id dataset without the need for collecting any training data for model fine-tuning. The model thus has the potential to make re-id model truly scalable."
Manifold-valued Image Generation with Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Nets,"Generative modeling over natural images is one of the most fundamental machine learning problems. However, few modern generative models, including Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Nets (WGANs), are studied on manifold-valued images that are frequently encountered in real-world applications. To fill the gap, this paper first formulates the problem of generating manifold-valued images and exploits three typical instances: hue-saturation-value (HSV) color image generation, chromaticity-brightness (CB) color image generation, and diffusion-tensor (DT) image generation. For the proposed generative modeling problem, we then introduce a theorem of optimal transport to derive a new Wasserstein distance of data distributions on complete manifolds, enabling us to achieve a tractable objective under the WGAN framework. In addition, we recommend three benchmark datasets that are CIFAR-10 HSV/CB color images, ImageNet HSV/CB color images, UCL DT image datasets. On the three datasets, we experimentally demonstrate the proposed manifold-aware WGAN model can generate more plausible manifold-valued images than its competitors."
Spatial PixelCNN: Generating Images from Patches,"In this paper we propose Spatial PixelCNN, a conditional autoregressive model that generates images from small patches. By conditioning on a grid of pixel coordinates and global features extracted from a Variational Autoencoder (VAE), we are able to train on patches of images, and reproduce the full-sized image. We show that it not only allows for generating high quality samples at the same resolution as the underlying dataset, but is also capable of upscaling images to arbitrary resolutions (tested at resolutions up to 50\times) on the MNIST dataset. Compared to a PixelCNN++ baseline, Spatial PixelCNN quantitatively and qualitatively achieves similar performance on the MNIST dataset."
Unsupervised Learning for Cell-level Visual Representation in Histopathology Images with Generative Adversarial Networks,"The visual attributes of cells, such as the nuclear morphology and chromatin openness, are critical for histopathology image analysis. By learning cell-level visual representation, we can obtain a rich mix of features that are highly reusable for various tasks, such as cell-level classification, nuclei segmentation, and cell counting. In this paper, we propose a unified generative adversarial networks architecture with a new formulation of loss to perform robust cell-level visual representation learning in an unsupervised setting. Our model is not only label-free and easily trained but also capable of cell-level unsupervised classification with interpretable visualization, which achieves promising results in the unsupervised classification of bone marrow cellular components. Based on the proposed cell-level visual representation learning, we further develop a pipeline that exploits the varieties of cellular elements to perform histopathology image classification, the advantages of which are demonstrated on bone marrow datasets."
Pipeline Generative Adversarial Networks for Facial Images Generation with Multiple Attributes,"Generative Adversarial Networks are proved to be efficient on various kinds of image generation tasks. However, it is still a challenge if we want to generate images precisely. Many researchers focus on how to generate images with one attribute. But image generation under multiple attributes is still a tough work. In this paper, we try to generate a variety of face images under multiple constraints using a pipeline process. The Pip-GAN (Pipeline Generative Adversarial Network) we present employs a pipeline network structure which can generate a complex facial image step by step using a neutral face image. We applied our method on two face image databases and demonstrate its ability to generate convincing novel images of unseen identities under multiple conditions previously."
AttnGAN: Fine-Grained Text to Image Generation with Attentional Generative Adversarial Networks,"In this paper, we propose an Attentional Generative Adversarial Network (AttnGAN) that allows attention-driven, multi-stage refinement for fine-grained text-to-image generation. With a novel attentional generative network, the AttnGAN can synthesize fine-grained details at different subregions of the image by paying attentions to the relevant words in the natural language description. In addition, a deep attentional multimodal similarity model is proposed to compute a fine-grained image-text matching loss for training the generator. The proposed AttnGAN significantly outperforms the previous state of the art, boosting the best reported inception score by 14.14% on the CUB dataset and 170.25% on the more challenging COCO dataset. A detailed analysis is also performed by visualizing the attention layers of the AttnGAN. It for the first time shows that the layered attentional GAN is able to automatically select the condition at the word level for generating different parts of the image."
Exposing Computer Generated Images by Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks,"The recent computer graphics developments have upraised the quality of the generated digital content, astonishing the most skeptical viewer. Games and movies have taken advantage of this fact but, at the same time, these advances have brought serious negative impacts like the ones yielded by fakeimages produced with malicious intents. Digital artists can compose artificial images capable of deceiving the great majority of people, turning this into a very dangerous weapon in a timespan currently know as Fake News/Post-Truth"" Era. In this work, we propose a new approach for dealing with the problem of detecting computer generated images, through the application of deep convolutional networks and transfer learning techniques. We start from Residual Networks and develop different models adapted to the binary problem of identifying if an image was or not computer generated. Differently from the current state-of-the-art approaches, we don't rely on hand-crafted features, but provide to the model the raw pixel information, achieving the same 0.97 of state-of-the-art methods with two main advantages: our methods show more stable results (depicted by lower variance) and eliminate the laborious and manual step of specialized features extraction and selection."
Attentive Generative Adversarial Network for Raindrop Removal from a Single Image,"Raindrops adhered to a glass window or camera lens can severely hamper the visibility of a background scene and degrade an image considerably. In this paper, we address the problem by visually removing raindrops, and thus transforming a raindrop degraded image into a clean one. The problem is intractable, since first the regions occluded by raindrops are not given. Second, the information about the background scene of the occluded regions is completely lost for most part. To resolve the problem, we apply an attentive generative network using adversarial training. Our main idea is to inject visual attention into both the generative and discriminative networks. During the training, our visual attention learns about raindrop regions and their surroundings. Hence, by injecting this information, the generative network will pay more attention to the raindrop regions and the surrounding structures, and the discriminative network will be able to assess the local consistency of the restored regions. This injection of visual attention to both generative and discriminative networks is the main contribution of this paper. Our experiments show the effectiveness of our approach, which outperforms the state of the art methods quantitatively and qualitatively."
Recurrent Generative Adversarial Networks for Proximal Learning and Automated Compressive Image Recovery,"Recovering images from undersampled linear measurements typically leads to an ill-posed linear inverse problem, that asks for proper statistical priors. Building effective priors is however challenged by the low train and test overhead dictated by real-time tasks; and the need for retrieving visually ""plausible"" and physically ""feasible"" images with minimal hallucination. To cope with these challenges, we design a cascaded network architecture that unrolls the proximal gradient iterations by permeating benefits from generative residual networks (ResNet) to modeling the proximal operator. A mixture of pixel-wise and perceptual costs is then deployed to train proximals. The overall architecture resembles back-and-forth projection onto the intersection of feasible and plausible images. Extensive computational experiments are examined for a global task of reconstructing MR images of pediatric patients, and a more local task of superresolving CelebA faces, that are insightful to design efficient architectures. Our observations indicate that for MRI reconstruction, a recurrent ResNet with a single residual block effectively learns the proximal. This simple architecture appears to significantly outperform the alternative deep ResNet architecture by 2dB SNR, and the conventional compressed-sensing MRI by 4dB SNR with 100x faster inference. For image superresolution, our preliminary results indicate that modeling the denoising proximal demands deep ResNets."
GazeGAN - Unpaired Adversarial Image Generation for Gaze Estimation,"Recent research has demonstrated the ability to estimate gaze on mobile devices by performing inference on the image from the phone's front-facing camera, and without requiring specialized hardware. While this offers wide potential applications such as in human-computer interaction, medical diagnosis and accessibility (e.g., hands free gaze as input for patients with motor disorders), current methods are limited as they rely on collecting data from real users, which is a tedious and expensive process that is hard to scale across devices. There have been some attempts to synthesize eye region data using 3D models that can simulate various head poses and camera settings, however these lack in realism.  In this paper, we improve upon a recently suggested method, and propose a generative adversarial framework to generate a large dataset of high resolution colorful images with high diversity (e.g., in subjects, head pose, camera settings) and realism, while simultaneously preserving the accuracy of gaze labels. The proposed approach operates on extended regions of the eye, and even completes missing parts of the image. Using this rich synthesized dataset, and without using any additional training data from real users, we demonstrate improvements over state-of-the-art for estimating 2D gaze position on mobile devices. We further demonstrate cross-device generalization of model performance, as well as improved robustness to diverse head pose, blur and distance."
In2I : Unsupervised Multi-Image-to-Image Translation Using Generative Adversarial Networks,"In unsupervised image-to-image translation, the goal is to learn the mapping between an input image and an output image using a set of unpaired training images. In this paper, we propose an extension of the unsupervised image-to-image translation problem to multiple input setting. Given a set of paired images from multiple modalities, a transformation is learned to translate the input into a specified domain. For this purpose, we introduce a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based framework along with a multi-modal generator structure and a new loss term, latent consistency loss. Through various experiments we show that leveraging multiple inputs generally improves the visual quality of the translated images. Moreover, we show that the proposed method outperforms current state-of-the-art unsupervised image-to-image translation methods."
StarGAN: Unified Generative Adversarial Networks for Multi-Domain Image-to-Image Translation,"Recent studies have shown remarkable success in image-to-image translation for two domains. However, existing approaches have limited scalability and robustness in handling more than two domains, since different models should be built independently for every pair of image domains. To address this limitation, we propose StarGAN, a novel and scalable approach that can perform image-to-image translations for multiple domains using only a single model. Such a unified model architecture of StarGAN allows simultaneous training of multiple datasets with different domains within a single network. This leads to StarGAN's superior quality of translated images compared to existing models as well as the novel capability of flexibly translating an input image to any desired target domain. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a facial attribute transfer and a facial expression synthesis tasks."
Image Generation from Sketch Constraint Using Contextual GAN,"In this paper we investigate image generation guided by hand sketch. When the input sketch is badly drawn, the output of common image-to-image translation follows the input edges due to the hard condition imposed by the translation process. Instead, we propose to use sketch as weak constraint, where the output edges do not necessarily follow the input edges. We address this problem using a novel joint image completion approach, where the sketch provides the image context for completing, or generating the output image. We train a generated adversarial network, i.e, contextual GAN to learn the joint distribution of sketch and the corresponding image by using joint images. Our contextual GAN has several advantages. First, the simple joint image representation allows for simple and effective learning of joint distribution in the same image-sketch space, which avoids complicated issues in cross-domain learning. Second, while the output is related to its input overall, the generated features exhibit more freedom in appearance and do not strictly align with the input features as previous conditional GANs do. Third, from the joint image's point of view, image and sketch are of no difference, thus exactly the same deep joint image completion network can be used for image-to-sketch generation. Experiments evaluated on three different datasets show that our contextual GAN can generate more realistic images than state-of-the-art conditional GANs on challenging inputs and generalize well on common categories."
On the Automatic Generation of Medical Imaging Reports,"Medical imaging is widely used in clinical practice for diagnosis and treatment. Report-writing can be error-prone for unexperienced physicians, and time- consuming and tedious for experienced physicians. To address these issues, we study the automatic generation of medical imaging reports. This task presents several challenges. First, a complete report contains multiple heterogeneous forms of information, including findings and tags. Second, abnormal regions in medical images are difficult to identify. Third, the re- ports are typically long, containing multiple sentences. To cope with these challenges, we (1) build a multi-task learning framework which jointly performs the pre- diction of tags and the generation of para- graphs, (2) propose a co-attention mechanism to localize regions containing abnormalities and generate narrations for them, (3) develop a hierarchical LSTM model to generate long paragraphs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods on two publicly available datasets."
Generating Analytic Insights on Human Behaviour using Image Processing,"This paper proposes a method to track human figures in physical spaces and then utilizes this data to generate several data points such as footfall distribution, demographic analysis,heat maps as well as gender distribution. The proposed framework aims to establish this while utilizing minimum computational resources while remaining real time. It is often useful to have information such as what kind of people visit a certain place or what hour of the day experiences maximum activity, Such analysis can be used improve sales, manage huge number of people as well as predict future behaviour. The proposed framework is designed in a way such that it can take input streams from IP cameras and use that to generate relevant data points using open source tools such as OpenCV and raspberryPi."
WAYLA - Generating Images from Eye Movements,"We present a method for reconstructing images viewed by observers based only on their eye movements. By exploring the relationships between gaze patterns and image stimuli, the ""What Are You Looking At?"" (WAYLA) system learns to synthesize photo-realistic images that are similar to the original pictures being viewed. The WAYLA approach is based on the Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (Conditional GAN) image-to-image translation technique of Isola et al. We consider two specific applications - the first, of reconstructing newspaper images from gaze heat maps, and the second, of detailed reconstruction of images containing only text. The newspaper image reconstruction process is divided into two image-to-image translation operations, the first mapping gaze heat maps into image segmentations, and the second mapping the generated segmentation into a newspaper image. We validate the performance of our approach using various evaluation metrics, along with human visual inspection. All results confirm the ability of our network to perform image generation tasks using eye tracking data."
Robust Seed Mask Generation for Interactive Image Segmentation,"In interactive medical image segmentation, anatomical structures are extracted from reconstructed volumetric images. The first iterations of user interaction traditionally consist of drawing pictorial hints as an initial estimate of the object to extract. Only after this time consuming first phase, the efficient selective refinement of current segmentation results begins. Erroneously labeled seeds, especially near the border of the object, are challenging to detect and replace for a human and may substantially impact the overall segmentation quality. We propose an automatic seeding pipeline as well as a configuration based on saliency recognition, in order to skip the time-consuming initial interaction phase during segmentation. A median Dice score of 68.22% is reached before the first user interaction on the test data set with an error rate in seeding of only 0.088%."
Two Birds with One Stone: Transforming and Generating Facial Images with Iterative GAN,"Generating high fidelity identity-preserving faces with different facial attributes has a wide range of applications. Although a number of generative models have been developed to tackle this problem, there is still much room for further improvement.In paticular, the current solutions usually ignore the perceptual information of images, which we argue that it benefits the output of a high-quality image while preserving the identity information, especially in facial attributes learning area.To this end, we propose to train GAN iteratively via regularizing the min-max process with an integrated loss, which includes not only the per-pixel loss but also the perceptual loss. In contrast to the existing methods only deal with either image generation or transformation, our proposed iterative architecture can achieve both of them. Experiments on the multi-label facial dataset CelebA demonstrate that the proposed model has excellent performance on recognizing multiple attributes, generating a high-quality image, and transforming image with controllable attributes."
Visually-Aware Fashion Recommendation and Design with Generative Image Models,"Building effective recommender systems for domains like fashion is challenging due to the high level of subjectivity and the semantic complexity of the features involved (i.e., fashion styles). Recent work has shown that approaches to `visual' recommendation (e.g.~clothing, art, etc.) can be made more accurate by incorporating visual signals directly into the recommendation objective, using `off-the-shelf' feature representations derived from deep networks. Here, we seek to extend this contribution by showing that recommendation performance can be significantly improved by learning `fashion aware' image representations directly, i.e., by training the image representation (from the pixel level) and the recommender system jointly; this contribution is related to recent work using Siamese CNNs, though we are able to show improvements over state-of-the-art recommendation techniques such as BPR and variants that make use of pre-trained visual features. Furthermore, we show that our model can be used \emph{generatively}, i.e., given a user and a product category, we can generate new images (i.e., clothing items) that are most consistent with their personal taste. This represents a first step towards building systems that go beyond recommending existing items from a product corpus, but which can be used to suggest styles and aid the design of new products."
Artificial Generation of Big Data for Improving Image Classification: A Generative Adversarial Network Approach on SAR Data,"Very High Spatial Resolution (VHSR) large-scale SAR image databases are still an unresolved issue in the Remote Sensing field. In this work, we propose such a dataset and use it to explore patch-based classification in urban and periurban areas, considering 7 distinct semantic classes. In this context, we investigate the accuracy of large CNN classification models and pre-trained networks for SAR imaging systems. Furthermore, we propose a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for SAR image generation and test, whether the synthetic data can actually improve classification accuracy."
Building Data-driven Models with Microstructural Images: Generalization and Interpretability,"As data-driven methods rise in popularity in materials science applications, a key question is how these machine learning models can be used to understand microstructure. Given the importance of process-structure-property relations throughout materials science, it seems logical that models that can leverage microstructural data would be more capable of predicting property information. While there have been some recent attempts to use convolutional neural networks to understand microstructural images, these early studies have focused only on which featurizations yield the highest machine learning model accuracy for a single data set. This paper explores the use of convolutional neural networks for classifying microstructure with a more holistic set of objectives in mind: generalization between data sets, number of features required, and interpretability."
StackGAN++: Realistic Image Synthesis with Stacked Generative Adversarial Networks,"Although Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown remarkable success in various tasks, they still face challenges in generating high quality images. In this paper, we propose Stacked Generative Adversarial Networks (StackGAN) aiming at generating high-resolution photo-realistic images. First, we propose a two-stage generative adversarial network architecture, StackGAN-v1, for text-to-image synthesis. The Stage-I GAN sketches the primitive shape and colors of the object based on given text description, yielding low-resolution images. The Stage-II GAN takes Stage-I results and text descriptions as inputs, and generates high-resolution images with photo-realistic details. Second, an advanced multi-stage generative adversarial network architecture, StackGAN-v2, is proposed for both conditional and unconditional generative tasks. Our StackGAN-v2 consists of multiple generators and discriminators in a tree-like structure; images at multiple scales corresponding to the same scene are generated from different branches of the tree. StackGAN-v2 shows more stable training behavior than StackGAN-v1 by jointly approximating multiple distributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed stacked generative adversarial networks significantly outperform other state-of-the-art methods in generating photo-realistic images."
Image Disguise based on Generative Model,"To protect image contents, most existing encryption algorithms are designed to transform an original image into a texture-like or noise-like image, which is, however, an obvious visual sign indicating the presence of an encrypted image, results in a significantly large number of attacks. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a new image encryption method to generate a visually same image as the original one by sending a meaning-normal and independent image to a corresponding well-trained generative model to achieve the effect of disguising the original image. This image disguise method not only solves the problem of obvious visual implication, but also guarantees the security of the information."
Retinal Vasculature Segmentation Using Local Saliency Maps and Generative Adversarial Networks For Image Super Resolution,"We propose an image super resolution(ISR) method using generative adversarial networks (GANs) that takes a low resolution input fundus image and generates a high resolution super resolved (SR) image upto scaling factor of 16. This facilitates more accurate automated image analysis, especially for small or blurred landmarks and pathologies. Local saliency maps, which define each pixel's importance, are used to define a novel saliency loss in the GAN cost function. Experimental results show the resulting SR images have perceptual quality very close to the original images and perform better than competing methods that do not weigh pixels according to their importance. When used for retinal vasculature segmentation, our SR images result in accuracy levels close to those obtained when using the original images."
GeneSIS-RT: Generating Synthetic Images for training Secondary Real-world Tasks,"We propose a novel approach for generating high-quality, synthetic data for domain-specific learning tasks, for which training data may not be readily available. We leverage recent progress in image-to-image translation to bridge the gap between simulated and real images, allowing us to generate realistic training data for real-world tasks using only unlabeled real-world images and a simulation. GeneSIS-RT ameliorates the burden of having to collect labeled real-world images and is a promising candidate for generating high-quality, domain-specific, synthetic data.  To show the effectiveness of using GeneSIS-RT to create training data, we study two tasks: semantic segmentation and reactive obstacle avoidance. We demonstrate that learning algorithms trained using data generated by GeneSIS-RT make high-accuracy predictions and outperform systems trained on raw simulated data alone, and as well or better than those trained on real data. Finally, we use our data to train a quadcopter to fly 60 meters at speeds up to 3.4 m/s through a cluttered environment, demonstrating that our GeneSIS-RT images can be used to learn to perform mission-critical tasks."
Improving image generative models with human interactions,"GANs provide a framework for training generative models which mimic a data distribution. However, in many cases we wish to train these generative models to optimize some auxiliary objective function within the data it generates, such as making more aesthetically pleasing images. In some cases, these objective functions are difficult to evaluate, e.g. they may require human interaction. Here, we develop a system for efficiently improving a GAN to target an objective involving human interaction, specifically generating images that increase rates of positive user interactions. To improve the generative model, we build a model of human behavior in the targeted domain from a relatively small set of interactions, and then use this behavioral model as an auxiliary loss function to improve the generative model. We show that this system is successful at improving positive interaction rates, at least on simulated data, and characterize some of the factors that affect its performance."
A Generic Regression Framework for Pose Recognition on Color and Depth Images,"Cascaded regression method is a fast and accurate method on finding 2D pose of objects in RGB images. It is able to find the accurate pose of objects in an image by a great number of corrections on the good initial guess of the pose of objects. This paper explains the algorithm and shows the result of two experiments carried by the researchers. The presented new method to quickly and accurately predict 3D positions of body joints from a single depth image, using no temporal information. We take an object recognition approach, designing an intermediate body parts representation that maps the difficult pose estimation problem into a simpler per-pixel classification problem. Our large and highly varied training dataset allows the classifier to estimate body parts invariant to pose, body shape, clothing. Finally, we generate confidence-scored 3D proposals of several body parts by re-projecting the classification result and finding local modes."
A Survey of Efficient Regression of General-Activity Human Poses from Depth Images,"This paper presents a comprehensive review on regression-based method for human pose estimation. The problem of human pose estimation has been intensively studied and enabled many application from entertainment to training. Traditional methods often rely on color image only which cannot completely ambiguity of joint 3D position, especially in the complex context. With the popularity of depth sensors, the precision of 3D estimation has significant improvement. In this paper, we give a detailed analysis of state-of-the-art on human pose estimation, including depth image based and RGB-D based approaches. The experimental results demonstrate their advantages and limitation for different scenarios."
Synthetic Medical Images from Dual Generative Adversarial Networks,"Currently there is strong interest in data-driven approaches to medical image classification. However, medical imaging data is scarce, expensive, and fraught with legal concerns regarding patient privacy. Typical consent forms only allow for patient data to be used in medical journals or education, meaning the majority of medical data is inaccessible for general public research. We propose a novel, two-stage pipeline for generating synthetic medical images from a pair of generative adversarial networks, tested in practice on retinal fundi images. We develop a hierarchical generation process to divide the complex image generation task into two parts: geometry and photorealism. We hope researchers will use our pipeline to bring private medical data into the public domain, sparking growth in imaging tasks that have previously relied on the hand-tuning of models. We have begun this initiative through the development of SynthMed, an online repository for synthetic medical images."
Training-image based geostatistical inversion using a spatial generative adversarial neural network,"Probabilistic inversion within a multiple-point statistics framework is often computationally prohibitive for high-dimensional problems. To partly address this, we introduce and evaluate a new training-image based inversion approach for complex geologic media. Our approach relies on a deep neural network of the generative adversarial network (GAN) type. After training using a training image (TI), our proposed spatial GAN (SGAN) can quickly generate 2D and 3D unconditional realizations. A key characteristic of our SGAN is that it defines a (very) low-dimensional parameterization, thereby allowing for efficient probabilistic inversion using state-of-the-art Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. In addition, available direct conditioning data can be incorporated within the inversion. Several 2D and 3D categorical TIs are first used to analyze the performance of our SGAN for unconditional geostatistical simulation. Training our deep network can take several hours. After training, realizations containing a few millions of pixels/voxels can be produced in a matter of seconds. This makes it especially useful for simulating many thousands of realizations (e.g., for MCMC inversion) as the relative cost of the training per realization diminishes with the considered number of realizations. Synthetic inversion case studies involving 2D steady-state flow and 3D transient hydraulic tomography with and without direct conditioning data are used to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed SGAN-based inversion. For the 2D case, the inversion rapidly explores the posterior model distribution. For the 3D case, the inversion recovers model realizations that fit the data close to the target level and visually resemble the true model well."
Binary Generative Adversarial Networks for Image Retrieval,"The most striking successes in image retrieval using deep hashing have mostly involved discriminative models, which require labels. In this paper, we use binary generative adversarial networks (BGAN) to embed images to binary codes in an unsupervised way. By restricting the input noise variable of generative adversarial networks (GAN) to be binary and conditioned on the features of each input image, BGAN can simultaneously learn a binary representation per image, and generate an image plausibly similar to the original one. In the proposed framework, we address two main problems: 1) how to directly generate binary codes without relaxation? 2) how to equip the binary representation with the ability of accurate image retrieval? We resolve these problems by proposing new sign-activation strategy and a loss function steering the learning process, which consists of new models for adversarial loss, a content loss, and a neighborhood structure loss. Experimental results on standard datasets (CIFAR-10, NUSWIDE, and Flickr) demonstrate that our BGAN significantly outperforms existing hashing methods by up to 107\% in terms of~mAP (See Table tab.res.map.comp)Our anonymous code is available at: https://github.com/htconquer/BGAN."
A Generic Deep Architecture for Single Image Reflection Removal and Image Smoothing,"This paper proposes a deep neural network structure that exploits edge information in addressing representative low-level vision tasks such as layer separation and image filtering. Unlike most other deep learning strategies applied in this context, our approach tackles these challenging problems by estimating edges and reconstructing images using only cascaded convolutional layers arranged such that no handcrafted or application-specific image-processing components are required. We apply the resulting transferrable pipeline to two different problem domains that are both sensitive to edges, namely, single image reflection removal and image smoothing. For the former, using a mild reflection smoothness assumption and a novel synthetic data generation method that acts as a type of weak supervision, our network is able to solve much more difficult reflection cases that cannot be handled by previous methods. For the latter, we also exceed the state-of-the-art quantitative and qualitative results by wide margins. In all cases, the proposed framework is simple, fast, and easy to transfer across disparate domains."
Anveshak - A Groundtruth Generation Tool for Foreground Regions of Document Images,"We propose a graphical user interface based groundtruth generation tool in this paper. Here, annotation of an input document image is done based on the foreground pixels. Foreground pixels are grouped together with user interaction to form labeling units. These units are then labeled by the user with the user defined labels. The output produced by the tool is an image with an XML file containing its metadata information. This annotated data can be further used in different applications of document image analysis."
Statistics of Deep Generated Images,"Here, we explore the low-level statistics of images generated by state-of-the-art deep generative models. First, Variational auto-encoder (VAE~\cite{kingma2013auto}), Wasserstein generative adversarial network (WGAN~\cite{arjovsky2017wasserstein}) and deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN~\cite{radford2015unsupervised}) are trained on the ImageNet dataset and a large set of cartoon frames from animations. Then, for images generated by these models as well as natural scenes and cartoons, statistics including mean power spectrum, the number of connected components in a given image area, distribution of random filter responses, and contrast distribution are computed. Our analyses on training images support current findings on scale invariance, non-Gaussianity, and Weibull contrast distribution of natural scenes. We find that although similar results hold over cartoon images, there is still a significant difference between statistics of natural scenes and images generated by VAE, DCGAN and WGAN models. In particular, generated images do not have scale invariant mean power spectrum magnitude, which indicates existence of extra structures in these images. Inspecting how well the statistics of deep generated images match the known statistical properties of natural images, such as scale invariance, non-Gaussianity, and Weibull contrast distribution, can a) reveal the degree to which deep learning models capture the essence of the natural scenes, b) provide a new dimension to evaluate models, and c) allow possible improvement of image generative models (e.g., via defining new loss functions)."
GPLAC: Generalizing Vision-Based Robotic Skills using Weakly Labeled Images,"We tackle the problem of learning robotic sensorimotor control policies that can generalize to visually diverse and unseen environments. Achieving broad generalization typically requires large datasets, which are difficult to obtain for task-specific interactive processes such as reinforcement learning or learning from demonstration. However, much of the visual diversity in the world can be captured through passively collected datasets of images or videos. In our method, which we refer to as GPLAC (Generalized Policy Learning with Attentional Classifier), we use both interaction data and weakly labeled image data to augment the generalization capacity of sensorimotor policies. Our method combines multitask learning on action selection and an auxiliary binary classification objective, together with a convolutional neural network architecture that uses an attentional mechanism to avoid distractors. We show that pairing interaction data from just a single environment with a diverse dataset of weakly labeled data results in greatly improved generalization to unseen environments, and show that this generalization depends on both the auxiliary objective and the attentional architecture that we propose. We demonstrate our results in both simulation and on a real robotic manipulator, and demonstrate substantial improvement over standard convolutional architectures and domain adaptation methods."
Image Quality Assessment Techniques Show Improved Training and Evaluation of Autoencoder Generative Adversarial Networks,"We propose a training and evaluation approach for autoencoder Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), specifically the Boundary Equilibrium Generative Adversarial Network (BEGAN), based on methods from the image quality assessment literature. Our approach explores a multidimensional evaluation criterion that utilizes three distance functions: an l_1 score, the Gradient Magnitude Similarity Mean (GMSM) score, and a chrominance score. We show that each of the different distance functions captures a slightly different set of properties in image space and, consequently, requires its own evaluation criterion to properly assess whether the relevant property has been adequately learned. We show that models using the new distance functions are able to produce better images than the original BEGAN model in predicted ways."
What is the Role of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in an Image Caption Generator?,"In neural image captioning systems, a recurrent neural network (RNN) is typically viewed as the primary `generation' component. This view suggests that the image features should be `injected' into the RNN. This is in fact the dominant view in the literature. Alternatively, the RNN can instead be viewed as only encoding the previously generated words. This view suggests that the RNN should only be used to encode linguistic features and that only the final representation should be `merged' with the image features at a later stage. This paper compares these two architectures. We find that, in general, late merging outperforms injection, suggesting that RNNs are better viewed as encoders, rather than generators."
Low Dose CT Image Denoising Using a Generative Adversarial Network with Wasserstein Distance and Perceptual Loss,"In this paper, we introduce a new CT image denoising method based on the generative adversarial network (GAN) with Wasserstein distance and perceptual similarity. The Wasserstein distance is a key concept of the optimal transform theory, and promises to improve the performance of the GAN. The perceptual loss compares the perceptual features of a denoised output against those of the ground truth in an established feature space, while the GAN helps migrate the data noise distribution from strong to weak. Therefore, our proposed method transfers our knowledge of visual perception to the image denoising task, is capable of not only reducing the image noise level but also keeping the critical information at the same time. Promising results have been obtained in our experiments with clinical CT images."
Generation of High Dynamic Range Illumination from a Single Image for the Enhancement of Undesirably Illuminated Images,"This paper presents an algorithm that enhances undesirably illuminated images by generating and fusing multi-level illuminations from a single image.The input image is first decomposed into illumination and reflectance components by using an edge-preserving smoothing filter. Then the reflectance component is scaled up to improve the image details in bright areas. The illumination component is scaled up and down to generate several illumination images that correspond to certain camera exposure values different from the original. The virtual multi-exposure illuminations are blended into an enhanced illumination, where we also propose a method to generate appropriate weight maps for the tone fusion. Finally, an enhanced image is obtained by multiplying the equalized illumination and enhanced reflectance. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm produces visually pleasing output and also yields comparable objective results to the conventional enhancement methods, while requiring modest computational loads."
Learning to Hallucinate Face Images via Component Generation and Enhancement,"We propose a two-stage method for face hallucination. First, we generate facial components of the input image using CNNs. These components represent the basic facial structures. Second, we synthesize fine-grained facial structures from high resolution training images. The details of these structures are transferred into facial components for enhancement. Therefore, we generate facial components to approximate ground truth global appearance in the first stage and enhance them through recovering details in the second stage. The experiments demonstrate that our method performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods"
Synthesis of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Images via Multi-channel Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs),"Positron emission tomography (PET) image synthesis plays an important role, which can be used to boost the training data for computer aided diagnosis systems. However, existing image synthesis methods have problems in synthesizing the low resolution PET images. To address these limitations, we propose multi-channel generative adversarial networks (M-GAN) based PET image synthesis method. Different to the existing methods which rely on using low-level features, the proposed M-GAN is capable to represent the features in a high-level of semantic based on the adversarial learning concept. In addition, M-GAN enables to take the input from the annotation (label) to synthesize the high uptake regions e.g., tumors and from the computed tomography (CT) images to constrain the appearance consistency and output the synthetic PET images directly. Our results on 50 lung cancer PET-CT studies indicate that our method was much closer to the real PET images when compared with the existing methods."
Freehand Ultrasound Image Simulation with Spatially-Conditioned Generative Adversarial Networks,"Sonography synthesis has a wide range of applications, including medical procedure simulation, clinical training and multimodality image registration. In this paper, we propose a machine learning approach to simulate ultrasound images at given 3D spatial locations (relative to the patient anatomy), based on conditional generative adversarial networks (GANs). In particular, we introduce a novel neural network architecture that can sample anatomically accurate images conditionally on spatial position of the (real or mock) freehand ultrasound probe. To ensure an effective and efficient spatial information assimilation, the proposed spatially-conditioned GANs take calibrated pixel coordinates in global physical space as conditioning input, and utilise residual network units and shortcuts of conditioning data in the GANs' discriminator and generator, respectively. Using optically tracked B-mode ultrasound images, acquired by an experienced sonographer on a fetus phantom, we demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method by two sets of quantitative results: distances were calculated between corresponding anatomical landmarks identified in the held-out ultrasound images and the simulated data at the same locations unseen to the networks; a usability study was carried out to distinguish the simulated data from the real images. In summary, we present what we believe are state-of-the-art visually realistic ultrasound images, simulated by the proposed GAN architecture that is stable to train and capable of generating plausibly diverse image samples."
Generative Adversarial Network based on Resnet for Conditional Image Restoration,"The GANs promote an adversarive game to approximate complex and jointed example probability. The networks driven by noise generate fake examples to approximate realistic data distributions. Later the conditional GAN merges prior-conditions as input in order to transfer attribute vectors to the corresponding data. However, the CGAN is not designed to deal with the high dimension conditions since indirect guide of the learning is inefficiency. In this paper, we proposed a network ResGAN to generate fine images in terms of extremely degenerated images. The coarse images aligned to attributes are embedded as the generator inputs and classifier labels. In generative network, a straight path similar to the Resnet is cohered to directly transfer the coarse images to the higher layers. And adversarial training is circularly implemented to prevent degeneration of the generated images. Experimental results of applying the ResGAN to datasets MNIST, CIFAR10/100 and CELEBA show its higher accuracy to the state-of-art GANs."
AlignGAN: Learning to Align Cross-Domain Images with Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks,"Recently, several methods based on generative adversarial network (GAN) have been proposed for the task of aligning cross-domain images or learning a joint distribution of cross-domain images. One of the methods is to use conditional GAN for alignment. However, previous attempts of adopting conditional GAN do not perform as well as other methods. In this work we present an approach for improving the capability of the methods which are based on conditional GAN. We evaluate the proposed method on numerous tasks and the experimental results show that it is able to align the cross-domain images successfully in absence of paired samples. Furthermore, we also propose another model which conditions on multiple information such as domain information and label information. Conditioning on domain information and label information, we are able to conduct label propagation from the source domain to the target domain. A 2-step alternating training algorithm is proposed to learn this model."
High-Quality Face Image SR Using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks,"We propose a novel single face image super-resolution method, which named Face Conditional Generative Adversarial Network(FCGAN), based on boundary equilibrium generative adversarial networks. Without taking any facial prior information, our method can generate a high-resolution face image from a low-resolution one. Compared with existing studies, both our training and testing phases are end-to-end pipeline with little pre/post-processing. To enhance the convergence speed and strengthen feature propagation, skip-layer connection is further employed in the generative and discriminative networks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art models."
Automatic Trimap Generation for Image Matting,"Image matting is a longstanding problem in computational photography. Although, it has been studied for more than two decades, yet there is a challenge of developing an automatic matting algorithm which does not require any human efforts. Most of the state-of-the-art matting algorithms require human intervention in the form of trimap or scribbles to generate the alpha matte form the input image. In this paper, we present a simple and efficient approach to automatically generate the trimap from the input image and make the whole matting process free from human-in-the-loop. We use learning based matting method to generate the matte from the automatically generated trimap. Experimental results demonstrate that our method produces good quality trimap which results into accurate matte estimation. We validate our results by replacing the automatically generated trimap by manually created trimap while using the same image matting algorithm."
Retinal Vessel Segmentation in Fundoscopic Images with Generative Adversarial Networks,"Retinal vessel segmentation is an indispensable step for automatic detection of retinal diseases with fundoscopic images. Though many approaches have been proposed, existing methods tend to miss fine vessels or allow false positives at terminal branches. Let alone under-segmentation, over-segmentation is also problematic when quantitative studies need to measure the precise width of vessels. In this paper, we present a method that generates the precise map of retinal vessels using generative adversarial training. Our methods achieve dice coefficient of 0.829 on DRIVE dataset and 0.834 on STARE dataset which is the state-of-the-art performance on both datasets."
Using Artificial Tokens to Control Languages for Multilingual Image Caption Generation,"Recent work in computer vision has yielded impressive results in automatically describing images with natural language. Most of these systems generate captions in a sin- gle language, requiring multiple language-specific models to build a multilingual captioning system. We propose a very simple technique to build a single unified model across languages, using artificial tokens to control the language, making the captioning system more compact. We evaluate our approach on generating English and Japanese captions, and show that a typical neural captioning architecture is capable of learning a single model that can switch between two different languages."
Video Imagination from a Single Image with Transformation Generation,"In this work, we focus on a challenging task: synthesizing multiple imaginary videos given a single image. Major problems come from high dimensionality of pixel space and the ambiguity of potential motions. To overcome those problems, we propose a new framework that produce imaginary videos by transformation generation. The generated transformations are applied to the original image in a novel volumetric merge network to reconstruct frames in imaginary video. Through sampling different latent variables, our method can output different imaginary video samples. The framework is trained in an adversarial way with unsupervised learning. For evaluation, we propose a new assessment metric RIQA. In experiments, we test on 3 datasets varying from synthetic data to natural scene. Our framework achieves promising performance in image quality assessment. The visual inspection indicates that it can successfully generate diverse five-frame videos in acceptable perceptual quality."
Depth Structure Preserving Scene Image Generation,"Key to automatically generate natural scene images is to properly arrange among various spatial elements, especially in the depth direction. To this end, we introduce a novel depth structure preserving scene image generation network (DSP-GAN), which favors a hierarchical and heterogeneous architecture, for the purpose of depth structure preserving scene generation. The main trunk of the proposed infrastructure is built on a Hawkes point process that models the spatial dependency between different depth layers. Within each layer generative adversarial sub-networks are trained collaboratively to generate realistic scene components, conditioned on the layer information produced by the point process. We experiment our model on a sub-set of SUNdataset with annotated scene images and demonstrate that our models are capable of generating depth-realistic natural scene image."
Megapixel Size Image Creation using Generative Adversarial Networks,"Since its appearance, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have received a lot of interest in the AI community. In image generation several projects showed how GANs are able to generate photorealistic images but the results so far did not look adequate for the quality standard of visual media production industry. We present an optimized image generation process based on a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs), in order to create photorealistic high-resolution images (up to 1024x1024 pixels). Furthermore, the system was fed with a limited dataset of images, less than two thousand images. All these results give more clue about future exploitation of GANs in Computer Graphics and Visual Effects."
Pose Guided Person Image Generation,"This paper proposes the novel Pose Guided Person Generation Network (PG^2) that allows to synthesize person images in arbitrary poses, based on an image of that person and a novel pose. Our generation framework PG^2 utilizes the pose information explicitly and consists of two key stages: pose integration and image refinement. In the first stage the condition image and the target pose are fed into a U-Net-like network to generate an initial but coarse image of the person with the target pose. The second stage then refines the initial and blurry result by training a U-Net-like generator in an adversarial way. Extensive experimental results on both 128\times64 re-identification images and 256\times256 fashion photos show that our model generates high-quality person images with convincing details."
Deep image representations using caption generators,"Deep learning exploits large volumes of labeled data to learn powerful models. When the target dataset is small, it is a common practice to perform transfer learning using pre-trained models to learn new task specific representations. However, pre-trained CNNs for image recognition are provided with limited information about the image during training, which is label alone. Tasks such as scene retrieval suffer from features learned from this weak supervision and require stronger supervision to better understand the contents of the image. In this paper, we exploit the features learned from caption generating models to learn novel task specific image representations. In particular, we consider the state-of-the art captioning system Show and Tell~\cite{SnT-pami-2016} and the dense region description model DenseCap~\cite{densecap-cvpr-2016}. We demonstrate that, owing to richer supervision provided during the process of training, the features learned by the captioning system perform better than those of CNNs. Further, we train a siamese network with a modified pair-wise loss to fuse the features learned by~\cite{SnT-pami-2016} and~\cite{densecap-cvpr-2016} and learn image representations suitable for retrieval. Experiments show that the proposed fusion exploits the complementary nature of the individual features and yields state-of-the art retrieval results on benchmark datasets."
How a General-Purpose Commonsense Ontology can Improve Performance of Learning-Based Image Retrieval,"The knowledge representation community has built general-purpose ontologies which contain large amounts of commonsense knowledge over relevant aspects of the world, including useful visual information, e.g.: ""a ball is used by a football player"", ""a tennis player is located at a tennis court"". Current state-of-the-art approaches for visual recognition do not exploit these rule-based knowledge sources. Instead, they learn recognition models directly from training examples. In this paper, we study how general-purpose ontologies---specifically, MIT's ConceptNet ontology---can improve the performance of state-of-the-art vision systems. As a testbed, we tackle the problem of sentence-based image retrieval. Our retrieval approach incorporates knowledge from ConceptNet on top of a large pool of object detectors derived from a deep learning technique. In our experiments, we show that ConceptNet can improve performance on a common benchmark dataset. Key to our performance is the use of the ESPGAME dataset to select visually relevant relations from ConceptNet. Consequently, a main conclusion of this work is that general-purpose commonsense ontologies improve performance on visual reasoning tasks when properly filtered to select meaningful visual relations."
Multi-Stage Variational Auto-Encoders for Coarse-to-Fine Image Generation,"Variational auto-encoder (VAE) is a powerful unsupervised learning framework for image generation. One drawback of VAE is that it generates blurry images due to its Gaussianity assumption and thus L2 loss. To allow the generation of high quality images by VAE, we increase the capacity of decoder network by employing residual blocks and skip connections, which also enable efficient optimization. To overcome the limitation of L2 loss, we propose to generate images in a multi-stage manner from coarse to fine. In the simplest case, the proposed multi-stage VAE divides the decoder into two components in which the second component generates refined images based on the course images generated by the first component. Since the second component is independent of the VAE model, it can employ other loss functions beyond the L2 loss and different model architectures. The proposed framework can be easily generalized to contain more than two components. Experiment results on the MNIST and CelebA datasets demonstrate that the proposed multi-stage VAE can generate sharper images as compared to those from the original VAE."
Efficient and Scalable View Generation from a Single Image using Fully Convolutional Networks,"Single-image-based view generation (SIVG) is important for producing 3D stereoscopic content. Here, handling different spatial resolutions as input and optimizing both reconstruction accuracy and processing speed is desirable. Latest approaches are based on convolutional neural network (CNN), and they generate promising results. However, their use of fully connected layers as well as pre-trained VGG forces a compromise between reconstruction accuracy and processing speed. In addition, this approach is limited to the use of a specific spatial resolution. To remedy these problems, we propose exploiting fully convolutional networks (FCN) for SIVG. We present two FCN architectures for SIVG. The first one is based on combination of an FCN and a view-rendering network called DeepView_{ren}. The second one consists of decoupled networks for luminance and chrominance signals, denoted by DeepView_{dec}. To train our solutions we present a large dataset of 2M stereoscopic images. Results show that both of our architectures improve accuracy and speed over the state of the art. DeepView_{ren} generates competitive accuracy to the state of the art, however, with the fastest processing speed of all. That is x5 times faster speed and x24 times lower memory consumption compared to the state of the art. DeepView_{dec} has much higher accuracy, but with x2.5 times faster speed and x12 times lower memory consumption. We evaluated our approach with both objective and subjective studies."
Generative Cooperative Net for Image Generation and Data Augmentation,"How to build a good model for image generation given an abstract concept is a fundamental problem in computer vision. In this paper, we explore a generative model for the task of generating unseen images with desired features. We propose the Generative Cooperative Net (GCN) for image generation. The idea is similar to generative adversarial networks except that the generators and discriminators are trained to work accordingly. Our experiments on hand-written digit generation and facial expression generation show that GCN's two cooperative counterparts (the generator and the classifier) can work together nicely and achieve promising results. We also discovered a usage of such generative model as an data-augmentation tool. Our experiment of applying this method on a recognition task shows that it is very effective comparing to other existing methods. It is easy to set up and could help generate a very large synthesized dataset."
Auto-painter: Cartoon Image Generation from Sketch by Using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks,"Recently, realistic image generation using deep neural networks has become a hot topic in machine learning and computer vision. Images can be generated at the pixel level by learning from a large collection of images. Learning to generate colorful cartoon images from black-and-white sketches is not only an interesting research problem, but also a potential application in digital entertainment. In this paper, we investigate the sketch-to-image synthesis problem by using conditional generative adversarial networks (cGAN). We propose the auto-painter model which can automatically generate compatible colors for a sketch. The new model is not only capable of painting hand-draw sketch with proper colors, but also allowing users to indicate preferred colors. Experimental results on two sketch datasets show that the auto-painter performs better that existing image-to-image methods."
Aligned Image Sets and the Generalized Degrees of Freedom of Symmetric MIMO Interference Channel with Partial CSIT,"The generalized degrees of freedom (GDoF) of the two user symmetric multiple input multiple output (MIMO) interference channel (IC) are characterized as a function of the channel strength levels and the level of channel state information at the transmitters (CSIT). In this symmetric setting, each transmitter is equipped with M antennas, each receiver is equipped with N antennas, and both cross links have the same strength parameter α and the same channel uncertainty parameter β. The main challenge resides in the proof of the outer bound which is accomplished by a generalization of the aligned image sets approach."
Sharing deep generative representation for perceived image reconstruction from human brain activity,"Decoding human brain activities via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has gained increasing attention in recent years. While encouraging results have been reported in brain states classification tasks, reconstructing the details of human visual experience still remains difficult. Two main challenges that hinder the development of effective models are the perplexing fMRI measurement noise and the high dimensionality of limited data instances. Existing methods generally suffer from one or both of these issues and yield dissatisfactory results. In this paper, we tackle this problem by casting the reconstruction of visual stimulus as the Bayesian inference of missing view in a multiview latent variable model. Sharing a common latent representation, our joint generative model of external stimulus and brain response is not only ""deep"" in extracting nonlinear features from visual images, but also powerful in capturing correlations among voxel activities of fMRI recordings. The nonlinearity and deep structure endow our model with strong representation ability, while the correlations of voxel activities are critical for suppressing noise and improving prediction. We devise an efficient variational Bayesian method to infer the latent variables and the model parameters. To further improve the reconstruction accuracy, the latent representations of testing instances are enforced to be close to that of their neighbours from the training set via posterior regularization. Experiments on three fMRI recording datasets demonstrate that our approach can more accurately reconstruct visual stimuli."
Paying Attention to Descriptions Generated by Image Captioning Models,"To bridge the gap between humans and machines in image understanding and describing, we need further insight into how people describe a perceived scene. In this paper, we study the agreement between bottom-up saliency-based visual attention and object referrals in scene description constructs. We investigate the properties of human-written descriptions and machine-generated ones. We then propose a saliency-boosted image captioning model in order to investigate benefits from low-level cues in language models. We learn that (1) humans mention more salient objects earlier than less salient ones in their descriptions, (2) the better a captioning model performs, the better attention agreement it has with human descriptions, (3) the proposed saliency-boosted model, compared to its baseline form, does not improve significantly on the MS COCO database, indicating explicit bottom-up boosting does not help when the task is well learnt and tuned on a data, (4) a better generalization is, however, observed for the saliency-boosted model on unseen data."
Multi-View Image Generation from a Single-View,"This paper addresses a challenging problem -- how to generate multi-view cloth images from only a single view input. To generate realistic-looking images with different views from the input, we propose a new image generation model termed VariGANs that combines the strengths of the variational inference and the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Our proposed VariGANs model generates the target image in a coarse-to-fine manner instead of a single pass which suffers from severe artifacts. It first performs variational inference to model global appearance of the object (e.g., shape and color) and produce a coarse image with a different view. Conditioned on the generated low resolution images, it then proceeds to perform adversarial learning to fill details and generate images of consistent details with the input. Extensive experiments conducted on two clothing datasets, MVC and DeepFashion, have demonstrated that images of a novel view generated by our model are more plausible than those generated by existing approaches, in terms of more consistent global appearance as well as richer and sharper details."
Semi-Latent GAN: Learning to generate and modify facial images from attributes,"Generating and manipulating human facial images using high-level attributal controls are important and interesting problems. The models proposed in previous work can solve one of these two problems (generation or manipulation), but not both coherently. This paper proposes a novel model that learns how to both generate and modify the facial image from high-level semantic attributes. Our key idea is to formulate a Semi-Latent Facial Attribute Space (SL-FAS) to systematically learn relationship between user-defined and latent attributes, as well as between those attributes and RGB imagery. As part of this newly formulated space, we propose a new model --- SL-GAN which is a specific form of Generative Adversarial Network. Finally, we present an iterative training algorithm for SL-GAN. The experiments on recent CelebA and CASIA-WebFace datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. We will also make data, pre-trained models and code available."
Unsupervised Holistic Image Generation from Key Local Patches,"We introduce a new problem of generating an image based on a small number of key local patches without any geometric prior. In this work, key local patches are defined as informative regions of the target object or scene. This is a challenging problem since it requires generating realistic images and predicting locations of parts at the same time. We construct adversarial networks to tackle this problem. A generator network generates a fake image as well as a mask based on the encoder-decoder framework. On the other hand, a discriminator network aims to detect fake images. The network is trained with three losses to consider spatial, appearance, and adversarial information. The spatial loss determines whether the locations of predicted parts are correct. Input patches are restored in the output image without much modification due to the appearance loss. The adversarial loss ensures output images are realistic. The proposed network is trained without supervisory signals since no labels of key parts are required. Experimental results on six datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs favorably on challenging objects and scenes."
CVAE-GAN: Fine-Grained Image Generation through Asymmetric Training,"We present variational generative adversarial networks, a general learning framework that combines a variational auto-encoder with a generative adversarial network, for synthesizing images in fine-grained categories, such as faces of a specific person or objects in a category. Our approach models an image as a composition of label and latent attributes in a probabilistic model. By varying the fine-grained category label fed into the resulting generative model, we can generate images in a specific category with randomly drawn values on a latent attribute vector. Our approach has two novel aspects. First, we adopt a cross entropy loss for the discriminative and classifier network, but a mean discrepancy objective for the generative network. This kind of asymmetric loss function makes the GAN training more stable. Second, we adopt an encoder network to learn the relationship between the latent space and the real image space, and use pairwise feature matching to keep the structure of generated images. We experiment with natural images of faces, flowers, and birds, and demonstrate that the proposed models are capable of generating realistic and diverse samples with fine-grained category labels. We further show that our models can be applied to other tasks, such as image inpainting, super-resolution, and data augmentation for training better face recognition models."
Discriminative Transfer Learning for General Image Restoration,"Recently, several discriminative learning approaches have been proposed for effective image restoration, achieving convincing trade-off between image quality and computational efficiency. However, these methods require separate training for each restoration task (e.g., denoising, deblurring, demosaicing) and problem condition (e.g., noise level of input images). This makes it time-consuming and difficult to encompass all tasks and conditions during training. In this paper, we propose a discriminative transfer learning method that incorporates formal proximal optimization and discriminative learning for general image restoration. The method requires a single-pass training and allows for reuse across various problems and conditions while achieving an efficiency comparable to previous discriminative approaches. Furthermore, after being trained, our model can be easily transferred to new likelihood terms to solve untrained tasks, or be combined with existing priors to further improve image restoration quality."
Where to put the Image in an Image Caption Generator,"When a recurrent neural network language model is used for caption generation, the image information can be fed to the neural network either by directly incorporating it in the RNN -- conditioning the language model by `injecting' image features -- or in a layer following the RNN -- conditioning the language model by `merging' image features. While both options are attested in the literature, there is as yet no systematic comparison between the two. In this paper we empirically show that it is not especially detrimental to performance whether one architecture is used or another. The merge architecture does have practical advantages, as conditioning by merging allows the RNN's hidden state vector to shrink in size by up to four times. Our results suggest that the visual and linguistic modalities for caption generation need not be jointly encoded by the RNN as that yields large, memory-intensive models with few tangible advantages in performance; rather, the multimodal integration should be delayed to a subsequent stage."
Efficient and Robust Recovery of Sparse Signal and Image Using Generalized Nonconvex Regularization,"This work addresses the robust reconstruction problem of a sparse signal from compressed measurements. We propose a robust formulation for sparse reconstruction which employs the \ell_1-norm as the loss function for the residual error and utilizes a generalized nonconvex penalty for sparsity inducing. The \ell_1-loss is less sensitive to outliers in the measurements than the popular \ell_2-loss, while the nonconvex penalty has the capability of ameliorating the bias problem of the popular convex LASSO penalty and thus can yield more accurate recovery. To solve this nonconvex and nonsmooth minimization formulation efficiently, we propose a first-order algorithm based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). A smoothing strategy on the \ell_1-loss function has been used in deriving the new algorithm to make it convergent. Further, a sufficient condition for the convergence of the new algorithm has been provided for generalized nonconvex regularization. In comparison with several state-of-the-art algorithms, the new algorithm showed better performance in numerical experiments in recovering sparse signals and compressible images. The new algorithm scales well for large-scale problems, as often encountered in image processing."
Refining Image Categorization by Exploiting Web Images and General Corpus,"Studies show that refining real-world categories into semantic subcategories contributes to better image modeling and classification. Previous image sub-categorization work relying on labeled images and WordNet's hierarchy is not only labor-intensive, but also restricted to classify images into NOUN subcategories. To tackle these problems, in this work, we exploit general corpus information to automatically select and subsequently classify web images into semantic rich (sub-)categories. The following two major challenges are well studied: 1) noise in the labels of subcategories derived from the general corpus; 2) noise in the labels of images retrieved from the web. Specifically, we first obtain the semantic refinement subcategories from the text perspective and remove the noise by the relevance-based approach. To suppress the search error induced noisy images, we then formulate image selection and classifier learning as a multi-class multi-instance learning problem and propose to solve the employed problem by the cutting-plane algorithm. The experiments show significant performance gains by using the generated data of our way on both image categorization and sub-categorization tasks. The proposed approach also consistently outperforms existing weakly supervised and web-supervised approaches."
DeepSD: Generating High Resolution Climate Change Projections through Single Image Super-Resolution,"The impacts of climate change are felt by most critical systems, such as infrastructure, ecological systems, and power-plants. However, contemporary Earth System Models (ESM) are run at spatial resolutions too coarse for assessing effects this localized. Local scale projections can be obtained using statistical downscaling, a technique which uses historical climate observations to learn a low-resolution to high-resolution mapping. Depending on statistical modeling choices, downscaled projections have been shown to vary significantly terms of accuracy and reliability. The spatio-temporal nature of the climate system motivates the adaptation of super-resolution image processing techniques to statistical downscaling. In our work, we present DeepSD, a generalized stacked super resolution convolutional neural network (SRCNN) framework for statistical downscaling of climate variables. DeepSD augments SRCNN with multi-scale input channels to maximize predictability in statistical downscaling. We provide a comparison with Bias Correction Spatial Disaggregation as well as three Automated-Statistical Downscaling approaches in downscaling daily precipitation from 1 degree (~100km) to 1/8 degrees (~12.5km) over the Continental United States. Furthermore, a framework using the NASA Earth Exchange (NEX) platform is discussed for downscaling more than 20 ESM models with multiple emission scenarios."
Transformation-Grounded Image Generation Network for Novel 3D View Synthesis,"We present a transformation-grounded image generation network for novel 3D view synthesis from a single image. Instead of taking a 'blank slate' approach, we first explicitly infer the parts of the geometry visible both in the input and novel views and then re-cast the remaining synthesis problem as image completion. Specifically, we both predict a flow to move the pixels from the input to the novel view along with a novel visibility map that helps deal with occulsion/disocculsion. Next, conditioned on those intermediate results, we hallucinate (infer) parts of the object invisible in the input image. In addition to the new network structure, training with a combination of adversarial and perceptual loss results in a reduction in common artifacts of novel view synthesis such as distortions and holes, while successfully generating high frequency details and preserving visual aspects of the input image. We evaluate our approach on a wide range of synthetic and real examples. Both qualitative and quantitative results show our method achieves significantly better results compared to existing methods."
LR-GAN: Layered Recursive Generative Adversarial Networks for Image Generation,"We present LR-GAN: an adversarial image generation model which takes scene structure and context into account. Unlike previous generative adversarial networks (GANs), the proposed GAN learns to generate image background and foregrounds separately and recursively, and stitch the foregrounds on the background in a contextually relevant manner to produce a complete natural image. For each foreground, the model learns to generate its appearance, shape and pose. The whole model is unsupervised, and is trained in an end-to-end manner with gradient descent methods. The experiments demonstrate that LR-GAN can generate more natural images with objects that are more human recognizable than DCGAN."
Generating Steganographic Images via Adversarial Training,"Adversarial training was recently shown to be competitive against supervised learning methods on computer vision tasks, however, studies have mainly been confined to generative tasks such as image synthesis. In this paper, we apply adversarial training techniques to the discriminative task of learning a steganographic algorithm. Steganography is a collection of techniques for concealing information by embedding it within a non-secret medium, such as cover texts or images. We show that adversarial training can produce robust steganographic techniques: our unsupervised training scheme produces a steganographic algorithm that competes with state-of-the-art steganographic techniques, and produces a robust steganalyzer, which performs the discriminative task of deciding if an image contains secret information. We define a game between three parties, Alice, Bob and Eve, in order to simultaneously train both a steganographic algorithm and a steganalyzer. Alice and Bob attempt to communicate a secret message contained within an image, while Eve eavesdrops on their conversation and attempts to determine if secret information is embedded within the image. We represent Alice, Bob and Eve by neural networks, and validate our scheme on two independent image datasets, showing our novel method of studying steganographic problems is surprisingly competitive against established steganographic techniques."
WaterGAN: Unsupervised Generative Network to Enable Real-time Color Correction of Monocular Underwater Images,"This paper reports on WaterGAN, a generative adversarial network (GAN) for generating realistic underwater images from in-air image and depth pairings in an unsupervised pipeline used for color correction of monocular underwater images. Cameras onboard autonomous and remotely operated vehicles can capture high resolution images to map the seafloor, however, underwater image formation is subject to the complex process of light propagation through the water column. The raw images retrieved are characteristically different than images taken in air due to effects such as absorption and scattering, which cause attenuation of light at different rates for different wavelengths. While this physical process is well described theoretically, the model depends on many parameters intrinsic to the water column as well as the objects in the scene. These factors make recovery of these parameters difficult without simplifying assumptions or field calibration, hence, restoration of underwater images is a non-trivial problem. Deep learning has demonstrated great success in modeling complex nonlinear systems but requires a large amount of training data, which is difficult to compile in deep sea environments. Using WaterGAN, we generate a large training dataset of paired imagery, both raw underwater and true color in-air, as well as depth data. This data serves as input to a novel end-to-end network for color correction of monocular underwater images. Due to the depth-dependent water column effects inherent to underwater environments, we show that our end-to-end network implicitly learns a coarse depth estimate of the underwater scene from monocular underwater images. Our proposed pipeline is validated with testing on real data collected from both a pure water tank and from underwater surveys in field testing. Source code is made publicly available with sample datasets and pretrained models."
Generalized 3D Voxel Image Synthesis Architecture for Volumetric Spatial Visualization,"A general concept of 3D volumetric visualization systems is described based on 3D discrete voxel scenes (worlds) representation. Definitions of 3D discrete voxel scene (world) basic elements and main steps of the image synthesis algorithm are formulated. An algorithm for solving the problem of the voxelized world 3D image synthesis, intended for the systems of volumetric spatial visualization, is proposed. A computer-based architecture for 3D volumetric visualization of 3D discrete voxel world is presented. On the basis of the proposed overall concept of discrete voxel representation, the proposed architecture successfully adapts the ray tracing technique for the synthesis of 3D volumetric images. Since it is algorithmically simple and effectively supports parallelism, it can efficiently be implemented.  Key words:Volumetric spatial visualization, 3D volumetric imagesynthesis, discrete voxel world, ray tracing."
Generative Adversarial Networks recover features in astrophysical images of galaxies beyond the deconvolution limit,"Observations of astrophysical objects such as galaxies are limited by various sources of random and systematic noise from the sky background, the optical system of the telescope and the detector used to record the data. Conventional deconvolution techniques are limited in their ability to recover features in imaging data by the Shannon-Nyquist sampling theorem. Here we train a generative adversarial network (GAN) on a sample of 4,550 images of nearby galaxies at 0.01<z<0.02 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and conduct 10\times cross validation to evaluate the results. We present a method using a GAN trained on galaxy images that can recover features from artificially degraded images with worse seeing and higher noise than the original with a performance which far exceeds simple deconvolution. The ability to better recover detailed features such as galaxy morphology from low-signal-to-noise and low angular resolution imaging data significantly increases our ability to study existing data sets of astrophysical objects as well as future observations with observatories such as the Large Synoptic Sky Telescope (LSST) and the Hubble and James Webb space telescopes."
Image-Grounded Conversations: Multimodal Context for Natural Question and Response Generation,"The popularity of image sharing on social media and the engagement it creates between users reflects the important role that visual context plays in everyday conversations. We present a novel task, Image-Grounded Conversations (IGC), in which natural-sounding conversations are generated about a shared image. To benchmark progress, we introduce a new multiple-reference dataset of crowd-sourced, event-centric conversations on images. IGC falls on the continuum between chit-chat and goal-directed conversation models, where visual grounding constrains the topic of conversation to event-driven utterances. Experiments with models trained on social media data show that the combination of visual and textual context enhances the quality of generated conversational turns. In human evaluation, the gap between human performance and that of both neural and retrieval architectures suggests that multi-modal IGC presents an interesting challenge for dialogue research."
Image De-raining Using a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network,"Severe weather conditions such as rain and snow adversely affect the visual quality of images captured under such conditions thus rendering them useless for further usage and sharing. In addition, such degraded images drastically affect performance of vision systems. Hence, it is important to solve the problem of single image de-raining/de-snowing. However, this is a difficult problem to solve due to its inherent ill-posed nature. Existing approaches attempt to introduce prior information to convert it into a well-posed problem. In this paper, we investigate a new point of view in addressing the single image de-raining problem. Instead of focusing only on deciding what is a good prior or a good framework to achieve good quantitative and qualitative performance, we also ensure that the de-rained image itself does not degrade the performance of a given computer vision algorithm such as detection and classification. In other words, the de-rained result should be indistinguishable from its corresponding clear image to a given discriminator. This criterion can be directly incorporated into the optimization framework by using the recently introduced conditional generative adversarial networks (GANs). To minimize artifacts introduced by GANs and ensure better visual quality, a new refined loss function is introduced. Based on this, we propose a novel single image de-raining method called Image De-raining Conditional General Adversarial Network (ID-CGAN), which considers quantitative, visual and also discriminative performance into the objective function. Experiments evaluated on synthetic images and real images show that the proposed method outperforms many recent state-of-the-art single image de-raining methods in terms of quantitative and visual performance."
ImageJ2: ImageJ for the next generation of scientific image data,"ImageJ is an image analysis program extensively used in the biological sciences and beyond. Due to its ease of use, recordable macro language, and extensible plug-in architecture, ImageJ enjoys contributions from non-programmers, amateur programmers, and professional developers alike. Enabling such a diversity of contributors has resulted in a large community that spans the biological and physical sciences. However, a rapidly growing user base, diverging plugin suites, and technical limitations have revealed a clear need for a concerted software engineering effort to support emerging imaging paradigms, to ensure the software's ability to handle the requirements of modern science. Due to these new and emerging challenges in scientific imaging, ImageJ is at a critical development crossroads.  We present ImageJ2, a total redesign of ImageJ offering a host of new functionality. It separates concerns, fully decoupling the data model from the user interface. It emphasizes integration with external applications to maximize interoperability. Its robust new plugin framework allows everything from image formats, to scripting languages, to visualization to be extended by the community. The redesigned data model supports arbitrarily large, N-dimensional datasets, which are increasingly common in modern image acquisition. Despite the scope of these changes, backwards compatibility is maintained such that this new functionality can be seamlessly integrated with the classic ImageJ interface, allowing users and developers to migrate to these new methods at their own pace. ImageJ2 provides a framework engineered for flexibility, intended to support these requirements as well as accommodate future needs."
Image Generation and Editing with Variational Info Generative AdversarialNetworks,"Recently there has been an enormous interest in generative models for images in deep learning. In pursuit of this, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) have surfaced as two most prominent and popular models. While VAEs tend to produce excellent reconstructions but blurry samples, GANs generate sharp but slightly distorted images. In this paper we propose a new model called Variational InfoGAN (ViGAN). Our aim is two fold: (i) To generated new images conditioned on visual descriptions, and (ii) modify the image, by fixing the latent representation of image and varying the visual description. We evaluate our model on Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW), celebA and a modified version of MNIST datasets and demonstrate the ability of our model to generate new images as well as to modify a given image by changing attributes."
Unsupervised Image-to-Image Translation with Generative Adversarial Networks,"It's useful to automatically transform an image from its original form to some synthetic form (style, partial contents, etc.), while keeping the original structure or semantics. We define this requirement as the ""image-to-image translation"" problem, and propose a general approach to achieve it, based on deep convolutional and conditional generative adversarial networks (GANs), which has gained a phenomenal success to learn mapping images from noise input since 2014. In this work, we develop a two step (unsupervised) learning method to translate images between different domains by using unlabeled images without specifying any correspondence between them, so that to avoid the cost of acquiring labeled data. Compared with prior works, we demonstrated the capacity of generality in our model, by which variance of translations can be conduct by a single type of model. Such capability is desirable in applications like bidirectional translation"
"Stage 4 validation of the Satellite Image Automatic Mapper lightweight computer program for Earth observation Level 2 product generation, Part 2 Validation","The European Space Agency (ESA) defines an Earth Observation (EO) Level 2 product as a multispectral (MS) image corrected for geometric, atmospheric, adjacency and topographic effects, stacked with its scene classification map (SCM) whose legend includes quality layers such as cloud and cloud-shadow. No ESA EO Level 2 product has ever been systematically generated at the ground segment. To contribute toward filling an information gap from EO big sensory data to the ESA EO Level 2 product, a Stage 4 validation (Val) of an off the shelf Satellite Image Automatic Mapper (SIAM) lightweight computer program for prior knowledge based MS color naming was conducted by independent means. A time-series of annual Web Enabled Landsat Data (WELD) image composites of the conterminous U.S. (CONUS) was selected as input dataset. The annual SIAM WELD maps of the CONUS were validated in comparison with the U.S. National Land Cover Data (NLCD) 2006 map. These test and reference maps share the same spatial resolution and spatial extent, but their map legends are not the same and must be harmonized. For the sake of readability this paper is split into two. The previous Part 1 Theory provided the multidisciplinary background of a priori color naming. The present Part 2 Validation presents and discusses Stage 4 Val results collected from the test SIAM WELD map time series and the reference NLCD map by an original protocol for wall to wall thematic map quality assessment without sampling, where the test and reference map legends can differ in agreement with the Part 1. Conclusions are that the SIAM-WELD maps instantiate a Level 2 SCM product whose legend is the FAO Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) taxonomy at the Dichotomous Phase (DP) Level 1 vegetation/nonvegetation, Level 2 terrestrial/aquatic or superior LCCS level."

For the sake of readability this paper is split into two. The present Part 1 Theory provides the multidisciplinary background of a priori color naming in cognitive science, from linguistics to computer vision. To cope with dictionaries of MS color names and land cover class names that do not coincide and must be harmonized, an original hybrid guideline is proposed to identify a categorical variable pair relationship. An original quantitative measure of categorical variable pair association is also proposed. The subsequent Part 2 Validation discusses Stage 4 Val results collected by an original protocol for wall-to-wall thematic map quality assessment without sampling where the test and reference map legends can differ.

Medical Image Synthesis with Context-Aware Generative Adversarial Networks,"Computed tomography (CT) is critical for various clinical applications, e.g., radiotherapy treatment planning and also PET attenuation correction. However, CT exposes radiation during acquisition, which may cause side effects to patients. Compared to CT, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is much safer and does not involve any radiations. Therefore, recently, researchers are greatly motivated to estimate CT image from its corresponding MR image of the same subject for the case of radiotherapy planning. In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach to address this challenging problem. Specifically, we train a fully convolutional network to generate CT given an MR image. To better model the nonlinear relationship from MRI to CT and to produce more realistic images, we propose to use the adversarial training strategy and an image gradient difference loss function. We further apply AutoContext Model to implement a context-aware generative adversarial network. Experimental results show that our method is accurate and robust for predicting CT images from MRI images, and also outperforms three state-of-the-art methods under comparison."
Compressive Image Recovery Using Recurrent Generative Model,"Reconstruction of signals from compressively sensed measurements is an ill-posed problem. In this paper, we leverage the recurrent generative model, RIDE, as an image prior for compressive image reconstruction. Recurrent networks can model long-range dependencies in images and hence are suitable to handle global multiplexing in reconstruction from compressive imaging. We perform MAP inference with RIDE using back-propagation to the inputs and projected gradient method. We propose an entropy thresholding based approach for preserving texture in images well. Our approach shows superior reconstructions compared to recent global reconstruction approaches like D-AMP and TVAL3 on both simulated and real data."
Generalized Deep Image to Image Regression,"We present a Deep Convolutional Neural Network architecture which serves as a generic image-to-image regressor that can be trained end-to-end without any further machinery. Our proposed architecture: the Recursively Branched Deconvolutional Network (RBDN) develops a cheap multi-context image representation very early on using an efficient recursive branching scheme with extensive parameter sharing and learnable upsampling. This multi-context representation is subjected to a highly non-linear locality preserving transformation by the remainder of our network comprising of a series of convolutions/deconvolutions without any spatial downsampling. The RBDN architecture is fully convolutional and can handle variable sized images during inference. We provide qualitative/quantitative results on 3 diverse tasks: relighting, denoising and colorization and show that our proposed RBDN architecture obtains comparable results to the state-of-the-art on each of these tasks when used off-the-shelf without any post processing or task-specific architectural modifications."
StackGAN: Text to Photo-realistic Image Synthesis with Stacked Generative Adversarial Networks,"Synthesizing high-quality images from text descriptions is a challenging problem in computer vision and has many practical applications. Samples generated by existing text-to-image approaches can roughly reflect the meaning of the given descriptions, but they fail to contain necessary details and vivid object parts. In this paper, we propose Stacked Generative Adversarial Networks (StackGAN) to generate 256x256 photo-realistic images conditioned on text descriptions. We decompose the hard problem into more manageable sub-problems through a sketch-refinement process. The Stage-I GAN sketches the primitive shape and colors of the object based on the given text description, yielding Stage-I low-resolution images. The Stage-II GAN takes Stage-I results and text descriptions as inputs, and generates high-resolution images with photo-realistic details. It is able to rectify defects in Stage-I results and add compelling details with the refinement process. To improve the diversity of the synthesized images and stabilize the training of the conditional-GAN, we introduce a novel Conditioning Augmentation technique that encourages smoothness in the latent conditioning manifold. Extensive experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-arts on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significant improvements on generating photo-realistic images conditioned on text descriptions."
Authoring image decompositions with generative models,"We show how to extend traditional intrinsic image decompositions to incorporate further layers above albedo and shading. It is hard to obtain data to learn a multi-layer decomposition. Instead, we can learn to decompose an image into layers that are ""like this"" by authoring generative models for each layer using proxy examples that capture the Platonic ideal (Mondrian images for albedo; rendered 3D primitives for shading; material swatches for shading detail). Our method then generates image layers, one from each model, that explain the image. Our approach rests on innovation in generative models for images. We introduce a Convolutional Variational Auto Encoder (conv-VAE), a novel VAE architecture that can reconstruct high fidelity images. The approach is general, and does not require that layers admit a physical interpretation."
A Point Set Generation Network for 3D Object Reconstruction from a Single Image,"Generation of 3D data by deep neural network has been attracting increasing attention in the research community. The majority of extant works resort to regular representations such as volumetric grids or collection of images; however, these representations obscure the natural invariance of 3D shapes under geometric transformations and also suffer from a number of other issues. In this paper we address the problem of 3D reconstruction from a single image, generating a straight-forward form of output -- point cloud coordinates. Along with this problem arises a unique and interesting issue, that the groundtruth shape for an input image may be ambiguous. Driven by this unorthodox output form and the inherent ambiguity in groundtruth, we design architecture, loss function and learning paradigm that are novel and effective. Our final solution is a conditional shape sampler, capable of predicting multiple plausible 3D point clouds from an input image. In experiments not only can our system outperform state-of-the-art methods on single image based 3d reconstruction benchmarks; but it also shows a strong performance for 3d shape completion and promising ability in making multiple plausible predictions."
Learning to Generate Images of Outdoor Scenes from Attributes and Semantic Layouts,"Automatic image synthesis research has been rapidly growing with deep networks getting more and more expressive. In the last couple of years, we have observed images of digits, indoor scenes, birds, chairs, etc. being automatically generated. The expressive power of image generators have also been enhanced by introducing several forms of conditioning variables such as object names, sentences, bounding box and key-point locations. In this work, we propose a novel deep conditional generative adversarial network architecture that takes its strength from the semantic layout and scene attributes integrated as conditioning variables. We show that our architecture is able to generate realistic outdoor scene images under different conditions, e.g. day-night, sunny-foggy, with clear object boundaries."
Plug & Play Generative Networks: Conditional Iterative Generation of Images in Latent Space,"Generating high-resolution, photo-realistic images has been a long-standing goal in machine learning. Recently, Nguyen et al. (2016) showed one interesting way to synthesize novel images by performing gradient ascent in the latent space of a generator network to maximize the activations of one or multiple neurons in a separate classifier network. In this paper we extend this method by introducing an additional prior on the latent code, improving both sample quality and sample diversity, leading to a state-of-the-art generative model that produces high quality images at higher resolutions (227x227) than previous generative models, and does so for all 1000 ImageNet categories. In addition, we provide a unified probabilistic interpretation of related activation maximization methods and call the general class of models ""Plug and Play Generative Networks"". PPGNs are composed of 1) a generator network G that is capable of drawing a wide range of image types and 2) a replaceable ""condition"" network C that tells the generator what to draw. We demonstrate the generation of images conditioned on a class (when C is an ImageNet or MIT Places classification network) and also conditioned on a caption (when C is an image captioning network). Our method also improves the state of the art of Multifaceted Feature Visualization, which generates the set of synthetic inputs that activate a neuron in order to better understand how deep neural networks operate. Finally, we show that our model performs reasonably well at the task of image inpainting. While image models are used in this paper, the approach is modality-agnostic and can be applied to many types of data."
Generating Holistic 3D Scene Abstractions for Text-based Image Retrieval,"Spatial relationships between objects provide important information for text-based image retrieval. As users are more likely to describe a scene from a real world perspective, using 3D spatial relationships rather than 2D relationships that assume a particular viewing direction, one of the main challenges is to infer the 3D structure that bridges images with users' text descriptions. However, direct inference of 3D structure from images requires learning from large scale annotated data. Since interactions between objects can be reduced to a limited set of atomic spatial relations in 3D, we study the possibility of inferring 3D structure from a text description rather than an image, applying physical relation models to synthesize holistic 3D abstract object layouts satisfying the spatial constraints present in a textual description. We present a generic framework for retrieving images from a textual description of a scene by matching images with these generated abstract object layouts. Images are ranked by matching object detection outputs (bounding boxes) to 2D layout candidates (also represented by bounding boxes) which are obtained by projecting the 3D scenes with sampled camera directions. We validate our approach using public indoor scene datasets and show that our method outperforms baselines built upon object occurrence histograms and learned 2D pairwise relations."
Sampled Image Tagging and Retrieval Methods on User Generated Content,"Traditional image tagging and retrieval algorithms have limited value as a result of being trained with heavily curated datasets. These limitations are most evident when arbitrary search words are used that do not intersect with training set labels. Weak labels from user generated content (UGC) found in the wild (e.g., Google Photos, FlickR, etc.) have an almost unlimited number of unique words in the metadata tags. Prior work on word embeddings successfully leveraged unstructured text with large vocabularies, and our proposed method seeks to apply similar cost functions to open source imagery. Specifically, we train a deep learning image tagging and retrieval system on large scale, user generated content (UGC) using sampling methods and joint optimization of word embeddings. By using the Yahoo! FlickR Creative Commons (YFCC100M) dataset, such an approach builds robustness to common unstructured data issues that include but are not limited to irrelevant tags, misspellings, multiple languages, polysemy, and tag imbalance. As a result, the final proposed algorithm will not only yield comparable results to state of the art in conventional image tagging, but will enable new capability to train algorithms on large, scale unstructured text in the YFCC100M dataset and outperform cited work in zero-shot capability."
A Hierarchical Approach for Generating Descriptive Image Paragraphs,"Recent progress on image captioning has made it possible to generate novel sentences describing images in natural language, but compressing an image into a single sentence can describe visual content in only coarse detail. While one new captioning approach, dense captioning, can potentially describe images in finer levels of detail by captioning many regions within an image, it in turn is unable to produce a coherent story for an image. In this paper we overcome these limitations by generating entire paragraphs for describing images, which can tell detailed, unified stories. We develop a model that decomposes both images and paragraphs into their constituent parts, detecting semantic regions in images and using a hierarchical recurrent neural network to reason about language. Linguistic analysis confirms the complexity of the paragraph generation task, and thorough experiments on a new dataset of image and paragraph pairs demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."
Can fully convolutional networks perform well for general image restoration problems?,"We present a fully convolutional network(FCN) based approach for color image restoration. FCNs have recently shown remarkable performance for high-level vision problem like semantic segmentation. In this paper, we investigate if FCN models can show promising performance for low-level problems like image restoration as well. We propose a fully convolutional model, that learns a direct end-to-end mapping between the corrupted images as input and the desired clean images as output. Our proposed method takes inspiration from domain transformation techniques but presents a data-driven task specific approach where filters for novel basis projection, task dependent coefficient alterations, and image reconstruction are represented as convolutional networks. Experimental results show that our FCN model outperforms traditional sparse coding based methods and demonstrates competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods for image denoising. We further show that our proposed model can solve the difficult problem of blind image inpainting and can produce reconstructed images of impressive visual quality."
Fast Algorithm of High-resolution Microwave Imaging Using the Non-parametric Generalized Reflectivity Model,"This paper presents an efficient algorithm of high-resolution microwave imaging based on the concept of generalized reflectivity. The contribution made in this paper is two-fold. We introduce the concept of non-parametric generalized reflectivity (GR, for short) as a function of operational frequencies and view angles, etc. The GR extends the conventional Born-based imaging model, i.e., single-scattering model, into that accounting for more realistic interaction between the electromagnetic wavefield and imaged scene. Afterwards, the GR-based microwave imaging is formulated in the convex of sparsity-regularized optimization. Typically, the sparsity-regularized optimization requires the implementation of iterative strategy, which is computationally expensive, especially for large-scale problems. To break this bottleneck, we convert the imaging problem into the problem of physics-driven image processing by introducing a dual transformation. Moreover, this image processing is performed over overlapping patches, which can be efficiently solved in the parallel or distributed manner. In this way, the proposed high-resolution imaging methodology could be applicable to large-scale microwave imaging problems. Selected simulation results are provided to demonstrate the state-of-art performance of proposed methodology."
Unsupervised Cross-Domain Image Generation,"We study the problem of transferring a sample in one domain to an analog sample in another domain. Given two related domains, S and T, we would like to learn a generative function G that maps an input sample from S to the domain T, such that the output of a given function f, which accepts inputs in either domains, would remain unchanged. Other than the function f, the training data is unsupervised and consist of a set of samples from each domain. The Domain Transfer Network (DTN) we present employs a compound loss function that includes a multiclass GAN loss, an f-constancy component, and a regularizing component that encourages G to map samples from T to themselves. We apply our method to visual domains including digits and face images and demonstrate its ability to generate convincing novel images of previously unseen entities, while preserving their identity."
Rain structure transfer using an exemplar rain image for synthetic rain image generation,"This letter proposes a simple method of transferring rain structures of a given exemplar rain image into a target image. Given the exemplar rain image and its corresponding masked rain image, rain patches including rain structures are extracted randomly, and then residual rain patches are obtained by subtracting those rain patches from their mean patches. Next, residual rain patches are selected randomly, and then added to the given target image along a raster scanning direction. To decrease boundary artifacts around the added patches on the target image, minimum error boundary cuts are found using dynamic programming, and then blending is conducted between overlapping patches. Our experiment shows that the proposed method can generate realistic rain images that have similar rain structures in the exemplar images. Moreover, it is expected that the proposed method can be used for rain removal. More specifically, natural images and synthetic rain images generated via the proposed method can be used to learn classifiers, for example, deep neural networks, in a supervised manner."
Enabling Dark Energy Science with Deep Generative Models of Galaxy Images,"Understanding the nature of dark energy, the mysterious force driving the accelerated expansion of the Universe, is a major challenge of modern cosmology. The next generation of cosmological surveys, specifically designed to address this issue, rely on accurate measurements of the apparent shapes of distant galaxies. However, shape measurement methods suffer from various unavoidable biases and therefore will rely on a precise calibration to meet the accuracy requirements of the science analysis. This calibration process remains an open challenge as it requires large sets of high quality galaxy images. To this end, we study the application of deep conditional generative models in generating realistic galaxy images. In particular we consider variations on conditional variational autoencoder and introduce a new adversarial objective for training of conditional generative networks. Our results suggest a reliable alternative to the acquisition of expensive high quality observations for generating the calibration data needed by the next generation of cosmological surveys."
Image-to-Markup Generation with Coarse-to-Fine Attention,"We present a neural encoder-decoder model to convert images into presentational markup based on a scalable coarse-to-fine attention mechanism. Our method is evaluated in the context of image-to-LaTeX generation, and we introduce a new dataset of real-world rendered mathematical expressions paired with LaTeX markup. We show that unlike neural OCR techniques using CTC-based models, attention-based approaches can tackle this non-standard OCR task. Our approach outperforms classical mathematical OCR systems by a large margin on in-domain rendered data, and, with pretraining, also performs well on out-of-domain handwritten data. To reduce the inference complexity associated with the attention-based approaches, we introduce a new coarse-to-fine attention layer that selects a support region before applying attention."
Photo-Realistic Single Image Super-Resolution Using a Generative Adversarial Network,"Despite the breakthroughs in accuracy and speed of single image super-resolution using faster and deeper convolutional neural networks, one central problem remains largely unsolved: how do we recover the finer texture details when we super-resolve at large upscaling factors? The behavior of optimization-based super-resolution methods is principally driven by the choice of the objective function. Recent work has largely focused on minimizing the mean squared reconstruction error. The resulting estimates have high peak signal-to-noise ratios, but they are often lacking high-frequency details and are perceptually unsatisfying in the sense that they fail to match the fidelity expected at the higher resolution. In this paper, we present SRGAN, a generative adversarial network (GAN) for image super-resolution (SR). To our knowledge, it is the first framework capable of inferring photo-realistic natural images for 4x upscaling factors. To achieve this, we propose a perceptual loss function which consists of an adversarial loss and a content loss. The adversarial loss pushes our solution to the natural image manifold using a discriminator network that is trained to differentiate between the super-resolved images and original photo-realistic images. In addition, we use a content loss motivated by perceptual similarity instead of similarity in pixel space. Our deep residual network is able to recover photo-realistic textures from heavily downsampled images on public benchmarks. An extensive mean-opinion-score (MOS) test shows hugely significant gains in perceptual quality using SRGAN. The MOS scores obtained with SRGAN are closer to those of the original high-resolution images than to those obtained with any state-of-the-art method."
Generative Visual Manipulation on the Natural Image Manifold,"Realistic image manipulation is challenging because it requires modifying the image appearance in a user-controlled way, while preserving the realism of the result. Unless the user has considerable artistic skill, it is easy to ""fall off"" the manifold of natural images while editing. In this paper, we propose to learn the natural image manifold directly from data using a generative adversarial neural network. We then define a class of image editing operations, and constrain their output to lie on that learned manifold at all times. The model automatically adjusts the output keeping all edits as realistic as possible. All our manipulations are expressed in terms of constrained optimization and are applied in near-real time. We evaluate our algorithm on the task of realistic photo manipulation of shape and color. The presented method can further be used for changing one image to look like the other, as well as generating novel imagery from scratch based on user's scribbles."
Learning to generalize to new compositions in image understanding,"Recurrent neural networks have recently been used for learning to describe images using natural language. However, it has been observed that these models generalize poorly to scenes that were not observed during training, possibly depending too strongly on the statistics of the text in the training data. Here we propose to describe images using short structured representations, aiming to capture the crux of a description. These structured representations allow us to tease-out and evaluate separately two types of generalization: standard generalization to new images with similar scenes, and generalization to new combinations of known entities. We compare two learning approaches on the MS-COCO dataset: a state-of-the-art recurrent network based on an LSTM (Show, Attend and Tell), and a simple structured prediction model on top of a deep network. We find that the structured model generalizes to new compositions substantially better than the LSTM, ~7 times the accuracy of predicting structured representations. By providing a concrete method to quantify generalization for unseen combinations, we argue that structured representations and compositional splits are a useful benchmark for image captioning, and advocate compositional models that capture linguistic and visual structure."
DeepDiary: Automatic Caption Generation for Lifelogging Image Streams,"Lifelogging cameras capture everyday life from a first-person perspective, but generate so much data that it is hard for users to browse and organize their image collections effectively. In this paper, we propose to use automatic image captioning algorithms to generate textual representations of these collections. We develop and explore novel techniques based on deep learning to generate captions for both individual images and image streams, using temporal consistency constraints to create summaries that are both more compact and less noisy. We evaluate our techniques with quantitative and qualitative results, and apply captioning to an image retrieval application for finding potentially private images. Our results suggest that our automatic captioning algorithms, while imperfect, may work well enough to help users manage lifelogging photo collections."
Generic 3D Convolutional Fusion for image restoration,"Also recently, exciting strides forward have been made in the area of image restoration, particularly for image denoising and single image super-resolution. Deep learning techniques contributed to this significantly. The top methods differ in their formulations and assumptions, so even if their average performance may be similar, some work better on certain image types and image regions than others. This complementarity motivated us to propose a novel 3D convolutional fusion (3DCF) method. Unlike other methods adapted to different tasks, our method uses the exact same convolutional network architecture to address both image denois- ing and single image super-resolution. As a result, our 3DCF method achieves substantial improvements (0.1dB-0.4dB PSNR) over the state-of-the-art methods that it fuses, and this on standard benchmarks for both tasks. At the same time, the method still is computationally efficient."
Semantic Image Inpainting with Deep Generative Models,"Semantic image inpainting is a challenging task where large missing regions have to be filled based on the available visual data. Existing methods which extract information from only a single image generally produce unsatisfactory results due to the lack of high level context. In this paper, we propose a novel method for semantic image inpainting, which generates the missing content by conditioning on the available data. Given a trained generative model, we search for the closest encoding of the corrupted image in the latent image manifold using our context and prior losses. This encoding is then passed through the generative model to infer the missing content. In our method, inference is possible irrespective of how the missing content is structured, while the state-of-the-art learning based method requires specific information about the holes in the training phase. Experiments on three datasets show that our method successfully predicts information in large missing regions and achieves pixel-level photorealism, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art methods."
Generating Images Part by Part with Composite Generative Adversarial Networks,"Image generation remains a fundamental problem in artificial intelligence in general and deep learning in specific. The generative adversarial network (GAN) was successful in generating high quality samples of natural images. We propose a model called composite generative adversarial network, that reveals the complex structure of images with multiple generators in which each generator generates some part of the image. Those parts are combined by alpha blending process to create a new single image. It can generate, for example, background and face sequentially with two generators, after training on face dataset. Training was done in an unsupervised way without any labels about what each generator should generate. We found possibilities of learning the structure by using this generative model empirically."
DNA Image Pro -- A Tool for Generating Pixel Patterns using DNA Tile Assembly,"Self-assembly is a process found everywhere in the Nature. In particular, it is known that DNA self-assembly is Turing universal. Thus one can do arbitrary computations or build nano-structures using DNA self-assembly. In order to understand the DNA self-assembly process, many mathematical models have been proposed in the literature. In particular, abstract Tile Assembly Model (aTAM) received much attention. In this work, we investigate pixel pattern generation using aTAM. For a given image, a tile assembly system is given which can generate the image by self-assembly process. We also consider image blocks with specific cyclic pixel patterns (uniform shift and non uniform shift) self assembly. A software, DNA Image Pro, for generating pixel patterns using DNA tile assembly is also given."
maskSLIC: Regional Superpixel Generation with Application to Local Pathology Characterisation in Medical Images,"Supervoxel methods such as Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) are an effective technique for partitioning an image or volume into locally similar regions, and are a common building block for the development of detection, segmentation and analysis methods. We introduce maskSLIC an extension of SLIC to create supervoxels within regions-of-interest, and demonstrate,on examples from 2-dimensions to 4-dimensions, that maskSLIC overcomes issues that affect SLIC within an irregular mask. We highlight the benefits of this method through examples, and show that it is able to better represent underlying tumour subregions and achieves significantly better results than SLIC on the BRATS 2013 brain tumour challenge data (p=0.001) - outperforming SLIC on 18/20 scans. Finally, we show an application of this method for the analysis of functional tumour subregions and demonstrate that it is more effective than voxel clustering."
Conditional Image Generation with PixelCNN Decoders,"This work explores conditional image generation with a new image density model based on the PixelCNN architecture. The model can be conditioned on any vector, including descriptive labels or tags, or latent embeddings created by other networks. When conditioned on class labels from the ImageNet database, the model is able to generate diverse, realistic scenes representing distinct animals, objects, landscapes and structures. When conditioned on an embedding produced by a convolutional network given a single image of an unseen face, it generates a variety of new portraits of the same person with different facial expressions, poses and lighting conditions. We also show that conditional PixelCNN can serve as a powerful decoder in an image autoencoder. Additionally, the gated convolutional layers in the proposed model improve the log-likelihood of PixelCNN to match the state-of-the-art performance of PixelRNN on ImageNet, with greatly reduced computational cost."
A Powerful Generative Model Using Random Weights for the Deep Image Representation,"To what extent is the success of deep visualization due to the training? Could we do deep visualization using untrained, random weight networks? To address this issue, we explore new and powerful generative models for three popular deep visualization tasks using untrained, random weight convolutional neural networks. First we invert representations in feature spaces and reconstruct images from white noise inputs. The reconstruction quality is statistically higher than that of the same method applied on well trained networks with the same architecture. Next we synthesize textures using scaled correlations of representations in multiple layers and our results are almost indistinguishable with the original natural texture and the synthesized textures based on the trained network. Third, by recasting the content of an image in the style of various artworks, we create artistic images with high perceptual quality, highly competitive to the prior work of Gatys et al. on pretrained networks. To our knowledge this is the first demonstration of image representations using untrained deep neural networks. Our work provides a new and fascinating tool to study the representation of deep network architecture and sheds light on new understandings on deep visualization."
DeepText: A Unified Framework for Text Proposal Generation and Text Detection in Natural Images,"In this paper, we develop a novel unified framework called DeepText for text region proposal generation and text detection in natural images via a fully convolutional neural network (CNN). First, we propose the inception region proposal network (Inception-RPN) and design a set of text characteristic prior bounding boxes to achieve high word recall with only hundred level candidate proposals. Next, we present a powerful textdetection network that embeds ambiguous text category (ATC) information and multilevel region-of-interest pooling (MLRP) for text and non-text classification and accurate localization. Finally, we apply an iterative bounding box voting scheme to pursue high recall in a complementary manner and introduce a filtering algorithm to retain the most suitable bounding box, while removing redundant inner and outer boxes for each text instance. Our approach achieves an F-measure of 0.83 and 0.85 on the ICDAR 2011 and 2013 robust text detection benchmarks, outperforming previous state-of-the-art results."
A Generic Framework for Assessing the Performance Bounds of Image Feature Detectors,"Since local feature detection has been one of the most active research areas in computer vision during the last decade, a large number of detectors have been proposed. The interest in feature-based applications continues to grow and has thus rendered the task of characterizing the performance of various feature detection methods an important issue in vision research. Inspired by the good practices of electronic system design, a generic framework based on the repeatability measure is presented in this paper that allows assessment of the upper and lower bounds of detector performance and finds statistically significant performance differences between detectors as a function of image transformation amount by introducing a new variant of McNemars test in an effort to design more reliable and effective vision systems. The proposed framework is then employed to establish operating and guarantee regions for several state-of-the-art detectors and to identify their statistical performance differences for three specific image transformations: JPEG compression, uniform light changes and blurring. The results are obtained using a newly acquired, large image database (20482) images with 539 different scenes. These results provide new insights into the behaviour of detectors and are also useful from the vision systems design perspective."
"Full characterization of generalized bent functions as (semi)-bent spaces, their dual, and the Gray image","In difference to many recent articles that deal with generalized bent (gbent) functions f:\mathbb{Z}_2^n \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_q for certain small valued q\in \{4,8,16 \}, we give a complete description of these functions for both n even and odd and for any q=2^k in terms of both the necessary and sufficient conditions their component functions need to satisfy. This enables us to completely characterize gbent functions as algebraic objects, namely as affine spaces of bent or semi-bent functions with interesting additional properties, which we in detail describe. We also specify the dual and the Gray image of gbent functions for q=2^k. We discuss the subclass of gbent functions which corresponds to relative difference sets, which we call \mathbb{Z}_q-bent functions, and point out that they correspond to a class of vectorial bent functions. The property of being \mathbb{Z}_q-bent is much stronger than the standard concept of a gbent function. We analyse two examples of this class of functions."
Generative Adversarial Text to Image Synthesis,"Automatic synthesis of realistic images from text would be interesting and useful, but current AI systems are still far from this goal. However, in recent years generic and powerful recurrent neural network architectures have been developed to learn discriminative text feature representations. Meanwhile, deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (GANs) have begun to generate highly compelling images of specific categories, such as faces, album covers, and room interiors. In this work, we develop a novel deep architecture and GAN formulation to effectively bridge these advances in text and image model- ing, translating visual concepts from characters to pixels. We demonstrate the capability of our model to generate plausible images of birds and flowers from detailed text descriptions."
Generating Binary Tags for Fast Medical Image Retrieval Based on Convolutional Nets and Radon Transform,"Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) in large medical image archives is a challenging and necessary task. Generally, different feature extraction methods are used to assign expressive and invariant features to each image such that the search for similar images comes down to feature classification and/or matching. The present work introduces a new image retrieval method for medical applications that employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) with recently introduced Radon barcodes. We combine neural codes for global classification with Radon barcodes for the final retrieval. We also examine image search based on regions of interest (ROI) matching after image retrieval. The IRMA dataset with more than 14,000 x-rays images is used to evaluate the performance of our method. Experimental results show that our approach is superior to many published works."
Generating Natural Questions About an Image,"There has been an explosion of work in the vision & language community during the past few years from image captioning to video transcription, and answering questions about images. These tasks have focused on literal descriptions of the image. To move beyond the literal, we choose to explore how questions about an image are often directed at commonsense inference and the abstract events evoked by objects in the image. In this paper, we introduce the novel task of Visual Question Generation (VQG), where the system is tasked with asking a natural and engaging question when shown an image. We provide three datasets which cover a variety of images from object-centric to event-centric, with considerably more abstract training data than provided to state-of-the-art captioning systems thus far. We train and test several generative and retrieval models to tackle the task of VQG. Evaluation results show that while such models ask reasonable questions for a variety of images, there is still a wide gap with human performance which motivates further work on connecting images with commonsense knowledge and pragmatics. Our proposed task offers a new challenge to the community which we hope furthers interest in exploring deeper connections between vision & language."
Generative Image Modeling using Style and Structure Adversarial Networks,"Current generative frameworks use end-to-end learning and generate images by sampling from uniform noise distribution. However, these approaches ignore the most basic principle of image formation: images are product of: (a) Structure: the underlying 3D model; (b) Style: the texture mapped onto structure. In this paper, we factorize the image generation process and propose Style and Structure Generative Adversarial Network (S^2-GAN). Our S^2-GAN has two components: the Structure-GAN generates a surface normal map; the Style-GAN takes the surface normal map as input and generates the 2D image. Apart from a real vs. generated loss function, we use an additional loss with computed surface normals from generated images. The two GANs are first trained independently, and then merged together via joint learning. We show our S^2-GAN model is interpretable, generates more realistic images and can be used to learn unsupervised RGBD representations."
Image Restoration: A General Wavelet Frame Based Model and Its Asymptotic Analysis,"Image restoration is one of the most important areas in imaging science. Mathematical tools have been widely used in image restoration, where wavelet frame based approach is one of the successful examples. In this paper, we introduce a generic wavelet frame based image restoration model, called the ""general model"", which includes most of the existing wavelet frame based models as special cases. Moreover, the general model also includes examples that are new to the literature. Motivated by our earlier studies [1-3], We provide an asymptotic analysis of the general model as image resolution goes to infinity, which establishes a connection between the general model in discrete setting and a new variatonal model in continuum setting. The variational model also includes some of the existing variational models as special cases, such as the total generalized variational model proposed by [4]. In the end, we introduce an algorithm solving the general model and present one numerical simulation as an example."
Generating images with recurrent adversarial networks,"Gatys et al. (2015) showed that optimizing pixels to match features in a convolutional network with respect reference image features is a way to render images of high visual quality. We show that unrolling this gradient-based optimization yields a recurrent computation that creates images by incrementally adding onto a visual ""canvas"". We propose a recurrent generative model inspired by this view, and show that it can be trained using adversarial training to generate very good image samples. We also propose a way to quantitatively compare adversarial networks by having the generators and discriminators of these networks compete against each other."
Generating Images with Perceptual Similarity Metrics based on Deep Networks,"Image-generating machine learning models are typically trained with loss functions based on distance in the image space. This often leads to over-smoothed results. We propose a class of loss functions, which we call deep perceptual similarity metrics (DeePSiM), that mitigate this problem. Instead of computing distances in the image space, we compute distances between image features extracted by deep neural networks. This metric better reflects perceptually similarity of images and thus leads to better results. We show three applications: autoencoder training, a modification of a variational autoencoder, and inversion of deep convolutional networks. In all cases, the generated images look sharp and resemble natural images."
Generate Image Descriptions based on Deep RNN and Memory Cells for Images Features,"Generating natural language descriptions for images is a challenging task. The traditional way is to use the convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract image features, followed by recurrent neural network (RNN) to generate sentences. In this paper, we present a new model that added memory cells to gate the feeding of image features to the deep neural network. The intuition is enabling our model to memorize how much information from images should be fed at each stage of the RNN. Experiments on Flickr8K and Flickr30K datasets showed that our model outperforms other state-of-the-art models with higher BLEU scores."
"Automatic Description Generation from Images: A Survey of Models, Datasets, and Evaluation Measures","Automatic description generation from natural images is a challenging problem that has recently received a large amount of interest from the computer vision and natural language processing communities. In this survey, we classify the existing approaches based on how they conceptualize this problem, viz., models that cast description as either generation problem or as a retrieval problem over a visual or multimodal representational space. We provide a detailed review of existing models, highlighting their advantages and disadvantages. Moreover, we give an overview of the benchmark image datasets and the evaluation measures that have been developed to assess the quality of machine-generated image descriptions. Finally we extrapolate future directions in the area of automatic image description generation."
A Method for Image Reduction Based on a Generalization of Ordered Weighted Averaging Functions,"In this paper we propose a special type of aggregation function which generalizes the notion of Ordered Weighted Averaging Function - OWA. The resulting functions are called Dynamic Ordered Weighted Averaging Functions --- DYOWAs. This generalization will be developed in such way that the weight vectors are variables depending on the input vector. Particularly, this operators generalize the aggregation functions: Minimum, Maximum, Arithmetic Mean, Median, etc, which are extensively used in image processing. In this field of research two problems are considered: The determination of methods to reduce images and the construction of techniques which provide noise reduction. The operators described here are able to be used in both cases. In terms of image reduction we apply the methodology provided by Patermain et al. We use the noise reduction operators obtained here to treat the images obtained in the first part of the paper, thus obtaining images with better quality."
A Deep Generative Deconvolutional Image Model,"A deep generative model is developed for representation and analysis of images, based on a hierarchical convolutional dictionary-learning framework. Stochastic {\em unpooling} is employed to link consecutive layers in the model, yielding top-down image generation. A Bayesian support vector machine is linked to the top-layer features, yielding max-margin discrimination. Deep deconvolutional inference is employed when testing, to infer the latent features, and the top-layer features are connected with the max-margin classifier for discrimination tasks. The model is efficiently trained using a Monte Carlo expectation-maximization (MCEM) algorithm, with implementation on graphical processor units (GPUs) for efficient large-scale learning, and fast testing. Excellent results are obtained on several benchmark datasets, including ImageNet, demonstrating that the proposed model achieves results that are highly competitive with similarly sized convolutional neural networks."
Attribute2Image: Conditional Image Generation from Visual Attributes,"This paper investigates a novel problem of generating images from visual attributes. We model the image as a composite of foreground and background and develop a layered generative model with disentangled latent variables that can be learned end-to-end using a variational auto-encoder. We experiment with natural images of faces and birds and demonstrate that the proposed models are capable of generating realistic and diverse samples with disentangled latent representations. We use a general energy minimization algorithm for posterior inference of latent variables given novel images. Therefore, the learned generative models show excellent quantitative and visual results in the tasks of attribute-conditioned image reconstruction and completion."
Learning to Generate Images with Perceptual Similarity Metrics,"Deep networks are increasingly being applied to problems involving image synthesis, e.g., generating images from textual descriptions and reconstructing an input image from a compact representation. Supervised training of image-synthesis networks typically uses a pixel-wise loss (PL) to indicate the mismatch between a generated image and its corresponding target image. We propose instead to use a loss function that is better calibrated to human perceptual judgments of image quality: the multiscale structural-similarity score (MS-SSIM). Because MS-SSIM is differentiable, it is easily incorporated into gradient-descent learning. We compare the consequences of using MS-SSIM versus PL loss on training deterministic and stochastic autoencoders. For three different architectures, we collected human judgments of the quality of image reconstructions. Observers reliably prefer images synthesized by MS-SSIM-optimized models over those synthesized by PL-optimized models, for two distinct PL measures (\ell_1 and \ell_2 distances). We also explore the effect of training objective on image encoding and analyze conditions under which perceptually-optimized representations yield better performance on image classification. Finally, we demonstrate the superiority of perceptually-optimized networks for super-resolution imaging. Just as computer vision has advanced through the use of convolutional architectures that mimic the structure of the mammalian visual system, we argue that significant additional advances can be made in modeling images through the use of training objectives that are well aligned to characteristics of human perception."
Efficient inference in occlusion-aware generative models of images,"We present a generative model of images based on layering, in which image layers are individually generated, then composited from front to back. We are thus able to factor the appearance of an image into the appearance of individual objects within the image --- and additionally for each individual object, we can factor content from pose. Unlike prior work on layered models, we learn a shape prior for each object/layer, allowing the model to tease out which object is in front by looking for a consistent shape, without needing access to motion cues or any labeled data. We show that ordinary stochastic gradient variational bayes (SGVB), which optimizes our fully differentiable lower-bound on the log-likelihood, is sufficient to learn an interpretable representation of images. Finally we present experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of the model for inferring foreground and background objects in images."
Density Modeling of Images using a Generalized Normalization Transformation,"We introduce a parametric nonlinear transformation that is well-suited for Gaussianizing data from natural images. The data are linearly transformed, and each component is then normalized by a pooled activity measure, computed by exponentiating a weighted sum of rectified and exponentiated components and a constant. We optimize the parameters of the full transformation (linear transform, exponents, weights, constant) over a database of natural images, directly minimizing the negentropy of the responses. The optimized transformation substantially Gaussianizes the data, achieving a significantly smaller mutual information between transformed components than alternative methods including ICA and radial Gaussianization. The transformation is differentiable and can be efficiently inverted, and thus induces a density model on images. We show that samples of this model are visually similar to samples of natural image patches. We demonstrate the use of the model as a prior probability density that can be used to remove additive noise. Finally, we show that the transformation can be cascaded, with each layer optimized using the same Gaussianization objective, thus offering an unsupervised method of optimizing a deep network architecture."
Generating Images from Captions with Attention,"Motivated by the recent progress in generative models, we introduce a model that generates images from natural language descriptions. The proposed model iteratively draws patches on a canvas, while attending to the relevant words in the description. After training on Microsoft COCO, we compare our model with several baseline generative models on image generation and retrieval tasks. We demonstrate that our model produces higher quality samples than other approaches and generates images with novel scene compositions corresponding to previously unseen captions in the dataset."
Generalized bent functions and their Gray images,"In this paper we prove that generalized bent (gbent) functions defined on \mathbb{Z}_2^n with values in \mathbb{Z}_{2^k} are regular, and find connections between the (generalized) Walsh spectrum of these functions and their components. We comprehensively characterize generalized bent and semibent functions with values in \mathbb{Z}_{16}, which extends earlier results on gbent functions with values in \mathbb{Z}_4 and \mathbb{Z}_8. We also show that the Gray images of gbent functions with values in \mathbb{Z}_{2^k} are semibent/plateaued when k=3,4."
SentiCap: Generating Image Descriptions with Sentiments,"The recent progress on image recognition and language modeling is making automatic description of image content a reality. However, stylized, non-factual aspects of the written description are missing from the current systems. One such style is descriptions with emotions, which is commonplace in everyday communication, and influences decision-making and interpersonal relationships. We design a system to describe an image with emotions, and present a model that automatically generates captions with positive or negative sentiments. We propose a novel switching recurrent neural network with word-level regularization, which is able to produce emotional image captions using only 2000+ training sentences containing sentiments. We evaluate the captions with different automatic and crowd-sourcing metrics. Our model compares favourably in common quality metrics for image captioning. In 84.6% of cases the generated positive captions were judged as being at least as descriptive as the factual captions. Of these positive captions 88% were confirmed by the crowd-sourced workers as having the appropriate sentiment."
Background Image Generation Using Boolean Operations,"Tracking moving objects from a video sequence requires segmentation of these objects from the background image. However, getting the actual background image automatically without object detection and using only the video is difficult. In this paper, we describe a novel algorithm that generates background from real world images without foreground detection. The algorithm assumes that the background image is shown in the majority of the video. Given this simple assumption, the method described in this paper is able to accurately generate, with high probability, the background image from a video using only a small number of binary operations."
Retinex filtering of foggy images: generation of a bulk set with selection and ranking,"In this paper we are proposing the use of GIMP Retinex, a filter of the GNU Image Manipulation Program, for enhancing foggy images. This filter involves adjusting four different parameters to find the output image which has to be preferred according to some specific purposes. Aiming to obtain a processing, which is able of choosing automatically the best image from a given set, we are proposing a method for the generation a bulk set of GIMP Retinex filtered images and a preliminary approach for selecting and ranking them."
Guiding Long-Short Term Memory for Image Caption Generation,"In this work we focus on the problem of image caption generation. We propose an extension of the long short term memory (LSTM) model, which we coin gLSTM for short. In particular, we add semantic information extracted from the image as extra input to each unit of the LSTM block, with the aim of guiding the model towards solutions that are more tightly coupled to the image content. Additionally, we explore different length normalization strategies for beam search in order to prevent from favoring short sentences. On various benchmark datasets such as Flickr8K, Flickr30K and MS COCO, we obtain results that are on par with or even outperform the current state-of-the-art."
Talking about the Moving Image: A Declarative Model for Image Schema Based Embodied Perception Grounding and Language Generation,"We present a general theory and corresponding declarative model for the embodied grounding and natural language based analytical summarisation of dynamic visuo-spatial imagery. The declarative model ---ecompassing spatio-linguistic abstractions, image schemas, and a spatio-temporal feature based language generator--- is modularly implemented within Constraint Logic Programming (CLP). The implemented model is such that primitives of the theory, e.g., pertaining to space and motion, image schemata, are available as first-class objects with `deep semantics' suited for inference and query. We demonstrate the model with select examples broadly motivated by areas such as film, design, geography, smart environments where analytical natural language based externalisations of the moving image are central from the viewpoint of human interaction, evidence-based qualitative analysis, and sensemaking.  Keywords: moving image, visual semantics and embodiment, visuo-spatial cognition and computation, cognitive vision, computational models of narrative, declarative spatial reasoning"
Deep Generative Image Models using a Laplacian Pyramid of Adversarial Networks,"In this paper we introduce a generative parametric model capable of producing high quality samples of natural images. Our approach uses a cascade of convolutional networks within a Laplacian pyramid framework to generate images in a coarse-to-fine fashion. At each level of the pyramid, a separate generative convnet model is trained using the Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) approach (Goodfellow et al.). Samples drawn from our model are of significantly higher quality than alternate approaches. In a quantitative assessment by human evaluators, our CIFAR10 samples were mistaken for real images around 40% of the time, compared to 10% for samples drawn from a GAN baseline model. We also show samples from models trained on the higher resolution images of the LSUN scene dataset."
Post-Reconstruction Deconvolution of PET Images by Total Generalized Variation Regularization,"Improving the quality of positron emission tomography (PET) images, affected by low resolution and high level of noise, is a challenging task in nuclear medicine and radiotherapy. This work proposes a restoration method, achieved after tomographic reconstruction of the images and targeting clinical situations where raw data are often not accessible. Based on inverse problem methods, our contribution introduces the recently developed total generalized variation (TGV) norm to regularize PET image deconvolution. Moreover, we stabilize this procedure with additional image constraints such as positivity and photometry invariance. A criterion for updating and adjusting automatically the regularization parameter in case of Poisson noise is also presented. Experiments are conducted on both synthetic data and real patient images."
Unveiling the Dreams of Word Embeddings: Towards Language-Driven Image Generation,"We introduce language-driven image generation, the task of generating an image visualizing the semantic contents of a word embedding, e.g., given the word embedding of grasshopper, we generate a natural image of a grasshopper. We implement a simple method based on two mapping functions. The first takes as input a word embedding (as produced, e.g., by the word2vec toolkit) and maps it onto a high-level visual space (e.g., the space defined by one of the top layers of a Convolutional Neural Network). The second function maps this abstract visual representation to pixel space, in order to generate the target image. Several user studies suggest that the current system produces images that capture general visual properties of the concepts encoded in the word embedding, such as color or typical environment, and are sufficient to discriminate between general categories of objects."
Generative Image Modeling Using Spatial LSTMs,"Modeling the distribution of natural images is challenging, partly because of strong statistical dependencies which can extend over hundreds of pixels. Recurrent neural networks have been successful in capturing long-range dependencies in a number of problems but only recently have found their way into generative image models. We here introduce a recurrent image model based on multi-dimensional long short-term memory units which are particularly suited for image modeling due to their spatial structure. Our model scales to images of arbitrary size and its likelihood is computationally tractable. We find that it outperforms the state of the art in quantitative comparisons on several image datasets and produces promising results when used for texture synthesis and inpainting."
Visual Madlibs: Fill in the blank Image Generation and Question Answering,"In this paper, we introduce a new dataset consisting of 360,001 focused natural language descriptions for 10,738 images. This dataset, the Visual Madlibs dataset, is collected using automatically produced fill-in-the-blank templates designed to gather targeted descriptions about: people and objects, their appearances, activities, and interactions, as well as inferences about the general scene or its broader context. We provide several analyses of the Visual Madlibs dataset and demonstrate its applicability to two new description generation tasks: focused description generation, and multiple-choice question-answering for images. Experiments using joint-embedding and deep learning methods show promising results on these tasks."
Location Prediction of Social Images via Generative Model,"The vast amount of geo-tagged social images has attracted great attention in research of predicting location using the plentiful content of images, such as visual content and textual description. Most of the existing researches use the text-based or vision-based method to predict location. There still exists a problem: how to effectively exploit the correlation between different types of content as well as their geographical distributions for location prediction. In this paper, we propose to predict image location by learning the latent relation between geographical location and multiple types of image content. In particularly, we propose a geographical topic model GTMI (geographical topic model of social image) to integrate multiple types of image content as well as the geographical distributions, In GTMI, image topic is modeled on both text vocabulary and visual feature. Each region has its own distribution over topics and hence has its own language model and vision pattern. The location of a new image is estimated based on the joint probability of image content and similarity measure on topic distribution between images. Experiment results demonstrate the performance of location prediction based on GTMI."
A General Framework for Multi-focal Image Classification and Authentication: Application to Microscope Pollen Images,"In this article, we propose a general framework for multi-focal image classification and authentication, the methodology being demonstrated on microscope pollen images. The framework is meant to be generic and based on a brute force-like approach aimed to be efficient not only on any kind, and any number, of pollen images (regardless of the pollen type), but also on any kind of multi-focal images. All stages of the framework's pipeline are designed to be used in an automatic fashion. First, the optimal focus is selected using the absolute gradient method. Then, pollen grains are extracted using a coarse-to-fine approach involving both clustering and morphological techniques (coarse stage), and a snake-based segmentation (fine stage). Finally, features are extracted and selected using a generalized approach, and their classification is tested with four classifiers: Weighted Neighbor Distance, Neural Network, Decision Tree and Random Forest. The latter method, which has shown the best and more robust classification accuracy results (above 97\% for any number of pollen types), is finally used for the authentication stage."
Multiscale Combinatorial Grouping for Image Segmentation and Object Proposal Generation,"We propose a unified approach for bottom-up hierarchical image segmentation and object proposal generation for recognition, called Multiscale Combinatorial Grouping (MCG). For this purpose, we first develop a fast normalized cuts algorithm. We then propose a high-performance hierarchical segmenter that makes effective use of multiscale information. Finally, we propose a grouping strategy that combines our multiscale regions into highly-accurate object proposals by exploring efficiently their combinatorial space. We also present Single-scale Combinatorial Grouping (SCG), a faster version of MCG that produces competitive proposals in under five second per image. We conduct an extensive and comprehensive empirical validation on the BSDS500, SegVOC12, SBD, and COCO datasets, showing that MCG produces state-of-the-art contours, hierarchical regions, and object proposals."
DRAW: A Recurrent Neural Network For Image Generation,"This paper introduces the Deep Recurrent Attentive Writer (DRAW) neural network architecture for image generation. DRAW networks combine a novel spatial attention mechanism that mimics the foveation of the human eye, with a sequential variational auto-encoding framework that allows for the iterative construction of complex images. The system substantially improves on the state of the art for generative models on MNIST, and, when trained on the Street View House Numbers dataset, it generates images that cannot be distinguished from real data with the naked eye."
"Show, Attend and Tell: Neural Image Caption Generation with Visual Attention","Inspired by recent work in machine translation and object detection, we introduce an attention based model that automatically learns to describe the content of images. We describe how we can train this model in a deterministic manner using standard backpropagation techniques and stochastically by maximizing a variational lower bound. We also show through visualization how the model is able to automatically learn to fix its gaze on salient objects while generating the corresponding words in the output sequence. We validate the use of attention with state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets: Flickr8k, Flickr30k and MS COCO."
Generalized Inpainting Method for Hyperspectral Image Acquisition,"A recently designed hyperspectral imaging device enables multiplexed acquisition of an entire data volume in a single snapshot thanks to monolithically-integrated spectral filters. Such an agile imaging technique comes at the cost of a reduced spatial resolution and the need for a demosaicing procedure on its interleaved data. In this work, we address both issues and propose an approach inspired by recent developments in compressed sensing and analysis sparse models. We formulate our superresolution and demosaicing task as a 3-D generalized inpainting problem. Interestingly, the target spatial resolution can be adjusted for mitigating the compression level of our sensing. The reconstruction procedure uses a fast greedy method called Pseudo-inverse IHT. We also show on simulations that a random arrangement of the spectral filters on the sensor is preferable to regular mosaic layout as it improves the quality of the reconstruction. The efficiency of our technique is demonstrated through numerical experiments on both synthetic and real data as acquired by the snapshot imager."
Deep Boosting: Layered Feature Mining for General Image Classification,"Constructing effective representations is a critical but challenging problem in multimedia understanding. The traditional handcraft features often rely on domain knowledge, limiting the performances of exiting methods. This paper discusses a novel computational architecture for general image feature mining, which assembles the primitive filters (i.e. Gabor wavelets) into compositional features in a layer-wise manner. In each layer, we produce a number of base classifiers (i.e. regression stumps) associated with the generated features, and discover informative compositions by using the boosting algorithm. The output compositional features of each layer are treated as the base components to build up the next layer. Our framework is able to generate expressive image representations while inducing very discriminate functions for image classification. The experiments are conducted on several public datasets, and we demonstrate superior performances over state-of-the-art approaches."
Simple Image Description Generator via a Linear Phrase-Based Approach,"Generating a novel textual description of an image is an interesting problem that connects computer vision and natural language processing. In this paper, we present a simple model that is able to generate descriptive sentences given a sample image. This model has a strong focus on the syntax of the descriptions. We train a purely bilinear model that learns a metric between an image representation (generated from a previously trained Convolutional Neural Network) and phrases that are used to described them. The system is then able to infer phrases from a given image sample. Based on caption syntax statistics, we propose a simple language model that can produce relevant descriptions for a given test image using the phrases inferred. Our approach, which is considerably simpler than state-of-the-art models, achieves comparable results on the recently release Microsoft COCO dataset."
Half-CNN: A General Framework for Whole-Image Regression,"The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has achieved great success in image classification. The classification model can also be utilized at image or patch level for many other applications, such as object detection and segmentation. In this paper, we propose a whole-image CNN regression model, by removing the full connection layer and training the network with continuous feature maps. This is a generic regression framework that fits many applications. We demonstrate this method through two tasks: simultaneous face detection & segmentation, and scene saliency prediction. The result is comparable with other models in the respective fields, using only a small scale network. Since the regression model is trained on corresponding image / feature map pairs, there are no requirements on uniform input size as opposed to the classification model. Our framework avoids classifier design, a process that may introduce too much manual intervention in model development. Yet, it is highly correlated to the classification network and offers some in-deep review of CNN structures."
Image Enhancement Using a Generalization of Homographic Function,"This paper presents a new method of gray level image enhancement, based on point transforms. In order to define the transform function, it was used a generalization of the homographic function."
Joint Segmentation and Deconvolution of Ultrasound Images Using a Hierarchical Bayesian Model based on Generalized Gaussian Priors,"This paper proposes a joint segmentation and deconvolution Bayesian method for medical ultrasound (US) images. Contrary to piecewise homogeneous images, US images exhibit heavy characteristic speckle patterns correlated with the tissue structures. The generalized Gaussian distribution (GGD) has been shown to be one of the most relevant distributions for characterizing the speckle in US images. Thus, we propose a GGD-Potts model defined by a label map coupling US image segmentation and deconvolution. The Bayesian estimators of the unknown model parameters, including the US image, the label map and all the hyperparameters are difficult to be expressed in closed form. Thus, we investigate a Gibbs sampler to generate samples distributed according to the posterior of interest. These generated samples are finally used to compute the Bayesian estimators of the unknown parameters. The performance of the proposed Bayesian model is compared with existing approaches via several experiments conducted on realistic synthetic data and in vivo US images."
Deep Visual-Semantic Alignments for Generating Image Descriptions,"We present a model that generates natural language descriptions of images and their regions. Our approach leverages datasets of images and their sentence descriptions to learn about the inter-modal correspondences between language and visual data. Our alignment model is based on a novel combination of Convolutional Neural Networks over image regions, bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks over sentences, and a structured objective that aligns the two modalities through a multimodal embedding. We then describe a Multimodal Recurrent Neural Network architecture that uses the inferred alignments to learn to generate novel descriptions of image regions. We demonstrate that our alignment model produces state of the art results in retrieval experiments on Flickr8K, Flickr30K and MSCOCO datasets. We then show that the generated descriptions significantly outperform retrieval baselines on both full images and on a new dataset of region-level annotations."
Color image quality assessment measure using multivariate generalized Gaussian distribution,"This paper deals with color image quality assessment in the reduced-reference framework based on natural scenes statistics. In this context, we propose to model the statistics of the steerable pyramid coefficients by a Multivariate Generalized Gaussian distribution (MGGD). This model allows taking into account the high correlation between the components of the RGB color space. For each selected scale and orientation, we extract a parameter matrix from the three color components subbands. In order to quantify the visual degradation, we use a closed-form of Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) between two MGGDs. Using ""TID 2008"" benchmark, the proposed measure has been compared with the most influential methods according to the FRTV1 VQEG framework. Results demonstrates its effectiveness for a great variety of distortion type. Among other benefits this measure uses only very little information about the original image."
Persistent Evidence of Local Image Properties in Generic ConvNets,"Supervised training of a convolutional network for object classification should make explicit any information related to the class of objects and disregard any auxiliary information associated with the capture of the image or the variation within the object class. Does this happen in practice? Although this seems to pertain to the very final layers in the network, if we look at earlier layers we find that this is not the case. Surprisingly, strong spatial information is implicit. This paper addresses this, in particular, exploiting the image representation at the first fully connected layer, i.e. the global image descriptor which has been recently shown to be most effective in a range of visual recognition tasks. We empirically demonstrate evidences for the finding in the contexts of four different tasks: 2d landmark detection, 2d object keypoints prediction, estimation of the RGB values of input image, and recovery of semantic label of each pixel. We base our investigation on a simple framework with ridge rigression commonly across these tasks, and show results which all support our insight. Such spatial information can be used for computing correspondence of landmarks to a good accuracy, but should potentially be useful for improving the training of the convolutional nets for classification purposes."
Learning a Recurrent Visual Representation for Image Caption Generation,"In this paper we explore the bi-directional mapping between images and their sentence-based descriptions. We propose learning this mapping using a recurrent neural network. Unlike previous approaches that map both sentences and images to a common embedding, we enable the generation of novel sentences given an image. Using the same model, we can also reconstruct the visual features associated with an image given its visual description. We use a novel recurrent visual memory that automatically learns to remember long-term visual concepts to aid in both sentence generation and visual feature reconstruction. We evaluate our approach on several tasks. These include sentence generation, sentence retrieval and image retrieval. State-of-the-art results are shown for the task of generating novel image descriptions. When compared to human generated captions, our automatically generated captions are preferred by humans over 19.8\% of the time. Results are better than or comparable to state-of-the-art results on the image and sentence retrieval tasks for methods using similar visual features."
Show and Tell: A Neural Image Caption Generator,"Automatically describing the content of an image is a fundamental problem in artificial intelligence that connects computer vision and natural language processing. In this paper, we present a generative model based on a deep recurrent architecture that combines recent advances in computer vision and machine translation and that can be used to generate natural sentences describing an image. The model is trained to maximize the likelihood of the target description sentence given the training image. Experiments on several datasets show the accuracy of the model and the fluency of the language it learns solely from image descriptions. Our model is often quite accurate, which we verify both qualitatively and quantitatively. For instance, while the current state-of-the-art BLEU-1 score (the higher the better) on the Pascal dataset is 25, our approach yields 59, to be compared to human performance around 69. We also show BLEU-1 score improvements on Flickr30k, from 56 to 66, and on SBU, from 19 to 28. Lastly, on the newly released COCO dataset, we achieve a BLEU-4 of 27.7, which is the current state-of-the-art."
A New Model of Array Grammar for generating Connected Patterns on an Image Neighborhood,Study of patterns on images is recognized as an important step in characterization and classification of image. The ability to efficiently analyze and describe image patterns is thus of fundamental importance. The study of syntactic methods of describing pictures has been of interest for researchers. Array Grammars can be used to represent and recognize connected patterns. In any image the patterns are recognized using connected patterns. It is very difficult to represent all connected patterns (CP) even on a small 3 x 3 neighborhood in a pictorial way. The present paper proposes the model of array grammar capable of generating any kind of simple or complex pattern and derivation of connected pattern in an image neighborhood using the proposed grammar is discussed.
Regression-Based Image Alignment for General Object Categories,"Gradient-descent methods have exhibited fast and reliable performance for image alignment in the facial domain, but have largely been ignored by the broader vision community. They require the image function be smooth and (numerically) differentiable -- properties that hold for pixel-based representations obeying natural image statistics, but not for more general classes of non-linear feature transforms. We show that transforms such as Dense SIFT can be incorporated into a Lucas Kanade alignment framework by predicting descent directions via regression. This enables robust matching of instances from general object categories whilst maintaining desirable properties of Lucas Kanade such as the capacity to handle high-dimensional warp parametrizations and a fast rate of convergence. We present alignment results on a number of objects from ImageNet, and an extension of the method to unsupervised joint alignment of objects from a corpus of images."
Automated Generation of Geometric Theorems from Images of Diagrams,We propose an approach to generate geometric theorems from electronic images of diagrams automatically. The approach makes use of techniques of Hough transform to recognize geometric objects and their labels and of numeric verification to mine basic geometric relations. Candidate propositions are generated from the retrieved information by using six strategies and geometric theorems are obtained from the candidates via algebraic computation. Experiments with a preliminary implementation illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach for generating nontrivial theorems from images of diagrams. This work demonstrates the feasibility of automated discovery of profound geometric knowledge from simple image data and has potential applications in geometric knowledge management and education.
Sequentially Generated Instance-Dependent Image Representations for Classification,"In this paper, we investigate a new framework for image classification that adaptively generates spatial representations. Our strategy is based on a sequential process that learns to explore the different regions of any image in order to infer its category. In particular, the choice of regions is specific to each image, directed by the actual content of previously selected regions.The capacity of the system to handle incomplete image information as well as its adaptive region selection allow the system to perform well in budgeted classification tasks by exploiting a dynamicly generated representation of each image. We demonstrate the system's abilities in a series of image-based exploration and classification tasks that highlight its learned exploration and inference abilities."
Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping and Probabilistic Atlas Generation of Hybrid Diffusion Imaging based on BFOR Signal Basis,"We propose a large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping algorithm to align multiple b-value diffusion weighted imaging (mDWI) data, specifically acquired via hybrid diffusion imaging (HYDI), denoted as LDDMM-HYDI. We then propose a Bayesian model for estimating the white matter atlas from HYDIs. We adopt the work given in Hosseinbor et al. (2012) and represent the q-space diffusion signal with the Bessel Fourier orientation reconstruction (BFOR) signal basis. The BFOR framework provides the representation of mDWI in the q-space and thus reduces memory requirement. In addition, since the BFOR signal basis is orthonormal, the L2 norm that quantifies the differences in the q-space signals of any two mDWI datasets can be easily computed as the sum of the squared differences in the BFOR expansion coefficients. In this work, we show that the reorientation of the q-space signal due to spatial transformation can be easily defined on the BFOR signal basis. We incorporate the BFOR signal basis into the LDDMM framework and derive the gradient descent algorithm for LDDMM-HYDI with explicit orientation optimization. Additionally, we extend the previous Bayesian atlas estimation framework for scalar-valued images to HYDIs and derive the expectation-maximization algorithm for solving the HYDI atlas estimation problem. Using real HYDI datasets, we show the Bayesian model generates the white matter atlas with anatomical details. Moreover, we show that it is important to consider the variation of mDWI reorientation due to a small change in diffeomorphic transformation in the LDDMM-HYDI optimization and to incorporate the full information of HYDI for aligning mDWI."
Generic Image Classification Approaches Excel on Face Recognition,"The main finding of this work is that the standard image classification pipeline, which consists of dictionary learning, feature encoding, spatial pyramid pooling and linear classification, outperforms all state-of-the-art face recognition methods on the tested benchmark datasets (we have tested on AR, Extended Yale B, the challenging FERET, and LFW-a datasets). This surprising and prominent result suggests that those advances in generic image classification can be directly applied to improve face recognition systems. In other words, face recognition may not need to be viewed as a separate object classification problem.  While recently a large body of residual based face recognition methods focus on developing complex dictionary learning algorithms, in this work we show that a dictionary of randomly extracted patches (even from non-face images) can achieve very promising results using the image classification pipeline. That means, the choice of dictionary learning methods may not be important. Instead, we find that learning multiple dictionaries using different low-level image features often improve the final classification accuracy. Our proposed face recognition approach offers the best reported results on the widely-used face recognition benchmark datasets. In particular, on the challenging FERET and LFW-a datasets, we improve the best reported accuracies in the literature by about 20% and 30% respectively."
Approximate Bayesian Image Interpretation using Generative Probabilistic Graphics Programs,"The idea of computer vision as the Bayesian inverse problem to computer graphics has a long history and an appealing elegance, but it has proved difficult to directly implement. Instead, most vision tasks are approached via complex bottom-up processing pipelines. Here we show that it is possible to write short, simple probabilistic graphics programs that define flexible generative models and to automatically invert them to interpret real-world images. Generative probabilistic graphics programs consist of a stochastic scene generator, a renderer based on graphics software, a stochastic likelihood model linking the renderer's output and the data, and latent variables that adjust the fidelity of the renderer and the tolerance of the likelihood model. Representations and algorithms from computer graphics, originally designed to produce high-quality images, are instead used as the deterministic backbone for highly approximate and stochastic generative models. This formulation combines probabilistic programming, computer graphics, and approximate Bayesian computation, and depends only on general-purpose, automatic inference techniques. We describe two applications: reading sequences of degraded and adversarially obscured alphanumeric characters, and inferring 3D road models from vehicle-mounted camera images. Each of the probabilistic graphics programs we present relies on under 20 lines of probabilistic code, and supports accurate, approximately Bayesian inferences about ambiguous real-world images."
Generic System Verilog Universal Verification Methodology based Reusable Verification Environment for Efficient Verification of Image Signal Processing IPs/SoCs,"In this paper,we present Generic System Verilog Universal Verification Methodology based Reusable Verification Environment for efficient verification of Image Signal Processing IP's/SoC's. With the tight schedules on all projects it is important to have a strong verification methodology which contributes to First Silicon Success. Deploy methodologies which enforce full functional coverage and verification of corner cases through pseudo random test scenarios is required. Also, standardization of verification flow is needed. Previously, inside imaging group of ST, Specman (e)/Verilog based Verification Environment for IP/Subsystem level verification and C/C++/Verilog based Directed Verification Environment for SoC Level Verification was used for Functional Verification. Different Verification Environments were used at IP level and SoC level. Different Verification/Validation Methodologies were used for SoC Verification across multiple sites. Verification teams were also looking for the ways how to catch bugs early in the design cycle? Thus, Generic System Verilog Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) based Reusable Verification Environment is required to avoid the problem of having so many methodologies and provides a standard unified solution which compiles on all tools. The main aim of development of this Generic and automatic verification environment is to develop an efficient and unified verification environment (at IP/Subsystem/SoC Level) which reuses the already developed Verification components and also sequences written at IP/Subsystem level can be reused at SoC Level both with Host BFM and actual Core using Incisive Software Extension (ISX) and Virtual Register Interface (VRI)/Verification Abstraction Layer (VAL) approaches. IP-XACT based tools are used for automatically configuring the environment for various imaging IPs/SoCs."
Writing Reusable Digital Geometry Algorithms in a Generic Image Processing Framework,"Digital Geometry software should reflect the generality of the underlying mathe- matics: mapping the latter to the former requires genericity. By designing generic solutions, one can effectively reuse digital geometry data structures and algorithms. We propose an image processing framework focused on the Generic Programming paradigm in which an algorithm on the paper can be turned into a single code, written once and usable with various input types. This approach enables users to design and implement new methods at a lower cost, try cross-domain experiments and help generalize results"
Image encryption schemes for JPEG and GIF formats based on 3D baker with compound chaotic sequence generator,"This paper proposed several methods to transplant the compound chaotic image encryption scheme with permutation based on 3D baker into image formats as Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) and Graphics Interchange Format (GIF). The new method averts the lossy Discrete Cosine Transform and quantization and can encrypt and decrypt JPEG images lossless. Our proposed method for GIF keeps the property of animation successfully. The security test results indicate the proposed methods have high security. Since JPEG and GIF image formats are popular contemporarily, this paper shows that the prospect of chaotic image encryption is promising."
Stego-Image Generator (SIG) - Building Steganography Image Database,"Any Universal Steganalysis algorithm developed should be tested with various stego-images to prove its efficiency. This work is aimed to build the stego-image database which is obtained by implementing various RGB Least Significant Bit Steganographic algorithms. Though there are many stego-images sources available on the internet it lacks in the information such as how many rows has been infected by the steganography algorithms, how many bits have been modified and which channel has been affected. These parameters are important for Steganalysis algorithms and it helps to rate its efficiency. Images are chosen from board categories such as animals, nature, person to produce variety of Stego-Image."
Hybrid Generative/Discriminative Learning for Automatic Image Annotation,"Automatic image annotation (AIA) raises tremendous challenges to machine learning as it requires modeling of data that are both ambiguous in input and output, e.g., images containing multiple objects and labeled with multiple semantic tags. Even more challenging is that the number of candidate tags is usually huge (as large as the vocabulary size) yet each image is only related to a few of them. This paper presents a hybrid generative-discriminative classifier to simultaneously address the extreme data-ambiguity and overfitting-vulnerability issues in tasks such as AIA. Particularly: (1) an Exponential-Multinomial Mixture (EMM) model is established to capture both the input and output ambiguity and in the meanwhile to encourage prediction sparsity; and (2) the prediction ability of the EMM model is explicitly maximized through discriminative learning that integrates variational inference of graphical models and the pairwise formulation of ordinal regression. Experiments show that our approach achieves both superior annotation performance and better tag scalability."
Generalized Boundaries from Multiple Image Interpretations,"Boundary detection is essential for a variety of computer vision tasks such as segmentation and recognition. In this paper we propose a unified formulation and a novel algorithm that are applicable to the detection of different types of boundaries, such as intensity edges, occlusion boundaries or object category specific boundaries. Our formulation leads to a simple method with state-of-the-art performance and significantly lower computational cost than existing methods. We evaluate our algorithm on different types of boundaries, from low-level boundaries extracted in natural images, to occlusion boundaries obtained using motion cues and RGB-D cameras, to boundaries from soft-segmentation. We also propose a novel method for figure/ground soft-segmentation that can be used in conjunction with our boundary detection method and improve its accuracy at almost no extra computational cost."
An efficient FPGA implementation of MRI image filtering and tumor characterization using Xilinx system generator,"This paper presents an efficient architecture for various image filtering algorithms and tumor characterization using Xilinx System Generator (XSG). This architecture offers an alternative through a graphical user interface that combines MATLAB, Simulink and XSG and explores important aspects concerned to hardware implementation. Performance of this architecture implemented in SPARTAN-3E Starter kit (XC3S500E-FG320) exceeds those of similar or greater resources architectures. The proposed architecture reduces the resources available on target device by 50%."
A Novel Chaotic Image Encryption using Generalized Threshold Function,"In this paper, after reviewing the main points of image encryption and threshold function, we introduce the methods of chaotic image encryption based on pseudorandom bit padding that the bits be generated by the novel generalized threshold function (segmentation and self-similarity) methods. These methods decrease periodic effect of the ergodic dynamical systems in randomness of the chaotic image encryption. The essential idea of this paper is that given threshold functions of the ergodic dynamical systems. To evaluate the security of the cipher image of this scheme, the key space analysis, the correlation of two adjacent pixels and differential attack were performed. This scheme tries to improve the problem of failure of encryption such as small key space and level of security."
Face Synthesis (FASY) System for Generation of a Face Image from Human Description,"This paper aims at generating a new face based on the human like description using a new concept. The FASY (FAce SYnthesis) System is a Face Database Retrieval and new Face generation System that is under development. One of its main features is the generation of the requested face when it is not found in the existing database, which allows a continuous growing of the database also."
The generating of Fractal Images Using MathCAD Program,This paper presents the graphic representation in the z-plane of the first three iterations of the algorithm that generates the Sierpinski Gasket. It analyzes the influence of the f(z) map when we represent fractal images.
Extraction of cartographic objects in high resolution satellite images for object model generation,"The aim of this study is to detect man-made cartographic objects in high-resolution satellite images. New generation satellites offer a sub-metric spatial resolution, in which it is possible (and necessary) to develop methods at object level rather than at pixel level, and to exploit structural features of objects. With this aim, a method to generate structural object models from manually segmented images has been developed. To generate the model from non-segmented images, extraction of the objects from the sample images is required. A hybrid method of extraction (both in terms of input sources and segmentation algorithms) is proposed: A region based segmentation is applied on a 10 meter resolution multi-spectral image. The result is used as marker in a ""marker-controlled watershed method using edges"" on a 2.5 meter resolution panchromatic image. Very promising results have been obtained even on images where the limits of the target objects are not apparent."
A Codebook Generation Algorithm for Document Image Compression,"Pattern-matching-based document-compression systems (e.g. for faxing) rely on finding a small set of patterns that can be used to represent all of the ink in the document. Finding an optimal set of patterns is NP-hard; previous compression schemes have resorted to heuristics. This paper describes an extension of the cross-entropy approach, used previously for measuring pattern similarity, to this problem. This approach reduces the problem to a k-medians problem, for which the paper gives a new algorithm with a provably good performance guarantee. In comparison to previous heuristics (First Fit, with and without generalized Lloyd's/k-means postprocessing steps), the new algorithm generates a better codebook, resulting in an overall improvement in compression performance of almost 17%."
General Theory of Image Normalization,"We give a systematic, abstract formulation of the image normalization method as applied to a general group of image transformations, and then illustrate the abstract analysis by applying it to the hierarchy of viewing transformations of a planar object."
