Neural Natural Language Processing for Long Texts: A Survey of the State-of-the-Art,"The adoption of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has greatly benefited Natural Language Processing (NLP) during the past decade. However, the demands of long documents analysis are quite different from those of shorter texts, with the ever increasing size of documents uploaded online rendering NLP on long documents a critical area of research. This paper surveys the current state-of-the-art in the domain, overviewing the relevant neural building blocks and subsequently focusing on two main NLP tasks: Document Classification, Summarization as well as mentioning uses in Sentiment Analysis. We detail the challenges, issues and current solutions related to long-document NLP. We also list publicly available, labelled, long-document datasets used in current research."
Exploring Sentiment Analysis Techniques in Natural Language Processing: A Comprehensive Review,"Sentiment analysis (SA) is the automated process of detecting and understanding the emotions conveyed through written text. Over the past decade, SA has gained significant popularity in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). With the widespread use of social media and online platforms, SA has become crucial for companies to gather customer feedback and shape their marketing strategies. Additionally, researchers rely on SA to analyze public sentiment on various topics. In this particular research study, a comprehensive survey was conducted to explore the latest trends and techniques in SA. The survey encompassed a wide range of methods, including lexicon-based, graph-based, network-based, machine learning, deep learning, ensemble-based, rule-based, and hybrid techniques. The paper also addresses the challenges and opportunities in SA, such as dealing with sarcasm and irony, analyzing multi-lingual data, and addressing ethical concerns. To provide a practical case study, Twitter was chosen as one of the largest online social media platforms. Furthermore, the researchers shed light on the diverse application areas of SA, including social media, healthcare, marketing, finance, and politics. The paper also presents a comparative and comprehensive analysis of existing trends and techniques, datasets, and evaluation metrics. The ultimate goal is to offer researchers and practitioners a systematic review of SA techniques, identify existing gaps, and suggest possible improvements. This study aims to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of SA processes, leading to smoother and error-free outcomes."
GlobalBench: A Benchmark for Global Progress in Natural Language Processing,"Despite the major advances in NLP, significant disparities in NLP system performance across languages still exist. Arguably, these are due to uneven resource allocation and sub-optimal incentives to work on less resourced languages. To track and further incentivize the global development of equitable language technology, we introduce GlobalBench. Prior multilingual benchmarks are static and have focused on a limited number of tasks and languages. In contrast, GlobalBench is an ever-expanding collection that aims to dynamically track progress on all NLP datasets in all languages. Rather than solely measuring accuracy, GlobalBench also tracks the estimated per-speaker utility and equity of technology across all languages, providing a multi-faceted view of how language technology is serving people of the world. Furthermore, GlobalBench is designed to identify the most under-served languages, and rewards research efforts directed towards those languages. At present, the most under-served languages are the ones with a relatively high population, but nonetheless overlooked by composite multilingual benchmarks (like Punjabi, Portuguese, and Wu Chinese). Currently, GlobalBench covers 966 datasets in 190 languages, and has 1,128 system submissions spanning 62 languages."
Process-To-Text: A Framework for the Quantitative Description of Processes in Natural Language,"In this paper we present the Process-To-Text (P2T) framework for the automatic generation of textual descriptive explanations of processes. P2T integrates three AI paradigms: process mining for extracting temporal and structural information from a process, fuzzy linguistic protoforms for modelling uncertain terms, and natural language generation for building the explanations. A real use-case in the cardiology domain is presented, showing the potential of P2T for providing natural language explanations addressed to specialists."
Detecting automatically the layout of clinical documents to enhance the performances of downstream natural language processing,"Objective:Develop and validate an algorithm for analyzing the layout of PDF clinical documents to improve the performance of downstream natural language processing tasks. Materials and Methods: We designed an algorithm to process clinical PDF documents and extract only clinically relevant text. The algorithm consists of several steps: initial text extraction using a PDF parser, followed by classification into categories such as body text, left notes, and footers using a Transformer deep neural network architecture, and finally an aggregation step to compile the lines of a given label in the text. We evaluated the technical performance of the body text extraction algorithm by applying it to a random sample of documents that were annotated. Medical performance was evaluated by examining the extraction of medical concepts of interest from the text in their respective sections. Finally, we tested an end-to-end system on a medical use case of automatic detection of acute infection described in the hospital report. Results:Our algorithm achieved per-line precision, recall, and F1 score of 98.4, 97.0, and 97.7, respectively, for body line extraction. The precision, recall, and F1 score per document for the acute infection detection algorithm were 82.54 (95CI 72.86-91.60), 85.24 (95CI 76.61-93.70), 83.87 (95CI 76, 92-90.08) with exploitation of the results of the advanced body extraction algorithm, respectively. Conclusion:We have developed and validated a system for extracting body text from clinical documents in PDF format by identifying their layout. We were able to demonstrate that this preprocessing allowed us to obtain better performances for a common downstream task, i.e., the extraction of medical concepts in their respective sections, thus proving the interest of this method on a clinical use case."
Interactive Natural Language Processing,"Interactive Natural Language Processing (iNLP) has emerged as a novel paradigm within the field of NLP, aimed at addressing limitations in existing frameworks while aligning with the ultimate goals of artificial intelligence. This paradigm considers language models as agents capable of observing, acting, and receiving feedback iteratively from external entities. Specifically, language models in this context can: (1) interact with humans for better understanding and addressing user needs, personalizing responses, aligning with human values, and improving the overall user experience; (2) interact with knowledge bases for enriching language representations with factual knowledge, enhancing the contextual relevance of responses, and dynamically leveraging external information to generate more accurate and informed responses; (3) interact with models and tools for effectively decomposing and addressing complex tasks, leveraging specialized expertise for specific subtasks, and fostering the simulation of social behaviors; and (4) interact with environments for learning grounded representations of language, and effectively tackling embodied tasks such as reasoning, planning, and decision-making in response to environmental observations. This paper offers a comprehensive survey of iNLP, starting by proposing a unified definition and framework of the concept. We then provide a systematic classification of iNLP, dissecting its various components, including interactive objects, interaction interfaces, and interaction methods. We proceed to delve into the evaluation methodologies used in the field, explore its diverse applications, scrutinize its ethical and safety issues, and discuss prospective research directions. This survey serves as an entry point for researchers who are interested in this rapidly evolving area and offers a broad view of the current landscape and future trajectory of iNLP."
Word differences in news media of lower and higher peace countries revealed by natural language processing and machine learning,"Language is both a cause and a consequence of the social processes that lead to conflict or peace. Hate speech can mobilize violence and destruction. What are the characteristics of peace speech that reflect and support the social processes that maintain peace? This study used existing peace indices, machine learning, and on-line, news media sources to identify the words most associated with lower-peace versus higher-peace countries. As each peace index measures different social properties, there is little consensus on the numerical values of these indices. There is however greater consensus with these indices for the countries that are at the extremes of lower-peace and higher-peace. Therefore, a data driven approach was used to find the words most important in distinguishing lower-peace and higher-peace countries. Rather than assuming a theoretical framework that predicts which words are more likely in lower-peace and higher-peace countries, and then searching for those words in news media, in this study, natural language processing and machine learning were used to identify the words that most accurately classified a country as lower-peace or higher-peace. Once the machine learning model was trained on the word frequencies from the extreme lower-peace and higher-peace countries, that model was also used to compute a quantitative peace index for these and other intermediate-peace countries. The model successfully yielded a quantitative peace index for intermediate-peace countries that was in between that of the lower-peace and higher-peace, even though they were not in the training set. This study demonstrates how natural language processing and machine learning can help to generate new quantitative measures of social systems, which in this study, were linguistic differences resulting in a quantitative index of peace for countries at different levels of peacefulness."
NoisywikiHow: A Benchmark for Learning with Real-world Noisy Labels in Natural Language Processing,"Large-scale datasets in the real world inevitably involve label noise. Deep models can gradually overfit noisy labels and thus degrade model generalization. To mitigate the effects of label noise, learning with noisy labels (LNL) methods are designed to achieve better generalization performance. Due to the lack of suitable datasets, previous studies have frequently employed synthetic label noise to mimic real-world label noise. However, synthetic noise is not instance-dependent, making this approximation not always effective in practice. Recent research has proposed benchmarks for learning with real-world noisy labels. However, the noise sources within may be single or fuzzy, making benchmarks different from data with heterogeneous label noises in the real world. To tackle these issues, we contribute NoisywikiHow, the largest NLP benchmark built with minimal supervision. Specifically, inspired by human cognition, we explicitly construct multiple sources of label noise to imitate human errors throughout the annotation, replicating real-world noise, whose corruption is affected by both ground-truth labels and instances. Moreover, we provide a variety of noise levels to support controlled experiments on noisy data, enabling us to evaluate LNL methods systematically and comprehensively. After that, we conduct extensive multi-dimensional experiments on a broad range of LNL methods, obtaining new and intriguing findings."
Fuzzy Temporal Protoforms for the Quantitative Description of Processes in Natural Language,"In this paper, we propose a series of fuzzy temporal protoforms in the framework of the automatic generation of quantitative and qualitative natural language descriptions of processes. The model includes temporal and causal information from processes and attributes, quantifies attributes in time during the process life-span and recalls causal relations and temporal distances between events, among other features. Through integrating process mining techniques and fuzzy sets within the usual Data-to-Text architecture, our framework is able to extract relevant quantitative temporal as well as structural information from a process and describe it in natural language involving uncertain terms. A real use-case in the cardiology domain is presented, showing the potential of our model for providing natural language explanations addressed to domain experts."
Putting Natural in Natural Language Processing,"Human language is firstly spoken and only secondarily written. Text, however, is a very convenient and efficient representation of language, and modern civilization has made it ubiquitous. Thus the field of NLP has overwhelmingly focused on processing written rather than spoken language. Work on spoken language, on the other hand, has been siloed off within the largely separate speech processing community which has been inordinately preoccupied with transcribing speech into text. Recent advances in deep learning have led to a fortuitous convergence in methods between speech processing and mainstream NLP. Arguably, the time is ripe for a unification of these two fields, and for starting to take spoken language seriously as the primary mode of human communication. Truly natural language processing could lead to better integration with the rest of language science and could lead to systems which are more data-efficient and more human-like, and which can communicate beyond the textual modality."
Beyond Rule-based Named Entity Recognition and Relation Extraction for Process Model Generation from Natural Language Text,"Automated generation of business process models from natural language text is an emerging methodology for avoiding the manual creation of formal business process models. For this purpose, process entities like actors, activities, objects etc., and relations among them are extracted from textual process descriptions. A high-quality annotated corpus of textual process descriptions (PET) has been published accompanied with a basic process extraction approach. In its current state, however, PET lacks information about whether two mentions refer to the same or different process entities, which corresponds to the crucial decision of whether to create one or two modeling elements in the target model. Consequently, it is ambiguous whether, for instance, two mentions of data processing mean processing of different, or the same data. In this paper, we extend the PET dataset by clustering mentions of process entities and by proposing a new baseline technique for process extraction equipped with an additional entity resolution component. In a second step, we replace the rule-based relation extraction component with a machine learning-based alternative, enabling rapid adaption to different datasets and domains. In addition, we evaluate a deep learning-approach built for solving entity and relation extraction as well as entity resolution in a holistic manner. Finally, our extensive evaluation of the original PET baseline against our own implementation shows that a pure machine learning-based process extraction technique is competitive, while avoiding the massive overhead arising from feature engineering and rule definition needed to adapt to other datasets, different entity and relation types, or new domains."
Training Natural Language Processing Models on Encrypted Text for Enhanced Privacy,"With the increasing use of cloud-based services for training and deploying machine learning models, data privacy has become a major concern. This is particularly important for natural language processing (NLP) models, which often process sensitive information such as personal communications and confidential documents. In this study, we propose a method for training NLP models on encrypted text data to mitigate data privacy concerns while maintaining similar performance to models trained on non-encrypted data. We demonstrate our method using two different architectures, namely Doc2Vec+XGBoost and Doc2Vec+LSTM, and evaluate the models on the 20 Newsgroups dataset. Our results indicate that both encrypted and non-encrypted models achieve comparable performance, suggesting that our encryption method is effective in preserving data privacy without sacrificing model accuracy. In order to replicate our experiments, we have provided a Colab notebook at the following address: https://t.ly/lR-TP"
Online Gesture Recognition using Transformer and Natural Language Processing,"The Transformer architecture is shown to provide a powerful machine transduction framework for online handwritten gestures corresponding to glyph strokes of natural language sentences. The attention mechanism is successfully used to create latent representations of an end-to-end encoder-decoder model, solving multi-level segmentation while also learning some language features and syntax rules. The additional use of a large decoding space with some learned Byte-Pair-Encoding (BPE) is shown to provide robustness to ablated inputs and syntax rules. The encoder stack was directly fed with spatio-temporal data tokens potentially forming an infinitely large input vocabulary, an approach that finds applications beyond that of this work. Encoder transfer learning capabilities is also demonstrated on several languages resulting in faster optimisation and shared parameters. A new supervised dataset of online handwriting gestures suitable for generic handwriting recognition tasks was used to successfully train a small transformer model to an average normalised Levenshtein accuracy of 96% on English or German sentences and 94% in French."
Gpt-4: A Review on Advancements and Opportunities in Natural Language Processing,"Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) is the fourth-generation language model in the GPT series, developed by OpenAI, which promises significant advancements in the field of natural language processing (NLP). In this research article, we have discussed the features of GPT-4, its potential applications, and the challenges that it might face. We have also compared GPT-4 with its predecessor, GPT-3. GPT-4 has a larger model size (more than one trillion), better multilingual capabilities, improved contextual understanding, and reasoning capabilities than GPT-3. Some of the potential applications of GPT-4 include chatbots, personal assistants, language translation, text summarization, and question-answering. However, GPT-4 poses several challenges and limitations such as computational requirements, data requirements, and ethical concerns."
The Elephant in the Room: Analyzing the Presence of Big Tech in Natural Language Processing Research,"Recent advances in deep learning methods for natural language processing (NLP) have created new business opportunities and made NLP research critical for industry development. As one of the big players in the field of NLP, together with governments and universities, it is important to track the influence of industry on research. In this study, we seek to quantify and characterize industry presence in the NLP community over time. Using a corpus with comprehensive metadata of 78,187 NLP publications and 701 resumes of NLP publication authors, we explore the industry presence in the field since the early 90s. We find that industry presence among NLP authors has been steady before a steep increase over the past five years (180% growth from 2017 to 2022). A few companies account for most of the publications and provide funding to academic researchers through grants and internships. Our study shows that the presence and impact of the industry on natural language processing research are significant and fast-growing. This work calls for increased transparency of industry influence in the field."
Natural language processing on customer note data,"Automatic analysis of customer data for businesses is an area that is of interest to companies. Business to business data is studied rarely in academia due to the sensitive nature of such information. Applying natural language processing can speed up the analysis of prohibitively large sets of data. This paper addresses this subject and applies sentiment analysis, topic modelling and keyword extraction to a B2B data set. We show that accurate sentiment can be extracted from the notes automatically and the notes can be sorted by relevance into different topics. We see that without clear separation topics can lack relevance to a business context."
Lessons Learned from a Citizen Science Project for Natural Language Processing,"Many Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems use annotated corpora for training and evaluation. However, labeled data is often costly to obtain and scaling annotation projects is difficult, which is why annotation tasks are often outsourced to paid crowdworkers. Citizen Science is an alternative to crowdsourcing that is relatively unexplored in the context of NLP. To investigate whether and how well Citizen Science can be applied in this setting, we conduct an exploratory study into engaging different groups of volunteers in Citizen Science for NLP by re-annotating parts of a pre-existing crowdsourced dataset. Our results show that this can yield high-quality annotations and attract motivated volunteers, but also requires considering factors such as scalability, participation over time, and legal and ethical issues. We summarize lessons learned in the form of guidelines and provide our code and data to aid future work on Citizen Science."
Semantic Tokenizer for Enhanced Natural Language Processing,"Traditionally, NLP performance improvement has been focused on improving models and increasing the number of model parameters. NLP vocabulary construction has remained focused on maximizing the number of words represented through subword regularization. We present a novel tokenizer that uses semantics to drive vocabulary construction. The tokenizer includes a trainer that uses stemming to enhance subword formation. Further optimizations and adaptations are implemented to minimize the number of words that cannot be encoded. The encoder is updated to integrate with the trainer. The tokenizer is implemented as a drop-in replacement for the SentencePiece tokenizer. The new tokenizer more than doubles the number of wordforms represented in the vocabulary. The enhanced vocabulary significantly improves NLP model convergence, and improves quality of word and sentence embeddings. Our experimental results show top performance on two Glue tasks using BERT-base, improving on models more than 50X in size."
Bridging Natural Language Processing and Psycholinguistics: computationally grounded semantic similarity datasets for Basque and Spanish,"We present a computationally-grounded word similarity dataset based on two well-known Natural Language Processing resources; text corpora and knowledge bases. This dataset aims to fulfil a gap in psycholinguistic research by providing a variety of quantifications of semantic similarity in an extensive set of noun pairs controlled by variables that play a significant role in lexical processing. The dataset creation has consisted in three steps, 1) computing four key psycholinguistic features for each noun; concreteness, frequency, semantic and phonological neighbourhood density; 2) pairing nouns across these four variables; 3) for each noun pair, assigning three types of word similarity measurements, computed out of text, Wordnet and hybrid embeddings. The present dataset includes noun pairs' information in Basque and European Spanish, but further work intends to extend it to more languages."
Use of social media and Natural Language Processing (NLP) in natural hazard research,"Twitter is a microblogging service for sending short, public text messages (tweets) that has recently received more attention in scientific comunity. In the works of Sasaki et al. (2010) and Earle et al., (2011) the authors explored the real-time interaction on Twitter for detecting natural hazards (e.g., earthquakes, typhoons) baed on users' tweets. An inherent challenge for such an application is the natural language processing (NLP), which basically consists in converting the words in number (vectors and tensors) in order to (mathematically/ computationally) make predictions and classifications. Recently advanced computational tools have been made available for dealing with text computationally. In this report we implement a NLP machine learning with TensorFlow, an end-to-end open source plataform for machine learning applications, to process and classify evenct based on files containing only text."
Thorny Roses: Investigating the Dual Use Dilemma in Natural Language Processing,"Dual use, the intentional, harmful reuse of technology and scientific artefacts, is a problem yet to be well-defined within the context of Natural Language Processing (NLP). However, as NLP technologies continue to advance and become increasingly widespread in society, their inner workings have become increasingly opaque. Therefore, understanding dual use concerns and potential ways of limiting them is critical to minimising the potential harms of research and development. In this paper, we conduct a survey of NLP researchers and practitioners to understand the depth and their perspective of the problem as well as to assess existing available support. Based on the results of our survey, we offer a definition of dual use that is tailored to the needs of the NLP community. The survey revealed that a majority of researchers are concerned about the potential dual use of their research but only take limited action toward it. In light of the survey results, we discuss the current state and potential means for mitigating dual use in NLP and propose a checklist that can be integrated into existing conference ethics-frameworks, e.g., the ACL ethics checklist."
A Survey of Resources and Methods for Natural Language Processing of Serbian Language,"The Serbian language is a Slavic language spoken by over 12 million speakers and well understood by over 15 million people. In the area of natural language processing, it can be considered a low-resourced language. Also, Serbian is considered a high-inflectional language. The combination of many word inflections and low availability of language resources makes natural language processing of Serbian challenging. Nevertheless, over the past three decades, there have been a number of initiatives to develop resources and methods for natural language processing of Serbian, ranging from developing a corpus of free text from books and the internet, annotated corpora for classification and named entity recognition tasks to various methods and models performing these tasks. In this paper, we review the initiatives, resources, methods, and their availability."

"Unlocking the Potential of ChatGPT: A Comprehensive Exploration of its Applications, Advantages, Limitations, and Future Directions in Natural Language Processing","Large language models have revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence and have been used in various applications. Among these models, ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer) has been developed by OpenAI, it stands out as a powerful tool that has been widely adopted. ChatGPT has been successfully applied in numerous areas, including chatbots, content generation, language translation, personalized recommendations, and even medical diagnosis and treatment. Its success in these applications can be attributed to its ability to generate human-like responses, understand natural language, and adapt to different contexts. Its versatility and accuracy make it a powerful tool for natural language processing (NLP). However, there are also limitations to ChatGPT, such as its tendency to produce biased responses and its potential to perpetuate harmful language patterns. This article provides a comprehensive overview of ChatGPT, its applications, advantages, and limitations. Additionally, the paper emphasizes the importance of ethical considerations when using this robust tool in real-world scenarios. Finally, This paper contributes to ongoing discussions surrounding artificial intelligence and its impact on vision and NLP domains by providing insights into prompt engineering techniques."
Identifying Mentions of Pain in Mental Health Records Text: A Natural Language Processing Approach,"Pain is a common reason for accessing healthcare resources and is a growing area of research, especially in its overlap with mental health. Mental health electronic health records are a good data source to study this overlap. However, much information on pain is held in the free text of these records, where mentions of pain present a unique natural language processing problem due to its ambiguous nature. This project uses data from an anonymised mental health electronic health records database. The data are used to train a machine learning based classification algorithm to classify sentences as discussing patient pain or not. This will facilitate the extraction of relevant pain information from large databases, and the use of such outputs for further studies on pain and mental health. 1,985 documents were manually triple-annotated for creation of gold standard training data, which was used to train three commonly used classification algorithms. The best performing model achieved an F1-score of 0.98 (95% CI 0.98-0.99)."
ScandEval: A Benchmark for Scandinavian Natural Language Processing,"This paper introduces a Scandinavian benchmarking platform, ScandEval, which can benchmark any pretrained model on four different tasks in the Scandinavian languages. The datasets used in two of the tasks, linguistic acceptability and question answering, are new. We develop and release a Python package and command-line interface, scandeval, which can benchmark any model that has been uploaded to the Hugging Face Hub, with reproducible results. Using this package, we benchmark more than 100 Scandinavian or multilingual models and present the results of these in an interactive online leaderboard, as well as provide an analysis of the results. The analysis shows that there is substantial cross-lingual transfer among the Mainland Scandinavian languages (Danish, Swedish and Norwegian), with limited cross-lingual transfer between the group of Mainland Scandinavian languages and the group of Insular Scandinavian languages (Icelandic and Faroese). The benchmarking results also show that the investment in language technology in Norway, Sweden and Denmark has led to language models that outperform massively multilingual models such as XLM-RoBERTa and mDeBERTaV3. We release the source code for both the package and leaderboard."
Extracting Thyroid Nodules Characteristics from Ultrasound Reports Using Transformer-based Natural Language Processing Methods,"The ultrasound characteristics of thyroid nodules guide the evaluation of thyroid cancer in patients with thyroid nodules. However, the characteristics of thyroid nodules are often documented in clinical narratives such as ultrasound reports. Previous studies have examined natural language processing (NLP) methods in extracting a limited number of characteristics (<9) using rule-based NLP systems. In this study, a multidisciplinary team of NLP experts and thyroid specialists, identified thyroid nodule characteristics that are important for clinical care, composed annotation guidelines, developed a corpus, and compared 5 state-of-the-art transformer-based NLP methods, including BERT, RoBERTa, LongFormer, DeBERTa, and GatorTron, for extraction of thyroid nodule characteristics from ultrasound reports. Our GatorTron model, a transformer-based large language model trained using over 90 billion words of text, achieved the best strict and lenient F1-score of 0.8851 and 0.9495 for the extraction of a total number of 16 thyroid nodule characteristics, and 0.9321 for linking characteristics to nodules, outperforming other clinical transformer models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically categorize and apply transformer-based NLP models to extract a large number of clinical relevant thyroid nodule characteristics from ultrasound reports. This study lays ground for assessing the documentation quality of thyroid ultrasound reports and examining outcomes of patients with thyroid nodules using electronic health records."
Identifying Symptoms of Delirium from Clinical Narratives Using Natural Language Processing,"Delirium is an acute decline or fluctuation in attention, awareness, or other cognitive function that can lead to serious adverse outcomes. Despite the severe outcomes, delirium is frequently unrecognized and uncoded in patients' electronic health records (EHRs) due to its transient and diverse nature. Natural language processing (NLP), a key technology that extracts medical concepts from clinical narratives, has shown great potential in studies of delirium outcomes and symptoms. To assist in the diagnosis and phenotyping of delirium, we formed an expert panel to categorize diverse delirium symptoms, composed annotation guidelines, created a delirium corpus with diverse delirium symptoms, and developed NLP methods to extract delirium symptoms from clinical notes. We compared 5 state-of-the-art transformer models including 2 models (BERT and RoBERTa) from the general domain and 3 models (BERT_MIMIC, RoBERTa_MIMIC, and GatorTron) from the clinical domain. GatorTron achieved the best strict and lenient F1 scores of 0.8055 and 0.8759, respectively. We conducted an error analysis to identify challenges in annotating delirium symptoms and developing NLP systems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large language model-based delirium symptom extraction system. Our study lays the foundation for the future development of computable phenotypes and diagnosis methods for delirium."
Exploring Natural Language Processing Methods for Interactive Behaviour Modelling,"Analysing and modelling interactive behaviour is an important topic in human-computer interaction (HCI) and a key requirement for the development of intelligent interactive systems. Interactive behaviour has a sequential (actions happen one after another) and hierarchical (a sequence of actions forms an activity driven by interaction goals) structure, which may be similar to the structure of natural language. Designed based on such a structure, natural language processing (NLP) methods have achieved groundbreaking success in various downstream tasks. However, few works linked interactive behaviour with natural language. In this paper, we explore the similarity between interactive behaviour and natural language by applying an NLP method, byte pair encoding (BPE), to encode mouse and keyboard behaviour. We then analyse the vocabulary, i.e., the set of action sequences, learnt by BPE, as well as use the vocabulary to encode the input behaviour for interactive task recognition. An existing dataset collected in constrained lab settings and our novel out-of-the-lab dataset were used for evaluation. Results show that this natural language-inspired approach not only learns action sequences that reflect specific interaction goals, but also achieves higher F1 scores on task recognition than other methods. Our work reveals the similarity between interactive behaviour and natural language, and presents the potential of applying the new pack of methods that leverage insights from NLP to model interactive behaviour in HCI."
"Natural Language Processing in Ethiopian Languages: Current State, Challenges, and Opportunities","This survey delves into the current state of natural language processing (NLP) for four Ethiopian languages: Amharic, Afaan Oromo, Tigrinya, and Wolaytta. Through this paper, we identify key challenges and opportunities for NLP research in Ethiopia. Furthermore, we provide a centralized repository on GitHub that contains publicly available resources for various NLP tasks in these languages. This repository can be updated periodically with contributions from other researchers. Our objective is to identify research gaps and disseminate the information to NLP researchers interested in Ethiopian languages and encourage future research in this domain."
Lay Text Summarisation Using Natural Language Processing: A Narrative Literature Review,"Summarisation of research results in plain language is crucial for promoting public understanding of research findings. The use of Natural Language Processing to generate lay summaries has the potential to relieve researchers' workload and bridge the gap between science and society. The aim of this narrative literature review is to describe and compare the different text summarisation approaches used to generate lay summaries. We searched the databases Web of Science, Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library and arXiv for articles published until 6 May 2022. We included original studies on automatic text summarisation methods to generate lay summaries. We screened 82 articles and included eight relevant papers published between 2020 and 2021, all using the same dataset. The results show that transformer-based methods such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and Pre-training with Extracted Gap-sentences for Abstractive Summarization (PEGASUS) dominate the landscape of lay text summarisation, with all but one study using these methods. A combination of extractive and abstractive summarisation methods in a hybrid approach was found to be most effective. Furthermore, pre-processing approaches to input text (e.g. applying extractive summarisation) or determining which sections of a text to include, appear critical. Evaluation metrics such as Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE) were used, which do not consider readability. To conclude, automatic lay text summarisation is under-explored. Future research should consider long document lay text summarisation, including clinical trial reports, and the development of evaluation metrics that consider readability of the lay summary."
Natural language processing to automatically extract the presence and severity of esophagitis in notes of patients undergoing radiotherapy,"Radiotherapy (RT) toxicities can impair survival and quality-of-life, yet remain under-studied. Real-world evidence holds potential to improve our understanding of toxicities, but toxicity information is often only in clinical notes. We developed natural language processing (NLP) models to identify the presence and severity of esophagitis from notes of patients treated with thoracic RT. We fine-tuned statistical and pre-trained BERT-based models for three esophagitis classification tasks: Task 1) presence of esophagitis, Task 2) severe esophagitis or not, and Task 3) no esophagitis vs. grade 1 vs. grade 2-3. Transferability was tested on 345 notes from patients with esophageal cancer undergoing RT.  Fine-tuning PubmedBERT yielded the best performance. The best macro-F1 was 0.92, 0.82, and 0.74 for Task 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Selecting the most informative note sections during fine-tuning improved macro-F1 by over 2% for all tasks. Silver-labeled data improved the macro-F1 by over 3% across all tasks. For the esophageal cancer notes, the best macro-F1 was 0.73, 0.74, and 0.65 for Task 1, 2, and 3, respectively, without additional fine-tuning.  To our knowledge, this is the first effort to automatically extract esophagitis toxicity severity according to CTCAE guidelines from clinic notes. The promising performance provides proof-of-concept for NLP-based automated detailed toxicity monitoring in expanded domains."
Extracting Physical Rehabilitation Exercise Information from Clinical Notes: a Comparison of Rule-Based and Machine Learning Natural Language Processing Techniques,"Physical rehabilitation plays a crucial role in the recovery process of post-stroke patients. By personalizing therapies for patients leveraging predictive modeling and electronic health records (EHRs), healthcare providers can make the rehabilitation process more efficient. Before predictive modeling can provide decision support for the assignment of treatment plans, automated methods are necessary to extract physical rehabilitation exercise information from unstructured EHRs. We introduce a rule-based natural language processing algorithm to annotate therapeutic procedures for stroke patients and compare it to several small machine learning models. We find that our algorithm outperforms these models in extracting half of the concepts where sufficient data is available, and individual exercise descriptions can be assigned binary labels with an f-score of no less than 0.75 per concept. More research needs to be done before these algorithms can be deployed on unlabeled documents, but current progress gives promise to the potential of precision rehabilitation research."
Development and validation of a natural language processing algorithm to pseudonymize documents in the context of a clinical data warehouse,"The objective of this study is to address the critical issue of de-identification of clinical reports in order to allow access to data for research purposes, while ensuring patient privacy. The study highlights the difficulties faced in sharing tools and resources in this domain and presents the experience of the Greater Paris University Hospitals (AP-HP) in implementing a systematic pseudonymization of text documents from its Clinical Data Warehouse. We annotated a corpus of clinical documents according to 12 types of identifying entities, and built a hybrid system, merging the results of a deep learning model as well as manual rules. Our results show an overall performance of 0.99 of F1-score. We discuss implementation choices and present experiments to better understand the effort involved in such a task, including dataset size, document types, language models, or rule addition. We share guidelines and code under a 3-Clause BSD license."
Requirement Formalisation using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning: A Systematic Review,"Improvement of software development methodologies attracts developers to automatic Requirement Formalisation (RF) in the Requirement Engineering (RE) field. The potential advantages by applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) in reducing the ambiguity and incompleteness of requirement written in natural languages is reported in different studies. The goal of this paper is to survey and classify existing work on NLP and ML for RF, identifying challenges in this domain and providing promising future research directions. To achieve this, we conducted a systematic literature review to outline the current state-of-the-art of NLP and ML techniques in RF by selecting 257 papers from common used libraries. The search result is filtered by defining inclusion and exclusion criteria and 47 relevant studies between 2012 and 2022 are selected. We found that heuristic NLP approaches are the most common NLP techniques used for automatic RF, primary operating on structured and semi-structured data. This study also revealed that Deep Learning (DL) technique are not widely used, instead classical ML techniques are predominant in the surveyed studies. More importantly, we identified the difficulty of comparing the performance of different approaches due to the lack of standard benchmark cases for RF."
Features matching using natural language processing,The feature matching is a basic step in matching different datasets. This article proposes shows a new hybrid model of a pretrained Natural Language Processing (NLP) based model called BERT used in parallel with a statistical model based on Jaccard similarity to measure the similarity between list of features from two different datasets. This reduces the time required to search for correlations or manually match each feature from one dataset to another.
Self-Improving-Leaderboard(SIL): A Call for Real-World Centric Natural Language Processing Leaderboards,"Leaderboard systems allow researchers to objectively evaluate Natural Language Processing (NLP) models and are typically used to identify models that exhibit superior performance on a given task in a predetermined setting. However, we argue that evaluation on a given test dataset is just one of many performance indications of the model. In this paper, we claim leaderboard competitions should also aim to identify models that exhibit the best performance in a real-world setting. We highlight three issues with current leaderboard systems: (1) the use of a single, static test set, (2) discrepancy between testing and real-world application (3) the tendency for leaderboard-centric competition to be biased towards the test set. As a solution, we propose a new paradigm of leaderboard systems that addresses these issues of current leaderboard system. Through this study, we hope to induce a paradigm shift towards more real -world-centric leaderboard competitions."
Automated Vulnerability Detection in Source Code Using Quantum Natural Language Processing,"One of the most important challenges in the field of software code audit is the presence of vulnerabilities in software source code. These flaws are highly likely ex-ploited and lead to system compromise, data leakage, or denial of ser-vice. C and C++ open source code are now available in order to create a large-scale, classical machine-learning and quantum machine-learning system for function-level vulnerability identification. We assembled a siz-able dataset of millions of open-source functions that point to poten-tial exploits. We created an efficient and scalable vulnerability detection method based on a deep neural network model Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), and quantum machine learning model Long Short Term Memory (QLSTM), that can learn features extracted from the source codes. The source code is first converted into a minimal intermediate representation to remove the pointless components and shorten the de-pendency. Therefore, We keep the semantic and syntactic information using state of the art word embedding algorithms such as Glove and fastText. The embedded vectors are subsequently fed into the classical and quantum convolutional neural networks to classify the possible vulnerabilities. To measure the performance, we used evaluation metrics such as F1 score, precision, re-call, accuracy, and total execution time. We made a comparison between the results derived from the classical LSTM and quantum LSTM using basic feature representation as well as semantic and syntactic represen-tation. We found that the QLSTM with semantic and syntactic features detects significantly accurate vulnerability and runs faster than its classical counterpart."
Comprehensive Event Representations using Event Knowledge Graphs and Natural Language Processing,"Recent work has utilised knowledge-aware approaches to natural language understanding, question answering, recommendation systems, and other tasks. These approaches rely on well-constructed and large-scale knowledge graphs that can be useful for many downstream applications and empower knowledge-aware models with commonsense reasoning. Such knowledge graphs are constructed through knowledge acquisition tasks such as relation extraction and knowledge graph completion. This work seeks to utilise and build on the growing body of work that uses findings from the field of natural language processing (NLP) to extract knowledge from text and build knowledge graphs. The focus of this research project is on how we can use transformer-based approaches to extract and contextualise event information, matching it to existing ontologies, to build a comprehensive knowledge of graph-based event representations. Specifically, sub-event extraction is used as a way of creating sub-event-aware event representations. These event representations are then further enriched through fine-grained location extraction and contextualised through the alignment of historically relevant quotes."
HugNLP: A Unified and Comprehensive Library for Natural Language Processing,"In this paper, we introduce HugNLP, a unified and comprehensive library for natural language processing (NLP) with the prevalent backend of HuggingFace Transformers, which is designed for NLP researchers to easily utilize off-the-shelf algorithms and develop novel methods with user-defined models and tasks in real-world scenarios. HugNLP consists of a hierarchical structure including models, processors and applications that unifies the learning process of pre-trained language models (PLMs) on different NLP tasks. Additionally, we present some featured NLP applications to show the effectiveness of HugNLP, such as knowledge-enhanced PLMs, universal information extraction, low-resource mining, and code understanding and generation, etc. The source code will be released on GitHub (https://github.com/wjn1996/HugNLP)."
Adapting Pre-trained Language Models for Quantum Natural Language Processing,"The emerging classical-quantum transfer learning paradigm has brought a decent performance to quantum computational models in many tasks, such as computer vision, by enabling a combination of quantum models and classical pre-trained neural networks. However, using quantum computing with pre-trained models has yet to be explored in natural language processing (NLP). Due to the high linearity constraints of the underlying quantum computing infrastructures, existing Quantum NLP models are limited in performance on real tasks. We fill this gap by pre-training a sentence state with complex-valued BERT-like architecture, and adapting it to the classical-quantum transfer learning scheme for sentence classification. On quantum simulation experiments, the pre-trained representation can bring 50\% to 60\% increases to the capacity of end-to-end quantum models."
Natural Language Processing in the Legal Domain,"In this paper, we summarize the current state of the field of NLP & Law with a specific focus on recent technical and substantive developments. To support our analysis, we construct and analyze a nearly complete corpus of more than six hundred NLP & Law related papers published over the past decade. Our analysis highlights several major trends. Namely, we document an increasing number of papers written, tasks undertaken, and languages covered over the course of the past decade. We observe an increase in the sophistication of the methods which researchers deployed in this applied context. Slowly but surely, Legal NLP is beginning to match not only the methodological sophistication of general NLP but also the professional standards of data availability and code reproducibility observed within the broader scientific community. We believe all of these trends bode well for the future of the field, but many questions in both the academic and commercial sphere still remain open."
NLPLego: Assembling Test Generation for Natural Language Processing Applications,"The development of modern NLP applications often relies on various benchmark datasets containing plenty of manually labeled tests to evaluate performance. While constructing datasets often costs many resources, the performance on the held-out data may not properly reflect their capability in real-world application scenarios and thus cause tremendous misunderstanding and monetary loss. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose an automated test generation method for detecting erroneous behaviors of various NLP applications. Our method is designed based on the sentence parsing process of classic linguistics, and thus it is capable of assembling basic grammatical elements and adjuncts into a grammatically correct test with proper oracle information. We implement this method into NLPLego, which is designed to fully exploit the potential of seed sentences to automate the test generation. NLPLego disassembles the seed sentence into the template and adjuncts and then generates new sentences by assembling context-appropriate adjuncts with the template in a specific order. Unlike the taskspecific methods, the tests generated by NLPLego have derivation relations and different degrees of variation, which makes constructing appropriate metamorphic relations easier. Thus, NLPLego is general, meaning it can meet the testing requirements of various NLP applications. To validate NLPLego, we experiment with three common NLP tasks, identifying failures in four state-of-art models. Given seed tests from SQuAD 2.0, SST, and QQP, NLPLego successfully detects 1,732, 5301, and 261,879 incorrect behaviors with around 95.7% precision in three tasks, respectively."
Time to Embrace Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based Digital Pathology: Benchmarking NLP- and Convolutional Neural Network-based Deep Learning Pipelines,"NLP-based computer vision models, particularly vision transformers, have been shown to outperform CNN models in many imaging tasks. However, most digital pathology artificial-intelligence models are based on CNN architectures, probably owing to a lack of data regarding NLP models for pathology images. In this study, we developed digital pathology pipelines to benchmark the five most recently proposed NLP models (vision transformer (ViT), Swin Transformer, MobileViT, CMT, and Sequencer2D) and four popular CNN models (ResNet18, ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and EfficientNet) to predict biomarkers in colorectal cancer (microsatellite instability, CpG island methylator phenotype, and BRAF mutation). Hematoxylin and eosin-stained whole-slide images from Molecular and Cellular Oncology and The Cancer Genome Atlas were used as training and external validation datasets, respectively. Cross-study external validations revealed that the NLP-based models significantly outperformed the CNN-based models in biomarker prediction tasks, improving the overall prediction and precision up to approximately 10% and 26%, respectively. Notably, compared with existing models in the current literature using large training datasets, our NLP models achieved state-of-the-art predictions for all three biomarkers using a relatively small training dataset, suggesting that large training datasets are not a prerequisite for NLP models or transformers, and NLP may be more suitable for clinical studies in which small training datasets are commonly collected. The superior performance of Sequencer2D suggests that further research and innovation on both transformer and bidirectional long short-term memory architectures are warranted in the field of digital pathology. NLP models can replace classic CNN architectures and become the new workhorse backbone in the field of digital pathology."
Foundation Models for Natural Language Processing -- Pre-trained Language Models Integrating Media,"This open access book provides a comprehensive overview of the state of the art in research and applications of Foundation Models and is intended for readers familiar with basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts. Over the recent years, a revolutionary new paradigm has been developed for training models for NLP. These models are first pre-trained on large collections of text documents to acquire general syntactic knowledge and semantic information. Then, they are fine-tuned for specific tasks, which they can often solve with superhuman accuracy. When the models are large enough, they can be instructed by prompts to solve new tasks without any fine-tuning. Moreover, they can be applied to a wide range of different media and problem domains, ranging from image and video processing to robot control learning. Because they provide a blueprint for solving many tasks in artificial intelligence, they have been called Foundation Models. After a brief introduction to basic NLP models the main pre-trained language models BERT, GPT and sequence-to-sequence transformer are described, as well as the concepts of self-attention and context-sensitive embedding. Then, different approaches to improving these models are discussed, such as expanding the pre-training criteria, increasing the length of input texts, or including extra knowledge. An overview of the best-performing models for about twenty application areas is then presented, e.g., question answering, translation, story generation, dialog systems, generating images from text, etc. For each application area, the strengths and weaknesses of current models are discussed, and an outlook on further developments is given. In addition, links are provided to freely available program code. A concluding chapter summarizes the economic opportunities, mitigation of risks, and potential developments of AI."
Is ChatGPT a General-Purpose Natural Language Processing Task Solver?,"Spurred by advancements in scale, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to perform a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks zero-shot -- i.e., without adaptation on downstream data. Recently, the debut of ChatGPT has drawn a great deal of attention from the natural language processing (NLP) community due to the fact that it can generate high-quality responses to human input and self-correct previous mistakes based on subsequent conversations. However, it is not yet known whether ChatGPT can serve as a generalist model that can perform many NLP tasks zero-shot. In this work, we empirically analyze the zero-shot learning ability of ChatGPT by evaluating it on 20 popular NLP datasets covering 7 representative task categories. With extensive empirical studies, we demonstrate both the effectiveness and limitations of the current version of ChatGPT. We find that ChatGPT performs well on many tasks favoring reasoning capabilities (e.g., arithmetic reasoning) while it still faces challenges when solving specific tasks such as sequence tagging. We additionally provide in-depth analysis through qualitative case studies."
Lightweight Transformers for Clinical Natural Language Processing,"Specialised pre-trained language models are becoming more frequent in NLP since they can potentially outperform models trained on generic texts. BioBERT and BioClinicalBERT are two examples of such models that have shown promise in medical NLP tasks. Many of these models are overparametrised and resource-intensive, but thanks to techniques like Knowledge Distillation (KD), it is possible to create smaller versions that perform almost as well as their larger counterparts. In this work, we specifically focus on development of compact language models for processing clinical texts (i.e. progress notes, discharge summaries etc). We developed a number of efficient lightweight clinical transformers using knowledge distillation and continual learning, with the number of parameters ranging from 15 million to 65 million. These models performed comparably to larger models such as BioBERT and ClinicalBioBERT and significantly outperformed other compact models trained on general or biomedical data. Our extensive evaluation was done across several standard datasets and covered a wide range of clinical text-mining tasks, including Natural Language Inference, Relation Extraction, Named Entity Recognition, and Sequence Classification. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study specifically focused on creating efficient and compact transformers for clinical NLP tasks. The models and code used in this study can be found on our Huggingface profile at https://huggingface.co/nlpie and Github page at https://github.com/nlpie-research/Lightweight-Clinical-Transformers, respectively, promoting reproducibility of our results."
Natural Language Processing for Policymaking,"Language is the medium for many political activities, from campaigns to news reports. Natural language processing (NLP) uses computational tools to parse text into key information that is needed for policymaking. In this chapter, we introduce common methods of NLP, including text classification, topic modeling, event extraction, and text scaling. We then overview how these methods can be used for policymaking through four major applications including data collection for evidence-based policymaking, interpretation of political decisions, policy communication, and investigation of policy effects. Finally, we highlight some potential limitations and ethical concerns when using NLP for policymaking.  This text is from Chapter 7 (pages 141-162) of the Handbook of Computational Social Science for Policy (2023). Open Access on Springer: https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-16624-2"
A Semantic Approach to Negation Detection and Word Disambiguation with Natural Language Processing,"This study aims to demonstrate the methods for detecting negations in a sentence by uniquely evaluating the lexical structure of the text via word-sense disambiguation. The proposed framework examines all the unique features in the various expressions within a text to resolve the contextual usage of all tokens and decipher the effect of negation on sentiment analysis. The application of popular expression detectors skips this important step, thereby neglecting the root words caught in the web of negation and making text classification difficult for machine learning and sentiment analysis. This study adopts the Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach to discover and antonimize words that were negated for better accuracy in text classification using a knowledge base provided by an NLP library called WordHoard. Early results show that our initial analysis improved on traditional sentiment analysis, which sometimes neglects negations or assigns an inverse polarity score. The SentiWordNet analyzer was improved by 35%, the Vader analyzer by 20% and the TextBlob by 6%."
Using natural language processing and structured medical data to phenotype patients hospitalized due to COVID-19,"To identify patients who are hospitalized because of COVID-19 as opposed to those who were admitted for other indications, we compared the performance of different computable phenotype definitions for COVID-19 hospitalizations that use different types of data from the electronic health records (EHR), including structured EHR data elements, provider notes, or a combination of both data types. And conduct a retrospective data analysis utilizing chart review-based validation. Participants are 586 hospitalized individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during January 2022. We used natural language processing to incorporate data from provider notes and LASSO regression and Random Forests to fit classification algorithms that incorporated structured EHR data elements, provider notes, or a combination of structured data and provider notes. Results: Based on a chart review, 38% of 586 patients were determined to be hospitalized for reasons other than COVID-19 despite having tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. A classification algorithm that used provider notes had significantly better discrimination than one that used structured EHR data elements (AUROC: 0.894 vs 0.841, p < 0.001), and performed similarly to a model that combined provider notes with structured data elements (AUROC: 0.894 vs 0.893). Assessments of hospital outcome metrics significantly differed based on whether the population included all hospitalized patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 versus those who were determined to have been hospitalized due to COVID-19. This work demonstrates the utility of natural language processing approaches to derive information related to patient hospitalizations in cases where there may be multiple conditions that could serve as the primary indication for hospitalization."
Consistency is Key: Disentangling Label Variation in Natural Language Processing with Intra-Annotator Agreement,"We commonly use agreement measures to assess the utility of judgements made by human annotators in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. While inter-annotator agreement is frequently used as an indication of label reliability by measuring consistency between annotators, we argue for the additional use of intra-annotator agreement to measure label stability over time. However, in a systematic review, we find that the latter is rarely reported in this field. Calculating these measures can act as important quality control and provide insights into why annotators disagree. We propose exploratory annotation experiments to investigate the relationships between these measures and perceptions of subjectivity and ambiguity in text items."
A Review of the Trends and Challenges in Adopting Natural Language Processing Methods for Education Feedback Analysis,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a fast-growing area of study that stretching its presence to many business and research domains. Machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing (NLP) are subsets of AI to tackle different areas of data processing and modelling. This review article presents an overview of AI impact on education outlining with current opportunities. In the education domain, student feedback data is crucial to uncover the merits and demerits of existing services provided to students. AI can assist in identifying the areas of improvement in educational infrastructure, learning management systems, teaching practices and study environment. NLP techniques play a vital role in analyzing student feedback in textual format. This research focuses on existing NLP methodologies and applications that could be adapted to educational domain applications like sentiment annotations, entity annotations, text summarization, and topic modelling. Trends and challenges in adopting NLP in education were reviewed and explored. Contextbased challenges in NLP like sarcasm, domain-specific language, ambiguity, and aspect-based sentiment analysis are explained with existing methodologies to overcome them. Research community approaches to extract the semantic meaning of emoticons and special characters in feedback which conveys user opinion and challenges in adopting NLP in education are explored."
Automatically Reproducing Android Bug Reports Using Natural Language Processing and Reinforcement Learning,"As part of the process of resolving issues submitted by users via bug reports, Android developers attempt to reproduce and observe the failures described by the bug report. Due to the low-quality of bug reports and the complexity of modern apps, the reproduction process is non-trivial and time-consuming. Therefore, automatic approaches that can help reproduce Android bug reports are in great need. However, current approaches to help developers automatically reproduce bug reports are only able to handle limited forms of natural language text and struggle to successfully reproduce failures for which the initial bug report had missing or imprecise steps. In this paper, we introduce a new fully automated Android bug report reproduction approach that addresses these limitations. Our approach accomplishes this by leveraging natural language process techniques to more holistically and accurately analyze the natural language in Android bug reports and designing new techniques, based on reinforcement learning, to guide the search for successful reproducing steps. We conducted an empirical evaluation of our approach on 77 real world bug reports. Our approach achieved 67% precision and 77% recall in accurately extracting reproduction steps from bug reports, and reproduced 74% of the bug reports, significantly outperforming state of the art techniques."
A Quantitative Exploration of Natural Language Processing Applications for Electricity Demand Analysis,"The relationship between electricity demand and weather has been established for a long time and is one of the cornerstones in load prediction for operation and planning, along with behavioral and social aspects such as calendars or significant events. This paper explores how and why the social information contained in the news can be used better to understand aggregate population behaviour in terms of energy demand. The work is done through experiments analysing the impact of predicting features extracted from national news on day-ahead electric demand prediction. The results are compared to a benchmark model trained exclusively on the calendar and meteorological information. Experimental results showed that the best-performing model reduced the official standard errors around 4%, 11%, and 10% in terms of RMSE, MAE, and SMAPE. The best-performing methods are: word frequency identified COVID-19-related keywords; topic distribution that identified news on the pandemic and internal politics; global word embeddings that identified news about international conflicts. This study brings a new perspective to traditional electricity demand analysis and confirms the feasibility of improving its predictions with unstructured information contained in texts, with potential consequences in sociology and economics."
Natural Language Processing of Aviation Occurrence Reports for Safety Management,"Occurrence reporting is a commonly used method in safety management systems to obtain insight in the prevalence of hazards and accident scenarios. In support of safety data analysis, reports are often categorized according to a taxonomy. However, the processing of the reports can require significant effort from safety analysts and a common problem is interrater variability in labeling processes. Also, in some cases, reports are not processed according to a taxonomy, or the taxonomy does not fully cover the contents of the documents. This paper explores various Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to support the analysis of aviation safety occurrence reports. In particular, the problems studied are the automatic labeling of reports using a classification model, extracting the latent topics in a collection of texts using a topic model and the automatic generation of probable cause texts. Experimental results showed that (i) under the right conditions the labeling of occurrence reports can be effectively automated with a transformer-based classifier, (ii) topic modeling can be useful for finding the topics present in a collection of reports, and (iii) using a summarization model can be a promising direction for generating probable cause texts."
Rock Guitar Tablature Generation via Natural Language Processing,"Deep learning has recently empowered and democratized generative modeling of images and text, with additional concurrent works exploring the possibility of generating more complex forms of data, such as audio. However, the high dimensionality, long-range dependencies, and lack of standardized datasets currently makes generative modeling of audio and music very challenging. We propose to model music as a series of discrete notes upon which we can use autoregressive natural language processing techniques for successful generative modeling. While previous works used similar pipelines on data such as sheet music and MIDI, we aim to extend such approaches to the under-studied medium of guitar tablature. Specifically, we develop the first work to our knowledge that models one specific genre as guitar tablature: heavy rock. Unlike other works in guitar tablature generation, we have a freely available public demo at https://huggingface.co/spaces/josuelmet/Metal_Music_Interpolator"
User-Centered Security in Natural Language Processing,"This dissertation proposes a framework of user-centered security in Natural Language Processing (NLP), and demonstrates how it can improve the accessibility of related research. Accordingly, it focuses on two security domains within NLP with great public interest. First, that of author profiling, which can be employed to compromise online privacy through invasive inferences. Without access and detailed insight into these models' predictions, there is no reasonable heuristic by which Internet users might defend themselves from such inferences. Secondly, that of cyberbullying detection, which by default presupposes a centralized implementation; i.e., content moderation across social platforms. As access to appropriate data is restricted, and the nature of the task rapidly evolves (both through lexical variation, and cultural shifts), the effectiveness of its classifiers is greatly diminished and thereby often misrepresented.  Under the proposed framework, we predominantly investigate the use of adversarial attacks on language; i.e., changing a given input (generating adversarial samples) such that a given model does not function as intended. These attacks form a common thread between our user-centered security problems; they are highly relevant for privacy-preserving obfuscation methods against author profiling, and adversarial samples might also prove useful to assess the influence of lexical variation and augmentation on cyberbullying detection."
Mining Healthcare Procurement Data Using Text Mining and Natural Language Processing -- Reflection From An Industrial Project,"While text mining and NLP research has been established for decades, there remain gaps in the literature that reports the use of these techniques in building real-world applications. For example, they typically look at single and sometimes simplified tasks, and do not discuss in-depth data heterogeneity and inconsistency that is common in real-world problems or their implication on the development of their methods. Also, few prior work has focused on the healthcare domain. In this work, we describe an industry project that developed text mining and NLP solutions to mine millions of heterogeneous, multilingual procurement documents in the healthcare sector. We extract structured procurement contract data that is used to power a platform for dynamically assessing supplier risks. Our work makes unique contributions in a number of ways. First, we deal with highly heterogeneous, multilingual data and we document our approach to tackle these challenges. This is mainly based on a method that effectively uses domain knowledge and generalises to multiple text mining and NLP tasks and languages. Second, applying this method to mine millions of procurement documents, we develop the first structured procurement contract database that will help facilitate the tendering process. Second, Finally, we discuss lessons learned for practical text mining/NLP development, and make recommendations for future research and practice."
MessageNet: Message Classification using Natural Language Processing and Meta-data,"In this paper we propose a new Deep Learning (DL) approach for message classification. Our method is based on the state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) building blocks, combined with a novel technique for infusing the meta-data input that is typically available in messages such as the sender information, timestamps, attached image, audio, affiliations, and more. As we demonstrate throughout the paper, going beyond the mere text by leveraging all available channels in the message, could yield an improved representation and higher classification accuracy. To achieve message representation, each type of input is processed in a dedicated block in the neural network architecture that is suitable for the data type. Such an implementation enables training all blocks together simultaneously, and forming cross channels features in the network. We show in the Experiments Section that in some cases, message's meta-data holds an additional information that cannot be extracted just from the text, and when using this information we achieve better performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our multi-modality block approach outperforms other approaches for injecting the meta data to the the text classifier."
Generalizable Natural Language Processing Framework for Migraine Reporting from Social Media,"Migraine is a high-prevalence and disabling neurological disorder. However, information migraine management in real-world settings could be limited to traditional health information sources. In this paper, we (i) verify that there is substantial migraine-related chatter available on social media (Twitter and Reddit), self-reported by migraine sufferers; (ii) develop a platform-independent text classification system for automatically detecting self-reported migraine-related posts, and (iii) conduct analyses of the self-reported posts to assess the utility of social media for studying this problem. We manually annotated 5750 Twitter posts and 302 Reddit posts. Our system achieved an F1 score of 0.90 on Twitter and 0.93 on Reddit. Analysis of information posted by our 'migraine cohort' revealed the presence of a plethora of relevant information about migraine therapies and patient sentiments associated with them. Our study forms the foundation for conducting an in-depth analysis of migraine-related information using social media data."
Human-Guided Fair Classification for Natural Language Processing,"Text classifiers have promising applications in high-stake tasks such as resume screening and content moderation. These classifiers must be fair and avoid discriminatory decisions by being invariant to perturbations of sensitive attributes such as gender or ethnicity. However, there is a gap between human intuition about these perturbations and the formal similarity specifications capturing them. While existing research has started to address this gap, current methods are based on hardcoded word replacements, resulting in specifications with limited expressivity or ones that fail to fully align with human intuition (e.g., in cases of asymmetric counterfactuals). This work proposes novel methods for bridging this gap by discovering expressive and intuitive individual fairness specifications. We show how to leverage unsupervised style transfer and GPT-3's zero-shot capabilities to automatically generate expressive candidate pairs of semantically similar sentences that differ along sensitive attributes. We then validate the generated pairs via an extensive crowdsourcing study, which confirms that a lot of these pairs align with human intuition about fairness in the context of toxicity classification. Finally, we show how limited amounts of human feedback can be leveraged to learn a similarity specification that can be used to train downstream fairness-aware models."
Natural Language Processing in Customer Service: A Systematic Review,"Artificial intelligence and natural language processing (NLP) are increasingly being used in customer service to interact with users and answer their questions. The goal of this systematic review is to examine existing research on the use of NLP technology in customer service, including the research domain, applications, datasets used, and evaluation methods. The review also looks at the future direction of the field and any significant limitations. The review covers the time period from 2015 to 2022 and includes papers from five major scientific databases. Chatbots and question-answering systems were found to be used in 10 main fields, with the most common use in general, social networking, and e-commerce areas. Twitter was the second most commonly used dataset, with most research also using their own original datasets. Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 were the most common evaluation methods. Future work aims to improve the performance and understanding of user behavior and emotions, and address limitations such as the volume, diversity, and quality of datasets. This review includes research on different spoken languages and models and techniques."
Using Natural Language Processing to Predict Costume Core Vocabulary of Historical Artifacts,"Historic dress artifacts are a valuable source for human studies. In particular, they can provide important insights into the social aspects of their corresponding era. These insights are commonly drawn from garment pictures as well as the accompanying descriptions and are usually stored in a standardized and controlled vocabulary that accurately describes garments and costume items, called the Costume Core Vocabulary. Building an accurate Costume Core from garment descriptions can be challenging because the historic garment items are often donated, and the accompanying descriptions can be based on untrained individuals and use a language common to the period of the items. In this paper, we present an approach to use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to map the free-form text descriptions of the historic items to that of the controlled vocabulary provided by the Costume Core. Despite the limited dataset, we were able to train an NLP model based on the Universal Sentence Encoder to perform this mapping with more than 90% test accuracy for a subset of the Costume Core vocabulary. We describe our methodology, design choices, and development of our approach, and show the feasibility of predicting the Costume Core for unseen descriptions. With more garment descriptions still being curated to be used for training, we expect to have higher accuracy for better generalizability."
Leveraging Natural Language Processing to Augment Structured Social Determinants of Health Data in the Electronic Health Record,"Objective: Social determinants of health (SDOH) impact health outcomes and are documented in the electronic health record (EHR) through structured data and unstructured clinical notes. However, clinical notes often contain more comprehensive SDOH information, detailing aspects such as status, severity, and temporality. This work has two primary objectives: i) develop a natural language processing (NLP) information extraction model to capture detailed SDOH information and ii) evaluate the information gain achieved by applying the SDOH extractor to clinical narratives and combining the extracted representations with existing structured data.  Materials and Methods: We developed a novel SDOH extractor using a deep learning entity and relation extraction architecture to characterize SDOH across various dimensions. In an EHR case study, we applied the SDOH extractor to a large clinical data set with 225,089 patients and 430,406 notes with social history sections and compared the extracted SDOH information with existing structured data.  Results: The SDOH extractor achieved 0.86 F1 on a withheld test set. In the EHR case study, we found extracted SDOH information complements existing structured data with 32% of homeless patients, 19% of current tobacco users, and 10% of drug users only having these health risk factors documented in the clinical narrative.  Conclusions: Utilizing EHR data to identify SDOH health risk factors and social needs may improve patient care and outcomes. Semantic representations of text-encoded SDOH information can augment existing structured data, and this more comprehensive SDOH representation can assist health systems in identifying and addressing these social needs."
Speech and Natural Language Processing Technologies for Pseudo-Pilot Simulator,"This paper describes a simple yet efficient repetition-based modular system for speeding up air-traffic controllers (ATCos) training. E.g., a human pilot is still required in EUROCONTROL's ESCAPE lite simulator (see https://www.eurocontrol.int/simulator/escape) during ATCo training. However, this need can be substituted by an automatic system that could act as a pilot. In this paper, we aim to develop and integrate a pseudo-pilot agent into the ATCo training pipeline by merging diverse artificial intelligence (AI) powered modules. The system understands the voice communications issued by the ATCo, and, in turn, it generates a spoken prompt that follows the pilot's phraseology to the initial communication. Our system mainly relies on open-source AI tools and air traffic control (ATC) databases, thus, proving its simplicity and ease of replicability. The overall pipeline is composed of the following: (1) a submodule that receives and pre-processes the input stream of raw audio, (2) an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system that transforms audio into a sequence of words; (3) a high-level ATC-related entity parser, which extracts relevant information from the communication, i.e., callsigns and commands, and finally, (4) a speech synthesizer submodule that generates responses based on the high-level ATC entities previously extracted. Overall, we show that this system could pave the way toward developing a real proof-of-concept pseudo-pilot system. Hence, speeding up the training of ATCos while drastically reducing its overall cost."
Categorical Tools for Natural Language Processing,"This thesis develops the translation between category theory and computational linguistics as a foundation for natural language processing. The three chapters deal with syntax, semantics and pragmatics. First, string diagrams provide a unified model of syntactic structures in formal grammars. Second, functors compute semantics by turning diagrams into logical, tensor, neural or quantum computation. Third, the resulting functorial models can be composed to form games where equilibria are the solutions of language processing tasks. This framework is implemented as part of DisCoPy, the Python library for computing with string diagrams. We describe the correspondence between categorical, linguistic and computational structures, and demonstrate their applications in compositional natural language processing."
Category Theory for Quantum Natural Language Processing,"This thesis introduces quantum natural language processing (QNLP) models based on a simple yet powerful analogy between computational linguistics and quantum mechanics: grammar as entanglement. The grammatical structure of text and sentences connects the meaning of words in the same way that entanglement structure connects the states of quantum systems. Category theory allows to make this language-to-qubit analogy formal: it is a monoidal functor from grammar to vector spaces. We turn this abstract analogy into a concrete algorithm that translates the grammatical structure onto the architecture of parameterised quantum circuits. We then use a hybrid classical-quantum algorithm to train the model so that evaluating the circuits computes the meaning of sentences in data-driven tasks.  The implementation of QNLP models motivated the development of DisCoPy (Distributional Compositional Python), the toolkit for applied category theory of which the first chapter gives a comprehensive overview. String diagrams are the core data structure of DisCoPy, they allow to reason about computation at a high level of abstraction. We show how they can encode both grammatical structures and quantum circuits, but also logical formulae, neural networks or arbitrary Python code. Monoidal functors allow to translate these abstract diagrams into concrete computation, interfacing with optimised task-specific libraries.  The second chapter uses DisCopy to implement QNLP models as parameterised functors from grammar to quantum circuits. It gives a first proof-of-concept for the more general concept of functorial learning: generalising machine learning from functions to functors by learning from diagram-like data. In order to learn optimal functor parameters via gradient descent, we introduce the notion of diagrammatic differentiation: a graphical calculus for computing the gradients of parameterised diagrams."
Auto-labelling of Bug Report using Natural Language Processing,"The exercise of detecting similar bug reports in bug tracking systems is known as duplicate bug report detection. Having prior knowledge of a bug report's existence reduces efforts put into debugging problems and identifying the root cause. Rule and Query-based solutions recommend a long list of potential similar bug reports with no clear ranking. In addition, triage engineers are less motivated to spend time going through an extensive list. Consequently, this deters the use of duplicate bug report retrieval solutions. In this paper, we have proposed a solution using a combination of NLP techniques. Our approach considers unstructured and structured attributes of a bug report like summary, description and severity, impacted products, platforms, categories, etc. It uses a custom data transformer, a deep neural network, and a non-generalizing machine learning method to retrieve existing identical bug reports. We have performed numerous experiments with significant data sources containing thousands of bug reports and showcased that the proposed solution achieves a high retrieval accuracy of 70% for recall@5."
Collaborating Heterogeneous Natural Language Processing Tasks via Federated Learning,"The increasing privacy concerns on personal private text data promote the development of federated learning (FL) in recent years. However, the existing studies on applying FL in NLP are not suitable to coordinate participants with heterogeneous or private learning objectives. In this study, we further broaden the application scope of FL in NLP by proposing an Assign-Then-Contrast (denoted as ATC) framework, which enables clients with heterogeneous NLP tasks to construct an FL course and learn useful knowledge from each other. Specifically, the clients are suggested to first perform local training with the unified tasks assigned by the server rather than using their own learning objectives, which is called the Assign training stage. After that, in the Contrast training stage, clients train with different local learning objectives and exchange knowledge with other clients who contribute consistent and useful model updates. We conduct extensive experiments on six widely-used datasets covering both Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Natural Language Generation (NLG) tasks, and the proposed ATC framework achieves significant improvements compared with various baseline methods. The source code is available at \url{https://github.com/alibaba/FederatedScope/tree/master/federatedscope/nlp/hetero_tasks}."
A Survey on Natural Language Processing for Programming,"Natural language processing for programming, which aims to use NLP techniques to assist programming, has experienced an explosion in recent years. However, there is no literature that systematically reviews related work from the full spectrum. In this paper, we comprehensively investigate existing work, ranging from early deductive models to the latest competition-level models. Another advantage of this paper is the completeness of the technique category, which provides easy access to locating and comparing future works."
Associations Between Natural Language Processing (NLP) Enriched Social Determinants of Health and Suicide Death among US Veterans,"Importance: Social determinants of health (SDOH) are known to be associated with increased risk of suicidal behaviors, but few studies utilized SDOH from unstructured electronic health record (EHR) notes.  Objective: To investigate associations between suicide and recent SDOH, identified using structured and unstructured data.  Design: Nested case-control study.  Setting: EHR data from the US Veterans Health Administration (VHA).  Participants: 6,122,785 Veterans who received care in the US VHA between October 1, 2010, and September 30, 2015.  Exposures: Occurrence of SDOH over a maximum span of two years compared with no occurrence of SDOH.  Main Outcomes and Measures: Cases of suicide deaths were matched with 4 controls on birth year, cohort entry date, sex, and duration of follow-up. We developed an NLP system to extract SDOH from unstructured notes. Structured data, NLP on unstructured data, and combining them yielded six, eight and nine SDOH respectively. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using conditional logistic regression.  Results: In our cohort, 8,821 Veterans committed suicide during 23,725,382 person-years of follow-up (incidence rate 37.18/100,000 person-years). Our cohort was mostly male (92.23%) and white (76.99%). Across the five common SDOH as covariates, NLP-extracted SDOH, on average, covered 80.03% of all SDOH occurrences. All SDOH, measured by structured data and NLP, were significantly associated with increased risk of suicide. The SDOH with the largest effects was legal problems (aOR=2.66, 95% CI=.46-2.89), followed by violence (aOR=2.12, 95% CI=1.98-2.27). NLP-extracted and structured SDOH were also associated with suicide.  Conclusions and Relevance: NLP-extracted SDOH were always significantly associated with increased risk of suicide among Veterans, suggesting the potential of NLP in public health studies."
SODA: A Natural Language Processing Package to Extract Social Determinants of Health for Cancer Studies,"Objective: We aim to develop an open-source natural language processing (NLP) package, SODA (i.e., SOcial DeterminAnts), with pre-trained transformer models to extract social determinants of health (SDoH) for cancer patients, examine the generalizability of SODA to a new disease domain (i.e., opioid use), and evaluate the extraction rate of SDoH using cancer populations.  Methods: We identified SDoH categories and attributes and developed an SDoH corpus using clinical notes from a general cancer cohort. We compared four transformer-based NLP models to extract SDoH, examined the generalizability of NLP models to a cohort of patients prescribed with opioids, and explored customization strategies to improve performance. We applied the best NLP model to extract 19 categories of SDoH from the breast (n=7,971), lung (n=11,804), and colorectal cancer (n=6,240) cohorts.  Results and Conclusion: We developed a corpus of 629 cancer patients notes with annotations of 13,193 SDoH concepts/attributes from 19 categories of SDoH. The Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model achieved the best strict/lenient F1 scores of 0.9216 and 0.9441 for SDoH concept extraction, 0.9617 and 0.9626 for linking attributes to SDoH concepts. Fine-tuning the NLP models using new annotations from opioid use patients improved the strict/lenient F1 scores from 0.8172/0.8502 to 0.8312/0.8679. The extraction rates among 19 categories of SDoH varied greatly, where 10 SDoH could be extracted from >70% of cancer patients, but 9 SDoH had a low extraction rate (<70% of cancer patients). The SODA package with pre-trained transformer models is publicly available at https://github.com/uf-hobiinformatics-lab/SDoH_SODA."
Predicting Digital Asset Prices using Natural Language Processing: a survey,"Blockchain technology has changed how people think about how they used to store and trade their assets, as it introduced us to a whole new way to transact: using digital currencies. One of the major innovations of blockchain technology is decentralization, meaning that traditional financial intermediaries, such as asset-backed security issuers and banks, are eliminated in the process. Even though blockchain technology has been utilized in a wide range of industries, its most prominent application is still cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin being the first proposed. At its peak in 2021, the market cap for Bitcoin once surpassed 1 trillion US dollars. The open nature of the crypto market poses various challenges and concerns for both potential retail investors and institutional investors, as the price of the investment is highly volatile, and its fluctuations are unpredictable. The rise of Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing, in particular, has shed some light on monitoring and predicting the price behaviors of cryptocurrencies. This paper aims to review and analyze the recent efforts in applying Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing methods to predict the prices and analyze the behaviors of digital assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum."
Inference of Media Bias and Content Quality Using Natural-Language Processing,"Media bias can significantly impact the formation and development of opinions and sentiments in a population. It is thus important to study the emergence and development of partisan media and political polarization. However, it is challenging to quantitatively infer the ideological positions of media outlets. In this paper, we present a quantitative framework to infer both political bias and content quality of media outlets from text, and we illustrate this framework with empirical experiments with real-world data. We apply a bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network to a data set of more than 1 million tweets to generate a two-dimensional ideological-bias and content-quality measurement for each tweet. We then infer a ``media-bias chart'' of (bias, quality) coordinates for the media outlets by integrating the (bias, quality) measurements of the tweets of the media outlets. We also apply a variety of baseline machine-learning methods, such as a naive-Bayes method and a support-vector machine (SVM), to infer the bias and quality values for each tweet. All of these baseline approaches are based on a bag-of-words approach. We find that the LSTM-network approach has the best performance of the examined methods. Our results illustrate the importance of leveraging word order into machine-learning methods in text analysis."
An Empirical Study on the Bugs Found while Reusing Pre-trained Natural Language Processing Models,"In NLP, reusing pre-trained models instead of training from scratch has gained popularity; however, NLP models are mostly black boxes, very large, and often require significant resources. To ease, models trained with large corpora are made available, and developers reuse them for different problems. In contrast, developers mostly build their models from scratch for traditional DL-related problems. By doing so, they have control over the choice of algorithms, data processing, model structure, tuning hyperparameters, etc. Whereas in NLP, due to the reuse of the pre-trained models, NLP developers are limited to little to no control over such design decisions. They either apply tuning or transfer learning on pre-trained models to meet their requirements. Also, NLP models and their corresponding datasets are significantly larger than the traditional DL models and require heavy computation. Such reasons often lead to bugs in the system while reusing the pre-trained models. While bugs in traditional DL software have been intensively studied, the nature of extensive reuse and black-box structure motivates us to understand the different types of bugs that occur while reusing NLP models? What are the root causes of those bugs? How do these bugs affect the system? To answer these questions, We studied the bugs reported while reusing the 11 popular NLP models. We mined 9,214 issues from GitHub repositories and identified 984 bugs. We created a taxonomy with bug types, root causes, and impacts. Our observations led to several findings, including limited access to model internals resulting in a lack of robustness, lack of input validation leading to the propagation of algorithmic and data bias, and high-resource consumption causing more crashes, etc. Our observations suggest several bug patterns, which would greatly facilitate further efforts in reducing bugs in pre-trained models and code reuse."
Automating Systematic Literature Reviews with Natural Language Processing and Text Mining: a Systematic Literature Review,"Objectives: An SLR is presented focusing on text mining based automation of SLR creation. The present review identifies the objectives of the automation studies and the aspects of those steps that were automated. In so doing, the various ML techniques used, challenges, limitations and scope of further research are explained.  Methods: Accessible published literature studies that primarily focus on automation of study selection, study quality assessment, data extraction and data synthesis portions of SLR. Twenty-nine studies were analyzed.  Results: This review identifies the objectives of the automation studies, steps within the study selection, study quality assessment, data extraction and data synthesis portions that were automated, the various ML techniques used, challenges, limitations and scope of further research.  Discussion: We describe uses of NLP/TM techniques to support increased automation of systematic literature reviews. This area has attracted increase attention in the last decade due to significant gaps in the applicability of TM to automate steps in the SLR process. There are significant gaps in the application of TM and related automation techniques in the areas of data extraction, monitoring, quality assessment and data synthesis. There is thus a need for continued progress in this area, and this is expected to ultimately significantly facilitate the construction of systematic literature reviews."
"A Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing Analysis of Youth Perspectives: Key Trends and Focus Areas for Sustainable Youth Development Policies","Investing in children and youth is a critical step towards inclusive, equitable, and sustainable development for current and future generations. Several international agendas for accomplishing common global goals emphasize the need for active youth participation and engagement for sustainable development. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development emphasizes the need for youth engagement and the inclusion of youth perspectives as an important step toward addressing each of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. The aim of this study is to analyze youth perspectives, values, and sentiments towards issues addressed by the 17 Sustainable Development Goals through social network analysis using machine learning. Social network data collected during 7 major sustainability conferences aimed at engaging children and youth is analyzed using natural language processing techniques for sentiment analysis. This data categorized using a natural language processing text classifier trained on a sample dataset of social network data during the 7 youth sustainability conferences for deeper understanding of youth perspectives in relation to the SDGs. Machine learning identified demographic and location attributes and features are utilized in order to identify bias and demographic differences between ages, gender, and race among youth. Using natural language processing, the qualitative data collected from over 7 different countries in 3 languages are systematically translated, categorized, and analyzed, revealing key trends and focus areas for sustainable youth development policies. The obtained results reveal the general youth's depth of knowledge on sustainable development and their attitudes towards each of the 17 SDGs. The findings of this study serve as a guide toward better understanding the interests, roles, and perspectives of children and youth in achieving the goals of Agenda 2030."
Continual Learning of Natural Language Processing Tasks: A Survey,"Continual learning (CL) is a learning paradigm that emulates the human capability of learning and accumulating knowledge continually without forgetting the previously learned knowledge and also transferring the learned knowledge to help learn new tasks better. This survey presents a comprehensive review and analysis of the recent progress of CL in NLP, which has significant differences from CL in computer vision and machine learning. It covers (1) all CL settings with a taxonomy of existing techniques; (2) catastrophic forgetting (CF) prevention, (3) knowledge transfer (KT), which is particularly important for NLP tasks; and (4) some theory and the hidden challenge of inter-task class separation (ICS). (1), (3) and (4) have not been included in the existing survey. Finally, a list of future directions is discussed."
A Survey on Backdoor Attack and Defense in Natural Language Processing,"Deep learning is becoming increasingly popular in real-life applications, especially in natural language processing (NLP). Users often choose training outsourcing or adopt third-party data and models due to data and computation resources being limited. In such a situation, training data and models are exposed to the public. As a result, attackers can manipulate the training process to inject some triggers into the model, which is called backdoor attack. Backdoor attack is quite stealthy and difficult to be detected because it has little inferior influence on the model's performance for the clean samples. To get a precise grasp and understanding of this problem, in this paper, we conduct a comprehensive review of backdoor attacks and defenses in the field of NLP. Besides, we summarize benchmark datasets and point out the open issues to design credible systems to defend against backdoor attacks."
Analyse der Entwicklungstreiber militärischer Schwarmdrohnen durch Natural Language Processing,"Military drones are taking an increasingly prominent role in armed conflict, and the use of multiple drones in a swarm can be useful. Who the drivers of the research are and what sub-domains exist is analyzed and visually presented in this research using NLP techniques based on 946 studies. Most research is conducted in the Western world, led by the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany. Through Tf-idf scoring, it is shown that countries have significant differences in the subdomains studied. Overall, 2019 and 2020 saw the most works published, with significant interest in military swarm drones as early as 2008. This study provides a first glimpse into research in this area and prompts further investigation."
"Searching for Carriers of the Diffuse Interstellar Bands Across Disciplines, using Natural Language Processing","The explosion of scientific publications overloads researchers with information. This is even more dramatic for interdisciplinary studies, where several fields need to be explored. A tool to help researchers overcome this is Natural Language Processing (NLP): a machine-learning (ML) technique that allows scientists to automatically synthesize information from many articles. As a practical example, we have used NLP to conduct an interdisciplinary search for compounds that could be carriers for Diffuse Interstellar Bands (DIBs), a long-standing open question in astrophysics. We have trained a NLP model on a corpus of 1.5 million cross-domain articles in open access, and fine-tuned this model with a corpus of astrophysical publications about DIBs. Our analysis points us toward several molecules, studied primarily in biology, having transitions at the wavelengths of several DIBs and composed of abundant interstellar atoms. Several of these molecules contain chromophores, small molecular groups responsible for the molecule's colour, that could be promising candidate carriers. Identifying viable carriers demonstrates the value of using NLP to tackle open scientific questions, in an interdisciplinary manner."
"Discover, Explanation, Improvement: Automatic Slice Detection Framework for Natural Language Processing","Current natural language processing (NLP) models such as BERT and RoBERTa have achieved high overall performance, but they often make systematic errors due to bias or certain difficult features to learn. Thus research on slice detection models (SDM) which automatically identifies underperforming groups of datapoints has gradually caught more attention, which aims at both understanding model behaviors and providing insights for future model training and designing. However, there is little systematic research on SDM and quantitative evaluation of its assessment for NLP models. Our paper fills this gap by proposing ""Discover, Explanation, Improvement"" framework that discovers coherent and underperforming groups of datapoints and unites datapoints of each slice under human-understandable concepts; it also provides comprehensive evaluation tasks and the corresponding quantitative metrics, which enable convenient comparison for future works. Results show that our framework can accurately select error-prone datapoints with informative semantic features that summarize error patterns, based on which it directly boosts model performance by an average of 2.85 points based on trained models without tuning any parameters across multiple datasets."
Bridging Fairness and Environmental Sustainability in Natural Language Processing,"Fairness and environmental impact are important research directions for the sustainable development of artificial intelligence. However, while each topic is an active research area in natural language processing (NLP), there is a surprising lack of research on the interplay between the two fields. This lacuna is highly problematic, since there is increasing evidence that an exclusive focus on fairness can actually hinder environmental sustainability, and vice versa. In this work, we shed light on this crucial intersection in NLP by (1) investigating the efficiency of current fairness approaches through surveying example methods for reducing unfair stereotypical bias from the literature, and (2) evaluating a common technique to reduce energy consumption (and thus environmental impact) of English NLP models, knowledge distillation (KD), for its impact on fairness. In this case study, we evaluate the effect of important KD factors, including layer and dimensionality reduction, with respect to: (a) performance on the distillation task (natural language inference and semantic similarity prediction), and (b) multiple measures and dimensions of stereotypical bias (e.g., gender bias measured via the Word Embedding Association Test). Our results lead us to clarify current assumptions regarding the effect of KD on unfair bias: contrary to other findings, we show that KD can actually decrease model fairness."
Privacy-Preserving Models for Legal Natural Language Processing,"Pre-training large transformer models with in-domain data improves domain adaptation and helps gain performance on the domain-specific downstream tasks. However, sharing models pre-trained on potentially sensitive data is prone to adversarial privacy attacks. In this paper, we asked to which extent we can guarantee privacy of pre-training data and, at the same time, achieve better downstream performance on legal tasks without the need of additional labeled data. We extensively experiment with scalable self-supervised learning of transformer models under the formal paradigm of differential privacy and show that under specific training configurations we can improve downstream performance without sacrifying privacy protection for the in-domain data. Our main contribution is utilizing differential privacy for large-scale pre-training of transformer language models in the legal NLP domain, which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been addressed before."
Tri-Attention: Explicit Context-Aware Attention Mechanism for Natural Language Processing,"In natural language processing (NLP), the context of a word or sentence plays an essential role. Contextual information such as the semantic representation of a passage or historical dialogue forms an essential part of a conversation and a precise understanding of the present phrase or sentence. However, the standard attention mechanisms typically generate weights using query and key but ignore context, forming a Bi-Attention framework, despite their great success in modeling sequence alignment. This Bi-Attention mechanism does not explicitly model the interactions between the contexts, queries and keys of target sequences, missing important contextual information and resulting in poor attention performance. Accordingly, a novel and general triple-attention (Tri-Attention) framework expands the standard Bi-Attention mechanism and explicitly interacts query, key, and context by incorporating context as the third dimension in calculating relevance scores. Four variants of Tri-Attention are generated by expanding the two-dimensional vector-based additive, dot-product, scaled dot-product, and bilinear operations in Bi-Attention to the tensor operations for Tri-Attention. Extensive experiments on three NLP tasks demonstrate that Tri-Attention outperforms about 30 state-of-the-art non-attention, standard Bi-Attention, contextual Bi-Attention approaches and pretrained neural language models1."
A Critical Reflection and Forward Perspective on Empathy and Natural Language Processing,"We review the state of research on empathy in natural language processing and identify the following issues: (1) empathy definitions are absent or abstract, which (2) leads to low construct validity and reproducibility. Moreover, (3) emotional empathy is overemphasized, skewing our focus to a narrow subset of simplified tasks. We believe these issues hinder research progress and argue that current directions will benefit from a clear conceptualization that includes operationalizing cognitive empathy components. Our main objectives are to provide insight and guidance on empathy conceptualization for NLP research objectives and to encourage researchers to pursue the overlooked opportunities in this area, highly relevant, e.g., for clinical and educational sectors."
Classification of Misinformation in New Articles using Natural Language Processing and a Recurrent Neural Network,"This paper seeks to address the classification of misinformation in news articles using a Long Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network. Articles were taken from 2018; a year that was filled with reporters writing about President Donald Trump, Special Counsel Robert Mueller, the Fifa World Cup, and Russia. The model presented successfully classifies these articles with an accuracy score of 0.779944. We consider this to be successful because the model was trained on articles that included languages other than English as well as incomplete, or fragmented, articles."
Design a Sustainable Micro-mobility Future: Trends and Challenges in the United States and European Union Using Natural Language Processing Techniques,"Micro-mobility is promising to contribute to sustainable cities in the future with its efficiency and low cost. To better design such a sustainable future, it is necessary to understand the trends and challenges. Thus, we examined people's opinions on micro-mobility in the US and the EU using Tweets. We used topic modeling based on advanced natural language processing techniques and categorized the data into seven topics: promotion and service, mobility, technical features, acceptance, recreation, infrastructure and regulations. Furthermore, using sentiment analysis, we investigated people's positive and negative attitudes towards specific aspects of these topics and compared the patterns of the trends and challenges in the US and the EU. We found that 1) promotion and service included the majority of Twitter discussions in the both regions, 2) the EU had more positive opinions than the US, 3) micro-mobility devices were more widely used for utilitarian mobility and recreational purposes in the EU than in the US, and 4) compared to the EU, people in the US had many more concerns related to infrastructure and regulation issues. These findings help us understand the trends and challenges and prioritize different aspects in micro-mobility to improve their safety and experience across the two areas for designing a more sustainable micro-mobility future."
A Survey of Active Learning for Natural Language Processing,"In this work, we provide a survey of active learning (AL) for its applications in natural language processing (NLP). In addition to a fine-grained categorization of query strategies, we also investigate several other important aspects of applying AL to NLP problems. These include AL for structured prediction tasks, annotation cost, model learning (especially with deep neural models), and starting and stopping AL. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of related topics and future directions."
"Knowledge Representation for Conceptual, Motivational, and Affective Processes in Natural Language Communication","Natural language communication is an intricate and complex process. The speaker usually begins with an intention and motivation of what is to be communicated, and what effects are expected from the communication, while taking into consideration the listener's mental model to concoct an appropriate sentence. The listener likewise has to interpret what the speaker means, and respond accordingly, also with the speaker's mental state in mind. To do this successfully, conceptual, motivational, and affective processes have to be represented appropriately to drive the language generation and understanding processes. Language processing has succeeded well with the big data approach in applications such as chatbots and machine translation. However, in human-robot collaborative social communication and in using natural language for delivering precise instructions to robots, a deeper representation of the conceptual, motivational, and affective processes is needed. This paper capitalizes on the UGALRS (Unified General Autonomous and Language Reasoning System) framework and the CD+ (Conceptual Representation Plus) representational scheme to illustrate how social communication through language is supported by a knowledge representational scheme that handles conceptual, motivational, and affective processes in a deep and general way. Though a small set of concepts, motivations, and emotions is treated in this paper, its main contribution is in articulating a general framework of knowledge representation and processing to link these aspects together in serving the purpose of natural language communication for an intelligent system."
The State of Profanity Obfuscation in Natural Language Processing,"Work on hate speech has made the consideration of rude and harmful examples in scientific publications inevitable. This raises various problems, such as whether or not to obscure profanities. While science must accurately disclose what it does, the unwarranted spread of hate speech is harmful to readers, and increases its internet frequency. While maintaining publications' professional appearance, obfuscating profanities makes it challenging to evaluate the content, especially for non-native speakers. Surveying 150 ACL papers, we discovered that obfuscation is usually employed for English but not other languages, and even so quite uneven. We discuss the problems with obfuscation and suggest a multilingual community resource called PrOf that has a Python module to standardize profanity obfuscation processes. We believe PrOf can help scientific publication policies to make hate speech work accessible and comparable, irrespective of language."
On the Explainability of Natural Language Processing Deep Models,"While there has been a recent explosion of work on ExplainableAI ExAI on deep models that operate on imagery and tabular data, textual datasets present new challenges to the ExAI community. Such challenges can be attributed to the lack of input structure in textual data, the use of word embeddings that add to the opacity of the models and the difficulty of the visualization of the inner workings of deep models when they are trained on textual data.  Lately, methods have been developed to address the aforementioned challenges and present satisfactory explanations on Natural Language Processing (NLP) models. However, such methods are yet to be studied in a comprehensive framework where common challenges are properly stated and rigorous evaluation practices and metrics are proposed. Motivated to democratize ExAI methods in the NLP field, we present in this work a survey that studies model-agnostic as well as model-specific explainability methods on NLP models. Such methods can either develop inherently interpretable NLP models or operate on pre-trained models in a post-hoc manner. We make this distinction and we further decompose the methods into three categories according to what they explain: (1) word embeddings (input-level), (2) inner workings of NLP models (processing-level) and (3) models' decisions (output-level). We also detail the different evaluation approaches interpretability methods in the NLP field. Finally, we present a case-study on the well-known neural machine translation in an appendix and we propose promising future research directions for ExAI in the NLP field."
Natural Language Processing for Cognitive Analysis of Emotions,"Emotion analysis in texts suffers from two major limitations: annotated gold-standard corpora are mostly small and homogeneous, and emotion identification is often simplified as a sentence-level classification problem. To address these issues, we introduce a new annotation scheme for exploring emotions and their causes, along with a new French dataset composed of autobiographical accounts of an emotional scene. The texts were collected by applying the Cognitive Analysis of Emotions developed by A. Finkel to help people improve on their emotion management. The method requires the manual analysis of an emotional event by a coach trained in Cognitive Analysis. We present a rule-based approach to automatically annotate emotions and their semantic roles (e.g. emotion causes) to facilitate the identification of relevant aspects by the coach. We investigate future directions for emotion analysis using graph structures."
A Survey of Methods for Addressing Class Imbalance in Deep-Learning Based Natural Language Processing,"Many natural language processing (NLP) tasks are naturally imbalanced, as some target categories occur much more frequently than others in the real world. In such scenarios, current NLP models still tend to perform poorly on less frequent classes. Addressing class imbalance in NLP is an active research topic, yet, finding a good approach for a particular task and imbalance scenario is difficult.  With this survey, the first overview on class imbalance in deep-learning based NLP, we provide guidance for NLP researchers and practitioners dealing with imbalanced data. We first discuss various types of controlled and real-world class imbalance. Our survey then covers approaches that have been explicitly proposed for class-imbalanced NLP tasks or, originating in the computer vision community, have been evaluated on them. We organize the methods by whether they are based on sampling, data augmentation, choice of loss function, staged learning, or model design. Finally, we discuss open problems such as dealing with multi-label scenarios, and propose systematic benchmarking and reporting in order to move forward on this problem as a community."
Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing and Understanding in Space: A Methodological Framework and Four ESA Case Studies,"The European Space Agency is well known as a powerful force for scientific discovery in numerous areas related to Space. The amount and depth of the knowledge produced throughout the different missions carried out by ESA and their contribution to scientific progress is enormous, involving large collections of documents like scientific publications, feasibility studies, technical reports, and quality management procedures, among many others. Through initiatives like the Open Space Innovation Platform, ESA also acts as a hub for new ideas coming from the wider community across different challenges, contributing to a virtuous circle of scientific discovery and innovation. Handling such wealth of information, of which large part is unstructured text, is a colossal task that goes beyond human capabilities, hence requiring automation. In this paper, we present a methodological framework based on artificial intelligence and natural language processing and understanding to automatically extract information from Space documents, generating value from it, and illustrate such framework through several case studies implemented across different functional areas of ESA, including Mission Design, Quality Assurance, Long-Term Data Preservation, and the Open Space Innovation Platform. In doing so, we demonstrate the value of these technologies in several tasks ranging from effortlessly searching and recommending Space information to automatically determining how innovative an idea can be, answering questions about Space, and generating quizzes regarding quality procedures. Each of these accomplishments represents a step forward in the application of increasingly intelligent AI systems in Space, from structuring and facilitating information access to intelligent systems capable to understand and reason with such information."
"Is Reinforcement Learning (Not) for Natural Language Processing: Benchmarks, Baselines, and Building Blocks for Natural Language Policy Optimization","We tackle the problem of aligning pre-trained large language models (LMs) with human preferences. If we view text generation as a sequential decision-making problem, reinforcement learning (RL) appears to be a natural conceptual framework. However, using RL for LM-based generation faces empirical challenges, including training instability due to the combinatorial action space, as well as a lack of open-source libraries and benchmarks customized for LM alignment. Thus, a question rises in the research community: is RL a practical paradigm for NLP?  To help answer this, we first introduce an open-source modular library, RL4LMs (Reinforcement Learning for Language Models), for optimizing language generators with RL. The library consists of on-policy RL algorithms that can be used to train any encoder or encoder-decoder LM in the HuggingFace library (Wolf et al. 2020) with an arbitrary reward function. Next, we present the GRUE (General Reinforced-language Understanding Evaluation) benchmark, a set of 6 language generation tasks which are supervised not by target strings, but by reward functions which capture automated measures of human preference.GRUE is the first leaderboard-style evaluation of RL algorithms for NLP tasks. Finally, we introduce an easy-to-use, performant RL algorithm, NLPO (Natural Language Policy Optimization)} that learns to effectively reduce the combinatorial action space in language generation. We show 1) that RL techniques are generally better than supervised methods at aligning LMs to human preferences; and 2) that NLPO exhibits greater stability and performance than previous policy gradient methods (e.g., PPO (Schulman et al. 2017)), based on both automatic and human evaluations."
A Decade of Knowledge Graphs in Natural Language Processing: A Survey,"In pace with developments in the research field of artificial intelligence, knowledge graphs (KGs) have attracted a surge of interest from both academia and industry. As a representation of semantic relations between entities, KGs have proven to be particularly relevant for natural language processing (NLP), experiencing a rapid spread and wide adoption within recent years. Given the increasing amount of research work in this area, several KG-related approaches have been surveyed in the NLP research community. However, a comprehensive study that categorizes established topics and reviews the maturity of individual research streams remains absent to this day. Contributing to closing this gap, we systematically analyzed 507 papers from the literature on KGs in NLP. Our survey encompasses a multifaceted review of tasks, research types, and contributions. As a result, we present a structured overview of the research landscape, provide a taxonomy of tasks, summarize our findings, and highlight directions for future work."
DR.BENCH: Diagnostic Reasoning Benchmark for Clinical Natural Language Processing,"The meaningful use of electronic health records (EHR) continues to progress in the digital era with clinical decision support systems augmented by artificial intelligence. A priority in improving provider experience is to overcome information overload and reduce the cognitive burden so fewer medical errors and cognitive biases are introduced during patient care. One major type of medical error is diagnostic error due to systematic or predictable errors in judgment that rely on heuristics. The potential for clinical natural language processing (cNLP) to model diagnostic reasoning in humans with forward reasoning from data to diagnosis and potentially reduce the cognitive burden and medical error has not been investigated. Existing tasks to advance the science in cNLP have largely focused on information extraction and named entity recognition through classification tasks. We introduce a novel suite of tasks coined as Diagnostic Reasoning Benchmarks, DR.BENCH, as a new benchmark for developing and evaluating cNLP models with clinical diagnostic reasoning ability. The suite includes six tasks from ten publicly available datasets addressing clinical text understanding, medical knowledge reasoning, and diagnosis generation. DR.BENCH is the first clinical suite of tasks designed to be a natural language generation framework to evaluate pre-trained language models. Experiments with state-of-the-art pre-trained generative language models using large general domain models and models that were continually trained on a medical corpus demonstrate opportunities for improvement when evaluated in DR. BENCH. We share DR. BENCH as a publicly available GitLab repository with a systematic approach to load and evaluate models for the cNLP community."
Natural Language Processing Methods to Identify Oncology Patients at High Risk for Acute Care with Clinical Notes,"Clinical notes are an essential component of a health record. This paper evaluates how natural language processing (NLP) can be used to identify the risk of acute care use (ACU) in oncology patients, once chemotherapy starts. Risk prediction using structured health data (SHD) is now standard, but predictions using free-text formats are complex. This paper explores the use of free-text notes for the prediction of ACU instead of SHD. Deep Learning models were compared to manually engineered language features. Results show that SHD models minimally outperform NLP models; an l1-penalised logistic regression with SHD achieved a C-statistic of 0.748 (95%-CI: 0.735, 0.762), while the same model with language features achieved 0.730 (95%-CI: 0.717, 0.745) and a transformer-based model achieved 0.702 (95%-CI: 0.688, 0.717). This paper shows how language models can be used in clinical applications and underlines how risk bias is different for diverse patient groups, even using only free-text data."
A general-purpose material property data extraction pipeline from large polymer corpora using Natural Language Processing,"The ever-increasing number of materials science articles makes it hard to infer chemistry-structure-property relations from published literature. We used natural language processing (NLP) methods to automatically extract material property data from the abstracts of polymer literature. As a component of our pipeline, we trained MaterialsBERT, a language model, using 2.4 million materials science abstracts, which outperforms other baseline models in three out of five named entity recognition datasets when used as the encoder for text. Using this pipeline, we obtained ~300,000 material property records from ~130,000 abstracts in 60 hours. The extracted data was analyzed for a diverse range of applications such as fuel cells, supercapacitors, and polymer solar cells to recover non-trivial insights. The data extracted through our pipeline is made available through a web platform at https://polymerscholar.org which can be used to locate material property data recorded in abstracts conveniently. This work demonstrates the feasibility of an automatic pipeline that starts from published literature and ends with a complete set of extracted material property information."
Automated Fidelity Assessment for Strategy Training in Inpatient Rehabilitation using Natural Language Processing,"Strategy training is a multidisciplinary rehabilitation approach that teaches skills to reduce disability among those with cognitive impairments following a stroke. Strategy training has been shown in randomized, controlled clinical trials to be a more feasible and efficacious intervention for promoting independence than traditional rehabilitation approaches. A standardized fidelity assessment is used to measure adherence to treatment principles by examining guided and directed verbal cues in video recordings of rehabilitation sessions. Although the fidelity assessment for detecting guided and directed verbal cues is valid and feasible for single-site studies, it can become labor intensive, time consuming, and expensive in large, multi-site pragmatic trials. To address this challenge to widespread strategy training implementation, we leveraged natural language processing (NLP) techniques to automate the strategy training fidelity assessment, i.e., to automatically identify guided and directed verbal cues from video recordings of rehabilitation sessions. We developed a rule-based NLP algorithm, a long-short term memory (LSTM) model, and a bidirectional encoder representation from transformers (BERT) model for this task. The best performance was achieved by the BERT model with a 0.8075 F1-score. This BERT model was verified on an external validation dataset collected from a separate major regional health system and achieved an F1 score of 0.8259, which shows that the BERT model generalizes well. The findings from this study hold widespread promise in psychology and rehabilitation intervention research and practice."
The Role of Explanatory Value in Natural Language Processing,"A key aim of science is explanation, yet the idea of explaining language phenomena has taken a backseat in mainstream Natural Language Processing (NLP) and many other areas of Artificial Intelligence. I argue that explanation of linguistic behaviour should be a main goal of NLP, and that this is not the same as making NLP models explainable. To illustrate these ideas, some recent models of human language production are compared with each other. I conclude by asking what it would mean for NLP research and institutional policies if our community took explanatory value seriously, while heeding some possible pitfalls."
Conversion of Acoustic Signal (Speech) Into Text By Digital Filter using Natural Language Processing,"One of the most crucial aspects of communication in daily life is speech recognition. Speech recognition that is based on natural language processing is one of the essential elements in the conversion of one system to another. In this paper, we created an interface that transforms speech and other auditory inputs into text using a digital filter. Contrary to the many methods for this conversion, it is also possible for linguistic faults to appear occasionally, gender recognition, speech recognition that is unsuccessful (cannot recognize voice), and gender recognition to fail. Since technical problems are involved, we developed a program that acts as a mediator to prevent initiating software issues in order to eliminate even this little deviation. Its planned MFCC and HMM are in sync with its AI system. As a result, technical errors have been avoided."
MalDetConv: Automated Behaviour-based Malware Detection Framework Based on Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning Techniques,"The popularity of Windows attracts the attention of hackers/cyber-attackers, making Windows devices the primary target of malware attacks in recent years. Several sophisticated malware variants and anti-detection methods have been significantly enhanced and as a result, traditional malware detection techniques have become less effective. This work presents MalBehavD-V1, a new behavioural dataset of Windows Application Programming Interface (API) calls extracted from benign and malware executable files using the dynamic analysis approach. In addition, we present MalDetConV, a new automated behaviour-based framework for detecting both existing and zero-day malware attacks. MalDetConv uses a text processing-based encoder to transform features of API calls into a suitable format supported by deep learning models. It then uses a hybrid of convolutional neural network (CNN) and bidirectional gated recurrent unit (CNN-BiGRU) automatic feature extractor to select high-level features of the API Calls which are then fed to a fully connected neural network module for malware classification. MalDetConv also uses an explainable component that reveals features that contributed to the final classification outcome, helping the decision-making process for security analysts. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated using our MalBehavD-V1 dataset and other benchmark datasets. The detection results demonstrate the effectiveness of MalDetConv over the state-of-the-art techniques with detection accuracy of 96.10%, 95.73%, 98.18%, and 99.93% achieved while detecting unseen malware from MalBehavD-V1, Allan and John, Brazilian, and Ki-D datasets, respectively. The experimental results show that MalDetConv is highly accurate in detecting both known and zero-day malware attacks on Windows devices."
Efficient Methods for Natural Language Processing: A Survey,"Recent work in natural language processing (NLP) has yielded appealing results from scaling model parameters and training data; however, using only scale to improve performance means that resource consumption also grows. Such resources include data, time, storage, or energy, all of which are naturally limited and unevenly distributed. This motivates research into efficient methods that require fewer resources to achieve similar results. This survey synthesizes and relates current methods and findings in efficient NLP. We aim to provide both guidance for conducting NLP under limited resources, and point towards promising research directions for developing more efficient methods."
Few-Shot Learning for Clinical Natural Language Processing Using Siamese Neural Networks,"Clinical Natural Language Processing (NLP) has become an emerging technology in healthcare that leverages a large amount of free-text data in electronic health records (EHRs) to improve patient care, support clinical decisions, and facilitate clinical and translational science research. Recently, deep learning has achieved state-of-the-art performance in many clinical NLP tasks. However, training deep learning models usually requires large annotated datasets, which are normally not publicly available and can be time-consuming to build in clinical domains. Working with smaller annotated datasets is typical in clinical NLP and therefore, ensuring that deep learning models perform well is crucial for the models to be used in real-world applications. A widely adopted approach is fine-tuning existing Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), but these attempts fall short when the training dataset contains only a few annotated samples. Few-Shot Learning (FSL) has recently been investigated to tackle this problem. Siamese Neural Network (SNN) has been widely utilized as an FSL approach in computer vision, but has not been studied well in NLP. Furthermore, the literature on its applications in clinical domains is scarce. In this paper, we propose two SNN-based FSL approaches for clinical NLP, including Pre-Trained SNN (PT-SNN) and SNN with Second-Order Embeddings (SOE-SNN). We evaluated the proposed approaches on two clinical tasks, namely clinical text classification and clinical named entity recognition. We tested three few-shot settings including 4-shot, 8-shot, and 16-shot learning. Both clinical NLP tasks were benchmarked using three PLMs, including BERT,BioBERT, and BioClinicalBERT. The experimental results verified the effectiveness of the proposed SNN-based FSL approaches in both NLP tasks."
Large-scale photonic natural language processing,"Modern machine learning applications require huge artificial networks demanding in computational power and memory. Light-based platforms promise ultra-fast and energy-efficient hardware, which may help in realizing next-generation data processing devices. However, current photonic networks are limited by the number of input-output nodes that can be processed in a single shot. This restricted network capacity prevents their application to relevant large-scale problems such as natural language processing. Here, we realize a photonic processor with a capacity exceeding 1.5 \times 10^{10} optical nodes, more than one order of magnitude larger than any previous implementation, which enables photonic large-scale text encoding and classification. By exploiting the full three-dimensional structure of the optical field propagating in free space, we overcome the interpolation threshold and reach the over-parametrized region of machine learning, a condition that allows high-performance natural language processing with a minimal fraction of training points. Our results provide a novel solution to scale-up light-driven computing and open the route to photonic language processing."
Stock Market Prediction using Natural Language Processing -- A Survey,"The stock market is a network which provides a platform for almost all major economic transactions. While investing in the stock market is a good idea, investing in individual stocks may not be, especially for the casual investor. Smart stock-picking requires in-depth research and plenty of dedication. Predicting this stock value offers enormous arbitrage profit opportunities. This attractiveness of finding a solution has prompted researchers to find a way past problems like volatility, seasonality, and dependence on time. This paper surveys recent literature in the domain of natural language processing and machine learning techniques used to predict stock market movements. The main contributions of this paper include the sophisticated categorizations of many recent articles and the illustration of the recent trends of research in stock market prediction and its related areas."
Living-off-the-Land Abuse Detection Using Natural Language Processing and Supervised Learning,"Living-off-the-Land is an evasion technique used by attackers where native binaries are abused to achieve malicious intent. Since these binaries are often legitimate system files, detecting such abuse is difficult and often missed by modern anti-virus software. This paper proposes a novel abuse detection algorithm using raw command strings. First, natural language processing techniques such as regular expressions and one-hot encoding are utilized for encoding the command strings as numerical token vectors. Next, supervised learning techniques are employed to learn the malicious patterns in the token vectors and ultimately predict the command's label. Finally, the model is evaluated using statistics from the training phase and in a virtual environment to compare its effectiveness at detecting new commands to existing anti-virus products such as Windows Defender."
"Kencorpus: A Kenyan Language Corpus of Swahili, Dholuo and Luhya for Natural Language Processing Tasks","Indigenous African languages are categorized as under-served in Artificial Intelligence and suffer poor digital inclusivity and information access. The challenge has been how to use machine learning and deep learning models without the requisite data. Kencorpus is a Kenyan Language corpus that intends to bridge the gap on how to collect, and store text and speech data that is good enough to enable data-driven solutions in applications such as machine translation, question answering and transcription in multilingual communities. Kencorpus is a corpus (text and speech) for three languages predominantly spoken in Kenya: Swahili, Dholuo and Luhya (dialects Lumarachi, Lulogooli and Lubukusu). This corpus intends to fill the gap of developing a dataset that can be used for Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning tasks for low-resource languages. Each of these languages contributed text and speech data for the language corpus. Data collection was done by researchers from communities, schools and collaborating partners (media, publishers). Kencorpus has a collection of 5,594 items, being 4,442 texts (5.6million words) and 1,152 speech files (177hrs). Based on this data, other datasets were also developed e.g POS tagging sets for Dholuo and Luhya (50,000 and 93,000 words tagged respectively), Question-Answer pairs from Swahili texts (7,537 QA pairs) and Translation of texts into Swahili (12,400 sentences). The datasets are useful for machine learning tasks such as text processing, annotation and translation. The project also undertook proof of concept systems in speech to text and machine learning for QA task, with initial results confirming the usability of the Kencorpus to the machine learning community. Kencorpus is the first such corpus of its kind for these low resource languages and forms a basis of learning and sharing experiences for similar works."
Review of Natural Language Processing in Pharmacology,"Natural language processing (NLP) is an area of artificial intelligence that applies information technologies to process the human language, understand it to a certain degree, and use it in various applications. This area has rapidly developed in the last few years and now employs modern variants of deep neural networks to extract relevant patterns from large text corpora. The main objective of this work is to survey the recent use of NLP in the field of pharmacology. As our work shows, NLP is a highly relevant information extraction and processing approach for pharmacology. It has been used extensively, from intelligent searches through thousands of medical documents to finding traces of adversarial drug interactions in social media. We split our coverage into five categories to survey modern NLP methodology, commonly addressed tasks, relevant textual data, knowledge bases, and useful programming libraries. We split each of the five categories into appropriate subcategories, describe their main properties and ideas, and summarize them in a tabular form. The resulting survey presents a comprehensive overview of the area, useful to practitioners and interested observers."
Brand Celebrity Matching Model Based on Natural Language Processing,"Celebrity Endorsement is one of the most significant strategies in brand communication. Nowadays, more and more companies try to build a vivid characteristic for themselves. Therefore, their brand identity communications should accord with some characteristics as humans and regulations. However, the previous works mostly stop by assumptions, instead of proposing a specific way to perform matching between brands and celebrities. In this paper, we propose a brand celebrity matching model (BCM) based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Given a brand and a celebrity, we firstly obtain some descriptive documents of them from the Internet, then summarize these documents, and finally calculate a matching degree between the brand and the celebrity to determine whether they are matched. According to the experimental result, our proposed model outperforms the best baselines with a 0.362 F1 score and 6.3% of accuracy, which indicates the effectiveness and application value of our model in the real-world scene. What's more, to our best knowledge, the proposed BCM model is the first work on using NLP to solve endorsement issues, so it can provide some novel research ideas and methodologies for the following works."
On the evolution of research in hypersonics: application of natural language processing and machine learning,"Research and development in hypersonics have progressed significantly in recent years, with various military and commercial applications being demonstrated increasingly. Public and private organizations in several countries have been investing in hypersonics, with the aim to overtake their competitors and secure/improve strategic advantage and deterrence. For these organizations, being able to identify emerging technologies in a timely and reliable manner is paramount. Recent advances in information technology have made it possible to analyze large amounts of data, extract hidden patterns, and provide decision-makers with new insights. In this study, we focus on scientific publications about hypersonics within the period of 2000-2020, and employ natural language processing and machine learning to characterize the research landscape by identifying 12 key latent research themes and analyzing their temporal evolution. Our publication similarity analysis revealed patterns that are indicative of cycles during two decades of research. The study offers a comprehensive analysis of the research field and the fact that the research themes are algorithmically extracted removes subjectivity from the exercise and enables consistent comparisons between topics and between time intervals."
Differential Privacy in Natural Language Processing: The Story So Far,"As the tide of Big Data continues to influence the landscape of Natural Language Processing (NLP), the utilization of modern NLP methods has grounded itself in this data, in order to tackle a variety of text-based tasks. These methods without a doubt can include private or otherwise personally identifiable information. As such, the question of privacy in NLP has gained fervor in recent years, coinciding with the development of new Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs). Among these PETs, Differential Privacy boasts several desirable qualities in the conversation surrounding data privacy. Naturally, the question becomes whether Differential Privacy is applicable in the largely unstructured realm of NLP. This topic has sparked novel research, which is unified in one basic goal: how can one adapt Differential Privacy to NLP methods? This paper aims to summarize the vulnerabilities addressed by Differential Privacy, the current thinking, and above all, the crucial next steps that must be considered."
Automated Utterance Labeling of Conversations Using Natural Language Processing,"Conversational data is essential in psychology because it can help researchers understand individuals cognitive processes, emotions, and behaviors. Utterance labelling is a common strategy for analyzing this type of data. The development of NLP algorithms allows researchers to automate this task. However, psychological conversational data present some challenges to NLP researchers, including multilabel classification, a large number of classes, and limited available data. This study explored how automated labels generated by NLP methods are comparable to human labels in the context of conversations on adulthood transition. We proposed strategies to handle three common challenges raised in psychological studies. Our findings showed that the deep learning method with domain adaptation (RoBERTa-CON) outperformed all other machine learning methods; and the hierarchical labelling system that we proposed was shown to help researchers strategically analyze conversational data. Our Python code and NLP model are available at https://github.com/mlaricheva/automated_labeling."
Searching for chromate replacements using natural language processing and machine learning algorithms,"The past few years has seen the application of machine learning utilised in the exploration of new materials. As in many fields of research - the vast majority of knowledge is published as text, which poses challenges in either a consolidated or statistical analysis across studies and reports. Such challenges include the inability to extract quantitative information, and in accessing the breadth of non-numerical information. To address this issue, the application of natural language processing (NLP) has been explored in several studies to date. In NLP, assignment of high-dimensional vectors, known as embeddings, to passages of text preserves the syntactic and semantic relationship between words. Embeddings rely on machine learning algorithms and in the present work, we have employed the Word2Vec model, previously explored by others, and the BERT model - applying them towards a unique challenge in materials engineering. That challenge is the search for chromate replacements in the field of corrosion protection. From a database of over 80 million records, a down-selection of 5990 papers focused on the topic of corrosion protection were examined using NLP. This study demonstrates it is possible to extract knowledge from the automated interpretation of the scientific literature and achieve expert human level insights."
A Quantum Natural Language Processing Approach to Pronoun Resolution,"We use the Lambek Calculus with soft sub-exponential modalities to model and reason about discourse relations such as anaphora and ellipsis. A semantics for this logic is obtained by using truncated Fock spaces, developed in our previous work. We depict these semantic computations via a new string diagram. The Fock Space semantics has the advantage that its terms are learnable from large corpora of data using machine learning and they can be experimented with on mainstream natural language tasks. Further, and thanks to an existing translation from vector spaces to quantum circuits, we can also learn these terms on quantum computers and their simulators, such as the IBMQ range. We extend the existing translation to Fock spaces and develop quantum circuit semantics for discourse relations. We then experiment with the IBMQ AerSimulations of these circuits in a definite pronoun resolution task, where the highest accuracies were recorded for models when the anaphora was resolved."
Natural Language Processing for Systems Engineering: Automatic Generation of Systems Modelling Language Diagrams,"The design of complex engineering systems is an often long and articulated process that highly relies on engineers' expertise and professional judgment. As such, the typical pitfalls of activities involving the human factor often manifest themselves in terms of lack of completeness or exhaustiveness of the analysis, inconsistencies across design choices or documentation, as well as an implicit degree of subjectivity. An approach is proposed to assist systems engineers in the automatic generation of systems diagrams from unstructured natural language text. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are used to extract entities and their relationships from textual resources (e.g., specifications, manuals, technical reports, maintenance reports) available within an organisation, and convert them into Systems Modelling Language (SysML) diagrams, with particular focus on structure and requirement diagrams. The intention is to provide the users with a more standardised, comprehensive and automated starting point onto which subsequently refine and adapt the diagrams according to their needs. The proposed approach is flexible and open-domain. It consists of six steps which leverage open-access tools, and it leads to an automatic generation of SysML diagrams without intermediate modelling requirement, but through the specification of a set of parameters by the user. The applicability and benefits of the proposed approach are shown through six case studies having different textual sources as inputs, and benchmarked against manually defined diagram elements."
Natural language processing for clusterization of genes according to their functions,"There are hundreds of methods for analysis of data obtained in mRNA-sequencing. The most of them are focused on small number of genes. In this study, we propose an approach that reduces the analysis of several thousand genes to analysis of several clusters. The list of genes is enriched with information from open databases. Then, the descriptions are encoded as vectors using the pretrained language model (BERT) and some text processing approaches. The encoded gene function pass through the dimensionality reduction and clusterization. Aiming to find the most efficient pipeline, 180 cases of pipeline with different methods in the major pipeline steps were analyzed. The performance was evaluated with clusterization indexes and expert review of the results."
A methodology to characterize bias and harmful stereotypes in natural language processing in Latin America,"Automated decision-making systems, especially those based on natural language processing, are pervasive in our lives. They are not only behind the internet search engines we use daily, but also take more critical roles: selecting candidates for a job, determining suspects of a crime, diagnosing autism and more. Such automated systems make errors, which may be harmful in many ways, be it because of the severity of the consequences (as in health issues) or because of the sheer number of people they affect. When errors made by an automated system affect a population more than others, we call the system \textit{biased}.  Most modern natural language technologies are based on artifacts obtained from enormous volumes of text using machine learning, namely language models and word embeddings. Since they are created by applying subsymbolic machine learning, mostly artificial neural networks, they are opaque and practically uninterpretable by direct inspection, thus making it very difficult to audit them.  In this paper, we present a methodology that spells out how social scientists, domain experts, and machine learning experts can collaboratively explore biases and harmful stereotypes in word embeddings and large language models. Our methodology is based on the following principles:  * focus on the linguistic manifestations of discrimination on word embeddings and language models, not on the mathematical properties of the models * reduce the technical barrier for discrimination experts%, be it social scientists, domain experts or other * characterize through a qualitative exploratory process in addition to a metric-based approach * address mitigation as part of the training process, not as an afterthought"
voxel2vec: A Natural Language Processing Approach to Learning Distributed Representations for Scientific Data,"Relationships in scientific data, such as the numerical and spatial distribution relations of features in univariate data, the scalar-value combinations' relations in multivariate data, and the association of volumes in time-varying and ensemble data, are intricate and complex. This paper presents voxel2vec, a novel unsupervised representation learning model, which is used to learn distributed representations of scalar values/scalar-value combinations in a low-dimensional vector space. Its basic assumption is that if two scalar values/scalar-value combinations have similar contexts, they usually have high similarity in terms of features. By representing scalar values/scalar-value combinations as symbols, voxel2vec learns the similarity between them in the context of spatial distribution and then allows us to explore the overall association between volumes by transfer prediction. We demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of voxel2vec by comparing it with the isosurface similarity map of univariate data and applying the learned distributed representations to feature classification for multivariate data and to association analysis for time-varying and ensemble data."
The Topological BERT: Transforming Attention into Topology for Natural Language Processing,"In recent years, the introduction of the Transformer models sparked a revolution in natural language processing (NLP). BERT was one of the first text encoders using only the attention mechanism without any recurrent parts to achieve state-of-the-art results on many NLP tasks.  This paper introduces a text classifier using topological data analysis. We use BERT's attention maps transformed into attention graphs as the only input to that classifier. The model can solve tasks such as distinguishing spam from ham messages, recognizing whether a sentence is grammatically correct, or evaluating a movie review as negative or positive. It performs comparably to the BERT baseline and outperforms it on some tasks.  Additionally, we propose a new method to reduce the number of BERT's attention heads considered by the topological classifier, which allows us to prune the number of heads from 144 down to as few as ten with no reduction in performance. Our work also shows that the topological model displays higher robustness against adversarial attacks than the original BERT model, which is maintained during the pruning process. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to confront topological-based models with adversarial attacks in the context of NLP."
BigBIO: A Framework for Data-Centric Biomedical Natural Language Processing,"Training and evaluating language models increasingly requires the construction of meta-datasets --diverse collections of curated data with clear provenance. Natural language prompting has recently lead to improved zero-shot generalization by transforming existing, supervised datasets into a diversity of novel pretraining tasks, highlighting the benefits of meta-dataset curation. While successful in general-domain text, translating these data-centric approaches to biomedical language modeling remains challenging, as labeled biomedical datasets are significantly underrepresented in popular data hubs. To address this challenge, we introduce BigBIO a community library of 126+ biomedical NLP datasets, currently covering 12 task categories and 10+ languages. BigBIO facilitates reproducible meta-dataset curation via programmatic access to datasets and their metadata, and is compatible with current platforms for prompt engineering and end-to-end few/zero shot language model evaluation. We discuss our process for task schema harmonization, data auditing, contribution guidelines, and outline two illustrative use cases: zero-shot evaluation of biomedical prompts and large-scale, multi-task learning. BigBIO is an ongoing community effort and is available at https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/biomedical"
TweetNLP: Cutting-Edge Natural Language Processing for Social Media,"In this paper we present TweetNLP, an integrated platform for Natural Language Processing (NLP) in social media. TweetNLP supports a diverse set of NLP tasks, including generic focus areas such as sentiment analysis and named entity recognition, as well as social media-specific tasks such as emoji prediction and offensive language identification. Task-specific systems are powered by reasonably-sized Transformer-based language models specialized on social media text (in particular, Twitter) which can be run without the need for dedicated hardware or cloud services. The main contributions of TweetNLP are: (1) an integrated Python library for a modern toolkit supporting social media analysis using our various task-specific models adapted to the social domain; (2) an interactive online demo for codeless experimentation using our models; and (3) a tutorial covering a wide variety of typical social media applications."
Sentiment Analysis with R: Natural Language Processing for Semi-Automated Assessments of Qualitative Data,"Sentiment analysis is a sub-discipline in the field of natural language processing and computational linguistics and can be used for automated or semi-automated analyses of text documents. One of the aims of these analyses is to recognize an expressed attitude as positive or negative as it can be contained in comments on social media platforms or political documents and speeches as well as fictional and nonfictional texts. Regarding analyses of comments on social media platforms, this is an extension of the previous tutorial on semi-automated screenings of social media network data. A longitudinal perspective regarding social media comments as well as cross-sectional perspectives regarding fictional and nonfictional texts, e.g. entire books and libraries, can lead to extensive text documents. Their analyses can be simplified and accelerated by using sentiment analysis with acceptable inter-rater reliability. Therefore, this tutorial introduces the basic functions for performing a sentiment analysis with R and explains how text documents can be analysed step by step - regardless of their underlying formatting. All prerequisites and steps are described in detail and associated codes are available on GitHub. A comparison of two political speeches illustrates a possible use case."
Lifelong Learning Natural Language Processing Approach for Multilingual Data Classification,"The abundance of information in digital media, which in today's world is the main source of knowledge about current events for the masses, makes it possible to spread disinformation on a larger scale than ever before. Consequently, there is a need to develop novel fake news detection approaches capable of adapting to changing factual contexts and generalizing previously or concurrently acquired knowledge. To deal with this problem, we propose a lifelong learning-inspired approach, which allows for fake news detection in multiple languages and the mutual transfer of knowledge acquired in each of them. Both classical feature extractors, such as Term frequency-inverse document frequency or Latent Dirichlet Allocation, and integrated deep NLP (Natural Language Processing) BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) models paired with MLP (Multilayer Perceptron) classifier, were employed. The results of experiments conducted on two datasets dedicated to the fake news classification task (in English and Spanish, respectively), supported by statistical analysis, confirmed that utilization of additional languages could improve performance for traditional methods. Also, in some cases supplementing the deep learning method with classical ones can positively impact obtained results. The ability of models to generalize the knowledge acquired between the analyzed languages was also observed."
Urdu News Article Recommendation Model using Natural Language Processing Techniques,"There are several online newspapers in urdu but for the users it is difficult to find the content they are looking for because these most of them contain irrelevant data and most users did not get what they want to retrieve. Our proposed framework will help to predict Urdu news in the interests of users and reduce the users searching time for news. For this purpose, NLP techniques are used for pre-processing, and then TF-IDF with cosine similarity is used for gaining the highest similarity and recommended news on user preferences. Moreover, the BERT language model is also used for similarity, and by using the BERT model similarity increases as compared to TF-IDF so the approach works better with the BERT language model and recommends news to the user on their interest. The news is recommended when the similarity of the articles is above 60 percent."
A Review of Published Machine Learning Natural Language Processing Applications for Protocolling Radiology Imaging,"Machine learning (ML) is a subfield of Artificial intelligence (AI), and its applications in radiology are growing at an ever-accelerating rate. The most studied ML application is the automated interpretation of images. However, natural language processing (NLP), which can be combined with ML for text interpretation tasks, also has many potential applications in radiology. One such application is automation of radiology protocolling, which involves interpreting a clinical radiology referral and selecting the appropriate imaging technique. It is an essential task which ensures that the correct imaging is performed. However, the time that a radiologist must dedicate to protocolling could otherwise be spent reporting, communicating with referrers, or teaching. To date, there have been few publications in which ML models were developed that use clinical text to automate protocol selection. This article reviews the existing literature in this field. A systematic assessment of the published models is performed with reference to best practices suggested by machine learning convention. Progress towards implementing automated protocolling in a clinical setting is discussed."
Traffic-Twitter Transformer: A Nature Language Processing-joined Framework For Network-wide Traffic Forecasting,"With accurate and timely traffic forecasting, the impacted traffic conditions can be predicted in advance to guide agencies and residents to respond to changes in traffic patterns appropriately. However, existing works on traffic forecasting mainly relied on historical traffic patterns confining to short-term prediction, under 1 hour, for instance. To better manage future roadway capacity and accommodate social and human impacts, it is crucial to propose a flexible and comprehensive framework to predict physical-aware long-term traffic conditions for public users and transportation agencies. In this paper, the gap of robust long-term traffic forecasting was bridged by taking social media features into consideration. A correlation study and a linear regression model were first implemented to evaluate the significance of the correlation between two time-series data, traffic intensity and Twitter data intensity. Two time-series data were then fed into our proposed social-aware framework, Traffic-Twitter Transformer, which integrated Nature Language representations into time-series records for long-term traffic prediction. Experimental results in the Great Seattle Area showed that our proposed model outperformed baseline models in all evaluation matrices. This NLP-joined social-aware framework can become a valuable implement of network-wide traffic prediction and management for traffic agencies."
A smile is all you need: Predicting limiting activity coefficients from SMILES with natural language processing,"Knowledge of mixtures' phase equilibria is crucial in nature and technical chemistry. Phase equilibria calculations of mixtures require activity coefficients. However, experimental data on activity coefficients is often limited due to high cost of experiments. For an accurate and efficient prediction of activity coefficients, machine learning approaches have been recently developed. However, current machine learning approaches still extrapolate poorly for activity coefficients of unknown molecules. In this work, we introduce the SMILES-to-Properties-Transformer (SPT), a natural language processing network to predict binary limiting activity coefficients from SMILES codes. To overcome the limitations of available experimental data, we initially train our network on a large dataset of synthetic data sampled from COSMO-RS (10 Million data points) and then fine-tune the model on experimental data (20 870 data points). This training strategy enables SPT to accurately predict limiting activity coefficients even for unknown molecules, cutting the mean prediction error in half compared to state-of-the-art models for activity coefficient predictions such as COSMO-RS, UNIFAC, and improving on recent machine learning approaches."
Computational linguistics and Natural Language Processing,"This chapter provides an introduction to computational linguistics methods, with focus on their applications to the practice and study of translation. It covers computational models, methods and tools for collection, storage, indexing and analysis of linguistic data in the context of translation, and discusses the main methodological issues and challenges in this field. While an exhaustive review of existing computational linguistics methods and tools is beyond the scope of this chapter, we describe the most representative approaches, and illustrate them with descriptions of typical applications."
Near-Term Advances in Quantum Natural Language Processing,"This paper describes experiments showing that some tasks in natural language processing (NLP) can already be performed using quantum computers, though so far only with small datasets.  We demonstrate various approaches to topic classification. The first uses an explicit word-based approach, in which word-topic scoring weights are implemented as fractional rotations of individual qubit, and a new phrase is classified based on the accumulation of these weights in a scoring qubit using entangling controlled-NOT gates. This is compared with more scalable quantum encodings of word embedding vectors, which are used in the computation of kernel values in a quantum support vector machine: this approach achieved an average of 62% accuracy on classification tasks involving over 10000 words, which is the largest such quantum computing experiment to date.  We describe a quantum probability approach to bigram modeling that can be applied to sequences of words and formal concepts, investigating a generative approximation to these distributions using a quantum circuit Born machine, and an approach to ambiguity resolution in verb-noun composition using single-qubit rotations for simple nouns and 2-qubit controlled-NOT gates for simple verbs.  The smaller systems described have been run successfully on physical quantum computers, and the larger ones have been simulated. We show that statistically meaningful results can be obtained using real datasets, but this is much more difficult to predict than with easier artificial language examples used previously in developing quantum NLP systems.  Other approaches to quantum NLP are compared, partly with respect to contemporary issues including informal language, fluency, and truthfulness."
Actuarial Applications of Natural Language Processing Using Transformers: Case Studies for Using Text Features in an Actuarial Context,"This tutorial demonstrates workflows to incorporate text data into actuarial classification and regression tasks. The main focus is on methods employing transformer-based models. A dataset of car accident descriptions with an average length of 400 words, available in English and German, and a dataset with short property insurance claims descriptions are used to demonstrate these techniques. The case studies tackle challenges related to a multi-lingual setting and long input sequences. They also show ways to interpret model output, to assess and improve model performance, by fine-tuning the models to the domain of application or to a specific prediction task. Finally, the tutorial provides practical approaches to handle classification tasks in situations with no or only few labeled data. The results achieved by using the language-understanding skills of off-the-shelf natural language processing (NLP) models with only minimal pre-processing and fine-tuning clearly demonstrate the power of transfer learning for practical applications."
Modeling Disagreement in Automatic Data Labelling for Semi-Supervised Learning in Clinical Natural Language Processing,"Computational models providing accurate estimates of their uncertainty are crucial for risk management associated with decision making in healthcare contexts. This is especially true since many state-of-the-art systems are trained using the data which has been labelled automatically (self-supervised mode) and tend to overfit. In this work, we investigate the quality of uncertainty estimates from a range of current state-of-the-art predictive models applied to the problem of observation detection in radiology reports. This problem remains understudied for Natural Language Processing in the healthcare domain. We demonstrate that Gaussian Processes (GPs) provide superior performance in quantifying the risks of 3 uncertainty labels based on the negative log predictive probability (NLPP) evaluation metric and mean maximum predicted confidence levels (MMPCL), whilst retaining strong predictive performance."
"L3Cube-MahaNLP: Marathi Natural Language Processing Datasets, Models, and Library","Despite being the third most popular language in India, the Marathi language lacks useful NLP resources. Moreover, popular NLP libraries do not have support for the Marathi language. With L3Cube-MahaNLP, we aim to build resources and a library for Marathi natural language processing. We present datasets and transformer models for supervised tasks like sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and hate speech detection. We have also published a monolingual Marathi corpus for unsupervised language modeling tasks. Overall we present MahaCorpus, MahaSent, MahaNER, and MahaHate datasets and their corresponding MahaBERT models fine-tuned on these datasets. We aim to move ahead of benchmark datasets and prepare useful resources for Marathi. The resources are available at https://github.com/l3cube-pune/MarathiNLP."
A Natural Language Processing Pipeline for Detecting Informal Data References in Academic Literature,"Discovering authoritative links between publications and the datasets that they use can be a labor-intensive process. We introduce a natural language processing pipeline that retrieves and reviews publications for informal references to research datasets, which complements the work of data librarians. We first describe the components of the pipeline and then apply it to expand an authoritative bibliography linking thousands of social science studies to the data-related publications in which they are used. The pipeline increases recall for literature to review for inclusion in data-related collections of publications and makes it possible to detect informal data references at scale. We contribute (1) a novel Named Entity Recognition (NER) model that reliably detects informal data references and (2) a dataset connecting items from social science literature with datasets they reference. Together, these contributions enable future work on data reference, data citation networks, and data reuse."
Information Propagation by Composited Labels in Natural Language Processing,"In natural language processing (NLP), labeling on regions of text, such as words, sentences and paragraphs, is a basic task. In this paper, label is defined as map between mention of entity in a region on text and context of entity in a broader region on text containing the mention. This definition naturally introduces linkage of entities induced from inclusion relation of regions, and connected entities form a graph representing information flow defined by map. It also enables calculation of information loss through map using entropy, and entropy lost is regarded as distance between two entities over a path on graph."
How to keep text private? A systematic review of deep learning methods for privacy-preserving natural language processing,"Deep learning (DL) models for natural language processing (NLP) tasks often handle private data, demanding protection against breaches and disclosures. Data protection laws, such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), thereby enforce the need for privacy. Although many privacy-preserving NLP methods have been proposed in recent years, no categories to organize them have been introduced yet, making it hard to follow the progress of the literature. To close this gap, this article systematically reviews over sixty DL methods for privacy-preserving NLP published between 2016 and 2020, covering theoretical foundations, privacy-enhancing technologies, and analysis of their suitability for real-world scenarios. First, we introduce a novel taxonomy for classifying the existing methods into three categories: data safeguarding methods, trusted methods, and verification methods. Second, we present an extensive summary of privacy threats, datasets for applications, and metrics for privacy evaluation. Third, throughout the review, we describe privacy issues in the NLP pipeline in a holistic view. Further, we discuss open challenges in privacy-preserving NLP regarding data traceability, computation overhead, dataset size, the prevalence of human biases in embeddings, and the privacy-utility tradeoff. Finally, this review presents future research directions to guide successive research and development of privacy-preserving NLP models."
Reasoning about Procedures with Natural Language Processing: A Tutorial,"This tutorial provides a comprehensive and in-depth view of the research on procedures, primarily in Natural Language Processing. A procedure is a sequence of steps intended to achieve some goal. Understanding procedures in natural language has a long history, with recent breakthroughs made possible by advances in technology. First, we discuss established approaches to collect procedures, by human annotation or extraction from web resources. Then, we examine different angles from which procedures can be reasoned about, as well as ways to represent them. Finally, we enumerate scenarios where procedural knowledge can be applied to the real world."
Design and Implementation of a Quantum Kernel for Natural Language Processing,"Natural language processing (NLP) is the field that attempts to make human language accessible to computers, and it relies on applying a mathematical model to express the meaning of symbolic language. One such model, DisCoCat, defines how to express both the meaning of individual words as well as their compositional nature. This model can be naturally implemented on quantum computers, leading to the field quantum NLP (QNLP). Recent experimental work used quantum machine learning techniques to map from text to class label using the expectation value of the quantum encoded sentence. Theoretical work has been done on computing the similarity of sentences but relies on an unrealized quantum memory store. The main goal of this thesis is to leverage the DisCoCat model to design a quantum-based kernel function that can be used by a support vector machine (SVM) for NLP tasks. Two similarity measures were studied: (i) the transition amplitude approach and (ii) the SWAP test. A simple NLP meaning classification task from previous work was used to train the word embeddings and evaluate the performance of both models. The Python module lambeq and its related software stack was used for implementation. The explicit model from previous work was used to train word embeddings and achieved a testing accuracy of 93.09 \pm 0.01%. It was shown that both the SVM variants achieved a higher testing accuracy of 95.72 \pm 0.01% for approach (i) and 97.14 \pm 0.01% for (ii). The SWAP test was then simulated under a noise model defined by the real quantum device, ibmq_guadalupe. The explicit model achieved an accuracy of 91.94 \pm 0.01% while the SWAP test SVM achieved 96.7% on the testing dataset, suggesting that the kernelized classifiers are resilient to noise. These are encouraging results and motivate further investigations of our proposed kernelized QNLP paradigm."
A Song of (Dis)agreement: Evaluating the Evaluation of Explainable Artificial Intelligence in Natural Language Processing,"There has been significant debate in the NLP community about whether or not attention weights can be used as an explanation - a mechanism for interpreting how important each input token is for a particular prediction. The validity of ""attention as explanation"" has so far been evaluated by computing the rank correlation between attention-based explanations and existing feature attribution explanations using LSTM-based models. In our work, we (i) compare the rank correlation between five more recent feature attribution methods and two attention-based methods, on two types of NLP tasks, and (ii) extend this analysis to also include transformer-based models. We find that attention-based explanations do not correlate strongly with any recent feature attribution methods, regardless of the model or task. Furthermore, we find that none of the tested explanations correlate strongly with one another for the transformer-based model, leading us to question the underlying assumption that we should measure the validity of attention-based explanations based on how well they correlate with existing feature attribution explanation methods. After conducting experiments on five datasets using two different models, we argue that the community should stop using rank correlation as an evaluation metric for attention-based explanations. We suggest that researchers and practitioners should instead test various explanation methods and employ a human-in-the-loop process to determine if the explanations align with human intuition for the particular use case at hand."
TinyGenius: Intertwining Natural Language Processing with Microtask Crowdsourcing for Scholarly Knowledge Graph Creation,"As the number of published scholarly articles grows steadily each year, new methods are needed to organize scholarly knowledge so that it can be more efficiently discovered and used. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are able to autonomously process scholarly articles at scale and to create machine readable representations of the article content. However, autonomous NLP methods are by far not sufficiently accurate to create a high-quality knowledge graph. Yet quality is crucial for the graph to be useful in practice. We present TinyGenius, a methodology to validate NLP-extracted scholarly knowledge statements using microtasks performed with crowdsourcing. The scholarly context in which the crowd workers operate has multiple challenges. The explainability of the employed NLP methods is crucial to provide context in order to support the decision process of crowd workers. We employed TinyGenius to populate a paper-centric knowledge graph, using five distinct NLP methods. In the end, the resulting knowledge graph serves as a digital library for scholarly articles."
Skin disease diagnosis using image analysis and natural language processing,"In Zambia, there is a serious shortage of medical staff where each practitioner attends to about 17000 patients in a given district while still, other patients travel over 10 km to access the basic medical services. In this research, we implement a deep learning model that can perform the clinical diagnosis process. The study will prove whether image analysis is capable of performing clinical diagnosis. It will also enable us to understand if we can use image analysis to lessen the workload on medical practitioners by delegating some tasks to an AI. The success of this study has the potential to increase the accessibility of medical services to Zambians, which is one of the national goals of Vision 2030."
Meta Learning for Natural Language Processing: A Survey,"Deep learning has been the mainstream technique in natural language processing (NLP) area. However, the techniques require many labeled data and are less generalizable across domains. Meta-learning is an arising field in machine learning studying approaches to learn better learning algorithms. Approaches aim at improving algorithms in various aspects, including data efficiency and generalizability. Efficacy of approaches has been shown in many NLP tasks, but there is no systematic survey of these approaches in NLP, which hinders more researchers from joining the field. Our goal with this survey paper is to offer researchers pointers to relevant meta-learning works in NLP and attract more attention from the NLP community to drive future innovation. This paper first introduces the general concepts of meta-learning and the common approaches. Then we summarize task construction settings and application of meta-learning for various NLP problems and review the development of meta-learning in NLP community."
"Open vs Closed-ended questions in attitudinal surveys -- comparing, combining, and interpreting using natural language processing","To improve the traveling experience, researchers have been analyzing the role of attitudes in travel behavior modeling. Although most researchers use closed-ended surveys, the appropriate method to measure attitudes is debatable. Topic Modeling could significantly reduce the time to extract information from open-ended responses and eliminate subjective bias, thereby alleviating analyst concerns. Our research uses Topic Modeling to extract information from open-ended questions and compare its performance with closed-ended responses. Furthermore, some respondents might prefer answering questions using their preferred questionnaire type. So, we propose a modeling framework that allows respondents to use their preferred questionnaire type to answer the survey and enable analysts to use the modeling frameworks of their choice to predict behavior. We demonstrate this using a dataset collected from the USA that measures the intention to use Autonomous Vehicles for commute trips. Respondents were presented with alternative questionnaire versions (open- and closed- ended). Since our objective was also to compare the performance of alternative questionnaire versions, the survey was designed to eliminate influences resulting from statements, behavioral framework, and the choice experiment. Results indicate the suitability of using Topic Modeling to extract information from open-ended responses; however, the models estimated using the closed-ended questions perform better compared to them. Besides, the proposed model performs better compared to the models used currently. Furthermore, our proposed framework will allow respondents to choose the questionnaire type to answer, which could be particularly beneficial to them when using voice-based surveys."
EasyNLP: A Comprehensive and Easy-to-use Toolkit for Natural Language Processing,"The success of Pre-Trained Models (PTMs) has reshaped the development of Natural Language Processing (NLP).

Information Retrieval in Friction Stir Welding of Aluminum Alloys by using Natural Language Processing based Algorithms,"Text summarization is a technique for condensing a big piece of text into a few key elements that give a general impression of the content. When someone requires a quick and precise summary of a large amount of information, it becomes vital. If done manually, summarizing text can be costly and time-consuming. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the sub-division of Artificial Intelligence that narrows down the gap between technology and human cognition by extracting the relevant information from the pile of data. In the present work, scientific information regarding the Friction Stir Welding of Aluminum alloys was collected from the abstract of scholarly research papers. For extracting the relevant information from these research abstracts four Natural Language Processing based algorithms i.e. Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), Luhn Algorithm, Lex Rank Algorithm, and KL-Algorithm were used. In order to evaluate the accuracy score of these algorithms, Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE) was used. The results showed that the Luhn Algorithm resulted in the highest f1-Score of 0.413 in comparison to other algorithms."
Suggesting Relevant Questions for a Query Using Statistical Natural Language Processing Technique,"Suggesting similar questions for a user query has many applications ranging from reducing search time of users on e-commerce websites, training of employees in companies to holistic learning for students. The use of Natural Language Processing techniques for suggesting similar questions is prevalent over the existing architecture. Mainly two approaches are studied for finding text similarity namely syntactic and semantic, however each has its draw-backs and fail to provide the desired outcome. In this article, a self-learning combined approach is proposed for determining textual similarity that introduces a robust weighted syntactic and semantic similarity index for determining similar questions from a predetermined database, this approach learns the optimal combination of the mentioned approaches for a database under consideration. Comprehensive analysis has been carried out to justify the efficiency and efficacy of the proposed approach over the existing literature."
A global analysis of metrics used for measuring performance in natural language processing,"Measuring the performance of natural language processing models is challenging. Traditionally used metrics, such as BLEU and ROUGE, originally devised for machine translation and summarization, have been shown to suffer from low correlation with human judgment and a lack of transferability to other tasks and languages. In the past 15 years, a wide range of alternative metrics have been proposed. However, it is unclear to what extent this has had an impact on NLP benchmarking efforts. Here we provide the first large-scale cross-sectional analysis of metrics used for measuring performance in natural language processing. We curated, mapped and systematized more than 3500 machine learning model performance results from the open repository 'Papers with Code' to enable a global and comprehensive analysis. Our results suggest that the large majority of natural language processing metrics currently used have properties that may result in an inadequate reflection of a models' performance. Furthermore, we found that ambiguities and inconsistencies in the reporting of metrics may lead to difficulties in interpreting and comparing model performances, impairing transparency and reproducibility in NLP research."
Extraction of Sleep Information from Clinical Notes of Alzheimer's Disease Patients Using Natural Language Processing,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in the United States. Sleep is one of the lifestyle-related factors that has been shown critical for optimal cognitive function in old age. . However, there is a lack of research studying the association between sleep and AD incidence. A major bottleneck for conducting such research is that the traditional way to acquire sleep information is time-consuming, inefficient, non-scalable, and limited to patients' subjective experience. In this study, we developed a rule-based NLP algorithm and machine learning models to automate the extraction of sleep-related concepts, including snoring, napping, sleep problem, bad sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, night wakings, and sleep duration, from the clinical notes of patients diagnosed with AD. We trained and validated the proposed models on the clinical notes retrieved from the University of Pittsburgh of Medical Center (UPMC). The results show that the rule-based NLP algorithm consistently achieved the best performance for all sleep concepts."
"COOL, a Context Outlooker, and its Application to Question Answering and other Natural Language Processing Tasks","Vision outlooker improves the performance of vision transformers, which implements a self-attention mechanism by adding an outlook attention, a form of local attention.  In natural language processing, as has been the case in computer vision and other domains, transformer-based models constitute the state-of-the-art for most processing tasks. In this domain, too, many authors have argued and demonstrated the importance of local context.  We present an outlook attention mechanism, COOL, for natural language processing. COOL, added on top of the self-attention layers of a transformer-based model, encodes local syntactic context considering word proximity and more pair-wise constraints than dynamic convolution used by existing approaches.  A comparative empirical performance evaluation of an implementation of COOL with different transformer-based models confirms the opportunity for improvement over a baseline using the original models alone for various natural language processing tasks, including question answering. The proposed approach achieves competitive performance with existing state-of-the-art methods on some tasks."
A Survey on Bias and Fairness in Natural Language Processing,"As NLP models become more integrated with the everyday lives of people, it becomes important to examine the social effect that the usage of these systems has. While these models understand language and have increased accuracy on difficult downstream tasks, there is evidence that these models amplify gender, racial and cultural stereotypes and lead to a vicious cycle in many settings. In this survey, we analyze the origins of biases, the definitions of fairness, and how different subfields of NLP mitigate bias. We finally discuss how future studies can work towards eradicating pernicious biases from NLP algorithms."
Analysing similarities between legal court documents using natural language processing approaches based on Transformers,"Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have leveraged promising results in solving complex problems in the area of Natural Language Processing (NLP), being an important tool to help in the expeditious resolution of judicial proceedings in the legal area. In this context, this work targets the problem of detecting the degree of similarity between judicial documents that can be achieved in the inference group, by applying six NLP techniques based on the transformers architecture to a case study of legal proceedings in the Brazilian judicial system. The NLP transformer-based models, namely BERT, GPT-2 and RoBERTa, were pre-trained using a general purpose corpora of the Brazilian Portuguese language, and then were fine-tuned and specialised for the legal sector using 210,000 legal proceedings. Vector representations of each legal document were calculated based on their embeddings, which were used to cluster the lawsuits, calculating the quality of each model based on the cosine of the distance between the elements of the group to its centroid. We noticed that models based on transformers presented better performance when compared to previous traditional NLP techniques, with the RoBERTa model specialised for the Brazilian Portuguese language presenting the best results. This methodology can be also applied to other case studies for different languages, making it possible to advance in the current state of the art in the area of NLP applied to the legal sector."
A Natural Language Processing Approach for Instruction Set Architecture Identification,"Binary analysis of software is a critical step in cyber forensics applications such as program vulnerability assessment and malware detection. This involves interpreting instructions executed by software and often necessitates converting the software's binary file data to assembly language. The conversion process requires information about the binary file's target instruction set architecture (ISA). However, ISA information might not be included in binary files due to compilation errors, partial downloads, or adversarial corruption of file metadata. Machine learning (ML) is a promising methodology that can be used to identify the target ISA using binary data in the object code section of binary files. In this paper we propose a binary code feature extraction model to improve the accuracy and scalability of ML-based ISA identification methods. Our feature extraction model can be used in the absence of domain knowledge about the ISAs. Specifically, we adapt models from natural language processing (NLP) to i) identify successive byte patterns commonly observed in binary codes, ii) estimate the significance of each byte pattern to a binary file, and iii) estimate the relevance of each byte pattern in distinguishing between ISAs. We introduce character-level features of encoded binaries to identify fine-grained bit patterns inherent to each ISA. We use a dataset with binaries from 12 different ISAs to evaluate our approach. Empirical evaluations show that using our byte-level features in ML-based ISA identification results in an 8% higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art features based on byte-histograms and byte pattern signatures. We observe that character-level features allow reducing the size of the feature set by up to 16x while maintaining accuracy above 97%."
EHRKit: A Python Natural Language Processing Toolkit for Electronic Health Record Texts,"The Electronic Health Record (EHR) is an essential part of the modern medical system and impacts healthcare delivery, operations, and research. Unstructured text is attracting much attention despite structured information in the EHRs and has become an exciting research field. The success of the recent neural Natural Language Processing (NLP) method has led to a new direction for processing unstructured clinical notes. In this work, we create a python library for clinical texts, EHRKit. This library contains two main parts: MIMIC-III-specific functions and tasks specific functions. The first part introduces a list of interfaces for accessing MIMIC-III NOTEEVENTS data, including basic search, information retrieval, and information extraction. The second part integrates many third-party libraries for up to 12 off-shelf NLP tasks such as named entity recognition, summarization, machine translation, etc."
Experimental Standards for Deep Learning in Natural Language Processing Research,"The field of Deep Learning (DL) has undergone explosive growth during the last decade, with a substantial impact on Natural Language Processing (NLP) as well. Yet, compared to more established disciplines, a lack of common experimental standards remains an open challenge to the field at large. Starting from fundamental scientific principles, we distill ongoing discussions on experimental standards in NLP into a single, widely-applicable methodology. Following these best practices is crucial to strengthen experimental evidence, improve reproducibility and support scientific progress. These standards are further collected in a public repository to help them transparently adapt to future needs."
Robust Quantification of Gender Disparity in Pre-Modern English Literature using Natural Language Processing,"Research has continued to shed light on the extent and significance of gender disparity in social, cultural and economic spheres. More recently, computational tools from the Natural Language Processing (NLP) literature have been proposed for measuring such disparity using relatively extensive datasets and empirically rigorous methodologies. In this paper, we contribute to this line of research by studying gender disparity, at scale, in copyright-expired literary texts published in the pre-modern period (defined in this work as the period ranging from the mid-nineteenth through the mid-twentieth century). One of the challenges in using such tools is to ensure quality control, and by extension, trustworthy statistical analysis. Another challenge is in using materials and methods that are publicly available and have been established for some time, both to ensure that they can be used and vetted in the future, and also, to add confidence to the methodology itself. We present our solution to addressing these challenges, and using multiple measures, demonstrate the significant discrepancy between the prevalence of female characters and male characters in pre-modern literature. The evidence suggests that the discrepancy declines when the author is female. The discrepancy seems to be relatively stable as we plot data over the decades in this century-long period. Finally, we aim to carefully describe both the limitations and ethical caveats associated with this study, and others like it."
Resources for Turkish Natural Language Processing: A critical survey,"This paper presents a comprehensive survey of corpora and lexical resources available for Turkish. We review a broad range of resources, focusing on the ones that are publicly available. In addition to providing information about the available linguistic resources, we present a set of recommendations, and identify gaps in the data available for conducting research and building applications in Turkish Linguistics and Natural Language Processing."
Classification of Natural Language Processing Techniques for Requirements Engineering,"Research in applying natural language processing (NLP) techniques to requirements engineering (RE) tasks spans more than 40 years, from initial efforts carried out in the 1980s to more recent attempts with machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. However, in spite of the progress, our recent survey shows that there is still a lack of systematic understanding and organization of commonly used NLP techniques in RE. We believe one hurdle facing the industry is lack of shared knowledge of NLP techniques and their usage in RE tasks. In this paper, we present our effort to synthesize and organize 57 most frequently used NLP techniques in RE. We classify these NLP techniques in two ways: first, by their NLP tasks in typical pipelines and second, by their linguist analysis levels. We believe these two ways of classification are complementary, contributing to a better understanding of the NLP techniques in RE and such understanding is crucial to the development of better NLP tools for RE."
A Survey of Multi-task Learning in Natural Language Processing: Regarding Task Relatedness and Training Methods,"Multi-task learning (MTL) has become increasingly popular in natural language processing (NLP) because it improves the performance of related tasks by exploiting their commonalities and differences. Nevertheless, it is still not understood very well how multi-task learning can be implemented based on the relatedness of training tasks. In this survey, we review recent advances of multi-task learning methods in NLP, with the aim of summarizing them into two general multi-task training methods based on their task relatedness: (i) joint training and (ii) multi-step training. We present examples in various NLP downstream applications, summarize the task relationships and discuss future directions of this promising topic."
Hierarchical Annotation for Building A Suite of Clinical Natural Language Processing Tasks: Progress Note Understanding,"Applying methods in natural language processing on electronic health records (EHR) data is a growing field. Existing corpus and annotation focus on modeling textual features and relation prediction. However, there is a paucity of annotated corpus built to model clinical diagnostic thinking, a process involving text understanding, domain knowledge abstraction and reasoning. This work introduces a hierarchical annotation schema with three stages to address clinical text understanding, clinical reasoning, and summarization. We created an annotated corpus based on an extensive collection of publicly available daily progress notes, a type of EHR documentation that is collected in time series in a problem-oriented format. The conventional format for a progress note follows a Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan heading (SOAP). We also define a new suite of tasks, Progress Note Understanding, with three tasks utilizing the three annotation stages. The novel suite of tasks was designed to train and evaluate future NLP models for clinical text understanding, clinical knowledge representation, inference, and summarization."
Classifying Cyber-Risky Clinical Notes by Employing Natural Language Processing,"Clinical notes, which can be embedded into electronic medical records, document patient care delivery and summarize interactions between healthcare providers and patients. These clinical notes directly inform patient care and can also indirectly inform research and quality/safety metrics, among other indirect metrics. Recently, some states within the United States of America require patients to have open access to their clinical notes to improve the exchange of patient information for patient care. Thus, developing methods to assess the cyber risks of clinical notes before sharing and exchanging data is critical. While existing natural language processing techniques are geared to de-identify clinical notes, to the best of our knowledge, few have focused on classifying sensitive-information risk, which is a fundamental step toward developing effective, widespread protection of patient health information. To bridge this gap, this research investigates methods for identifying security/privacy risks within clinical notes. The classification either can be used upstream to identify areas within notes that likely contain sensitive information or downstream to improve the identification of clinical notes that have not been entirely de-identified. We develop several models using unigram and word2vec features with different classifiers to categorize sentence risk. Experiments on i2b2 de-identification dataset show that the SVM classifier using word2vec features obtained a maximum F1-score of 0.792. Future research involves articulation and differentiation of risk in terms of different global regulatory requirements."
Filter Drug-induced Liver Injury Literature with Natural Language Processing and Ensemble Learning,"Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) describes the adverse effects of drugs that damage liver. Life-threatening results including liver failure or death were also reported in severe DILI cases. Therefore, DILI-related events are strictly monitored for all approved drugs and the liver toxicity became important assessments for new drug candidates. These DILI-related reports are documented in hospital records, in clinical trial results, and also in research papers that contain preliminary in vitro and in vivo experiments. Conventionally, data extraction from previous publications relies heavily on resource-demanding manual labelling, which considerably decreased the efficiency of the information extraction process. The recent development of artificial intelligence, particularly, the rise of natural language processing (NLP) techniques, enabled the automatic processing of biomedical texts. In this study, based on around 28,000 papers (titles and abstracts) provided by the Critical Assessment of Massive Data Analysis (CAMDA) challenge, we benchmarked model performances on filtering out DILI literature. Among four word vectorization techniques, the model using term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) and logistic regression outperformed others with an accuracy of 0.957 with our in-house test set. Furthermore, an ensemble model with similar overall performances was implemented and was fine-tuned to lower the false-negative cases to avoid neglecting potential DILI reports. The ensemble model achieved a high accuracy of 0.954 and an F1 score of 0.955 in the hold-out validation data provided by the CAMDA committee. Moreover, important words in positive/negative predictions were identified via model interpretation. Overall, the ensemble model reached satisfactory classification results, which can be further used by researchers to rapidly filter DILI-related literature."
TCM-SD: A Benchmark for Probing Syndrome Differentiation via Natural Language Processing,"Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is a natural, safe, and effective therapy that has spread and been applied worldwide. The unique TCM diagnosis and treatment system requires a comprehensive analysis of a patient's symptoms hidden in the clinical record written in free text. Prior studies have shown that this system can be informationized and intelligentized with the aid of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, such as natural language processing (NLP). However, existing datasets are not of sufficient quality nor quantity to support the further development of data-driven AI technology in TCM. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on the core task of the TCM diagnosis and treatment system -- syndrome differentiation (SD) -- and we introduce the first public large-scale dataset for SD, called TCM-SD. Our dataset contains 54,152 real-world clinical records covering 148 syndromes. Furthermore, we collect a large-scale unlabelled textual corpus in the field of TCM and propose a domain-specific pre-trained language model, called ZY-BERT. We conducted experiments using deep neural networks to establish a strong performance baseline, reveal various challenges in SD, and prove the potential of domain-specific pre-trained language model. Our study and analysis reveal opportunities for incorporating computer science and linguistics knowledge to explore the empirical validity of TCM theories."
TSM: Measuring the Enticement of Honeyfiles with Natural Language Processing,"Honeyfile deployment is a useful breach detection method in cyber deception that can also inform defenders about the intent and interests of intruders and malicious insiders. A key property of a honeyfile, enticement, is the extent to which the file can attract an intruder to interact with it. We introduce a novel metric, Topic Semantic Matching (TSM), which uses topic modelling to represent files in the repository and semantic matching in an embedding vector space to compare honeyfile text and topic words robustly. We also present a honeyfile corpus created with different Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods. Experiments show that TSM is effective in inter-corpus comparisons and is a promising tool to measure the enticement of honeyfiles. TSM is the first measure to use NLP techniques to quantify the enticement of honeyfile content that compares the essential topical content of local contexts to honeyfiles and is robust to paraphrasing."
A Systematic Study and Analysis of Bengali Folklore with Natural Language Processing Systems,"Folklore, a solid branch of folk literature, is the hallmark of any nation or any society. Such as oral tradition; as proverbs or jokes, it also includes material culture as well as traditional folk beliefs, and various customs. Bengali folklore is as rich in-depth as it is amazing. Nevertheless, in the womb of time, it is determined to sustain its existence. Therefore, our aim in this study is to make our rich folklore more comprehensible to everyone in a more sophisticated computational way. Some studies concluded various aspects of the Bengali language with NLP. Our proposed model is to be specific for Bengali folklore. Technically, it will be the first step towards Bengali natural language processing for studying and analyzing the folklore of Bengal."
Librarian-in-the-Loop: A Natural Language Processing Paradigm for Detecting Informal Mentions of Research Data in Academic Literature,"Data citations provide a foundation for studying research data impact. Collecting and managing data citations is a new frontier in archival science and scholarly communication. However, the discovery and curation of research data citations is labor intensive. Data citations that reference unique identifiers (i.e. DOIs) are readily findable; however, informal mentions made to research data are more challenging to infer. We propose a natural language processing (NLP) paradigm to support the human task of identifying informal mentions made to research datasets. The work of discovering informal data mentions is currently performed by librarians and their staff in the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR), a large social science data archive that maintains a large bibliography of data-related literature. The NLP model is bootstrapped from data citations actively collected by librarians at ICPSR. The model combines pattern matching with multiple iterations of human annotations to learn additional rules for detecting informal data mentions. These examples are then used to train an NLP pipeline. The librarian-in-the-loop paradigm is centered in the data work performed by ICPSR librarians, supporting broader efforts to build a more comprehensive bibliography of data-related literature that reflects the scholarly communities of research data users."
HealthPrompt: A Zero-shot Learning Paradigm for Clinical Natural Language Processing,"Deep learning algorithms are dependent on the availability of large-scale annotated clinical text datasets. The lack of such publicly available datasets is the biggest bottleneck for the development of clinical Natural Language Processing(NLP) systems. Zero-Shot Learning(ZSL) refers to the use of deep learning models to classify instances from new classes of which no training data have been seen before. Prompt-based learning is an emerging ZSL technique where we define task-based templates for NLP tasks. We developed a novel prompt-based clinical NLP framework called HealthPrompt and applied the paradigm of prompt-based learning on clinical texts. In this technique, rather than fine-tuning a Pre-trained Language Model(PLM), the task definitions are tuned by defining a prompt template. We performed an in-depth analysis of HealthPrompt on six different PLMs in a no-data setting. Our experiments prove that prompts effectively capture the context of clinical texts and perform remarkably well without any training data."
PET: An Annotated Dataset for Process Extraction from Natural Language Text,"Process extraction from text is an important task of process discovery, for which various approaches have been developed in recent years. However, in contrast to other information extraction tasks, there is a lack of gold-standard corpora of business process descriptions that are carefully annotated with all the entities and relationships of interest. Due to this, it is currently hard to compare the results obtained by extraction approaches in an objective manner, whereas the lack of annotated texts also prevents the application of data-driven information extraction methodologies, typical of the natural language processing field. Therefore, to bridge this gap, we present the PET dataset, a first corpus of business process descriptions annotated with activities, gateways, actors, and flow information. We present our new resource, including a variety of baselines to benchmark the difficulty and challenges of business process extraction from text. PET can be accessed via huggingface.co/datasets/patriziobellan/PET"
Paper Plain: Making Medical Research Papers Approachable to Healthcare Consumers with Natural Language Processing,"When seeking information not covered in patient-friendly documents, like medical pamphlets, healthcare consumers may turn to the research literature. Reading medical papers, however, can be a challenging experience. To improve access to medical papers, we introduce a novel interactive interface-Paper Plain-with four features powered by natural language processing: definitions of unfamiliar terms, in-situ plain language section summaries, a collection of key questions that guide readers to answering passages, and plain language summaries of the answering passages. We evaluate Paper Plain, finding that participants who use Paper Plain have an easier time reading and understanding research papers without a loss in paper comprehension compared to those who use a typical PDF reader. Altogether, the study results suggest that guiding readers to relevant passages and providing plain language summaries, or ""gists,"" alongside the original paper content can make reading medical papers easier and give readers more confidence to approach these papers."
The impact of lexical and grammatical processing on generating code from natural language,"Considering the seq2seq architecture of TranX for natural language to code translation, we identify four key components of importance: grammatical constraints, lexical preprocessing, input representations, and copy mechanisms. To study the impact of these components, we use a state-of-the-art architecture that relies on BERT encoder and a grammar-based decoder for which a formalization is provided. The paper highlights the importance of the lexical substitution component in the current natural language to code systems."
Wastewater Pipe Rating Model Using Natural Language Processing,"Closed-circuit video (CCTV) inspection has been the most popular technique for visually evaluating the interior status of pipelines in recent decades. Certified inspectors prepare the pipe repair document based on the CCTV inspection. The traditional manual method of assessing sewage structural conditions from pipe repair documents takes a long time and is prone to human mistakes. The automatic identification of necessary texts has received little attention. By building an automated framework employing Natural Language Processing (NLP), this study presents an effective technique to automate the identification of the pipe defect rating of the pipe repair documents. NLP technologies are employed to break down textual material into grammatical units in this research. Further analysis entails using words to discover pipe defect symptoms and their frequency and then combining that information into a single score. Our model achieves 95.0% accuracy,94.9% sensitivity, 94.4% specificity, 95.9% precision score, and 95.7% F1 score, showing the potential of the proposed model to be used in large-scale pipe repair documents for accurate and efficient pipeline failure detection to improve the quality of the pipeline. Keywords: Sewer pipe inspection, Defect detection, Natural language processing, Text recognition"
"Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Explainable Artificial Intelligence in the Biomedical Domain","In this article, we first give an introduction to artificial intelligence and its applications in biology and medicine in Section 1. Deep learning methods are then described in Section 2. We narrow down the focus of the study on textual data in Section 3, where natural language processing and its applications in the biomedical domain are described. In Section 4, we give an introduction to explainable artificial intelligence and discuss the importance of explainability of artificial intelligence systems, especially in the biomedical domain."
Is Neuro-Symbolic AI Meeting its Promise in Natural Language Processing? A Structured Review,"Advocates for Neuro-Symbolic Artificial Intelligence (NeSy) assert that combining deep learning with symbolic reasoning will lead to stronger AI than either paradigm on its own. As successful as deep learning has been, it is generally accepted that even our best deep learning systems are not very good at abstract reasoning. And since reasoning is inextricably linked to language, it makes intuitive sense that Natural Language Processing (NLP), would be a particularly well-suited candidate for NeSy. We conduct a structured review of studies implementing NeSy for NLP, with the aim of answering the question of whether NeSy is indeed meeting its promises: reasoning, out-of-distribution generalization, interpretability, learning and reasoning from small data, and transferability to new domains. We examine the impact of knowledge representation, such as rules and semantic networks, language structure and relational structure, and whether implicit or explicit reasoning contributes to higher promise scores. We find that systems where logic is compiled into the neural network lead to the most NeSy goals being satisfied, while other factors such as knowledge representation, or type of neural architecture do not exhibit a clear correlation with goals being met. We find many discrepancies in how reasoning is defined, specifically in relation to human level reasoning, which impact decisions about model architectures and drive conclusions which are not always consistent across studies. Hence we advocate for a more methodical approach to the application of theories of human reasoning as well as the development of appropriate benchmarks, which we hope can lead to a better understanding of progress in the field. We make our data and code available on github for further analysis."
Welcome to the Modern World of Pronouns: Identity-Inclusive Natural Language Processing beyond Gender,"The world of pronouns is changing. From a closed class of words with few members to a much more open set of terms to reflect identities. However, Natural Language Processing (NLP) is barely reflecting this linguistic shift, even though recent work outlined the harms of gender-exclusive language technology. Particularly problematic is the current modeling 3rd person pronouns, as it largely ignores various phenomena like neopronouns, i.e., pronoun sets that are novel and not (yet) widely established. This omission contributes to the discrimination of marginalized and underrepresented groups, e.g., non-binary individuals. However, other identity-expression phenomena beyond gender are also ignored by current NLP technology. In this paper, we provide an overview of 3rd person pronoun issues for NLP. Based on our observations and ethical considerations, we define a series of desiderata for modeling pronouns in language technology. We evaluate existing and novel modeling approaches w.r.t. these desiderata qualitatively, and quantify the impact of a more discrimination-free approach on established benchmark data."
A gentle introduction to Quantum Natural Language Processing,"The main goal of this master's thesis is to introduce Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP) in a way understandable by both the NLP engineer and the quantum computing practitioner. QNLP is a recent application of quantum computing that aims at representing sentences' meaning as vectors encoded into quantum computers. To achieve this, the distributional meaning of words is extended by the compositional meaning of sentences (DisCoCat model) : the vectors representing words' meanings are composed through the syntactic structure of the sentence. This is done using an algorithm based on tensor products. We see that this algorithm is inefficient on classical computers but scales well using quantum circuits. After exposing the practical details of its implementation, we go through three use-cases."
Integrating AI Planning with Natural Language Processing: A Combination of Explicit and Tacit Knowledge,"Natural language processing (NLP) aims at investigating the interactions between agents and humans, processing and analyzing large amounts of natural language data. Large-scale language models play an important role in current natural language processing. However, the challenges of explainability and complexity come along with the developments of language models. One way is to introduce logical relations and rules into natural language processing models, such as making use of Automated Planning. Automated planning (AI planning) focuses on building symbolic domain models and synthesizing plans to transit initial states to goals based on domain models. Recently, there have been plenty of works related to these two fields, which have the abilities to generate explicit knowledge, e.g., preconditions and effects of action models, and learn from tacit knowledge, e.g., neural models, respectively. Integrating AI planning and natural language processing effectively improves the communication between human and intelligent agents. This paper outlines the commons and relations between AI planning and natural language processing, argues that each of them can effectively impact on the other one by five areas: (1) planning-based text understanding, (2) planning-based natural language processing, (3) planning-based explainability, (4) text-based human-robot interaction, and (5) applications. We also explore some potential future issues between AI planning and natural language processing. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the first work that addresses the deep connections between AI planning and Natural language processing."
A Survey on Dynamic Neural Networks for Natural Language Processing,"Effectively scaling large Transformer models is a main driver of recent advances in natural language processing. Dynamic neural networks, as an emerging research direction, are capable of scaling up neural networks with sub-linear increases in computation and time by dynamically adjusting their computational path based on the input. Dynamic neural networks could be a promising solution to the growing parameter numbers of pretrained language models, allowing both model pretraining with trillions of parameters and faster inference on mobile devices. In this survey, we summarize progress of three types of dynamic neural networks in NLP: skimming, mixture of experts, and early exit. We also highlight current challenges in dynamic neural networks and directions for future research."
Evaluating natural language processing models with generalization metrics that do not need access to any training or testing data,"The search for effective and robust metrics has been the focus of recent theoretical and empirical work on generalization of deep neural networks (NNs). In this paper, we discuss the performance of natural language processing (NLP) models, and we evaluate various existing and novel generalization metrics. Compared to prior studies, we (i) focus on NLP instead of computer vision (CV), (ii) focus on generalization metrics that predict test error instead of the generalization gap, (iii) focus on generalization metrics that do not need the access to data, and (iv) focus on the heavy-tail (HT) phenomenon that has received comparatively less attention in the study of NNs. We extend recent HT-based work which focuses on power law (PL) distributions, and we study exponential and exponentially truncated power law (E-TPL) fitting to the empirical spectral densities (ESDs) of weight matrices. Our empirical studies are carried on (i) hundreds of Transformers trained in different settings, in which we systematically vary different hyperparameters, (ii) a total of 51 pretrained Transformers from eight families of Huggingface NLP models, including BERT, GPT2, etc., and (iii) a total of 28 existing and novel generalization metrics. From our empirical analyses, we show that shape metrics, or the metrics obtained from fitting the shape of the ESDs, perform uniformly better at predicting generalization performance than scale metrics commonly studied in the literature, as measured by the rank correlations with the generalization performance. We also show that among the three HT distributions considered in our paper, the E-TPL fitting of ESDs performs the most robustly when the models are trained in experimental settings, while the PL fitting achieves the best performance on well-trained Huggingface models, and that both E-TPL and PL metrics (which are both shape metrics) outperform scale metrics."
NeuraHealth: An Automated Screening Pipeline to Detect Undiagnosed Cognitive Impairment in Electronic Health Records with Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing,"Dementia related cognitive impairment (CI) is a neurodegenerative disorder, affecting over 55 million people worldwide and growing rapidly at the rate of one new case every 3 seconds. 75% cases go undiagnosed globally with up to 90% in low-and-middle-income countries, leading to an estimated annual worldwide cost of USD 1.3 trillion, forecasted to reach 2.8 trillion by 2030. With no cure, a recurring failure of clinical trials, and a lack of early diagnosis, the mortality rate is 100%. Information in electronic health records (EHR) can provide vital clues for early detection of CI, but a manual review by experts is tedious and error prone. Several computational methods have been proposed, however, they lack an enhanced understanding of the linguistic context in complex language structures of EHR. Therefore, I propose a novel and more accurate framework, NeuraHealth, to identify patients who had no earlier diagnosis. In NeuraHealth, using patient EHR from Mass General Brigham BioBank, I fine-tuned a bi-directional attention-based deep learning natural language processing model to classify sequences. The sequence predictions were used to generate structured features as input for a patient level regularized logistic regression model. This two-step framework creates high dimensionality, outperforming all existing state-of-the-art computational methods as well as clinical methods. Further, I integrate the models into a real-world product, a web app, to create an automated EHR screening pipeline for scalable and high-speed discovery of undetected CI in EHR, making early diagnosis viable in medical facilities and in regions with scarce health services."
Recurrent Neural Networks with Mixed Hierarchical Structures and EM Algorithm for Natural Language Processing,"How to obtain hierarchical representations with an increasing level of abstraction becomes one of the key issues of learning with deep neural networks. A variety of RNN models have recently been proposed to incorporate both explicit and implicit hierarchical information in modeling languages in the literature. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called the latent indicator layer to identify and learn implicit hierarchical information (e.g., phrases), and further develop an EM algorithm to handle the latent indicator layer in training. The latent indicator layer further simplifies a text's hierarchical structure, which allows us to seamlessly integrate different levels of attention mechanisms into the structure. We called the resulting architecture as the EM-HRNN model. Furthermore, we develop two bootstrap strategies to effectively and efficiently train the EM-HRNN model on long text documents. Simulation studies and real data applications demonstrate that the EM-HRNN model with bootstrap training outperforms other RNN-based models in document classification tasks. The performance of the EM-HRNN model is comparable to a Transformer-based method called Bert-base, though the former is much smaller model and does not require pre-training."
Development of Fake News Model using Machine Learning through Natural Language Processing,"Fake news detection research is still in the early stage as this is a relatively new phenomenon in the interest raised by society. Machine learning helps to solve complex problems and to build AI systems nowadays and especially in those cases where we have tacit knowledge or the knowledge that is not known. We used machine learning algorithms and for identification of fake news; we applied three classifiers; Passive Aggressive, Naïve Bayes, and Support Vector Machine. Simple classification is not completely correct in fake news detection because classification methods are not specialized for fake news. With the integration of machine learning and text-based processing, we can detect fake news and build classifiers that can classify the news data. Text classification mainly focuses on extracting various features of text and after that incorporating those features into classification. The big challenge in this area is the lack of an efficient way to differentiate between fake and non-fake due to the unavailability of corpora. We applied three different machine learning classifiers on two publicly available datasets. Experimental analysis based on the existing dataset indicates a very encouraging and improved performance."
Rethink the Evaluation for Attack Strength of Backdoor Attacks in Natural Language Processing,"It has been shown that natural language processing (NLP) models are vulnerable to a kind of security threat called the Backdoor Attack, which utilizes a `backdoor trigger' paradigm to mislead the models. The most threatening backdoor attack is the stealthy backdoor, which defines the triggers as text style or syntactic. Although they have achieved an incredible high attack success rate (ASR), we find that the principal factor contributing to their ASR is not the `backdoor trigger' paradigm. Thus the capacity of these stealthy backdoor attacks is overestimated when categorized as backdoor attacks. Therefore, to evaluate the real attack power of backdoor attacks, we propose a new metric called attack successful rate difference (ASRD), which measures the ASR difference between clean state and poison state models. Besides, since the defenses against stealthy backdoor attacks are absent, we propose Trigger Breaker, consisting of two too simple tricks that can defend against stealthy backdoor attacks effectively. Experiments show that our method achieves significantly better performance than state-of-the-art defense methods against stealthy backdoor attacks."
HuSpaCy: an industrial-strength Hungarian natural language processing toolkit,"Although there are a couple of open-source language processing pipelines available for Hungarian, none of them satisfies the requirements of today's NLP applications. A language processing pipeline should consist of close to state-of-the-art lemmatization, morphosyntactic analysis, entity recognition and word embeddings. Industrial text processing applications have to satisfy non-functional software quality requirements, what is more, frameworks supporting multiple languages are more and more favored. This paper introduces HuSpaCy, an industry-ready Hungarian language processing toolkit. The presented tool provides components for the most important basic linguistic analysis tasks. It is open-source and is available under a permissive license. Our system is built upon spaCy's NLP components resulting in an easily usable, fast yet accurate application. Experiments confirm that HuSpaCy has high accuracy while maintaining resource-efficient prediction capabilities."
"Robust Natural Language Processing: Recent Advances, Challenges, and Future Directions","Recent natural language processing (NLP) techniques have accomplished high performance on benchmark datasets, primarily due to the significant improvement in the performance of deep learning. The advances in the research community have led to great enhancements in state-of-the-art production systems for NLP tasks, such as virtual assistants, speech recognition, and sentiment analysis. However, such NLP systems still often fail when tested with adversarial attacks. The initial lack of robustness exposed troubling gaps in current models' language understanding capabilities, creating problems when NLP systems are deployed in real life. In this paper, we present a structured overview of NLP robustness research by summarizing the literature in a systemic way across various dimensions. We then take a deep-dive into the various dimensions of robustness, across techniques, metrics, embeddings, and benchmarks. Finally, we argue that robustness should be multi-dimensional, provide insights into current research, identify gaps in the literature to suggest directions worth pursuing to address these gaps."
Learning with Latent Structures in Natural Language Processing: A Survey,"While end-to-end learning with fully differentiable models has enabled tremendous success in natural language process (NLP) and machine learning, there have been significant recent interests in learning with latent discrete structures to incorporate better inductive biases for improved end-task performance and better interpretability. This paradigm, however, is not straightforwardly amenable to the mainstream gradient-based optimization methods. This work surveys three main families of methods to learn such models: surrogate gradients, continuous relaxation, and marginal likelihood maximization via sampling. We conclude with a review of applications of these methods and an inspection of the learned latent structure that they induce."
A Survey on Using Gaze Behaviour for Natural Language Processing,"Gaze behaviour has been used as a way to gather cognitive information for a number of years. In this paper, we discuss the use of gaze behaviour in solving different tasks in natural language processing (NLP) without having to record it at test time. This is because the collection of gaze behaviour is a costly task, both in terms of time and money. Hence, in this paper, we focus on research done to alleviate the need for recording gaze behaviour at run time. We also mention different eye tracking corpora in multiple languages, which are currently available and can be used in natural language processing. We conclude our paper by discussing applications in a domain - education - and how learning gaze behaviour can help in solving the tasks of complex word identification and automatic essay grading."
A Survey on Gender Bias in Natural Language Processing,"Language can be used as a means of reproducing and enforcing harmful stereotypes and biases and has been analysed as such in numerous research. In this paper, we present a survey of 304 papers on gender bias in natural language processing. We analyse definitions of gender and its categories within social sciences and connect them to formal definitions of gender bias in NLP research. We survey lexica and datasets applied in research on gender bias and then compare and contrast approaches to detecting and mitigating gender bias. We find that research on gender bias suffers from four core limitations. 1) Most research treats gender as a binary variable neglecting its fluidity and continuity. 2) Most of the work has been conducted in monolingual setups for English or other high-resource languages. 3) Despite a myriad of papers on gender bias in NLP methods, we find that most of the newly developed algorithms do not test their models for bias and disregard possible ethical considerations of their work. 4) Finally, methodologies developed in this line of research are fundamentally flawed covering very limited definitions of gender bias and lacking evaluation baselines and pipelines. We suggest recommendations towards overcoming these limitations as a guide for future research."
LINDA: Unsupervised Learning to Interpolate in Natural Language Processing,"Despite the success of mixup in data augmentation, its applicability to natural language processing (NLP) tasks has been limited due to the discrete and variable-length nature of natural languages. Recent studies have thus relied on domain-specific heuristics and manually crafted resources, such as dictionaries, in order to apply mixup in NLP. In this paper, we instead propose an unsupervised learning approach to text interpolation for the purpose of data augmentation, to which we refer as ""Learning to INterpolate for Data Augmentation"" (LINDA), that does not require any heuristics nor manually crafted resources but learns to interpolate between any pair of natural language sentences over a natural language manifold. After empirically demonstrating the LINDA's interpolation capability, we show that LINDA indeed allows us to seamlessly apply mixup in NLP and leads to better generalization in text classification both in-domain and out-of-domain."
Natural language processing to identify lupus nephritis phenotype in electronic health records,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by an unpredictable course of flares and remission with diverse manifestations. Lupus nephritis, one of the major disease manifestations of SLE for organ damage and mortality, is a key component of lupus classification criteria. Accurately identifying lupus nephritis in electronic health records (EHRs) would therefore benefit large cohort observational studies and clinical trials where characterization of the patient population is critical for recruitment, study design, and analysis. Lupus nephritis can be recognized through procedure codes and structured data, such as laboratory tests. However, other critical information documenting lupus nephritis, such as histologic reports from kidney biopsies and prior medical history narratives, require sophisticated text processing to mine information from pathology reports and clinical notes. In this study, we developed algorithms to identify lupus nephritis with and without natural language processing (NLP) using EHR data. We developed four algorithms: a rule-based algorithm using only structured data (baseline algorithm) and three algorithms using different NLP models. The three NLP models are based on regularized logistic regression and use different sets of features including positive mention of concept unique identifiers (CUIs), number of appearances of CUIs, and a mixture of three components respectively. The baseline algorithm and the best performed NLP algorithm were external validated on a dataset from Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC). Our best performing NLP model incorporating features from both structured data, regular expression concepts, and mapped CUIs improved F measure in both the NMEDW (0.41 vs 0.79) and VUMC (0.62 vs 0.96) datasets compared to the baseline lupus nephritis algorithm."
Explainable Natural Language Processing with Matrix Product States,"Despite empirical successes of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in natural language processing (NLP), theoretical understanding of RNNs is still limited due to intrinsically complex non-linear computations. We systematically analyze RNNs' behaviors in a ubiquitous NLP task, the sentiment analysis of movie reviews, via the mapping between a class of RNNs called recurrent arithmetic circuits (RACs) and a matrix product state (MPS). Using the von-Neumann entanglement entropy (EE) as a proxy for information propagation, we show that single-layer RACs possess a maximum information propagation capacity, reflected by the saturation of the EE. Enlarging the bond dimension beyond the EE saturation threshold does not increase model prediction accuracies, so a minimal model that best estimates the data statistics can be inferred. Although the saturated EE is smaller than the maximum EE allowed by the area law, our minimal model still achieves ~99% training accuracies in realistic sentiment analysis data sets. Thus, low EE is not a warrant against the adoption of single-layer RACs for NLP. Contrary to a common belief that long-range information propagation is the main source of RNNs' successes, we show that single-layer RACs harness high expressiveness from the subtle interplay between the information propagation and the word vector embeddings. Our work sheds light on the phenomenology of learning in RACs, and more generally on the explainability of RNNs for NLP, using tools from many-body quantum physics."
Fine-Tuning Large Neural Language Models for Biomedical Natural Language Processing,"Motivation: A perennial challenge for biomedical researchers and clinical practitioners is to stay abreast with the rapid growth of publications and medical notes. Natural language processing (NLP) has emerged as a promising direction for taming information overload. In particular, large neural language models facilitate transfer learning by pretraining on unlabeled text, as exemplified by the successes of BERT models in various NLP applications. However, fine-tuning such models for an end task remains challenging, especially with small labeled datasets, which are common in biomedical NLP.  Results: We conduct a systematic study on fine-tuning stability in biomedical NLP. We show that finetuning performance may be sensitive to pretraining settings, especially in low-resource domains. Large models have potential to attain better performance, but increasing model size also exacerbates finetuning instability. We thus conduct a comprehensive exploration of techniques for addressing fine-tuning instability. We show that these techniques can substantially improve fine-tuning performance for lowresource biomedical NLP applications. Specifically, freezing lower layers is helpful for standard BERT-BASE models, while layerwise decay is more effective for BERT-LARGE and ELECTRA models. For low-resource text similarity tasks such as BIOSSES, reinitializing the top layer is the optimal strategy. Overall, domainspecific vocabulary and pretraining facilitate more robust models for fine-tuning. Based on these findings, we establish new state of the art on a wide range of biomedical NLP applications.  Availability and implementation: To facilitate progress in biomedical NLP, we release our state-of-the-art pretrained and fine-tuned models: https://aka.ms/BLURB."
The King is Naked: on the Notion of Robustness for Natural Language Processing,"There is growing evidence that the classical notion of adversarial robustness originally introduced for images has been adopted as a de facto standard by a large part of the NLP research community. We show that this notion is problematic in the context of NLP as it considers a narrow spectrum of linguistic phenomena. In this paper, we argue for semantic robustness, which is better aligned with the human concept of linguistic fidelity. We characterize semantic robustness in terms of biases that it is expected to induce in a model. We study semantic robustness of a range of vanilla and robustly trained architectures using a template-based generative test bed. We complement the analysis with empirical evidence that, despite being harder to implement, semantic robustness can improve performance %gives guarantees for on complex linguistic phenomena where models robust in the classical sense fail."
A Scoping Review of Publicly Available Language Tasks in Clinical Natural Language Processing,"Objective: to provide a scoping review of papers on clinical natural language processing (NLP) tasks that use publicly available electronic health record data from a cohort of patients. Materials and Methods: We searched six databases, including biomedical research and computer science literature database. A round of title/abstract screening and full-text screening were conducted by two reviewers. Our method followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Results: A total of 35 papers with 47 clinical NLP tasks met inclusion criteria between 2007 and 2021. We categorized the tasks by the type of NLP problems, including name entity recognition, summarization, and other NLP tasks. Some tasks were introduced with a topic of clinical decision support applications, such as substance abuse, phenotyping, cohort selection for clinical trial. We summarized the tasks by publication and dataset information. Discussion: The breadth of clinical NLP tasks keeps growing as the field of NLP evolves with advancements in language systems. However, gaps exist in divergent interests between general domain NLP community and clinical informatics community, and in generalizability of the data sources. We also identified issues in data selection and preparation including the lack of time-sensitive data, and invalidity of problem size and evaluation. Conclusions: The existing clinical NLP tasks cover a wide range of topics and the field will continue to grow and attract more attention from both general domain NLP and clinical informatics community. We encourage future work to incorporate multi-disciplinary collaboration, reporting transparency, and standardization in data preparation."
Investigating the Impact of 9/11 on The Simpsons through Natural Language Processing,"The impact of real world events on fictional media is particularly apparent in the American cartoon series The Simpsons. While there are often very direct pop culture references evident in the dialogue and visual gags of the show, subtle changes in tone or sentiment may not be so obvious. Our aim was to use Natural Language Processing to attempt to search for changes in word frequency, topic, and sentiment before and after the September 11 terrorist attacks in New York. No clear trend change was seen, there was a slight decrease in the average sentiment over time around the relevant period between 2000 and 2002, but the scripts still maintained an overall positive value, indicating that the comedic nature of The Simpsons did not wane particularly significantly. The exploration of other social issues and even specific character statistics is needed to bolster the findings here."
Automatic evaluation of scientific abstracts through natural language processing,"This work presents a framework to classify and evaluate distinct research abstract texts which are focused on the description of processes and their applications. In this context, this paper proposes natural language processing algorithms to classify, segment and evaluate the results of scientific work. Initially, the proposed framework categorize the abstract texts into according to the problems intended to be solved by employing a text classification approach. Then, the abstract text is segmented into problem description, methodology and results. Finally, the methodology of the abstract is ranked based on the sentiment analysis of its results. The proposed framework allows us to quickly rank the best methods to solve specific problems. To validate the proposed framework, oil production anomaly abstracts were experimented and achieved promising results."
A Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning based Model for Automated Vehicle Diagnostics using Free-Text Customer Service Reports,"Initial fault detection and diagnostics are imperative measures to improve the efficiency, safety, and stability of vehicle operation. In recent years, numerous studies have investigated data-driven approaches to improve the vehicle diagnostics process using available vehicle data. Moreover, data-driven methods are employed to enhance customer-service agent interactions. In this study, we demonstrate a machine learning pipeline to improve automated vehicle diagnostics. First, Natural Language Processing (NLP) is used to automate the extraction of crucial information from free-text failure reports (generated during customers' calls to the service department). Then, deep learning algorithms are employed to validate service requests and filter vague or misleading claims. Ultimately, different classification algorithms are implemented to classify service requests so that valid service requests can be directed to the relevant service department. The proposed model- Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) along with Convolution Neural Network (CNN)- shows more than 18\% accuracy improvement in validating service requests compared to technicians' capabilities. In addition, using domain-based NLP techniques at preprocessing and feature extraction stages along with CNN-BiLSTM based request validation enhanced the accuracy (>25\%), sensitivity (>39\%), specificity (>11\%), and precision (>11\%) of Gradient Tree Boosting (GTB) service classification model. The Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve (ROC-AUC) reached 0.82."
Linguistic Knowledge in Data Augmentation for Natural Language Processing: An Example on Chinese Question Matching,"To investigate the role of linguistic knowledge in data augmentation (DA) for Natural Language Processing (NLP), we designed two adapted DA programs and applied them to LCQMC (a Large-scale Chinese Question Matching Corpus) for a binary Chinese question matching classification task. The two DA programs produce augmented texts by five simple text editing operations (or DA techniques), largely irrespective of language generation rules, but one is enhanced with a pre-trained n-gram language model to fuse it with prior linguistic knowledge. We then trained four neural network models (BOW, CNN, LSTM, and GRU) and a pre-trained model (ERNIE-Gram) on the LCQMCs train sets of varying size as well as the related augmented train sets produced by the two DA programs. The results show that there are no significant performance differences between the models trained on the two types of augmented train sets, both when the five DA techniques are applied together or separately. Moreover, due to the inability of the five DA techniques to make strictly paraphrastic augmented texts, the results indicate the need of sufficient amounts of training examples for the classification models trained on them to mediate the negative impact of false matching augmented text pairs and improve performance, a limitation of random text editing perturbations used as a DA approach. Similar results were also obtained for English."
Natural Language Processing in-and-for Design Research,"We review the scholarly contributions that utilise Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to support the design process. Using a heuristic approach, we gathered 223 articles that are published in 32 journals within the period 1991-present. We present state-of-the-art NLP in-and-for design research by reviewing these articles according to the type of natural language text sources: internal reports, design concepts, discourse transcripts, technical publications, consumer opinions, and others. Upon summarizing and identifying the gaps in these contributions, we utilise an existing design innovation framework to identify the applications that are currently being supported by NLP. We then propose a few methodological and theoretical directions for future NLP in-and-for design research."
CVSS-BERT: Explainable Natural Language Processing to Determine the Severity of a Computer Security Vulnerability from its Description,"When a new computer security vulnerability is publicly disclosed, only a textual description of it is available. Cybersecurity experts later provide an analysis of the severity of the vulnerability using the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). Specifically, the different characteristics of the vulnerability are summarized into a vector (consisting of a set of metrics), from which a severity score is computed. However, because of the high number of vulnerabilities disclosed everyday this process requires lot of manpower, and several days may pass before a vulnerability is analyzed. We propose to leverage recent advances in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to determine the CVSS vector and the associated severity score of a vulnerability from its textual description in an explainable manner. To this purpose, we trained multiple BERT classifiers, one for each metric composing the CVSS vector. Experimental results show that our trained classifiers are able to determine the value of the metrics of the CVSS vector with high accuracy. The severity score computed from the predicted CVSS vector is also very close to the real severity score attributed by a human expert. For explainability purpose, gradient-based input saliency method was used to determine the most relevant input words for a given prediction made by our classifiers. Often, the top relevant words include terms in agreement with the rationales of a human cybersecurity expert, making the explanation comprehensible for end-users."
A Quantum Natural Language Processing Approach to Musical Intelligence,"There has been tremendous progress in Artificial Intelligence (AI) for music, in particular for musical composition and access to large databases for commercialisation through the Internet. We are interested in further advancing this field, focusing on composition. In contrast to current black-box AI methods, we are championing an interpretable compositional outlook on generative music systems. In particular, we are importing methods from the Distributional Compositional Categorical (DisCoCat) modelling framework for Natural Language Processing (NLP), motivated by musical grammars. Quantum computing is a nascent technology, which is very likely to impact the music industry in time to come. Thus, we are pioneering a Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP) approach to develop a new generation of intelligent musical systems. This work follows from previous experimental implementations of DisCoCat linguistic models on quantum hardware. In this chapter, we present Quanthoven, the first proof-of-concept ever built, which (a) demonstrates that it is possible to program a quantum computer to learn to classify music that conveys different meanings and (b) illustrates how such a capability might be leveraged to develop a system to compose meaningful pieces of music. After a discussion about our current understanding of music as a communication medium and its relationship to natural language, the chapter focuses on the techniques developed to (a) encode musical compositions as quantum circuits, and (b) design a quantum classifier. The chapter ends with demonstrations of compositions created with the system."
On Transferability of Prompt Tuning for Natural Language Processing,"Prompt tuning (PT) is a promising parameter-efficient method to utilize extremely large pre-trained language models (PLMs), which can achieve comparable performance to full-parameter fine-tuning by only tuning a few soft prompts. However, PT requires much more training time than fine-tuning. Intuitively, knowledge transfer can help to improve the efficiency. To explore whether we can improve PT via prompt transfer, we empirically investigate the transferability of soft prompts across different downstream tasks and PLMs in this work. We find that (1) in zero-shot setting, trained soft prompts can effectively transfer to similar tasks on the same PLM and also to other PLMs with a cross-model projector trained on similar tasks; (2) when used as initialization, trained soft prompts of similar tasks and projected prompts of other PLMs can significantly accelerate training and also improve the performance of PT. Moreover, to explore what decides prompt transferability, we investigate various transferability indicators and find that the overlapping rate of activated neurons strongly reflects the transferability, which suggests how the prompts stimulate PLMs is essential. Our findings show that prompt transfer is promising for improving PT, and further research shall focus more on prompts' stimulation to PLMs. The source code can be obtained from https://github.com/thunlp/Prompt-Transferability."
Recent Advances in Natural Language Processing via Large Pre-Trained Language Models: A Survey,"Large, pre-trained transformer-based language models such as BERT have drastically changed the Natural Language Processing (NLP) field. We present a survey of recent work that uses these large language models to solve NLP tasks via pre-training then fine-tuning, prompting, or text generation approaches. We also present approaches that use pre-trained language models to generate data for training augmentation or other purposes. We conclude with discussions on limitations and suggested directions for future research."
Natural Language Processing for Smart Healthcare,"Smart healthcare has achieved significant progress in recent years. Emerging artificial intelligence (AI) technologies enable various smart applications across various healthcare scenarios. As an essential technology powered by AI, natural language processing (NLP) plays a key role in smart healthcare due to its capability of analysing and understanding human language. In this work, we review existing studies that concern NLP for smart healthcare from the perspectives of technique and application. We first elaborate on different NLP approaches and the NLP pipeline for smart healthcare from the technical point of view. Then, in the context of smart healthcare applications employing NLP techniques, we introduce representative smart healthcare scenarios, including clinical practice, hospital management, personal care, public health, and drug development. We further discuss two specific medical issues, i.e., the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and mental health, in which NLP-driven smart healthcare plays an important role. Finally, we discuss the limitations of current works and identify the directions for future works."
LegalNLP -- Natural Language Processing methods for the Brazilian Legal Language,"We present and make available pre-trained language models (Phraser, Word2Vec, Doc2Vec, FastText, and BERT) for the Brazilian legal language, a Python package with functions to facilitate their use, and a set of demonstrations/tutorials containing some applications involving them. Given that our material is built upon legal texts coming from several Brazilian courts, this initiative is extremely helpful for the Brazilian legal field, which lacks other open and specific tools and language models. Our main objective is to catalyze the use of natural language processing tools for legal texts analysis by the Brazilian industry, government, and academia, providing the necessary tools and accessible material."
An Open Natural Language Processing Development Framework for EHR-based Clinical Research: A case demonstration using the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C),"While we pay attention to the latest advances in clinical natural language processing (NLP), we can notice some resistance in the clinical and translational research community to adopt NLP models due to limited transparency, interpretability, and usability. In this study, we proposed an open natural language processing development framework. We evaluated it through the implementation of NLP algorithms for the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C). Based on the interests in information extraction from COVID-19 related clinical notes, our work includes 1) an open data annotation process using COVID-19 signs and symptoms as the use case, 2) a community-driven ruleset composing platform, and 3) a synthetic text data generation workflow to generate texts for information extraction tasks without involving human subjects. The corpora were derived from texts from three different institutions (Mayo Clinic, University of Kentucky, University of Minnesota). The gold standard annotations were tested with a single institution's (Mayo) ruleset. This resulted in performances of 0.876, 0.706, and 0.694 in F-scores for Mayo, Minnesota, and Kentucky test datasets, respectively. The study as a consortium effort of the N3C NLP subgroup demonstrates the feasibility of creating a federated NLP algorithm development and benchmarking platform to enhance multi-institution clinical NLP study and adoption. Although we use COVID-19 as a use case in this effort, our framework is general enough to be applied to other domains of interest in clinical NLP."
Interpreting Deep Learning Models in Natural Language Processing: A Review,"Neural network models have achieved state-of-the-art performances in a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, a long-standing criticism against neural network models is the lack of interpretability, which not only reduces the reliability of neural NLP systems but also limits the scope of their applications in areas where interpretability is essential (e.g., health care applications). In response, the increasing interest in interpreting neural NLP models has spurred a diverse array of interpretation methods over recent years. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of various interpretation methods for neural models in NLP. We first stretch out a high-level taxonomy for interpretation methods in NLP, i.e., training-based approaches, test-based approaches, and hybrid approaches. Next, we describe sub-categories in each category in detail, e.g., influence-function based methods, KNN-based methods, attention-based models, saliency-based methods, perturbation-based methods, etc. We point out deficiencies of current methods and suggest some avenues for future research."
Using Natural Language Processing to Understand Reasons and Motivators Behind Customer Calls in Financial Domain,"In this era of abundant digital information, customer satisfaction has become one of the prominent factors in the success of any business. Customers want a one-click solution for almost everything. They tend to get unsatisfied if they have to call about something which they could have done online. Moreover, incoming calls are a high-cost component for any business. Thus, it is essential to develop a framework capable of mining the reasons and motivators behind customer calls. This paper proposes two models. Firstly, an attention-based stacked bidirectional Long Short Term Memory Network followed by Hierarchical Clustering for extracting these reasons from transcripts of inbound calls. Secondly, a set of ensemble models based on probabilities from Support Vector Machines and Logistic Regression. It is capable of detecting factors that led to these calls. Extensive evaluation proves the effectiveness of these models."
ViraPart: A Text Refinement Framework for Automatic Speech Recognition and Natural Language Processing Tasks in Persian,"The Persian language is an inflectional subject-object-verb language. This fact makes Persian a more uncertain language. However, using techniques such as Zero-Width Non-Joiner (ZWNJ) recognition, punctuation restoration, and Persian Ezafe construction will lead us to a more understandable and precise language. In most of the works in Persian, these techniques are addressed individually. Despite that, we believe that for text refinement in Persian, all of these tasks are necessary. In this work, we proposed a ViraPart framework that uses embedded ParsBERT in its core for text clarifications. First, used the BERT variant for Persian following by a classifier layer for classification procedures. Next, we combined models outputs to output cleartext. In the end, the proposed model for ZWNJ recognition, punctuation restoration, and Persian Ezafe construction performs the averaged F1 macro scores of 96.90%, 92.13%, and 98.50%, respectively. Experimental results show that our proposed approach is very effective in text refinement for the Persian language."
The Dawn of Quantum Natural Language Processing,"In this paper, we discuss the initial attempts at boosting understanding human language based on deep-learning models with quantum computing. We successfully train a quantum-enhanced Long Short-Term Memory network to perform the parts-of-speech tagging task via numerical simulations. Moreover, a quantum-enhanced Transformer is proposed to perform the sentiment analysis based on the existing dataset."
We Need to Talk About Data: The Importance of Data Readiness in Natural Language Processing,"In this paper, we identify the state of data as being an important reason for failure in applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects. We argue that there is a gap between academic research in NLP and its application to problems outside academia, and that this gap is rooted in poor mutual understanding between academic researchers and their non-academic peers who seek to apply research results to their operations. To foster transfer of research results from academia to non-academic settings, and the corresponding influx of requirements back to academia, we propose a method for improving the communication between researchers and external stakeholders regarding the accessibility, validity, and utility of data based on Data Readiness Levels \cite{lawrence2017data}. While still in its infancy, the method has been iterated on and applied in multiple innovation and research projects carried out with stakeholders in both the private and public sectors. Finally, we invite researchers and practitioners to share their experiences, and thus contributing to a body of work aimed at raising awareness of the importance of data readiness for NLP."
Data Augmentation Approaches in Natural Language Processing: A Survey,"As an effective strategy, data augmentation (DA) alleviates data scarcity scenarios where deep learning techniques may fail. It is widely applied in computer vision then introduced to natural language processing and achieves improvements in many tasks. One of the main focuses of the DA methods is to improve the diversity of training data, thereby helping the model to better generalize to unseen testing data. In this survey, we frame DA methods into three categories based on the diversity of augmented data, including paraphrasing, noising, and sampling. Our paper sets out to analyze DA methods in detail according to the above categories. Further, we also introduce their applications in NLP tasks as well as the challenges. Some helpful resources are provided in the appendix."
What to Prioritize? Natural Language Processing for the Development of a Modern Bug Tracking Solution in Hardware Development,"Managing large numbers of incoming bug reports and finding the most critical issues in hardware development is time consuming, but crucial in order to reduce development costs. In this paper, we present an approach to predict the time to fix, the risk and the complexity of debugging and resolution of a bug report using different supervised machine learning algorithms, namely Random Forest, Naive Bayes, SVM, MLP and XGBoost. Further, we investigate the effect of the application of active learning and we evaluate the impact of different text representation techniques, namely TF-IDF, Word2Vec, Universal Sentence Encoder and XLNet on the model's performance. The evaluation shows that a combination of text embeddings generated through the Universal Sentence Encoder and MLP as classifier outperforms all other methods, and is well suited to predict the risk and complexity of bug tickets."
Automatic Generation of Word Problems for Academic Education via Natural Language Processing (NLP),"Digital learning platforms enable students to learn on a flexible and individual schedule as well as providing instant feedback mechanisms. The field of STEM education requires students to solve numerous training exercises to grasp underlying concepts. It is apparent that there are restrictions in current online education in terms of exercise diversity and individuality. Many exercises show little variance in structure and content, hindering the adoption of abstraction capabilities by students. This thesis proposes an approach to generate diverse, context rich word problems. In addition to requiring the generated language to be grammatically correct, the nature of word problems implies additional constraints on the validity of contents. The proposed approach is proven to be effective in generating valid word problems for mathematical statistics. The experimental results present a tradeoff between generation time and exercise validity. The system can easily be parametrized to handle this tradeoff according to the requirements of specific use cases."
Language Invariant Properties in Natural Language Processing,"Meaning is context-dependent, but many properties of language (should) remain the same even if we transform the context. For example, sentiment, entailment, or speaker properties should be the same in a translation and original of a text. We introduce language invariant properties: i.e., properties that should not change when we transform text, and how they can be used to quantitatively evaluate the robustness of transformation algorithms. We use translation and paraphrasing as transformation examples, but our findings apply more broadly to any transformation. Our results indicate that many NLP transformations change properties like author characteristics, i.e., make them sound more male. We believe that studying these properties will allow NLP to address both social factors and pragmatic aspects of language. We also release an application suite that can be used to evaluate the invariance of transformation applications."
Paradigm Shift in Natural Language Processing,"In the era of deep learning, modeling for most NLP tasks has converged to several mainstream paradigms. For example, we usually adopt the sequence labeling paradigm to solve a bundle of tasks such as POS-tagging, NER, Chunking, and adopt the classification paradigm to solve tasks like sentiment analysis. With the rapid progress of pre-trained language models, recent years have observed a rising trend of Paradigm Shift, which is solving one NLP task by reformulating it as another one. Paradigm shift has achieved great success on many tasks, becoming a promising way to improve model performance. Moreover, some of these paradigms have shown great potential to unify a large number of NLP tasks, making it possible to build a single model to handle diverse tasks. In this paper, we review such phenomenon of paradigm shifts in recent years, highlighting several paradigms that have the potential to solve different NLP tasks."
Distiller: A Systematic Study of Model Distillation Methods in Natural Language Processing,"We aim to identify how different components in the KD pipeline affect the resulting performance and how much the optimal KD pipeline varies across different datasets/tasks, such as the data augmentation policy, the loss function, and the intermediate representation for transferring the knowledge between teacher and student. To tease apart their effects, we propose Distiller, a meta KD framework that systematically combines a broad range of techniques across different stages of the KD pipeline, which enables us to quantify each component's contribution. Within Distiller, we unify commonly used objectives for distillation of intermediate representations under a universal mutual information (MI) objective and propose a class of MI-α objective functions with better bias/variance trade-off for estimating the MI between the teacher and the student. On a diverse set of NLP datasets, the best Distiller configurations are identified via large-scale hyperparameter optimization. Our experiments reveal the following: 1) the approach used to distill the intermediate representations is the most important factor in KD performance, 2) among different objectives for intermediate distillation, MI-α performs the best, and 3) data augmentation provides a large boost for small training datasets or small student networks. Moreover, we find that different datasets/tasks prefer different KD algorithms, and thus propose a simple AutoDistiller algorithm that can recommend a good KD pipeline for a new dataset."
Small-Bench NLP: Benchmark for small single GPU trained models in Natural Language Processing,"Recent progress in the Natural Language Processing domain has given us several State-of-the-Art (SOTA) pretrained models which can be finetuned for specific tasks. These large models with billions of parameters trained on numerous GPUs/TPUs over weeks are leading in the benchmark leaderboards. In this paper, we discuss the need for a benchmark for cost and time effective smaller models trained on a single GPU. This will enable researchers with resource constraints experiment with novel and innovative ideas on tokenization, pretraining tasks, architecture, fine tuning methods etc. We set up Small-Bench NLP, a benchmark for small efficient neural language models trained on a single GPU. Small-Bench NLP benchmark comprises of eight NLP tasks on the publicly available GLUE datasets and a leaderboard to track the progress of the community. Our ELECTRA-DeBERTa (15M parameters) small model architecture achieves an average score of 81.53 which is comparable to that of BERT-Base's 82.20 (110M parameters). Our models, code and leaderboard are available at https://github.com/smallbenchnlp"
Multi-Task Learning in Natural Language Processing: An Overview,"Deep learning approaches have achieved great success in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). However, deep neural models often suffer from overfitting and data scarcity problems that are pervasive in NLP tasks. In recent years, Multi-Task Learning (MTL), which can leverage useful information of related tasks to achieve simultaneous performance improvement on multiple related tasks, has been used to handle these problems. In this paper, we give an overview of the use of MTL in NLP tasks. We first review MTL architectures used in NLP tasks and categorize them into four classes, including the parallel architecture, hierarchical architecture, modular architecture, and generative adversarial architecture. Then we present optimization techniques on loss construction, data sampling, and task scheduling to properly train a multi-task model. After presenting applications of MTL in a variety of NLP tasks, we introduce some benchmark datasets. Finally, we make a conclusion and discuss several possible research directions in this field."
On the validity of pre-trained transformers for natural language processing in the software engineering domain,"Transformers are the current state-of-the-art of natural language processing in many domains and are using traction within software engineering research as well. Such models are pre-trained on large amounts of data, usually from the general domain. However, we only have a limited understanding regarding the validity of transformers within the software engineering domain, i.e., how good such models are at understanding words and sentences within a software engineering context and how this improves the state-of-the-art. Within this article, we shed light on this complex, but crucial issue. We compare BERT transformer models trained with software engineering data with transformers based on general domain data in multiple dimensions: their vocabulary, their ability to understand which words are missing, and their performance in classification tasks. Our results show that for tasks that require understanding of the software engineering context, pre-training with software engineering data is valuable, while general domain models are sufficient for general language understanding, also within the software engineering domain."
Leveraging Code Clones and Natural Language Processing for Log Statement Prediction,"Software developers embed logging statements inside the source code as an imperative duty in modern software development as log files are necessary for tracking down runtime system issues and troubleshooting system management tasks. Prior research has emphasized the importance of logging statements in the operation and debugging of software systems. However, the current logging process is mostly manual and ad hoc, and thus, proper placement and content of logging statements remain as challenges. To overcome these challenges, methods that aim to automate log placement and log content, i.e., 'where, what, and how to log', are of high interest. Thus, we propose to accomplish the goal of this research, that is ""to predict the log statements by utilizing source code clones and natural language processing (NLP)"", as these approaches provide additional context and advantage for log prediction. We pursue the following four research objectives: (RO1) investigate whether source code clones can be leveraged for log statement location prediction, (RO2) propose a clone-based approach for log statement prediction, (RO3) predict log statement's description with code-clone and NLP models, and (RO4) examine approaches to automatically predict additional details of the log statement, such as its verbosity level and variables. For this purpose, we perform an experimental analysis on seven open-source java projects, extract their method-level code clones, investigate their attributes, and utilize them for log location and description prediction. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of log-aware clone detection for automated log location and description prediction and outperforms the prior work."
DeepZensols: Deep Natural Language Processing Framework,"Reproducing results in publications by distributing publicly available source code is becoming ever more popular. Given the difficulty of reproducing machine learning (ML) experiments, there have been significant efforts in reducing the variance of these results. As in any science, the ability to consistently reproduce results effectively strengthens the underlying hypothesis of the work, and thus, should be regarded as important as the novel aspect of the research itself. The contribution of this work is a framework that is able to reproduce consistent results and provides a means of easily creating, training, and evaluating natural language processing (NLP) deep learning (DL) models."
Sequential Attention Module for Natural Language Processing,"Recently, large pre-trained neural language models have attained remarkable performance on many downstream natural language processing (NLP) applications via fine-tuning. In this paper, we target at how to further improve the token representations on the language models. We, therefore, propose a simple yet effective plug-and-play module, Sequential Attention Module (SAM), on the token embeddings learned from a pre-trained language model. Our proposed SAM consists of two main attention modules deployed sequentially: Feature-wise Attention Module (FAM) and Token-wise Attention Module (TAM). More specifically, FAM can effectively identify the importance of features at each dimension and promote the effect via dot-product on the original token embeddings for downstream NLP applications. Meanwhile, TAM can further re-weight the features at the token-wise level. Moreover, we propose an adaptive filter on FAM to prevent noise impact and increase information absorption. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the advantages and properties of our proposed SAM. We first show how SAM plays a primary role in the champion solution of two subtasks of SemEval'21 Task 7. After that, we apply SAM on sentiment analysis and three popular NLP tasks and demonstrate that SAM consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines."
Data Driven Content Creation using Statistical and Natural Language Processing Techniques for Financial Domain,"Over the years customers' expectation of getting information instantaneously has given rise to the increased usage of channels like virtual assistants. Typically, customers try to get their questions answered by low-touch channels like search and virtual assistant first, before getting in touch with a live chat agent or the phone representative. Higher usage of these low-touch systems is a win-win for both customers and the organization since it enables organizations to attain a low cost of service while customers get served without delay. In this paper, we propose a two-part framework where the first part describes methods to combine the information from different interaction channels like call, search, and chat. We do this by summarizing (using a stacked Bi-LSTM network) the high-touch interaction channel data such as call and chat into short searchquery like customer intents and then creating an organically grown intent taxonomy from interaction data (using Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering). The second part of the framework focuses on extracting customer questions by analyzing interaction data sources. It calculates similarity scores using TF-IDF and BERT(Devlin et al., 2019). It also maps these identified questions to the output of the first part of the framework using syntactic and semantic similarity."
Datasets: A Community Library for Natural Language Processing,"The scale, variety, and quantity of publicly-available NLP datasets has grown rapidly as researchers propose new tasks, larger models, and novel benchmarks. Datasets is a community library for contemporary NLP designed to support this ecosystem. Datasets aims to standardize end-user interfaces, versioning, and documentation, while providing a lightweight front-end that behaves similarly for small datasets as for internet-scale corpora. The design of the library incorporates a distributed, community-driven approach to adding datasets and documenting usage. After a year of development, the library now includes more than 650 unique datasets, has more than 250 contributors, and has helped support a variety of novel cross-dataset research projects and shared tasks. The library is available at https://github.com/huggingface/datasets."
Learning Neural Models for Natural Language Processing in the Face of Distributional Shift,"The dominating NLP paradigm of training a strong neural predictor to perform one task on a specific dataset has led to state-of-the-art performance in a variety of applications (eg. sentiment classification, span-prediction based question answering or machine translation). However, it builds upon the assumption that the data distribution is stationary, ie. that the data is sampled from a fixed distribution both at training and test time. This way of training is inconsistent with how we as humans are able to learn from and operate within a constantly changing stream of information. Moreover, it is ill-adapted to real-world use cases where the data distribution is expected to shift over the course of a model's lifetime.  The first goal of this thesis is to characterize the different forms this shift can take in the context of natural language processing, and propose benchmarks and evaluation metrics to measure its effect on current deep learning architectures. We then proceed to take steps to mitigate the effect of distributional shift on NLP models. To this end, we develop methods based on parametric reformulations of the distributionally robust optimization framework. Empirically, we demonstrate that these approaches yield more robust models as demonstrated on a selection of realistic problems. In the third and final part of this thesis, we explore ways of efficiently adapting existing models to new domains or tasks. Our contribution to this topic takes inspiration from information geometry to derive a new gradient update rule which alleviate catastrophic forgetting issues during adaptation."
"Causal Inference in Natural Language Processing: Estimation, Prediction, Interpretation and Beyond","A fundamental goal of scientific research is to learn about causal relationships. However, despite its critical role in the life and social sciences, causality has not had the same importance in Natural Language Processing (NLP), which has traditionally placed more emphasis on predictive tasks. This distinction is beginning to fade, with an emerging area of interdisciplinary research at the convergence of causal inference and language processing. Still, research on causality in NLP remains scattered across domains without unified definitions, benchmark datasets and clear articulations of the challenges and opportunities in the application of causal inference to the textual domain, with its unique properties. In this survey, we consolidate research across academic areas and situate it in the broader NLP landscape. We introduce the statistical challenge of estimating causal effects with text, encompassing settings where text is used as an outcome, treatment, or to address confounding. In addition, we explore potential uses of causal inference to improve the robustness, fairness, and interpretability of NLP models. We thus provide a unified overview of causal inference for the NLP community."
Discourse Analysis of Covid-19 in Persian Twitter Social Networks Using Graph Mining and Natural Language Processing,"One of the new scientific ways of understanding discourse dynamics is analyzing the public data of social networks. This research's aim is Post-structuralist Discourse Analysis (PDA) of Covid-19 phenomenon (inspired by Laclau and Mouffe's Discourse Theory) by using Intelligent Data Mining for Persian Society. The examined big data is five million tweets from 160,000 users of the Persian Twitter network to compare two discourses. Besides analyzing the tweet texts individually, a social network graph database has been created based on retweets relationships. We use the VoteRank algorithm to introduce and rank people whose posts become word of mouth, provided that the total information spreading scope is maximized over the network. These users are also clustered according to their word usage pattern (the Gaussian Mixture Model is used). The constructed discourse of influential spreaders is compared to the most active users. This analysis is done based on Covid-related posts over eight episodes. Also, by relying on the statistical content analysis and polarity of tweet words, discourse analysis is done for the whole mentioned subpopulations, especially for the top individuals. The most important result of this research is that the Twitter subjects' discourse construction is government-based rather than community-based. The analyzed Iranian society does not consider itself responsible for the Covid-19 wicked problem, does not believe in participation, and expects the government to solve all problems. The most active and most influential users' similarity is that political, national, and critical discourse construction is the predominant one. In addition to the advantages of its research methodology, it is necessary to pay attention to the study's limitations. Suggestion for future encounters of Iranian society with similar crises is given."
Artificial Intelligence Algorithms for Natural Language Processing and the Semantic Web Ontology Learning,"Evolutionary clustering algorithms have considered as the most popular and widely used evolutionary algorithms for minimising optimisation and practical problems in nearly all fields. In this thesis, a new evolutionary clustering algorithm star (ECA*) is proposed. Additionally, a number of experiments were conducted to evaluate ECA* against five state-of-the-art approaches. For this, 32 heterogeneous and multi-featured datasets were used to examine their performance using internal and external clustering measures, and to measure the sensitivity of their performance towards dataset features in the form of operational framework. The results indicate that ECA* overcomes its competitive techniques in terms of the ability to find the right clusters. Based on its superior performance, exploiting and adapting ECA* on the ontology learning had a vital possibility. In the process of deriving concept hierarchies from corpora, generating formal context may lead to a time-consuming process. Therefore, formal context size reduction results in removing uninterested and erroneous pairs, taking less time to extract the concept lattice and concept hierarchies accordingly. In this premise, this work aims to propose a framework to reduce the ambiguity of the formal context of the existing framework using an adaptive version of ECA*. In turn, an experiment was conducted by applying 385 sample corpora from Wikipedia on the two frameworks to examine the reduction of formal context size, which leads to yield concept lattice and concept hierarchy. The resulting lattice of formal context was evaluated to the original one using concept lattice-invariants. Accordingly, the homomorphic between the two lattices preserves the quality of resulting concept hierarchies by 89% in contrast to the basic ones, and the reduced concept lattice inherits the structural relation of the original one."
Deep Natural Language Processing for LinkedIn Search,"Many search systems work with large amounts of natural language data, e.g., search queries, user profiles, and documents. Building a successful search system requires a thorough understanding of textual data semantics, where deep learning based natural language processing techniques (deep NLP) can be of great help. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive study for applying deep NLP techniques to five representative tasks in search systems: query intent prediction (classification), query tagging (sequential tagging), document ranking (ranking), query auto completion (language modeling), and query suggestion (sequence to sequence). We also introduce BERT pre-training as a sixth task that can be applied to many of the other tasks. Through the model design and experiments of the six tasks, readers can find answers to four important questions: (1). When is deep NLP helpful/not helpful in search systems? (2). How to address latency challenges? (3). How to ensure model robustness? This work builds on existing efforts of LinkedIn search, and is tested at scale on LinkedIn's commercial search engines. We believe our experiences can provide useful insights for the industry and research communities."
"Natural Language Processing Accurately Categorizes Indications, Findings and Pathology Reports from Multicenter Colonoscopy","Colonoscopy is used for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. Extracting details of the colonoscopy findings from free text in electronic health records (EHRs) can be used to determine patient risk for CRC and colorectal screening strategies. We developed and evaluated the accuracy of a deep learning model framework to extract information for the clinical decision support system to interpret relevant free-text reports, including indications, pathology, and findings notes. The Bio-Bi-LSTM-CRF framework was developed using Bidirectional Long Short-term Memory (Bi-LSTM) and Conditional Random Fields (CRF) to extract several clinical features from these free-text reports including indications for the colonoscopy, findings during the colonoscopy, and pathology of resected material. We trained the Bio-Bi-LSTM-CRF and existing Bi-LSTM-CRF models on 80% of 4,000 manually annotated notes from 3,867 patients. These clinical notes were from a group of patients over 40 years of age enrolled in four Veterans Affairs Medical Centers. A total of 10% of the remaining annotated notes were used to train hyperparameter and the remaining 10% were used to evaluate the accuracy of our model Bio-Bi-LSTM-CRF and compare to Bi-LSTM-CRF."
Ensuring the Inclusive Use of Natural Language Processing in the Global Response to COVID-19,"Natural language processing (NLP) plays a significant role in tools for the COVID-19 pandemic response, from detecting misinformation on social media to helping to provide accurate clinical information or summarizing scientific research. However, the approaches developed thus far have not benefited all populations, regions or languages equally. We discuss ways in which current and future NLP approaches can be made more inclusive by covering low-resource languages, including alternative modalities, leveraging out-of-the-box tools and forming meaningful partnerships. We suggest several future directions for researchers interested in maximizing the positive societal impacts of NLP."

Reusable Templates and Guides For Documenting Datasets and Models for Natural Language Processing and Generation: A Case Study of the HuggingFace and GEM Data and Model Cards,"Developing documentation guidelines and easy-to-use templates for datasets and models is a challenging task, especially given the variety of backgrounds, skills, and incentives of the people involved in the building of natural language processing (NLP) tools. Nevertheless, the adoption of standard documentation practices across the field of NLP promotes more accessible and detailed descriptions of NLP datasets and models, while supporting researchers and developers in reflecting on their work. To help with the standardization of documentation, we present two case studies of efforts that aim to develop reusable documentation templates -- the HuggingFace data card, a general purpose card for datasets in NLP, and the GEM benchmark data and model cards with a focus on natural language generation. We describe our process for developing these templates, including the identification of relevant stakeholder groups, the definition of a set of guiding principles, the use of existing templates as our foundation, and iterative revisions based on feedback."
AMMUS : A Survey of Transformer-based Pretrained Models in Natural Language Processing,"Transformer-based pretrained language models (T-PTLMs) have achieved great success in almost every NLP task. The evolution of these models started with GPT and BERT. These models are built on the top of transformers, self-supervised learning and transfer learning. Transformed-based PTLMs learn universal language representations from large volumes of text data using self-supervised learning and transfer this knowledge to downstream tasks. These models provide good background knowledge to downstream tasks which avoids training of downstream models from scratch. In this comprehensive survey paper, we initially give a brief overview of self-supervised learning. Next, we explain various core concepts like pretraining, pretraining methods, pretraining tasks, embeddings and downstream adaptation methods. Next, we present a new taxonomy of T-PTLMs and then give brief overview of various benchmarks including both intrinsic and extrinsic. We present a summary of various useful libraries to work with T-PTLMs. Finally, we highlight some of the future research directions which will further improve these models. We strongly believe that this comprehensive survey paper will serve as a good reference to learn the core concepts as well as to stay updated with the recent happenings in T-PTLMs."
Perturbing Inputs for Fragile Interpretations in Deep Natural Language Processing,"Interpretability methods like Integrated Gradient and LIME are popular choices for explaining natural language model predictions with relative word importance scores. These interpretations need to be robust for trustworthy NLP applications in high-stake areas like medicine or finance. Our paper demonstrates how interpretations can be manipulated by making simple word perturbations on an input text. Via a small portion of word-level swaps, these adversarial perturbations aim to make the resulting text semantically and spatially similar to its seed input (therefore sharing similar interpretations). Simultaneously, the generated examples achieve the same prediction label as the seed yet are given a substantially different explanation by the interpretation methods. Our experiments generate fragile interpretations to attack two SOTA interpretation methods, across three popular Transformer models and on two different NLP datasets. We observe that the rank order correlation drops by over 20% when less than 10% of words are perturbed on average. Further, rank-order correlation keeps decreasing as more words get perturbed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that candidates generated from our method have good quality metrics."
A Study of Social and Behavioral Determinants of Health in Lung Cancer Patients Using Transformers-based Natural Language Processing Models,"Social and behavioral determinants of health (SBDoH) have important roles in shaping people's health. In clinical research studies, especially comparative effectiveness studies, failure to adjust for SBDoH factors will potentially cause confounding issues and misclassification errors in either statistical analyses and machine learning-based models. However, there are limited studies to examine SBDoH factors in clinical outcomes due to the lack of structured SBDoH information in current electronic health record (EHR) systems, while much of the SBDoH information is documented in clinical narratives. Natural language processing (NLP) is thus the key technology to extract such information from unstructured clinical text. However, there is not a mature clinical NLP system focusing on SBDoH. In this study, we examined two state-of-the-art transformer-based NLP models, including BERT and RoBERTa, to extract SBDoH concepts from clinical narratives, applied the best performing model to extract SBDoH concepts on a lung cancer screening patient cohort, and examined the difference of SBDoH information between NLP extracted results and structured EHRs (SBDoH information captured in standard vocabularies such as the International Classification of Diseases codes). The experimental results show that the BERT-based NLP model achieved the best strict/lenient F1-score of 0.8791 and 0.8999, respectively. The comparison between NLP extracted SBDoH information and structured EHRs in the lung cancer patient cohort of 864 patients with 161,933 various types of clinical notes showed that much more detailed information about smoking, education, and employment were only captured in clinical narratives and that it is necessary to use both clinical narratives and structured EHRs to construct a more complete picture of patients' SBDoH factors."
Differences in Chinese and Western tourists faced with Japanese hospitality: A natural language processing approach,"Since culture influences expectations, perceptions, and satisfaction, a cross-culture study is necessary to understand the differences between Japan's biggest tourist populations, Chinese and Western tourists. However, with ever-increasing customer populations, this is hard to accomplish without extensive customer base studies. There is a need for an automated method for identifying these expectations at a large scale. For this, we used a data-driven approach to our analysis. Our study analyzed their satisfaction factors comparing soft attributes, such as service, with hard attributes, such as location and facilities, and studied different price ranges. We collected hotel reviews and extracted keywords to classify the sentiment of sentences with an SVC. We then used dependency parsing and part-of-speech tagging to extract nouns tied to positive adjectives. We found that Chinese tourists consider room quality more than hospitality, whereas Westerners are delighted more by staff behavior. Furthermore, the lack of a Chinese-friendly environment for Chinese customers and cigarette smell for Western ones can be disappointing factors of their stay. As one of the first studies in the tourism field to use the high-standard Japanese hospitality environment for this analysis, our cross-cultural study contributes to both the theoretical understanding of satisfaction and suggests practical applications and strategies for hotel managers."
"Pre-train, Prompt, and Predict: A Systematic Survey of Prompting Methods in Natural Language Processing","This paper surveys and organizes research works in a new paradigm in natural language processing, which we dub ""prompt-based learning"". Unlike traditional supervised learning, which trains a model to take in an input x and predict an output y as P(y|x), prompt-based learning is based on language models that model the probability of text directly. To use these models to perform prediction tasks, the original input x is modified using a template into a textual string prompt x' that has some unfilled slots, and then the language model is used to probabilistically fill the unfilled information to obtain a final string x, from which the final output y can be derived. This framework is powerful and attractive for a number of reasons: it allows the language model to be pre-trained on massive amounts of raw text, and by defining a new prompting function the model is able to perform few-shot or even zero-shot learning, adapting to new scenarios with few or no labeled data. In this paper we introduce the basics of this promising paradigm, describe a unified set of mathematical notations that can cover a wide variety of existing work, and organize existing work along several dimensions, e.g.the choice of pre-trained models, prompts, and tuning strategies. To make the field more accessible to interested beginners, we not only make a systematic review of existing works and a highly structured typology of prompt-based concepts, but also release other resources, e.g., a website http://pretrain.nlpedia.ai/ including constantly-updated survey, and paperlist."
Federated Learning Meets Natural Language Processing: A Survey,"Federated Learning aims to learn machine learning models from multiple decentralized edge devices (e.g. mobiles) or servers without sacrificing local data privacy. Recent Natural Language Processing techniques rely on deep learning and large pre-trained language models. However, both big deep neural and language models are trained with huge amounts of data which often lies on the server side. Since text data is widely originated from end users, in this work, we look into recent NLP models and techniques which use federated learning as the learning framework. Our survey discusses major challenges in federated natural language processing, including the algorithm challenges, system challenges as well as the privacy issues. We also provide a critical review of the existing Federated NLP evaluation methods and tools. Finally, we highlight the current research gaps and future directions."
mmPose-NLP: A Natural Language Processing Approach to Precise Skeletal Pose Estimation using mmWave Radars,"In this paper we presented mmPose-NLP, a novel Natural Language Processing (NLP) inspired Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) skeletal key-point estimator using millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar data. To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first method to precisely estimate upto 25 skeletal key-points using mmWave radar data alone. Skeletal pose estimation is critical in several applications ranging from autonomous vehicles, traffic monitoring, patient monitoring, gait analysis, to defense security forensics, and aid both preventative and actionable decision making. The use of mmWave radars for this task, over traditionally employed optical sensors, provide several advantages, primarily its operational robustness to scene lighting and adverse weather conditions, where optical sensor performance degrade significantly. The mmWave radar point-cloud (PCL) data is first voxelized (analogous to tokenization in NLP) and N frames of the voxelized radar data (analogous to a text paragraph in NLP) is subjected to the proposed mmPose-NLP architecture, where the voxel indices of the 25 skeletal key-points (analogous to keyword extraction in NLP) are predicted. The voxel indices are converted back to real world 3-D coordinates using the voxel dictionary used during the tokenization process. Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metrics were used to measure the accuracy of the proposed system against the ground truth, with the proposed mmPose-NLP offering <3 cm localization errors in the depth, horizontal and vertical axes. The effect of the number of input frames vs performance/accuracy was also studied for N = {1,2,..,10}. A comprehensive methodology, results, discussions and limitations are presented in this paper. All the source codes and results are made available on GitHub for furthering research and development in this critical yet emerging domain of skeletal key-point estimation using mmWave radars."
An artificial intelligence natural language processing pipeline for information extraction in neuroradiology,"The use of electronic health records in medical research is difficult because of the unstructured format. Extracting information within reports and summarising patient presentations in a way amenable to downstream analysis would be enormously beneficial for operational and clinical research. In this work we present a natural language processing pipeline for information extraction of radiological reports in neurology. Our pipeline uses a hybrid sequence of rule-based and artificial intelligence models to accurately extract and summarise neurological reports. We train and evaluate a custom language model on a corpus of 150000 radiological reports from National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, London MRI imaging. We also present results for standard NLP tasks on domain-specific neuroradiology datasets. We show our pipeline, called `neuroNLP', can reliably extract clinically relevant information from these reports, enabling downstream modelling of reports and associated imaging on a heretofore unprecedented scale."
Analysing Cyberbullying using Natural Language Processing by Understanding Jargon in Social Media,"Cyberbullying is of extreme prevalence today. Online-hate comments, toxicity, cyberbullying amongst children and other vulnerable groups are only growing over online classes, and increased access to social platforms, especially post COVID-19. It is paramount to detect and ensure minors' safety across social platforms so that any violence or hate-crime is automatically detected and strict action is taken against it. In our work, we explore binary classification by using a combination of datasets from various social media platforms that cover a wide range of cyberbullying such as sexism, racism, abusive, and hate-speech. We experiment through multiple models such as Bi-LSTM, GloVe, state-of-the-art models like BERT, and apply a unique preprocessing technique by introducing a slang-abusive corpus, achieving a higher precision in comparison to models without slang preprocessing."
Benchmarking for Biomedical Natural Language Processing Tasks with a Domain Specific ALBERT,"The availability of biomedical text data and advances in natural language processing (NLP) have made new applications in biomedical NLP possible. Language models trained or fine tuned using domain specific corpora can outperform general models, but work to date in biomedical NLP has been limited in terms of corpora and tasks. We present BioALBERT, a domain-specific adaptation of A Lite Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (ALBERT), trained on biomedical (PubMed and PubMed Central) and clinical (MIMIC-III) corpora and fine tuned for 6 different tasks across 20 benchmark datasets. Experiments show that BioALBERT outperforms the state of the art on named entity recognition (+11.09% BLURB score improvement), relation extraction (+0.80% BLURB score), sentence similarity (+1.05% BLURB score), document classification (+0.62% F1-score), and question answering (+2.83% BLURB score). It represents a new state of the art in 17 out of 20 benchmark datasets. By making BioALBERT models and data available, our aim is to help the biomedical NLP community avoid computational costs of training and establish a new set of baselines for future efforts across a broad range of biomedical NLP tasks."
A Review of Bangla Natural Language Processing Tasks and the Utility of Transformer Models,"Bangla -- ranked as the 6th most widely spoken language across the world (https://www.ethnologue.com/guides/ethnologue200), with 230 million native speakers -- is still considered as a low-resource language in the natural language processing (NLP) community. With three decades of research, Bangla NLP (BNLP) is still lagging behind mainly due to the scarcity of resources and the challenges that come with it. There is sparse work in different areas of BNLP; however, a thorough survey reporting previous work and recent advances is yet to be done. In this study, we first provide a review of Bangla NLP tasks, resources, and tools available to the research community; we benchmark datasets collected from various platforms for nine NLP tasks using current state-of-the-art algorithms (i.e., transformer-based models). We provide comparative results for the studied NLP tasks by comparing monolingual vs. multilingual models of varying sizes. We report our results using both individual and consolidated datasets and provide data splits for future research. We reviewed a total of 108 papers and conducted 175 sets of experiments. Our results show promising performance using transformer-based models while highlighting the trade-off with computational costs. We hope that such a comprehensive survey will motivate the community to build on and further advance the research on Bangla NLP."
Neural Natural Language Processing for Unstructured Data in Electronic Health Records: a Review,"Electronic health records (EHRs), digital collections of patient healthcare events and observations, are ubiquitous in medicine and critical to healthcare delivery, operations, and research. Despite this central role, EHRs are notoriously difficult to process automatically. Well over half of the information stored within EHRs is in the form of unstructured text (e.g. provider notes, operation reports) and remains largely untapped for secondary use. Recently, however, newer neural network and deep learning approaches to Natural Language Processing (NLP) have made considerable advances, outperforming traditional statistical and rule-based systems on a variety of tasks. In this survey paper, we summarize current neural NLP methods for EHR applications. We focus on a broad scope of tasks, namely, classification and prediction, word embeddings, extraction, generation, and other topics such as question answering, phenotyping, knowledge graphs, medical dialogue, multilinguality, interpretability, etc."
Draw Me a Flower: Processing and Grounding Abstraction in Natural Language,"Abstraction is a core tenet of human cognition and communication. When composing natural language instructions, humans naturally evoke abstraction to convey complex procedures in an efficient and concise way. Yet, interpreting and grounding abstraction expressed in NL has not yet been systematically studied in NLP, with no accepted benchmarks specifically eliciting abstraction in NL. In this work, we set the foundation for a systematic study of processing and grounding abstraction in NLP. First, we deliver a novel abstraction elicitation method and present Hexagons, a 2D instruction-following game. Using Hexagons we collected over 4k naturally-occurring visually-grounded instructions rich with diverse types of abstractions. From these data, we derive an instruction-to-execution task and assess different types of neural models. Our results show that contemporary models and modeling practices are substantially inferior to human performance, and that models' performance is inversely correlated with the level of abstraction, showing less satisfying performance on higher levels of abstraction. These findings are consistent across models and setups, confirming that abstraction is a challenging phenomenon deserving further attention and study in NLP/AI research."
Ad Text Classification with Transformer-Based Natural Language Processing Methods,"In this study, a natural language processing-based (NLP-based) method is proposed for the sector-wise automatic classification of ad texts created on online advertising platforms. Our data set consists of approximately 21,000 labeled advertising texts from 12 different sectors. In the study, the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model, which is a transformer-based language model that is recently used in fields such as text classification in the natural language processing literature, was used. The classification efficiencies obtained using a pre-trained BERT model for the Turkish language are shown in detail."
TweeNLP: A Twitter Exploration Portal for Natural Language Processing,"We present TweeNLP, a one-stop portal that organizes Twitter's natural language processing (NLP) data and builds a visualization and exploration platform. It curates 19,395 tweets (as of April 2021) from various NLP conferences and general NLP discussions. It supports multiple features such as TweetExplorer to explore tweets by topics, visualize insights from Twitter activity throughout the organization cycle of conferences, discover popular research papers and researchers. It also builds a timeline of conference and workshop submission deadlines. We envision TweeNLP to function as a collective memory unit for the NLP community by integrating the tweets pertaining to research papers with the NLPExplorer scientific literature search engine. The current system is hosted at http://nlpexplorer.org/twitter/CFP ."
Model Explainability in Deep Learning Based Natural Language Processing,"Machine learning (ML) model explainability has received growing attention, especially in the area related to model risk and regulations. In this paper, we reviewed and compared some popular ML model explainability methodologies, especially those related to Natural Language Processing (NLP) models. We then applied one of the NLP explainability methods Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to a NLP classification model. We used the LRP method to derive a relevance score for each word in an instance, which is a local explainability. The relevance scores are then aggregated together to achieve global variable importance of the model. Through the case study, we also demonstrated how to apply the local explainability method to false positive and false negative instances to discover the weakness of a NLP model. These analysis can help us to understand NLP models better and reduce the risk due to the black-box nature of NLP models. We also identified some common issues due to the special natures of NLP models and discussed how explainability analysis can act as a control to detect these issues after the model has been trained."
Explaining the Deep Natural Language Processing by Mining Textual Interpretable Features,"Despite the high accuracy offered by state-of-the-art deep natural-language models (e.g. LSTM, BERT), their application in real-life settings is still widely limited, as they behave like a black-box to the end-user. Hence, explainability is rapidly becoming a fundamental requirement of future-generation data-driven systems based on deep-learning approaches. Several attempts to fulfill the existing gap between accuracy and interpretability have been done. However, robust and specialized xAI (Explainable Artificial Intelligence) solutions tailored to deep natural-language models are still missing. We propose a new framework, named T-EBAnO, which provides innovative prediction-local and class-based model-global explanation strategies tailored to black-box deep natural-language models. Given a deep NLP model and the textual input data, T-EBAnO provides an objective, human-readable, domain-specific assessment of the reasons behind the automatic decision-making process. Specifically, the framework extracts sets of interpretable features mining the inner knowledge of the model. Then, it quantifies the influence of each feature during the prediction process by exploiting the novel normalized Perturbation Influence Relation index at the local level and the novel Global Absolute Influence and Global Relative Influence indexes at the global level. The effectiveness and the quality of the local and global explanations obtained with T-EBAnO are proved on (i) a sentiment analysis task performed by a fine-tuned BERT model, and (ii) a toxic comment classification task performed by an LSTM model."
Graph Neural Networks for Natural Language Processing: A Survey,"Deep learning has become the dominant approach in coping with various tasks in Natural LanguageProcessing (NLP). Although text inputs are typically represented as a sequence of tokens, there isa rich variety of NLP problems that can be best expressed with a graph structure. As a result, thereis a surge of interests in developing new deep learning techniques on graphs for a large numberof NLP tasks. In this survey, we present a comprehensive overview onGraph Neural Networks(GNNs) for Natural Language Processing. We propose a new taxonomy of GNNs for NLP, whichsystematically organizes existing research of GNNs for NLP along three axes: graph construction,graph representation learning, and graph based encoder-decoder models. We further introducea large number of NLP applications that are exploiting the power of GNNs and summarize thecorresponding benchmark datasets, evaluation metrics, and open-source codes. Finally, we discussvarious outstanding challenges for making the full use of GNNs for NLP as well as future researchdirections. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive overview of Graph NeuralNetworks for Natural Language Processing."
Case Studies on using Natural Language Processing Techniques in Customer Relationship Management Software,"How can a text corpus stored in a customer relationship management (CRM) database be used for data mining and segmentation? In order to answer this question we inherited the state of the art methods commonly used in natural language processing (NLP) literature, such as word embeddings, and deep learning literature, such as recurrent neural networks (RNN). We used the text notes from a CRM system which are taken by customer representatives of an internet ads consultancy agency between years 2009 and 2020. We trained word embeddings by using the corresponding text corpus and showed that these word embeddings can not only be used directly for data mining but also be used in RNN architectures, which are deep learning frameworks built with long short term memory (LSTM) units, for more comprehensive segmentation objectives. The results prove that structured text data in a CRM can be used to mine out very valuable information and any CRM can be equipped with useful NLP features once the problem definitions are properly built and the solution methods are conveniently implemented."
Auto-tagging of Short Conversational Sentences using Natural Language Processing Methods,"In this study, we aim to find a method to auto-tag sentences specific to a domain. Our training data comprises short conversational sentences extracted from chat conversations between company's customer representatives and web site visitors. We manually tagged approximately 14 thousand visitor inputs into ten basic categories, which will later be used in a transformer-based language model with attention mechanisms for the ultimate goal of developing a chatbot application that can produce meaningful dialogue. We considered three different state-of-the-art models and reported their auto-tagging capabilities. We achieved the best performance with the bidirectional encoder representation from transformers (BERT) model. Implementation of the models used in these experiments can be cloned from our GitHub repository and tested for similar auto-tagging problems without much effort."
Recurrent Neural Networks with Mixed Hierarchical Structures for Natural Language Processing,"Hierarchical structures exist in both linguistics and Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. How to design RNNs to learn hierarchical representations of natural languages remains a long-standing challenge. In this paper, we define two different types of boundaries referred to as static and dynamic boundaries, respectively, and then use them to construct a multi-layer hierarchical structure for document classification tasks. In particular, we focus on a three-layer hierarchical structure with static word- and sentence- layers and a dynamic phrase-layer. LSTM cells and two boundary detectors are used to implement the proposed structure, and the resulting network is called the {\em Recurrent Neural Network with Mixed Hierarchical Structures} (MHS-RNN). We further add three layers of attention mechanisms to the MHS-RNN model. Incorporating attention mechanisms allows our model to use more important content to construct document representation and enhance its performance on document classification tasks. Experiments on five different datasets show that the proposed architecture outperforms previous methods on all the five tasks."
A systematic review of Hate Speech automatic detection using Natural Language Processing,"With the multiplication of social media platforms, which offer anonymity, easy access and online community formation, and online debate, the issue of hate speech detection and tracking becomes a growing challenge to society, individual, policy-makers and researchers. Despite efforts for leveraging automatic techniques for automatic detection and monitoring, their performances are still far from satisfactory, which constantly calls for future research on the issue. This paper provides a systematic review of literature in this field, with a focus on natural language processing and deep learning technologies, highlighting the terminology, processing pipeline, core methods employed, with a focal point on deep learning architecture. From a methodological perspective, we adopt PRISMA guideline of systematic review of the last 10 years literature from ACM Digital Library and Google Scholar. In the sequel, existing surveys, limitations, and future research directions are extensively discussed."
"Bangla Natural Language Processing: A Comprehensive Analysis of Classical, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning Based Methods","The Bangla language is the seventh most spoken language, with 265 million native and non-native speakers worldwide. However, English is the predominant language for online resources and technical knowledge, journals, and documentation. Consequently, many Bangla-speaking people, who have limited command of English, face hurdles to utilize English resources. To bridge the gap between limited support and increasing demand, researchers conducted many experiments and developed valuable tools and techniques to create and process Bangla language materials. Many efforts are also ongoing to make it easy to use the Bangla language in the online and technical domains. There are some review papers to understand the past, previous, and future Bangla Natural Language Processing (BNLP) trends. The studies are mainly concentrated on the specific domains of BNLP, such as sentiment analysis, speech recognition, optical character recognition, and text summarization. There is an apparent scarcity of resources that contain a comprehensive review of the recent BNLP tools and methods. Therefore, in this paper, we present a thorough analysis of 75 BNLP research papers and categorize them into 11 categories, namely Information Extraction, Machine Translation, Named Entity Recognition, Parsing, Parts of Speech Tagging, Question Answering System, Sentiment Analysis, Spam and Fake Detection, Text Summarization, Word Sense Disambiguation, and Speech Processing and Recognition. We study articles published between 1999 to 2021, and 50% of the papers were published after 2015. Furthermore, we discuss Classical, Machine Learning and Deep Learning approaches with different datasets while addressing the limitations and current and future trends of the BNLP."
Greedy-layer Pruning: Speeding up Transformer Models for Natural Language Processing,"Fine-tuning transformer models after unsupervised pre-training reaches a very high performance on many different natural language processing tasks. Unfortunately, transformers suffer from long inference times which greatly increases costs in production. One possible solution is to use knowledge distillation, which solves this problem by transferring information from large teacher models to smaller student models. Knowledge distillation maintains high performance and reaches high compression rates, nevertheless, the size of the student model is fixed after pre-training and can not be changed individually for a given downstream task and use-case to reach a desired performance/speedup ratio. Another solution to reduce the size of models in a much more fine-grained and computationally cheaper fashion is to prune layers after the pre-training. The price to pay is that the performance of layer-wise pruning algorithms is not on par with state-of-the-art knowledge distillation methods. In this paper, Greedy-layer pruning is introduced to (1) outperform current state-of-the-art for layer-wise pruning, (2) close the performance gap when compared to knowledge distillation, while (3) providing a method to adapt the model size dynamically to reach a desired performance/speedup tradeoff without the need of additional pre-training phases. Our source code is available on https://github.com/deepopinion/greedy-layer-pruning."
Natural Language Processing 4 All (NLP4All): A New Online Platform for Teaching and Learning NLP Concepts,"Natural Language Processing offers new insights into language data across almost all disciplines and domains, and allows us to corroborate and/or challenge existing knowledge. The primary hurdles to widening participation in and use of these new research tools are, first, a lack of coding skills in students across K-16, and in the population at large, and second, a lack of knowledge of how NLP-methods can be used to answer questions of disciplinary interest outside of linguistics and/or computer science. To broaden participation in NLP and improve NLP-literacy, we introduced a new tool web-based tool called Natural Language Processing 4 All (NLP4All). The intended purpose of NLP4All is to help teachers facilitate learning with and about NLP, by providing easy-to-use interfaces to NLP-methods, data, and analyses, making it possible for non- and novice-programmers to learn NLP concepts interactively."
Context-Sensitive Visualization of Deep Learning Natural Language Processing Models,"The introduction of Transformer neural networks has changed the landscape of Natural Language Processing (NLP) during the last years. So far, none of the visualization systems has yet managed to examine all the facets of the Transformers. This gave us the motivation of the current work. We propose a new NLP Transformer context-sensitive visualization method that leverages existing NLP tools to find the most significant groups of tokens (words) that have the greatest effect on the output, thus preserving some context from the original text. First, we use a sentence-level dependency parser to highlight promising word groups. The dependency parser creates a tree of relationships between the words in the sentence. Next, we systematically remove adjacent and non-adjacent tuples of \emph{n} tokens from the input text, producing several new texts with those tokens missing. The resulting texts are then passed to a pre-trained BERT model. The classification output is compared with that of the full text, and the difference in the activation strength is recorded. The modified texts that produce the largest difference in the target classification output neuron are selected, and the combination of removed words are then considered to be the most influential on the model's output. Finally, the most influential word combinations are visualized in a heatmap."
Extending the Abstraction of Personality Types based on MBTI with Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing,"A data-centric approach with Natural Language Processing (NLP) to predict personality types based on the MBTI (an introspective self-assessment questionnaire that indicates different psychological preferences about how people perceive the world and make decisions) through systematic enrichment of text representation, based on the domain of the area, under the generation of features based on three types of analysis: sentimental, grammatical and aspects. The experimentation had a robust baseline of stacked models, with premature optimization of hyperparameters through grid search, with gradual feedback, for each of the four classifiers (dichotomies) of MBTI. The results showed that attention to the data iteration loop focused on quality, explanatory power and representativeness for the abstraction of more relevant/important resources for the studied phenomenon made it possible to improve the evaluation metrics results more quickly and less costly than complex models such as the LSTM or state of the art ones as BERT, as well as the importance of these results by comparisons made from various perspectives. In addition, the study demonstrated a broad spectrum for the evolution and deepening of the task and possible approaches for a greater extension of the abstraction of personality types."
Doing Natural Language Processing in A Natural Way: An NLP toolkit based on object-oriented knowledge base and multi-level grammar base,"We introduce an NLP toolkit based on object-oriented knowledge base and multi-level grammar base. This toolkit focuses on semantic parsing, it also has abilities to discover new knowledge and grammar automatically, new discovered knowledge and grammar will be identified by human, and will be used to update the knowledge base and grammar base. This process can be iterated many times to improve the toolkit continuously."
Including Signed Languages in Natural Language Processing,"Signed languages are the primary means of communication for many deaf and hard of hearing individuals. Since signed languages exhibit all the fundamental linguistic properties of natural language, we believe that tools and theories of Natural Language Processing (NLP) are crucial towards its modeling. However, existing research in Sign Language Processing (SLP) seldom attempt to explore and leverage the linguistic organization of signed languages. This position paper calls on the NLP community to include signed languages as a research area with high social and scientific impact. We first discuss the linguistic properties of signed languages to consider during their modeling. Then, we review the limitations of current SLP models and identify the open challenges to extend NLP to signed languages. Finally, we urge (1) the adoption of an efficient tokenization method; (2) the development of linguistically-informed models; (3) the collection of real-world signed language data; (4) the inclusion of local signed language communities as an active and leading voice in the direction of research."
On the Ethical Limits of Natural Language Processing on Legal Text,"Natural language processing (NLP) methods for analyzing legal text offer legal scholars and practitioners a range of tools allowing to empirically analyze law on a large scale. However, researchers seem to struggle when it comes to identifying ethical limits to using NLP systems for acquiring genuine insights both about the law and the systems' predictive capacity. In this paper we set out a number of ways in which to think systematically about such issues. We place emphasis on three crucial normative parameters which have, to the best of our knowledge, been underestimated by current debates: (a) the importance of academic freedom, (b) the existence of a wide diversity of legal and ethical norms domestically but even more so internationally and (c) the threat of moralism in research related to computational law. For each of these three parameters we provide specific recommendations for the legal NLP community. Our discussion is structured around the study of a real-life scenario that has prompted recent debate in the legal NLP research community."
Reliability Testing for Natural Language Processing Systems,"Questions of fairness, robustness, and transparency are paramount to address before deploying NLP systems. Central to these concerns is the question of reliability: Can NLP systems reliably treat different demographics fairly and function correctly in diverse and noisy environments? To address this, we argue for the need for reliability testing and contextualize it among existing work on improving accountability. We show how adversarial attacks can be reframed for this goal, via a framework for developing reliability tests. We argue that reliability testing -- with an emphasis on interdisciplinary collaboration -- will enable rigorous and targeted testing, and aid in the enactment and enforcement of industry standards."
Security Vulnerability Detection Using Deep Learning Natural Language Processing,"Detecting security vulnerabilities in software before they are exploited has been a challenging problem for decades. Traditional code analysis methods have been proposed, but are often ineffective and inefficient. In this work, we model software vulnerability detection as a natural language processing (NLP) problem with source code treated as texts, and address the automated software venerability detection with recent advanced deep learning NLP models assisted by transfer learning on written English. For training and testing, we have preprocessed the NIST NVD/SARD databases and built a dataset of over 100,000 files in C programming language with 123 types of vulnerabilities. The extensive experiments generate the best performance of over 93\% accuracy in detecting security vulnerabilities."
Teaching a Massive Open Online Course on Natural Language Processing,"This paper presents a new Massive Open Online Course on Natural Language Processing, targeted at non-English speaking students. The course lasts 12 weeks; every week consists of lectures, practical sessions, and quiz assignments. Three weeks out of 12 are followed by Kaggle-style coding assignments.  Our course intends to serve multiple purposes: (i) familiarize students with the core concepts and methods in NLP, such as language modeling or word or sentence representations, (ii) show that recent advances, including pre-trained Transformer-based models, are built upon these concepts; (iii) introduce architectures for most demanded real-life applications, (iv) develop practical skills to process texts in multiple languages. The course was prepared and recorded during 2020, launched by the end of the year, and in early 2021 has received positive feedback."
Identifying botnet IP address clusters using natural language processing techniques on honeypot command logs,"Computer security has been plagued by increasing formidable, dynamic, hard-to-detect, hard-to-predict, and hard-to-characterize hacking techniques. Such techniques are very often deployed in self-propagating worms capable of automatically infecting vulnerable computer systems and then building large bot networks, which are then used to launch coordinated attacks on designated targets. In this work, we investigate novel applications of Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to detect and correlate botnet behaviors through the analysis of honeypot data. In our approach we take observed behaviors in shell commands issued by intruders during captured internet sessions and reduce them to collections of stochastic processes that are, in turn, processed with machine learning techniques to build classifiers and predictors. Our technique results in a new ability to cluster botnet source IP address even in the face of their desire to obfuscate their penetration attempts through rapid or random permutation techniques."
Machine Learning Meets Natural Language Processing -- The story so far,"Natural Language Processing (NLP) has evolved significantly over the last decade. This paper highlights the most important milestones of this period while trying to pinpoint the contribution of each individual model and algorithm to the overall progress. Furthermore, it focuses on issues still remaining to be solved, emphasizing the groundbreaking proposals of Transformers, BERT, and all the similar attention-based models."
Problems and Countermeasures in Natural Language Processing Evaluation,"Evaluation in natural language processing guides and promotes research on models and methods. In recent years, new evalua-tion data sets and evaluation tasks have been continuously proposed. At the same time, a series of problems exposed by ex-isting evaluation have also restricted the progress of natural language processing technology. Starting from the concept, com-position, development and meaning of natural language evaluation, this article classifies and summarizes the tasks and char-acteristics of mainstream natural language evaluation, and then summarizes the problems and causes of natural language pro-cessing evaluation. Finally, this article refers to the human language ability evaluation standard, puts forward the concept of human-like machine language ability evaluation, and proposes a series of basic principles and implementation ideas for hu-man-like machine language ability evaluation from the three aspects of reliability, difficulty and validity."
FedNLP: Benchmarking Federated Learning Methods for Natural Language Processing Tasks,"Increasing concerns and regulations about data privacy and sparsity necessitate the study of privacy-preserving, decentralized learning methods for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Federated learning (FL) provides promising approaches for a large number of clients (e.g., personal devices or organizations) to collaboratively learn a shared global model to benefit all clients while allowing users to keep their data locally. Despite interest in studying FL methods for NLP tasks, a systematic comparison and analysis is lacking in the literature. Herein, we present the FedNLP, a benchmarking framework for evaluating federated learning methods on four different task formulations: text classification, sequence tagging, question answering, and seq2seq. We propose a universal interface between Transformer-based language models (e.g., BERT, BART) and FL methods (e.g., FedAvg, FedOPT, etc.) under various non-IID partitioning strategies. Our extensive experiments with FedNLP provide empirical comparisons between FL methods and helps us better understand the inherent challenges of this direction. The comprehensive analysis points to intriguing and exciting future research aimed at developing FL methods for NLP tasks."
Crossing the Conversational Chasm: A Primer on Natural Language Processing for Multilingual Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems,"In task-oriented dialogue (ToD), a user holds a conversation with an artificial agent to complete a concrete task. Although this technology represents one of the central objectives of AI and has been the focus of ever more intense research and development efforts, it is currently limited to a few narrow domains (e.g., food ordering, ticket booking) and a handful of languages (e.g., English, Chinese). This work provides an extensive overview of existing methods and resources in multilingual ToD as an entry point to this exciting and emerging field. We find that the most critical factor preventing the creation of truly multilingual ToD systems is the lack of datasets in most languages for both training and evaluation. In fact, acquiring annotations or human feedback for each component of modular systems or for data-hungry end-to-end systems is expensive and tedious. Hence, state-of-the-art approaches to multilingual ToD mostly rely on (zero- or few-shot) cross-lingual transfer from resource-rich languages (almost exclusively English), either by means of machine translation or multilingual representations. These approaches are currently viable only for typologically similar languages and languages with parallel / monolingual corpora available. On the other hand, their effectiveness beyond these boundaries is doubtful or hard to assess due to the lack of linguistically diverse benchmarks (especially for natural language generation and end-to-end evaluation). To overcome this limitation, we draw parallels between components of the ToD pipeline and other NLP tasks, which can inspire solutions for learning in low-resource scenarios. Finally, we list additional challenges that multilinguality poses for related areas (such as speech and human-centred evaluation), and indicate future directions that hold promise to further expand language coverage and dialogue capabilities of current ToD systems."
Translational NLP: A New Paradigm and General Principles for Natural Language Processing Research,"Natural language processing (NLP) research combines the study of universal principles, through basic science, with applied science targeting specific use cases and settings. However, the process of exchange between basic NLP and applications is often assumed to emerge naturally, resulting in many innovations going unapplied and many important questions left unstudied. We describe a new paradigm of Translational NLP, which aims to structure and facilitate the processes by which basic and applied NLP research inform one another. Translational NLP thus presents a third research paradigm, focused on understanding the challenges posed by application needs and how these challenges can drive innovation in basic science and technology design. We show that many significant advances in NLP research have emerged from the intersection of basic principles with application needs, and present a conceptual framework outlining the stakeholders and key questions in translational research. Our framework provides a roadmap for developing Translational NLP as a dedicated research area, and identifies general translational principles to facilitate exchange between basic and applied research."
NPE: An FPGA-based Overlay Processor for Natural Language Processing,"In recent years, transformer-based models have shown state-of-the-art results for Natural Language Processing (NLP). In particular, the introduction of the BERT language model brought with it breakthroughs in tasks such as question answering and natural language inference, advancing applications that allow humans to interact naturally with embedded devices. FPGA-based overlay processors have been shown as effective solutions for edge image and video processing applications, which mostly rely on low precision linear matrix operations. In contrast, transformer-based NLP techniques employ a variety of higher precision nonlinear operations with significantly higher frequency. We present NPE, an FPGA-based overlay processor that can efficiently execute a variety of NLP models. NPE offers software-like programmability to the end user and, unlike FPGA designs that implement specialized accelerators for each nonlinear function, can be upgraded for future NLP models without requiring reconfiguration. We demonstrate that NPE can meet real-time conversational AI latency targets for the BERT language model with 4\times lower power than CPUs and 6\times lower power than GPUs. We also show NPE uses 3\times fewer FPGA resources relative to comparable BERT network-specific accelerators in the literature. NPE provides a cost-effective and power-efficient FPGA-based solution for Natural Language Processing at the edge."
A survey on extremism analysis using Natural Language Processing,"Extremism research has grown as an open problem for several countries during recent years, especially due to the apparition of movements such as jihadism. This and other extremist groups have taken advantage of different approaches, such as the use of Social Media, to spread their ideology, promote their acts and recruit followers. Natural Language Processing (NLP) represents a way of detecting this type of content, and several authors make use of it to describe and discriminate the discourse held by this groups, with the final objective of detecting and preventing its spread. This survey aims to review the contributions of NLP to the field of extremism research, providing the reader with a comprehensive picture of the state of the art of this research area. The content includes a description and comparison of the frequently used NLP techniques, how they were applied, the insights they provided, the most frequently used NLP software tools and the availability of datasets and data sources for research. Finally, research questions are approached and answered with highlights from the review, while future trends, challenges and directions derived from these highlights are suggested."
Machine Learning Based on Natural Language Processing to Detect Cardiac Failure in Clinical Narratives,"The purpose of the study presented herein is to develop a machine learning algorithm based on natural language processing that automatically detects whether a patient has a cardiac failure or a healthy condition by using physician notes in Research Data Warehouse at CHU Sainte Justine Hospital. First, a word representation learning technique was employed by using bag-of-word (BoW), term frequency inverse document frequency (TFIDF), and neural word embeddings (word2vec). Each representation technique aims to retain the words semantic and syntactic analysis in critical care data. It helps to enrich the mutual information for the word representation and leads to an advantage for further appropriate analysis steps. Second, a machine learning classifier was used to detect the patients condition for either cardiac failure or stable patient through the created word representation vector space from the previous step. This machine learning approach is based on a supervised binary classification algorithm, including logistic regression (LR), Gaussian Naive-Bayes (GaussianNB), and multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN). Technically, it mainly optimizes the empirical loss during training the classifiers. As a result, an automatic learning algorithm would be accomplished to draw a high classification performance, including accuracy (acc), precision (pre), recall (rec), and F1 score (f1). The results show that the combination of TFIDF and MLPNN always outperformed other combinations with all overall performance. In the case without any feature selection, the proposed framework yielded an overall classification performance with acc, pre, rec, and f1 of 84% and 82%, 85%, and 83%, respectively. Significantly, if the feature selection was well applied, the overall performance would finally improve up to 4% for each evaluation."
Automating Transfer Credit Assessment in Student Mobility -- A Natural Language Processing-based Approach,"Student mobility or academic mobility involves students moving between institutions during their post-secondary education, and one of the challenging tasks in this process is to assess the transfer credits to be offered to the incoming student. In general, this process involves domain experts comparing the learning outcomes of the courses, to decide on offering transfer credits to the incoming students. This manual implementation is not only labor-intensive but also influenced by undue bias and administrative complexity. The proposed research article focuses on identifying a model that exploits the advancements in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to effectively automate this process. Given the unique structure, domain specificity, and complexity of learning outcomes (LOs), a need for designing a tailor-made model arises. The proposed model uses a clustering-inspired methodology based on knowledge-based semantic similarity measures to assess the taxonomic similarity of LOs and a transformer-based semantic similarity model to assess the semantic similarity of the LOs. The similarity between LOs is further aggregated to form course to course similarity. Due to the lack of quality benchmark datasets, a new benchmark dataset containing seven course-to-course similarity measures is proposed. Understanding the inherent need for flexibility in the decision-making process the aggregation part of the model offers tunable parameters to accommodate different scenarios. While providing an efficient model to assess the similarity between courses with existing resources, this research work steers future research attempts to apply NLP in the field of articulation in an ideal direction by highlighting the persisting research gaps."
An Automated Multiple-Choice Question Generation Using Natural Language Processing Techniques,"Automatic multiple-choice question generation (MCQG) is a useful yet challenging task in Natural Language Processing (NLP). It is the task of automatic generation of correct and relevant questions from textual data. Despite its usefulness, manually creating sizeable, meaningful and relevant questions is a time-consuming and challenging task for teachers. In this paper, we present an NLP-based system for automatic MCQG for Computer-Based Testing Examination (CBTE).We used NLP technique to extract keywords that are important words in a given lesson material. To validate that the system is not perverse, five lesson materials were used to check the effectiveness and efficiency of the system. The manually extracted keywords by the teacher were compared to the auto-generated keywords and the result shows that the system was capable of extracting keywords from lesson materials in setting examinable questions. This outcome is presented in a user-friendly interface for easy accessibility."
Data Augmentation in Natural Language Processing: A Novel Text Generation Approach for Long and Short Text Classifiers,"In many cases of machine learning, research suggests that the development of training data might have a higher relevance than the choice and modelling of classifiers themselves. Thus, data augmentation methods have been developed to improve classifiers by artificially created training data. In NLP, there is the challenge of establishing universal rules for text transformations which provide new linguistic patterns. In this paper, we present and evaluate a text generation method suitable to increase the performance of classifiers for long and short texts. We achieved promising improvements when evaluating short as well as long text tasks with the enhancement by our text generation method. Especially with regard to small data analytics, additive accuracy gains of up to 15.53% and 3.56% are achieved within a constructed low data regime, compared to the no augmentation baseline and another data augmentation technique. As the current track of these constructed regimes is not universally applicable, we also show major improvements in several real world low data tasks (up to +4.84 F1-score). Since we are evaluating the method from many perspectives (in total 11 datasets), we also observe situations where the method might not be suitable. We discuss implications and patterns for the successful application of our approach on different types of datasets."
Visual Grounding Strategies for Text-Only Natural Language Processing,"Visual grounding is a promising path toward more robust and accurate Natural Language Processing (NLP) models. Many multimodal extensions of BERT (e.g., VideoBERT, LXMERT, VL-BERT) allow a joint modeling of texts and images that lead to state-of-the-art results on multimodal tasks such as Visual Question Answering. Here, we leverage multimodal modeling for purely textual tasks (language modeling and classification) with the expectation that the multimodal pretraining provides a grounding that can improve text processing accuracy. We propose possible strategies in this respect. A first type of strategy, referred to as {\it transferred grounding} consists in applying multimodal models to text-only tasks using a placeholder to replace image input. The second one, which we call {\it associative grounding}, harnesses image retrieval to match texts with related images during both pretraining and text-only downstream tasks. We draw further distinctions into both strategies and then compare them according to their impact on language modeling and commonsense-related downstream tasks, showing improvement over text-only baselines."
BERT: A Review of Applications in Natural Language Processing and Understanding,"In this review, we describe the application of one of the most popular deep learning-based language models - BERT. The paper describes the mechanism of operation of this model, the main areas of its application to the tasks of text analytics, comparisons with similar models in each task, as well as a description of some proprietary models. In preparing this review, the data of several dozen original scientific articles published over the past few years, which attracted the most attention in the scientific community, were systematized. This survey will be useful to all students and researchers who want to get acquainted with the latest advances in the field of natural language text analysis."
Extracting Semantic Process Information from the Natural Language in Event Logs,"Process mining focuses on the analysis of recorded event data in order to gain insights about the true execution of business processes. While foundational process mining techniques treat such data as sequences of abstract events, more advanced techniques depend on the availability of specific kinds of information, such as resources in organizational mining and business objects in artifact-centric analysis. However, this information is generally not readily available, but rather associated with events in an ad hoc manner, often even as part of unstructured textual attributes. Given the size and complexity of event logs, this calls for automated support to extract such process information and, thereby, enable advanced process mining techniques. In this paper, we present an approach that achieves this through so-called semantic role labeling of event data. We combine the analysis of textual attribute values, based on a state-of-the-art language model, with a novel attribute classification technique. In this manner, our approach extracts information about up to eight semantic roles per event. We demonstrate the approach's efficacy through a quantitative evaluation using a broad range of event logs and demonstrate the usefulness of the extracted information in a case study."
TextFlint: Unified Multilingual Robustness Evaluation Toolkit for Natural Language Processing,"Various robustness evaluation methodologies from different perspectives have been proposed for different natural language processing (NLP) tasks. These methods have often focused on either universal or task-specific generalization capabilities. In this work, we propose a multilingual robustness evaluation platform for NLP tasks (TextFlint) that incorporates universal text transformation, task-specific transformation, adversarial attack, subpopulation, and their combinations to provide comprehensive robustness analysis. TextFlint enables practitioners to automatically evaluate their models from all aspects or to customize their evaluations as desired with just a few lines of code. To guarantee user acceptability, all the text transformations are linguistically based, and we provide a human evaluation for each one. TextFlint generates complete analytical reports as well as targeted augmented data to address the shortcomings of the model's robustness. To validate TextFlint's utility, we performed large-scale empirical evaluations (over 67,000 evaluations) on state-of-the-art deep learning models, classic supervised methods, and real-world systems. Almost all models showed significant performance degradation, including a decline of more than 50% of BERT's prediction accuracy on tasks such as aspect-level sentiment classification, named entity recognition, and natural language inference. Therefore, we call for the robustness to be included in the model evaluation, so as to promote the healthy development of NLP technology."
Local Interpretations for Explainable Natural Language Processing: A Survey,"As the use of deep learning techniques has grown across various fields over the past decade, complaints about the opaqueness of the black-box models have increased, resulting in an increased focus on transparency in deep learning models. This work investigates various methods to improve the interpretability of deep neural networks for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation and sentiment analysis. We provide a comprehensive discussion on the definition of the term \textit{interpretability} and its various aspects at the beginning of this work. The methods collected and summarised in this survey are only associated with local interpretation and are divided into three categories: 1) explaining the model's predictions through related input features; 2) explaining through natural language explanation; 3) probing the hidden states of models and word representations."
A Systematic Review of Reproducibility Research in Natural Language Processing,"Against the background of what has been termed a reproducibility crisis in science, the NLP field is becoming increasingly interested in, and conscientious about, the reproducibility of its results. The past few years have seen an impressive range of new initiatives, events and active research in the area. However, the field is far from reaching a consensus about how reproducibility should be defined, measured and addressed, with diversity of views currently increasing rather than converging. With this focused contribution, we aim to provide a wide-angle, and as near as possible complete, snapshot of current work on reproducibility in NLP, delineating differences and similarities, and providing pointers to common denominators."
Putting Humans in the Natural Language Processing Loop: A Survey,"How can we design Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems that learn from human feedback? There is a growing research body of Human-in-the-loop (HITL) NLP frameworks that continuously integrate human feedback to improve the model itself. HITL NLP research is nascent but multifarious -- solving various NLP problems, collecting diverse feedback from different people, and applying different methods to learn from collected feedback. We present a survey of HITL NLP work from both Machine Learning (ML) and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) communities that highlights its short yet inspiring history, and thoroughly summarize recent frameworks focusing on their tasks, goals, human interactions, and feedback learning methods. Finally, we discuss future directions for integrating human feedback in the NLP development loop."
Hardware Acceleration of Fully Quantized BERT for Efficient Natural Language Processing,"BERT is the most recent Transformer-based model that achieves state-of-the-art performance in various NLP tasks. In this paper, we investigate the hardware acceleration of BERT on FPGA for edge computing. To tackle the issue of huge computational complexity and memory footprint, we propose to fully quantize the BERT (FQ-BERT), including weights, activations, softmax, layer normalization, and all the intermediate results. Experiments demonstrate that the FQ-BERT can achieve 7.94x compression for weights with negligible performance loss. We then propose an accelerator tailored for the FQ-BERT and evaluate on Xilinx ZCU102 and ZCU111 FPGA. It can achieve a performance-per-watt of 3.18 fps/W, which is 28.91x and 12.72x over Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8700 CPU and NVIDIA K80 GPU, respectively."
Combat COVID-19 Infodemic Using Explainable Natural Language Processing Models,"Misinformation of COVID-19 is prevalent on social media as the pandemic unfolds, and the associated risks are extremely high. Thus, it is critical to detect and combat such misinformation. Recently, deep learning models using natural language processing techniques, such as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), have achieved great successes in detecting misinformation. In this paper, we proposed an explainable natural language processing model based on DistilBERT and SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations) to combat misinformation about COVID-19 due to their efficiency and effectiveness. First, we collected a dataset of 984 claims about COVID-19 with fact checking. By augmenting the data using back-translation, we doubled the sample size of the dataset and the DistilBERT model was able to obtain good performance (accuracy: 0.972; areas under the curve: 0.993) in detecting misinformation about COVID-19. Our model was also tested on a larger dataset for AAAI2021 - COVID-19 Fake News Detection Shared Task and obtained good performance (accuracy: 0.938; areas under the curve: 0.985). The performance on both datasets was better than traditional machine learning models. Second, in order to boost public trust in model prediction, we employed SHAP to improve model explainability, which was further evaluated using a between-subjects experiment with three conditions, i.e., text (T), text+SHAP explanation (TSE), and text+SHAP explanation+source and evidence (TSESE). The participants were significantly more likely to trust and share information related to COVID-19 in the TSE and TSESE conditions than in the T condition. Our results provided good implications in detecting misinformation about COVID-19 and improving public trust."
Token-Modification Adversarial Attacks for Natural Language Processing: A Survey,"There are now many adversarial attacks for natural language processing systems. Of these, a vast majority achieve success by modifying individual document tokens, which we call here a \textit{token-modification} attack. Each token-modification attack is defined by a specific combination of fundamental \textit{components}, such as a constraint on the adversary or a particular search algorithm. Motivated by this observation, we survey existing token-modification attacks and extract the components of each. We use an attack-independent framework to structure our survey which results in an effective categorisation of the field and an easy comparison of components. We hope this survey will guide new researchers to this field and spark further research into the individual attack components."
Teach Me to Explain: A Review of Datasets for Explainable Natural Language Processing,"Explainable NLP (ExNLP) has increasingly focused on collecting human-annotated textual explanations. These explanations are used downstream in three ways: as data augmentation to improve performance on a predictive task, as supervision to train models to produce explanations for their predictions, and as a ground-truth to evaluate model-generated explanations. In this review, we identify 65 datasets with three predominant classes of textual explanations (highlights, free-text, and structured), organize the literature on annotating each type, identify strengths and shortcomings of existing collection methodologies, and give recommendations for collecting ExNLP datasets in the future."
A Systematic Review of Natural Language Processing Applied to Radiology Reports,"NLP has a significant role in advancing healthcare and has been found to be key in extracting structured information from radiology reports. Understanding recent developments in NLP application to radiology is of significance but recent reviews on this are limited. This study systematically assesses recent literature in NLP applied to radiology reports. Our automated literature search yields 4,799 results using automated filtering, metadata enriching steps and citation search combined with manual review. Our analysis is based on 21 variables including radiology characteristics, NLP methodology, performance, study, and clinical application characteristics. We present a comprehensive analysis of the 164 publications retrieved with each categorised into one of 6 clinical application categories. Deep learning use increases but conventional machine learning approaches are still prevalent. Deep learning remains challenged when data is scarce and there is little evidence of adoption into clinical practice. Despite 17% of studies reporting greater than 0.85 F1 scores, it is hard to comparatively evaluate these approaches given that most of them use different datasets. Only 14 studies made their data and 15 their code available with 10 externally validating results. Automated understanding of clinical narratives of the radiology reports has the potential to enhance the healthcare process but reproducibility and explainability of models are important if the domain is to move applications into clinical use. More could be done to share code enabling validation of methods on different institutional data and to reduce heterogeneity in reporting of study properties allowing inter-study comparisons. Our results have significance for researchers providing a systematic synthesis of existing work to build on, identify gaps, opportunities for collaboration and avoid duplication."
Decoding EEG Brain Activity for Multi-Modal Natural Language Processing,"Until recently, human behavioral data from reading has mainly been of interest to researchers to understand human cognition. However, these human language processing signals can also be beneficial in machine learning-based natural language processing tasks. Using EEG brain activity to this purpose is largely unexplored as of yet. In this paper, we present the first large-scale study of systematically analyzing the potential of EEG brain activity data for improving natural language processing tasks, with a special focus on which features of the signal are most beneficial. We present a multi-modal machine learning architecture that learns jointly from textual input as well as from EEG features. We find that filtering the EEG signals into frequency bands is more beneficial than using the broadband signal. Moreover, for a range of word embedding types, EEG data improves binary and ternary sentiment classification and outperforms multiple baselines. For more complex tasks such as relation detection, further research is needed. Finally, EEG data shows to be particularly promising when limited training data is available."
Broader terms curriculum mapping: Using natural language processing and visual-supported communication to create representative program planning experiences,"Accreditation bodies call for curriculum development processes open to all stakeholders, reflecting viewpoints of students, industry, university faculty and society. However, communication difficulties between faculty and non-faculty groups leave unexplored an immense collaboration potential. Using classification of learning objectives, natural language processing, and data visualization, this paper presents a method to deliver program plan representations that are universal, self-explanatory, and empowering. A simple example shows how the method contributes to representative program planning experiences and a case study is used to confirm the method's accuracy and utility."
Spoiler Alert: Using Natural Language Processing to Detect Spoilers in Book Reviews,"This paper presents an NLP (Natural Language Processing) approach to detecting spoilers in book reviews, using the University of California San Diego (UCSD) Goodreads Spoiler dataset. We explored the use of LSTM, BERT, and RoBERTa language models to perform spoiler detection at the sentence-level. This was contrasted with a UCSD paper which performed the same task, but using handcrafted features in its data preparation. Despite eschewing the use of handcrafted features, our results from the LSTM model were able to slightly exceed the UCSD team's performance in spoiler detection."
Representation Learning for Natural Language Processing,"This book aims to review and present the recent advances of distributed representation learning for NLP, including why representation learning can improve NLP, how representation learning takes part in various important topics of NLP, and what challenges are still not well addressed by distributed representation."
Parametrized Quantum Circuits of Synonymous Sentences in Quantum Natural Language Processing,"In this paper, we develop a compositional vector-based semantics of positive transitive sentences in quantum natural language processing for a non-English language, i.e. Persian, to compare the parametrized quantum circuits of two synonymous sentences in two languages, English and Persian. By considering grammar+meaning of a transitive sentence, we translate DisCoCat diagram via ZX-calculus into quantum circuit form. Also, we use a bigraph method to rewrite DisCoCat diagram and turn into quantum circuit in the semantic side."

BNLP provides pre-trained model with high accuracy to do model based tokenization, embedding, POS tagging, NER tagging task for Bengali language. BNLP pre-trained model achieves significant results in Bengali text tokenization, word embedding, POS tagging and NER tagging task. BNLP is using widely in the Bengali research communities with 16K downloads, 119 stars and 31 forks. BNLP is available at https://github.com/sagorbrur/bnlp."
Explaining Natural Language Processing Classifiers with Occlusion and Language Modeling,"Deep neural networks are powerful statistical learners. However, their predictions do not come with an explanation of their process. To analyze these models, explanation methods are being developed. We present a novel explanation method, called OLM, for natural language processing classifiers. This method combines occlusion and language modeling, which are techniques central to explainability and NLP, respectively. OLM gives explanations that are theoretically sound and easy to understand.  We make several contributions to the theory of explanation methods. Axioms for explanation methods are an interesting theoretical concept to explore their basics and deduce methods. We introduce a new axiom, give its intuition and show it contradicts another existing axiom. Additionally, we point out theoretical difficulties of existing gradient-based and some occlusion-based explanation methods in natural language processing. We provide an extensive argument why evaluation of explanation methods is difficult. We compare OLM to other explanation methods and underline its uniqueness experimentally. Finally, we investigate corner cases of OLM and discuss its validity and possible improvements."
Challenges Encountered in Turkish Natural Language Processing Studies,"Natural language processing is a branch of computer science that combines artificial intelligence with linguistics. It aims to analyze a language element such as writing or speaking with software and convert it into information. Considering that each language has its own grammatical rules and vocabulary diversity, the complexity of the studies in this field is somewhat understandable. For instance, Turkish is a very interesting language in many ways. Examples of this are agglutinative word structure, consonant/vowel harmony, a large number of productive derivational morphemes (practically infinite vocabulary), derivation and syntactic relations, a complex emphasis on vocabulary and phonological rules. In this study, the interesting features of Turkish in terms of natural language processing are mentioned. In addition, summary info about natural language processing techniques, systems and various sources developed for Turkish are given."
Knowledge Graphs and Natural-Language Processing,"Emergency-relevant data comes in many varieties. It can be high volume and high velocity, and reaction times are critical, calling for efficient and powerful techniques for data analysis and management. Knowledge graphs represent data in a rich, flexible, and uniform way that is well matched with the needs of emergency management. They build on existing standards, resources, techniques, and tools for semantic data and computing. This chapter explains the most important semantic technologies and how they support knowledge graphs. We proceed to discuss their benefits and challenges and give examples of relevant semantic data sources and vocabularies. Natural-language texts -- in particular those collected from social media such as Twitter -- is a type of data source that poses particular analysis challenges. We therefore include an overview of techniques for processing natural-language texts."
Indonesian ID Card Extractor Using Optical Character Recognition and Natural Language Post-Processing,"The development of Information Technology has been increasingly changing the means of information exchange leading to the need of digitizing print documents. In the present era, there is a lot of fraud that often occur. To avoid account fraud there was verification using ID card extraction using OCR and NLP. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is technology that used to generate text from image. With OCR we can extract Indonesian ID card or kartu tanda penduduk (KTP) into text too. This is using to make easier service operator to do data entry. To improve the accuracy we made text correction using Natural language Processing (NLP) method to fixing the text. With 50 Indonesian ID card image we got 0.78 F-score, and we need 4510 milliseconds to extract per ID card."
AI- and HPC-enabled Lead Generation for SARS-CoV-2: Models and Processes to Extract Druglike Molecules Contained in Natural Language Text,"Researchers worldwide are seeking to repurpose existing drugs or discover new drugs to counter the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). A promising source of candidates for such studies is molecules that have been reported in the scientific literature to be drug-like in the context of coronavirus research. We report here on a project that leverages both human and artificial intelligence to detect references to drug-like molecules in free text. We engage non-expert humans to create a corpus of labeled text, use this labeled corpus to train a named entity recognition model, and employ the trained model to extract 10912 drug-like molecules from the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge (CORD-19) corpus of 198875 papers. Performance analyses show that our automated extraction model can achieve performance on par with that of non-expert humans."
Trankit: A Light-Weight Transformer-based Toolkit for Multilingual Natural Language Processing,"We introduce Trankit, a light-weight Transformer-based Toolkit for multilingual Natural Language Processing (NLP). It provides a trainable pipeline for fundamental NLP tasks over 100 languages, and 90 pretrained pipelines for 56 languages. Built on a state-of-the-art pretrained language model, Trankit significantly outperforms prior multilingual NLP pipelines over sentence segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, morphological feature tagging, and dependency parsing while maintaining competitive performance for tokenization, multi-word token expansion, and lemmatization over 90 Universal Dependencies treebanks. Despite the use of a large pretrained transformer, our toolkit is still efficient in memory usage and speed. This is achieved by our novel plug-and-play mechanism with Adapters where a multilingual pretrained transformer is shared across pipelines for different languages. Our toolkit along with pretrained models and code are publicly available at: https://github.com/nlp-uoregon/trankit. A demo website for our toolkit is also available at: http://nlp.uoregon.edu/trankit. Finally, we create a demo video for Trankit at: https://youtu.be/q0KGP3zGjGc."
Looking Through Glass: Knowledge Discovery from Materials Science Literature using Natural Language Processing,"Most of the knowledge in materials science literature is in the form of unstructured data such as text and images. Here, we present a framework employing natural language processing, which automates text and image comprehension and precision knowledge extraction from inorganic glasses' literature. The abstracts are automatically categorized using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), providing a way to classify and search semantically linked publications. Similarly, a comprehensive summary of images and plots are presented using the 'Caption Cluster Plot' (CCP), which provides direct access to the images buried in the papers. Finally, we combine the LDA and CCP with the chemical elements occurring in the manuscript to present an 'Elemental map', a topical and image-wise distribution of chemical elements in the literature. Overall, the framework presented here can be a generic and powerful tool to extract and disseminate material-specific information on composition-structure-processing-property dataspaces, allowing insights into fundamental problems relevant to the materials science community and accelerated materials discovery."
Towards Zero-Shot Knowledge Distillation for Natural Language Processing,"Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a common knowledge transfer algorithm used for model compression across a variety of deep learning based natural language processing (NLP) solutions. In its regular manifestations, KD requires access to the teacher's training data for knowledge transfer to the student network. However, privacy concerns, data regulations and proprietary reasons may prevent access to such data. We present, to the best of our knowledge, the first work on Zero-Shot Knowledge Distillation for NLP, where the student learns from the much larger teacher without any task specific data. Our solution combines out of domain data and adversarial training to learn the teacher's output distribution. We investigate six tasks from the GLUE benchmark and demonstrate that we can achieve between 75% and 92% of the teacher's classification score (accuracy or F1) while compressing the model 30 times."
Continual Lifelong Learning in Natural Language Processing: A Survey,"Continual learning (CL) aims to enable information systems to learn from a continuous data stream across time. However, it is difficult for existing deep learning architectures to learn a new task without largely forgetting previously acquired knowledge. Furthermore, CL is particularly challenging for language learning, as natural language is ambiguous: it is discrete, compositional, and its meaning is context-dependent. In this work, we look at the problem of CL through the lens of various NLP tasks. Our survey discusses major challenges in CL and current methods applied in neural network models. We also provide a critical review of the existing CL evaluation methods and datasets in NLP. Finally, we present our outlook on future research directions."
"Discovering key topics from short, real-world medical inquiries via natural language processing and unsupervised learning","Millions of unsolicited medical inquiries are received by pharmaceutical companies every year. It has been hypothesized that these inquiries represent a treasure trove of information, potentially giving insight into matters regarding medicinal products and the associated medical treatments. However, due to the large volume and specialized nature of the inquiries, it is difficult to perform timely, recurrent, and comprehensive analyses. Here, we propose a machine learning approach based on natural language processing and unsupervised learning to automatically discover key topics in real-world medical inquiries from customers. This approach does not require ontologies nor annotations. The discovered topics are meaningful and medically relevant, as judged by medical information specialists, thus demonstrating that unsolicited medical inquiries are a source of valuable customer insights. Our work paves the way for the machine-learning-driven analysis of medical inquiries in the pharmaceutical industry, which ultimately aims at improving patient care."
Foundations for Near-Term Quantum Natural Language Processing,"We provide conceptual and mathematical foundations for near-term quantum natural language processing (QNLP), and do so in quantum computer scientist friendly terms. We opted for an expository presentation style, and provide references for supporting empirical evidence and formal statements concerning mathematical generality.  We recall how the quantum model for natural language that we employ canonically combines linguistic meanings with rich linguistic structure, most notably grammar. In particular, the fact that it takes a quantum-like model to combine meaning and structure, establishes QNLP as quantum-native, on par with simulation of quantum systems. Moreover, the now leading Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) paradigm for encoding classical data on quantum hardware, variational quantum circuits, makes NISQ exceptionally QNLP-friendly: linguistic structure can be encoded as a free lunch, in contrast to the apparently exponentially expensive classical encoding of grammar.  Quantum speed-up for QNLP tasks has already been established in previous work with Will Zeng. Here we provide a broader range of tasks which all enjoy the same advantage.  Diagrammatic reasoning is at the heart of QNLP. Firstly, the quantum model interprets language as quantum processes via the diagrammatic formalism of categorical quantum mechanics. Secondly, these diagrams are via ZX-calculus translated into quantum circuits. Parameterisations of meanings then become the circuit variables to be learned.  Our encoding of linguistic structure within quantum circuits also embodies a novel approach for establishing word-meanings that goes beyond the current standards in mainstream AI, by placing linguistic structure at the heart of Wittgenstein's meaning-is-context."
A Panoramic Survey of Natural Language Processing in the Arab World,"The term natural language refers to any system of symbolic communication (spoken, signed or written) without intentional human planning and design. This distinguishes natural languages such as Arabic and Japanese from artificially constructed languages such as Esperanto or Python. Natural language processing (NLP) is the sub-field of artificial intelligence (AI) focused on modeling natural languages to build applications such as speech recognition and synthesis, machine translation, optical character recognition (OCR), sentiment analysis (SA), question answering, dialogue systems, etc. NLP is a highly interdisciplinary field with connections to computer science, linguistics, cognitive science, psychology, mathematics and others. Some of the earliest AI applications were in NLP (e.g., machine translation); and the last decade (2010-2020) in particular has witnessed an incredible increase in quality, matched with a rise in public awareness, use, and expectations of what may have seemed like science fiction in the past. NLP researchers pride themselves on developing language independent models and tools that can be applied to all human languages, e.g. machine translation systems can be built for a variety of languages using the same basic mechanisms and models. However, the reality is that some languages do get more attention (e.g., English and Chinese) than others (e.g., Hindi and Swahili). Arabic, the primary language of the Arab world and the religious language of millions of non-Arab Muslims is somewhere in the middle of this continuum. Though Arabic NLP has many challenges, it has seen many successes and developments. Next we discuss Arabic's main challenges as a necessary background, and we present a brief history of Arabic NLP. We then survey a number of its research areas, and close with a critical discussion of the future of Arabic NLP."
Using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing Techniques to Analyze and Support Moderation of Student Book Discussions,"The increasing adoption of technology to augment or even replace traditional face-to-face learning has led to the development of a myriad of tools and platforms aimed at engaging the students and facilitating the teacher's ability to present new information. The IMapBook project aims at improving the literacy and reading comprehension skills of elementary school-aged children by presenting them with interactive e-books and letting them take part in moderated book discussions. This study aims to develop and illustrate a machine learning-based approach to message classification that could be used to automatically notify the discussion moderator of a possible need for an intervention and also to collect other useful information about the ongoing discussion. We aim to predict whether a message posted in the discussion is relevant to the discussed book, whether the message is a statement, a question, or an answer, and in which broad category it can be classified. We incrementally enrich our used feature subsets and compare them using standard classification algorithms as well as the novel Feature stacking method. We use standard classification performance metrics as well as the Bayesian correlated t-test to show that the use of described methods in discussion moderation is feasible. Moving forward, we seek to attain better performance by focusing on extracting more of the significant information found in the strong temporal interdependence of the messages."
NLPGym -- A toolkit for evaluating RL agents on Natural Language Processing Tasks,"Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently shown impressive performance in complex game AI and robotics tasks. To a large extent, this is thanks to the availability of simulated environments such as OpenAI Gym, Atari Learning Environment, or Malmo which allow agents to learn complex tasks through interaction with virtual environments. While RL is also increasingly applied to natural language processing (NLP), there are no simulated textual environments available for researchers to apply and consistently benchmark RL on NLP tasks. With the work reported here, we therefore release NLPGym, an open-source Python toolkit that provides interactive textual environments for standard NLP tasks such as sequence tagging, multi-label classification, and question answering. We also present experimental results for 6 tasks using different RL algorithms which serve as baselines for further research. The toolkit is published at https://github.com/rajcscw/nlp-gym"
Analyzing Sustainability Reports Using Natural Language Processing,"Climate change is a far-reaching, global phenomenon that will impact many aspects of our society, including the global stock market \cite{dietz2016climate}. In recent years, companies have increasingly been aiming to both mitigate their environmental impact and adapt to the changing climate context. This is reported via increasingly exhaustive reports, which cover many types of climate risks and exposures under the umbrella of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG). However, given this abundance of data, sustainability analysts are obliged to comb through hundreds of pages of reports in order to find relevant information. We leveraged recent progress in Natural Language Processing (NLP) to create a custom model, ClimateQA, which allows the analysis of financial reports in order to identify climate-relevant sections based on a question answering approach. We present this tool and the methodology that we used to develop it in the present article."
Natural Language Processing to Detect Cognitive Concerns in Electronic Health Records Using Deep Learning,"Dementia is under-recognized in the community, under-diagnosed by healthcare professionals, and under-coded in claims data. Information on cognitive dysfunction, however, is often found in unstructured clinician notes within medical records but manual review by experts is time consuming and often prone to errors. Automated mining of these notes presents a potential opportunity to label patients with cognitive concerns who could benefit from an evaluation or be referred to specialist care. In order to identify patients with cognitive concerns in electronic medical records, we applied natural language processing (NLP) algorithms and compared model performance to a baseline model that used structured diagnosis codes and medication data only. An attention-based deep learning model outperformed the baseline model and other simpler models."
"Situated Data, Situated Systems: A Methodology to Engage with Power Relations in Natural Language Processing Research","We propose a bias-aware methodology to engage with power relations in natural language processing (NLP) research. NLP research rarely engages with bias in social contexts, limiting its ability to mitigate bias. While researchers have recommended actions, technical methods, and documentation practices, no methodology exists to integrate critical reflections on bias with technical NLP methods. In this paper, after an extensive and interdisciplinary literature review, we contribute a bias-aware methodology for NLP research. We also contribute a definition of biased text, a discussion of the implications of biased NLP systems, and a case study demonstrating how we are executing the bias-aware methodology in research on archival metadata descriptions."
Generating Knowledge Graphs by Employing Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning Techniques within the Scholarly Domain,"The continuous growth of scientific literature brings innovations and, at the same time, raises new challenges. One of them is related to the fact that its analysis has become difficult due to the high volume of published papers for which manual effort for annotations and management is required. Novel technological infrastructures are needed to help researchers, research policy makers, and companies to time-efficiently browse, analyse, and forecast scientific research. Knowledge graphs i.e., large networks of entities and relationships, have proved to be effective solution in this space. Scientific knowledge graphs focus on the scholarly domain and typically contain metadata describing research publications such as authors, venues, organizations, research topics, and citations. However, the current generation of knowledge graphs lacks of an explicit representation of the knowledge presented in the research papers. As such, in this paper, we present a new architecture that takes advantage of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning methods for extracting entities and relationships from research publications and integrates them in a large-scale knowledge graph. Within this research work, we i) tackle the challenge of knowledge extraction by employing several state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing and Text Mining tools, ii) describe an approach for integrating entities and relationships generated by these tools, iii) show the advantage of such an hybrid system over alternative approaches, and vi) as a chosen use case, we generated a scientific knowledge graph including 109,105 triples, extracted from 26,827 abstracts of papers within the Semantic Web domain. As our approach is general and can be applied to any domain, we expect that it can facilitate the management, analysis, dissemination, and processing of scientific knowledge."
Leveraging Natural Language Processing to Mine Issues on Twitter During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"The recent global outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread to all corners of the globe. The international travel ban, panic buying, and the need for self-quarantine are among the many other social challenges brought about in this new era. Twitter platforms have been used in various public health studies to identify public opinion about an event at the local and global scale. To understand the public concerns and responses to the pandemic, a system that can leverage machine learning techniques to filter out irrelevant tweets and identify the important topics of discussion on social media platforms like Twitter is needed. In this study, we constructed a system to identify the relevant tweets related to the COVID-19 pandemic throughout January 1st, 2020 to April 30th, 2020, and explored topic modeling to identify the most discussed topics and themes during this period in our data set. Additionally, we analyzed the temporal changes in the topics with respect to the events that occurred during this pandemic. We found out that eight topics were sufficient to identify the themes in our corpus. These topics depicted a temporal trend. The dominant topics vary over time and align with the events related to the COVID-19 pandemic."
Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Action: Addressing the COVID-19 Pandemic with Natural Language Processing (NLP),"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on society, both because of the serious health effects of COVID-19 and because of public health measures implemented to slow its spread. Many of these difficulties are fundamentally information needs; attempts to address these needs have caused an information overload for both researchers and the public. Natural language processing (NLP), the branch of artificial intelligence that interprets human language, can be applied to address many of the information needs made urgent by the COVID-19 pandemic. This review surveys approximately 150 NLP studies and more than 50 systems and datasets addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. We detail work on four core NLP tasks: information retrieval, named entity recognition, literature-based discovery, and question answering. We also describe work that directly addresses aspects of the pandemic through four additional tasks: topic modeling, sentiment and emotion analysis, caseload forecasting, and misinformation detection. We conclude by discussing observable trends and remaining challenges."
A Cross-lingual Natural Language Processing Framework for Infodemic Management,"The COVID-19 pandemic has put immense pressure on health systems which are further strained due to the misinformation surrounding it. Under such a situation, providing the right information at the right time is crucial. There is a growing demand for the management of information spread using Artificial Intelligence. Hence, we have exploited the potential of Natural Language Processing for identifying relevant information that needs to be disseminated amongst the masses. In this work, we present a novel Cross-lingual Natural Language Processing framework to provide relevant information by matching daily news with trusted guidelines from the World Health Organization. The proposed pipeline deploys various techniques of NLP such as summarizers, word embeddings, and similarity metrics to provide users with news articles along with a corresponding healthcare guideline. A total of 36 models were evaluated and a combination of LexRank based summarizer on Word2Vec embedding with Word Mover distance metric outperformed all other models. This novel open-source approach can be used as a template for proactive dissemination of relevant healthcare information in the midst of misinformation spread associated with epidemics."
Differential Privacy and Natural Language Processing to Generate Contextually Similar Decoy Messages in Honey Encryption Scheme,"Honey Encryption is an approach to encrypt the messages using low min-entropy keys, such as weak passwords, OTPs, PINs, credit card numbers. The ciphertext is produces, when decrypted with any number of incorrect keys, produces plausible-looking but bogus plaintext called ""honey messages"". But the current techniques used in producing the decoy plaintexts do not model human language entirely. A gibberish, random assortment of words is not enough to fool an attacker; that will not be acceptable and convincing, whether or not the attacker knows some information of the genuine source.  In this paper, I focus on the plaintexts which are some non-numeric informative messages. In order to fool the attacker into believing that the decoy message can actually be from a certain source, we need to capture the empirical and contextual properties of the language. That is, there should be no linguistic difference between real and fake message, without revealing the structure of the real message. I employ natural language processing and generalized differential privacy to solve this problem. Mainly I focus on machine learning methods like keyword extraction, context classification, bags-of-words, word embeddings, transformers for text processing to model privacy for text documents. Then I prove the security of this approach with e-differential privacy."
Transgender Community Sentiment Analysis from Social Media Data: A Natural Language Processing Approach,"Transgender community is experiencing a huge disparity in mental health conditions compared with the general population. Interpreting the social medial data posted by transgender people may help us understand the sentiments of these sexual minority groups better and apply early interventions. In this study, we manually categorize 300 social media comments posted by transgender people to the sentiment of negative, positive, and neutral. 5 machine learning algorithms and 2 deep neural networks are adopted to build sentiment analysis classifiers based on the annotated data. Results show that our annotations are reliable with a high Cohen's Kappa score over 0.8 across all three classes. LSTM model yields an optimal performance of accuracy over 0.85 and AUC of 0.876. Our next step will focus on using advanced natural language processing algorithms on a larger annotated dataset."
Word Embeddings for Chemical Patent Natural Language Processing,We evaluate chemical patent word embeddings against known biomedical embeddings and show that they outperform the latter extrinsically and intrinsically. We also show that using contextualized embeddings can induce predictive models of reasonable performance for this domain over a relatively small gold standard.
New Approaches for Natural Language Understanding based on the Idea that Natural Language encodes both Information and its Processing Procedures,"We must recognize that natural language is a way of information encoding, and it encodes not only the information but also the procedures for how information is processed. To understand natural language, the same as we conceive and design computer languages, the first step is to separate information (or data) and the processing procedures of information (or data). In natural language, some processing procedures of data are encoded directly as the structure chunk and the pointer chunk (this paper has reclassified lexical chunks as the data chunk, structure chunk, and the pointer chunk); some processing procedures of data imply in sentences structures; some requests of processing procedures are expressed by information senders and processed by information receivers. For the data parts, the classification encoding system of attribute information and the information organization architecture (including constitutional structures of information sets and the hierarchy between the information sets) were discussed. In section 2, the theoretical part elaborated in section 2 has been verified in examples and proofed that the studies in this paper have achieved the goal of enabling machines to understand the information conveyed in the dialogue. In section 4, the author summarizes the basic conditions of ""Understanding"", rethinks what ""Understanding"" is and how to proceed. The study in this paper provides a practical, theoretical basis and research methods for NLU. It also can be applied in large-scale and multi-type information processing in the artificial intelligence (AI) area."
Natural Language Processing Chains Inside a Cross-lingual Event-Centric Knowledge Pipeline for European Union Under-resourced Languages,"This article presents the strategy for developing a platform containing Language Processing Chains for European Union languages, consisting of Tokenization to Parsing, also including Named Entity recognition andwith addition ofSentiment Analysis. These chains are part of the first step of an event-centric knowledge processing pipeline whose aim is to process multilingual media information about major events that can cause an impactin Europe and the rest of the world. Due to the differences in terms of availability of language resources for each language, we have built this strategy in three steps, starting with processing chains for the well-resourced languages and finishing with the development of new modules for the under-resourced ones. In order to classify all European Union official languages in terms of resources, we have analysed the size of annotated corpora as well as the existence of pre-trained models in mainstream Language Processing tools, and we have combined this information with the proposed classification published at META-NETwhitepaper series."
A Survey on Recent Approaches for Natural Language Processing in Low-Resource Scenarios,"Deep neural networks and huge language models are becoming omnipresent in natural language applications. As they are known for requiring large amounts of training data, there is a growing body of work to improve the performance in low-resource settings. Motivated by the recent fundamental changes towards neural models and the popular pre-train and fine-tune paradigm, we survey promising approaches for low-resource natural language processing. After a discussion about the different dimensions of data availability, we give a structured overview of methods that enable learning when training data is sparse. This includes mechanisms to create additional labeled data like data augmentation and distant supervision as well as transfer learning settings that reduce the need for target supervision. A goal of our survey is to explain how these methods differ in their requirements as understanding them is essential for choosing a technique suited for a specific low-resource setting. Further key aspects of this work are to highlight open issues and to outline promising directions for future research."
Using the Full-text Content of Academic Articles to Identify and Evaluate Algorithm Entities in the Domain of Natural Language Processing,"In the era of big data, the advancement, improvement, and application of algorithms in academic research have played an important role in promoting the development of different disciplines. Academic papers in various disciplines, especially computer science, contain a large number of algorithms. Identifying the algorithms from the full-text content of papers can determine popular or classical algorithms in a specific field and help scholars gain a comprehensive understanding of the algorithms and even the field. To this end, this article takes the field of natural language processing (NLP) as an example and identifies algorithms from academic papers in the field. A dictionary of algorithms is constructed by manually annotating the contents of papers, and sentences containing algorithms in the dictionary are extracted through dictionary-based matching. The number of articles mentioning an algorithm is used as an indicator to analyze the influence of that algorithm. Our results reveal the algorithm with the highest influence in NLP papers and show that classification algorithms represent the largest proportion among the high-impact algorithms. In addition, the evolution of the influence of algorithms reflects the changes in research tasks and topics in the field, and the changes in the influence of different algorithms show different trends. As a preliminary exploration, this paper conducts an analysis of the impact of algorithms mentioned in the academic text, and the results can be used as training data for the automatic extraction of large-scale algorithms in the future. The methodology in this paper is domain-independent and can be applied to other domains."
Improving Natural Language Processing Tasks with Human Gaze-Guided Neural Attention,"A lack of corpora has so far limited advances in integrating human gaze data as a supervisory signal in neural attention mechanisms for natural language processing(NLP). We propose a novel hybrid text saliency model(TSM) that, for the first time, combines a cognitive model of reading with explicit human gaze supervision in a single machine learning framework. On four different corpora we demonstrate that our hybrid TSM duration predictions are highly correlated with human gaze ground truth. We further propose a novel joint modeling approach to integrate TSM predictions into the attention layer of a network designed for a specific upstream NLP task without the need for any task-specific human gaze data. We demonstrate that our joint model outperforms the state of the art in paraphrase generation on the Quora Question Pairs corpus by more than 10% in BLEU-4 and achieves state of the art performance for sentence compression on the challenging Google Sentence Compression corpus. As such, our work introduces a practical approach for bridging between data-driven and cognitive models and demonstrates a new way to integrate human gaze-guided neural attention into NLP tasks."
"Sentence, Phrase, and Triple Annotations to Build a Knowledge Graph of Natural Language Processing Contributions -- A Trial Dataset","Purpose: The aim of this work is to normalize the NLPCONTRIBUTIONS scheme (henceforward, NLPCONTRIBUTIONGRAPH) to structure, directly from article sentences, the contributions information in Natural Language Processing (NLP) scholarly articles via a two-stage annotation methodology: 1) pilot stage - to define the scheme (described in prior work); and 2) adjudication stage - to normalize the graphing model (the focus of this paper).  Design/methodology/approach: We re-annotate, a second time, the contributions-pertinent information across 50 prior-annotated NLP scholarly articles in terms of a data pipeline comprising: contribution-centered sentences, phrases, and triple statements. To this end, specifically, care was taken in the adjudication annotation stage to reduce annotation noise while formulating the guidelines for our proposed novel NLP contributions structuring and graphing scheme.  Findings: The application of NLPCONTRIBUTIONGRAPH on the 50 articles resulted finally in a dataset of 900 contribution-focused sentences, 4,702 contribution-information-centered phrases, and 2,980 surface-structured triples. The intra-annotation agreement between the first and second stages, in terms of F1, was 67.92% for sentences, 41.82% for phrases, and 22.31% for triple statements indicating that with increased granularity of the information, the annotation decision variance is greater.  Practical Implications: We demonstrate NLPCONTRIBUTIONGRAPH data integrated into the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG), a next-generation KG-based digital library with intelligent computations enabled over structured scholarly knowledge, as a viable aid to assist researchers in their day-to-day tasks."
Is the Best Better? Bayesian Statistical Model Comparison for Natural Language Processing,"Recent work raises concerns about the use of standard splits to compare natural language processing models. We propose a Bayesian statistical model comparison technique which uses k-fold cross-validation across multiple data sets to estimate the likelihood that one model will outperform the other, or that the two will produce practically equivalent results. We use this technique to rank six English part-of-speech taggers across two data sets and three evaluation metrics."
Universal Natural Language Processing with Limited Annotations: Try Few-shot Textual Entailment as a Start,"A standard way to address different NLP problems is by first constructing a problem-specific dataset, then building a model to fit this dataset. To build the ultimate artificial intelligence, we desire a single machine that can handle diverse new problems, for which task-specific annotations are limited. We bring up textual entailment as a unified solver for such NLP problems. However, current research of textual entailment has not spilled much ink on the following questions: (i) How well does a pretrained textual entailment system generalize across domains with only a handful of domain-specific examples? and (ii) When is it worth transforming an NLP task into textual entailment? We argue that the transforming is unnecessary if we can obtain rich annotations for this task. Textual entailment really matters particularly when the target NLP task has insufficient annotations.  Universal NLP can be probably achieved through different routines. In this work, we introduce Universal Few-shot textual Entailment (UFO-Entail). We demonstrate that this framework enables a pretrained entailment model to work well on new entailment domains in a few-shot setting, and show its effectiveness as a unified solver for several downstream NLP tasks such as question answering and coreference resolution when the end-task annotations are limited. Code: https://github.com/salesforce/UniversalFewShotNLP"
Multi-domain Clinical Natural Language Processing with MedCAT: the Medical Concept Annotation Toolkit,"Electronic health records (EHR) contain large volumes of unstructured text, requiring the application of Information Extraction (IE) technologies to enable clinical analysis. We present the open-source Medical Concept Annotation Toolkit (MedCAT) that provides: a) a novel self-supervised machine learning algorithm for extracting concepts using any concept vocabulary including UMLS/SNOMED-CT; b) a feature-rich annotation interface for customising and training IE models; and c) integrations to the broader CogStack ecosystem for vendor-agnostic health system deployment. We show improved performance in extracting UMLS concepts from open datasets (F1:0.448-0.738 vs 0.429-0.650). Further real-world validation demonstrates SNOMED-CT extraction at 3 large London hospitals with self-supervised training over ~8.8B words from ~17M clinical records and further fine-tuning with ~6K clinician annotated examples. We show strong transferability (F1 > 0.94) between hospitals, datasets, and concept types indicating cross-domain EHR-agnostic utility for accelerated clinical and research use cases."
A Survey of the State of Explainable AI for Natural Language Processing,"Recent years have seen important advances in the quality of state-of-the-art models, but this has come at the expense of models becoming less interpretable. This survey presents an overview of the current state of Explainable AI (XAI), considered within the domain of Natural Language Processing (NLP). We discuss the main categorization of explanations, as well as the various ways explanations can be arrived at and visualized. We detail the operations and explainability techniques currently available for generating explanations for NLP model predictions, to serve as a resource for model developers in the community. Finally, we point out the current gaps and encourage directions for future work in this important research area."
A survey on natural language processing (nlp) and applications in insurance,"Text is the most widely used means of communication today. This data is abundant but nevertheless complex to exploit within algorithms. For years, scientists have been trying to implement different techniques that enable computers to replicate some mechanisms of human reading. During the past five years, research disrupted the capacity of the algorithms to unleash the value of text data. It brings today, many opportunities for the insurance industry.Understanding those methods and, above all, knowing how to apply them is a major challenge and key to unleash the value of text data that have been stored for many years. Processing language with computer brings many new opportunities especially in the insurance sector where reports are central in the information used by insurers. SCOR's Data Analytics team has been working on the implementation of innovative tools or products that enable the use of the latest research on text analysis. Understanding text mining techniques in insurance enhances the monitoring of the underwritten risks and many processes that finally benefit policyholders.This article proposes to explain opportunities that Natural Language Processing (NLP) are providing to insurance. It details different methods used today in practice traces back the story of them. We also illustrate the implementation of certain methods using open source libraries and python codes that we have developed to facilitate the use of these techniques.After giving a general overview on the evolution of text mining during the past few years,we share about how to conduct a full study with text mining and share some examples to serve those models into insurance products or services. Finally, we explained in more details every step that composes a Natural Language Processing study to ensure the reader can have a deep understanding on the implementation."
Towards a Natural Language Query Processing System,"Tackling the information retrieval gap between non-technical database end-users and those with the knowledge of formal query languages has been an interesting area of data management and analytics research. The use of natural language interfaces to query information from databases offers the opportunity to bridge the communication challenges between end-users and systems that use formal query languages. Previous research efforts mainly focused on developing structured query interfaces to relational databases. However, the evolution of unstructured big data such as text, images, and video has exposed the limitations of traditional structured query interfaces. While the existing web search tools prove the popularity and usability of natural language query, they return complete documents and web pages instead of focused query responses and are not applicable to database systems. This paper reports our study on the design and development of a natural language query interface to a backend relational database. The novelty in the study lies in defining a graph database as a middle layer to store necessary metadata needed to transform a natural language query into structured query language that can be executed on backend databases. We implemented and evaluated our approach using a restaurant dataset. The translation results for some sample queries yielded a 90% accuracy rate."
Rank over Class: The Untapped Potential of Ranking in Natural Language Processing,"Text classification has long been a staple within Natural Language Processing (NLP) with applications spanning across diverse areas such as sentiment analysis, recommender systems and spam detection. With such a powerful solution, it is often tempting to use it as the go-to tool for all NLP problems since when you are holding a hammer, everything looks like a nail. However, we argue here that many tasks which are currently addressed using classification are in fact being shoehorned into a classification mould and that if we instead address them as a ranking problem, we not only improve the model, but we achieve better performance. We propose a novel end-to-end ranking approach consisting of a Transformer network responsible for producing representations for a pair of text sequences, which are in turn passed into a context aggregating network outputting ranking scores used to determine an ordering to the sequences based on some notion of relevance. We perform numerous experiments on publicly-available datasets and investigate the applications of ranking in problems often solved using classification. In an experiment on a heavily-skewed sentiment analysis dataset, converting ranking results to classification labels yields an approximately 22% improvement over state-of-the-art text classification, demonstrating the efficacy of text ranking over text classification in certain scenarios."
Data Readiness for Natural Language Processing,"This document concerns data readiness in the context of machine learning and Natural Language Processing. It describes how an organization may proceed to identify, make available, validate, and prepare data to facilitate automated analysis methods. The contents of the document is based on the practical challenges and frequently asked questions we have encountered in our work as an applied research institute with helping organizations and companies, both in the public and private sectors, to use data in their business processes."
A Decade of In-text Citation Analysis based on Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning Techniques: An overview of empirical studies,"Citation analysis is one of the most frequently used methods in research evaluation. We are seeing significant growth in citation analysis through bibliometric metadata, primarily due to the availability of citation databases such as the Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar, Microsoft Academic, and Dimensions. Due to better access to full-text publication corpora in recent years, information scientists have gone far beyond traditional bibliometrics by tapping into advancements in full-text data processing techniques to measure the impact of scientific publications in contextual terms. This has led to technical developments in citation context and content analysis, citation classifications, citation sentiment analysis, citation summarisation, and citation-based recommendation. This article aims to narratively review the studies on these developments. Its primary focus is on publications that have used natural language processing and machine learning techniques to analyse citations."
Knowledge Efficient Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing,"Deep learning has become the workhorse for a wide range of natural language processing applications. But much of the success of deep learning relies on annotated examples. Annotation is time-consuming and expensive to produce at scale. Here we are interested in methods for reducing the required quantity of annotated data -- by making the learning methods more knowledge efficient so as to make them more applicable in low annotation (low resource) settings. There are various classical approaches to making the models more knowledge efficient such as multi-task learning, transfer learning, weakly supervised and unsupervised learning etc. This thesis focuses on adapting such classical methods to modern deep learning models and algorithms.  This thesis describes four works aimed at making machine learning models more knowledge efficient. First, we propose a knowledge rich deep learning model (KRDL) as a unifying learning framework for incorporating prior knowledge into deep models. In particular, we apply KRDL built on Markov logic networks to denoise weak supervision. Second, we apply a KRDL model to assist the machine reading models to find the correct evidence sentences that can support their decision. Third, we investigate the knowledge transfer techniques in multilingual setting, where we proposed a method that can improve pre-trained multilingual BERT based on the bilingual dictionary. Fourth, we present an episodic memory network for language modelling, in which we encode the large external knowledge for the pre-trained GPT."
Understanding scholarly Natural Language Processing system diagrams through application of the Richards-Engelhardt framework,"We utilise Richards-Engelhardt framework as a tool for understanding Natural Language Processing systems diagrams. Through four examples from scholarly proceedings, we find that the application of the framework to this ecological and complex domain is effective for reflecting on these diagrams. We argue for vocabulary to describe multiple-codings, semiotic variability, and inconsistency or misuse of visual encoding principles in diagrams. Further, for application to scholarly Natural Language Processing systems, and perhaps systems diagrams more broadly, we propose the addition of ""Grouping by Object"" as a new visual encoding principle, and ""Emphasising"" as a new visual encoding type."
COVID-19 Pandemic: Identifying Key Issues using Social Media and Natural Language Processing,"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected people's lives in many ways. Social media data can reveal public perceptions and experience with respect to the pandemic, and also reveal factors that hamper or support efforts to curb global spread of the disease. In this paper, we analyzed COVID-19-related comments collected from six social media platforms using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. We identified relevant opinionated keyphrases and their respective sentiment polarity (negative or positive) from over 1 million randomly selected comments, and then categorized them into broader themes using thematic analysis. Our results uncover 34 negative themes out of which 17 are economic, socio-political, educational, and political issues. 20 positive themes were also identified. We discuss the negative issues and suggest interventions to tackle them based on the positive themes and research evidence."
Sentiment Analysis based Multi-person Multi-criteria Decision Making Methodology using Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning for Smarter Decision Aid. Case study of restaurant choice using TripAdvisor reviews,"Decision making models are constrained by taking the expert evaluations with pre-defined numerical or linguistic terms. We claim that the use of sentiment analysis will allow decision making models to consider expert evaluations in natural language. Accordingly, we propose the Sentiment Analysis based Multi-person Multi-criteria Decision Making (SA-MpMcDM) methodology for smarter decision aid, which builds the expert evaluations from their natural language reviews, and even from their numerical ratings if they are available. The SA-MpMcDM methodology incorporates an end-to-end multi-task deep learning model for aspect based sentiment analysis, named DOC-ABSADeepL model, able to identify the aspect categories mentioned in an expert review, and to distill their opinions and criteria. The individual evaluations are aggregated via the procedure named criteria weighting through the attention of the experts. We evaluate the methodology in a case study of restaurant choice using TripAdvisor reviews, hence we build, manually annotate, and release the TripR-2020 dataset of restaurant reviews. We analyze the SA-MpMcDM methodology in different scenarios using and not using natural language and numerical evaluations. The analysis shows that the combination of both sources of information results in a higher quality preference vector."
Multi-task learning for natural language processing in the 2020s: where are we going?,"Multi-task learning (MTL) significantly pre-dates the deep learning era, and it has seen a resurgence in the past few years as researchers have been applying MTL to deep learning solutions for natural language tasks. While steady MTL research has always been present, there is a growing interest driven by the impressive successes published in the related fields of transfer learning and pre-training, such as BERT, and the release of new challenge problems, such as GLUE and the NLP Decathlon (decaNLP). These efforts place more focus on how weights are shared across networks, evaluate the re-usability of network components and identify use cases where MTL can significantly outperform single-task solutions. This paper strives to provide a comprehensive survey of the numerous recent MTL contributions to the field of natural language processing and provide a forum to focus efforts on the hardest unsolved problems in the next decade. While novel models that improve performance on NLP benchmarks are continually produced, lasting MTL challenges remain unsolved which could hold the key to better language understanding, knowledge discovery and natural language interfaces."
Domain-Specific Language Model Pretraining for Biomedical Natural Language Processing,"Pretraining large neural language models, such as BERT, has led to impressive gains on many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, most pretraining efforts focus on general domain corpora, such as newswire and Web. A prevailing assumption is that even domain-specific pretraining can benefit by starting from general-domain language models. In this paper, we challenge this assumption by showing that for domains with abundant unlabeled text, such as biomedicine, pretraining language models from scratch results in substantial gains over continual pretraining of general-domain language models. To facilitate this investigation, we compile a comprehensive biomedical NLP benchmark from publicly-available datasets. Our experiments show that domain-specific pretraining serves as a solid foundation for a wide range of biomedical NLP tasks, leading to new state-of-the-art results across the board. Further, in conducting a thorough evaluation of modeling choices, both for pretraining and task-specific fine-tuning, we discover that some common practices are unnecessary with BERT models, such as using complex tagging schemes in named entity recognition (NER). To help accelerate research in biomedical NLP, we have released our state-of-the-art pretrained and task-specific models for the community, and created a leaderboard featuring our BLURB benchmark (short for Biomedical Language Understanding & Reasoning Benchmark) at https://aka.ms/BLURB."
Constructing a Testbed for Psychometric Natural Language Processing,"Psychometric measures of ability, attitudes, perceptions, and beliefs are crucial for understanding user behaviors in various contexts including health, security, e-commerce, and finance. Traditionally, psychometric dimensions have been measured and collected using survey-based methods. Inferring such constructs from user-generated text could afford opportunities for timely, unobtrusive, collection and analysis. In this paper, we describe our efforts to construct a corpus for psychometric natural language processing (NLP). We discuss our multi-step process to align user text with their survey-based response items and provide an overview of the resulting testbed which encompasses survey-based psychometric measures and accompanying user-generated text from over 8,500 respondents. We report preliminary results on the use of the text to categorize/predict users' survey response labels. We also discuss the important implications of our work and resulting testbed for future psychometric NLP research."
"Health, Psychosocial, and Social issues emanating from COVID-19 pandemic based on Social Media Comments using Natural Language Processing","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a global health crisis that affects many aspects of human lives. In the absence of vaccines and antivirals, several behavioural change and policy initiatives, such as physical distancing, have been implemented to control the spread of the coronavirus. Social media data can reveal public perceptions toward how governments and health agencies across the globe are handling the pandemic, as well as the impact of the disease on people regardless of their geographic locations in line with various factors that hinder or facilitate the efforts to control the spread of the pandemic globally. This paper aims to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people globally using social media data. We apply natural language processing (NLP) and thematic analysis to understand public opinions, experiences, and issues with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic using social media data. First, we collect over 47 million COVID-19-related comments from Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and three online discussion forums. Second, we perform data preprocessing which involves applying NLP techniques to clean and prepare the data for automated theme extraction. Third, we apply context-aware NLP approach to extract meaningful keyphrases or themes from over 1 million randomly selected comments, as well as compute sentiment scores for each theme and assign sentiment polarity based on the scores using lexicon-based technique. Fourth, we categorize related themes into broader themes. A total of 34 negative themes emerged, out of which 15 are health-related issues, psychosocial issues, and social issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic from the public perspective. In addition, 20 positive themes emerged from our results. Finally, we recommend interventions that can help address the negative issues based on the positive themes and other remedial ideas rooted in research."
Understanding the temporal evolution of COVID-19 research through machine learning and natural language processing,"The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been continuously affecting human lives and communities around the world in many ways, from cities under lockdown to new social experiences. Although in most cases COVID-19 results in mild illness, it has drawn global attention due to the extremely contagious nature of SARS-CoV-2. Governments and healthcare professionals, along with people and society as a whole, have taken any measures to break the chain of transition and flatten the epidemic curve. In this study, we used multiple data sources, i.e., PubMed and ArXiv, and built several machine learning models to characterize the landscape of current COVID-19 research by identifying the latent topics and analyzing the temporal evolution of the extracted research themes, publications similarity, and sentiments, within the time-frame of January- May 2020. Our findings confirm the types of research available in PubMed and ArXiv differ significantly, with the former exhibiting greater diversity in terms of COVID-19 related issues and the latter focusing more on intelligent systems/tools to predict/diagnose COVID-19. The special attention of the research community to the high-risk groups and people with complications was also confirmed."
Meta-learning for Few-shot Natural Language Processing: A Survey,"Few-shot natural language processing (NLP) refers to NLP tasks that are accompanied with merely a handful of labeled examples. This is a real-world challenge that an AI system must learn to handle. Usually we rely on collecting more auxiliary information or developing a more efficient learning algorithm. However, the general gradient-based optimization in high capacity models, if training from scratch, requires many parameter-updating steps over a large number of labeled examples to perform well (Snell et al., 2017). If the target task itself cannot provide more information, how about collecting more tasks equipped with rich annotations to help the model learning? The goal of meta-learning is to train a model on a variety of tasks with rich annotations, such that it can solve a new task using only a few labeled samples. The key idea is to train the model's initial parameters such that the model has maximal performance on a new task after the parameters have been updated through zero or a couple of gradient steps. There are already some surveys for meta-learning, such as (Vilalta and Drissi, 2002; Vanschoren, 2018; Hospedales et al., 2020). Nevertheless, this paper focuses on NLP domain, especially few-shot applications. We try to provide clearer definitions, progress summary and some common datasets of applying meta-learning to few-shot NLP."
A Systematic Review of Natural Language Processing for Knowledge Management in Healthcare,"Driven by the visions of Data Science, recent years have seen a paradigm shift in Natural Language Processing (NLP). NLP has set the milestone in text processing and proved to be the preferred choice for researchers in the healthcare domain. The objective of this paper is to identify the potential of NLP, especially, how NLP is used to support the knowledge management process in the healthcare domain, making data a critical and trusted component in improving the health outcomes. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art NLP research with a particular focus on how knowledge is created, captured, shared, and applied in the healthcare domain. Our findings suggest, first, the techniques of NLP those supporting knowledge management extraction and knowledge capture processes in healthcare. Second, we propose a conceptual model for the knowledge extraction process through NLP. Finally, we discuss a set of issues, challenges, and proposed future research areas."
Targeting the Benchmark: On Methodology in Current Natural Language Processing Research,"It has become a common pattern in our field: One group introduces a language task, exemplified by a dataset, which they argue is challenging enough to serve as a benchmark. They also provide a baseline model for it, which then soon is improved upon by other groups. Often, research efforts then move on, and the pattern repeats itself. What is typically left implicit is the argumentation for why this constitutes progress, and progress towards what. In this paper, we try to step back for a moment from this pattern and work out possible argumentations and their parts."
A Survey on Transfer Learning in Natural Language Processing,"Deep learning models usually require a huge amount of data. However, these large datasets are not always attainable. This is common in many challenging NLP tasks. Consider Neural Machine Translation, for instance, where curating such large datasets may not be possible specially for low resource languages. Another limitation of deep learning models is the demand for huge computing resources. These obstacles motivate research to question the possibility of knowledge transfer using large trained models. The demand for transfer learning is increasing as many large models are emerging. In this survey, we feature the recent transfer learning advances in the field of NLP. We also provide a taxonomy for categorizing different transfer learning approaches from the literature."
NLPContributions: An Annotation Scheme for Machine Reading of Scholarly Contributions in Natural Language Processing Literature,"We describe an annotation initiative to capture the scholarly contributions in natural language processing (NLP) articles, particularly, for the articles that discuss machine learning (ML) approaches for various information extraction tasks. We develop the annotation task based on a pilot annotation exercise on 50 NLP-ML scholarly articles presenting contributions to five information extraction tasks 1. machine translation, 2. named entity recognition, 3. question answering, 4. relation classification, and 5. text classification. In this article, we describe the outcomes of this pilot annotation phase. Through the exercise we have obtained an annotation methodology; and found ten core information units that reflect the contribution of the NLP-ML scholarly investigations. The resulting annotation scheme we developed based on these information units is called NLPContributions.  The overarching goal of our endeavor is four-fold: 1) to find a systematic set of patterns of subject-predicate-object statements for the semantic structuring of scholarly contributions that are more or less generically applicable for NLP-ML research articles; 2) to apply the discovered patterns in the creation of a larger annotated dataset for training machine readers of research contributions; 3) to ingest the dataset into the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG) infrastructure as a showcase for creating user-friendly state-of-the-art overviews; 4) to integrate the machine readers into the ORKG to assist users in the manual curation of their respective article contributions. We envision that the NLPContributions methodology engenders a wider discussion on the topic toward its further refinement and development. Our pilot annotated dataset of 50 NLP-ML scholarly articles according to the NLPContributions scheme is openly available to the research community at https://doi.org/10.25835/0019761."
Comparing Natural Language Processing Techniques for Alzheimer's Dementia Prediction in Spontaneous Speech,"Alzheimer's Dementia (AD) is an incurable, debilitating, and progressive neurodegenerative condition that affects cognitive function. Early diagnosis is important as therapeutics can delay progression and give those diagnosed vital time. Developing models that analyse spontaneous speech could eventually provide an efficient diagnostic modality for earlier diagnosis of AD. The Alzheimer's Dementia Recognition through Spontaneous Speech task offers acoustically pre-processed and balanced datasets for the classification and prediction of AD and associated phenotypes through the modelling of spontaneous speech. We exclusively analyse the supplied textual transcripts of the spontaneous speech dataset, building and comparing performance across numerous models for the classification of AD vs controls and the prediction of Mental Mini State Exam scores. We rigorously train and evaluate Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT), and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) alongside deep learning Transformer based models. We find our top performing models to be a simple Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectoriser as input into a SVM model and a pre-trained Transformer based model `DistilBERT' when used as an embedding layer into simple linear models. We demonstrate test set scores of 0.81-0.82 across classification metrics and a RMSE of 4.58."
NAS-Bench-NLP: Neural Architecture Search Benchmark for Natural Language Processing,"Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is a promising and rapidly evolving research area. Training a large number of neural networks requires an exceptional amount of computational power, which makes NAS unreachable for those researchers who have limited or no access to high-performance clusters and supercomputers. A few benchmarks with precomputed neural architectures performances have been recently introduced to overcome this problem and ensure more reproducible experiments. However, these benchmarks are only for the computer vision domain and, thus, are built from the image datasets and convolution-derived architectures. In this work, we step outside the computer vision domain by leveraging the language modeling task, which is the core of natural language processing (NLP). Our main contribution is as follows: we have provided search space of recurrent neural networks on the text datasets and trained 14k architectures within it; we have conducted both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation of the trained models using datasets for semantic relatedness and language understanding evaluation; finally, we have tested several NAS algorithms to demonstrate how the precomputed results can be utilized. We believe that our results have high potential of usage for both NAS and NLP communities."
PeopleMap: Visualization Tool for Mapping Out Researchers using Natural Language Processing,"Discovering research expertise at institutions can be a difficult task. Manually curated university directories easily become out of date and they often lack the information necessary for understanding a researcher's interests and past work, making it harder to explore the diversity of research at an institution and identify research talents. This results in lost opportunities for both internal and external entities to discover new connections and nurture research collaboration. To solve this problem, we have developed PeopleMap, the first interactive, open-source, web-based tool that visually ""maps out"" researchers based on their research interests and publications by leveraging embeddings generated by natural language processing (NLP) techniques. PeopleMap provides a new engaging way for institutions to summarize their research talents and for people to discover new connections. The platform is developed with ease-of-use and sustainability in mind. Using only researchers' Google Scholar profiles as input, PeopleMap can be readily adopted by any institution using its publicly-accessible repository and detailed documentation."
NLP Scholar: An Interactive Visual Explorer for Natural Language Processing Literature,"As part of the NLP Scholar project, we created a single unified dataset of NLP papers and their meta-information (including citation numbers), by extracting and aligning information from the ACL Anthology and Google Scholar. In this paper, we describe several interconnected interactive visualizations (dashboards) that present various aspects of the data. Clicking on an item within a visualization or entering query terms in the search boxes filters the data in all visualizations in the dashboard. This allows users to search for papers in the area of their interest, published within specific time periods, published by specified authors, etc. The interactive visualizations presented here, and the associated dataset of papers mapped to citations, have additional uses as well including understanding how the field is growing (both overall and across sub-areas), as well as quantifying the impact of different types of papers on subsequent publications."
"Rhetoric, Logic, and Dialectic: Advancing Theory-based Argument Quality Assessment in Natural Language Processing","Though preceding work in computational argument quality (AQ) mostly focuses on assessing overall AQ, researchers agree that writers would benefit from feedback targeting individual dimensions of argumentation theory. However, a large-scale theory-based corpus and corresponding computational models are missing. We fill this gap by conducting an extensive analysis covering three diverse domains of online argumentative writing and presenting GAQCorpus: the first large-scale English multi-domain (community Q&A forums, debate forums, review forums) corpus annotated with theory-based AQ scores. We then propose the first computational approaches to theory-based assessment, which can serve as strong baselines for future work. We demonstrate the feasibility of large-scale AQ annotation, show that exploiting relations between dimensions yields performance improvements, and explore the synergies between theory-based prediction and practical AQ assessment."
HAT: Hardware-Aware Transformers for Efficient Natural Language Processing,"Transformers are ubiquitous in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, but they are difficult to be deployed on hardware due to the intensive computation. To enable low-latency inference on resource-constrained hardware platforms, we propose to design Hardware-Aware Transformers (HAT) with neural architecture search. We first construct a large design space with \textit{arbitrary encoder-decoder attention} and \textit{heterogeneous layers}. Then we train a \textit{SuperTransformer} that covers all candidates in the design space, and efficiently produces many \textit{SubTransformers} with weight sharing. Finally, we perform an evolutionary search with a hardware latency constraint to find a specialized \textit{SubTransformer} dedicated to run fast on the target hardware. Extensive experiments on four machine translation tasks demonstrate that HAT can discover efficient models for different hardware (CPU, GPU, IoT device). When running WMT'14 translation task on Raspberry Pi-4, HAT can achieve \textbf{3}\times speedup, \textbf{3.7}\times smaller size over baseline Transformer; \textbf{2.7}\times speedup, \textbf{3.6}\times smaller size over Evolved Transformer with \textbf{12,041}\times less search cost and no performance loss. HAT code is https://github.com/mit-han-lab/hardware-aware-transformers.git"
COVID-Twitter-BERT: A Natural Language Processing Model to Analyse COVID-19 Content on Twitter,"In this work, we release COVID-Twitter-BERT (CT-BERT), a transformer-based model, pretrained on a large corpus of Twitter messages on the topic of COVID-19. Our model shows a 10-30% marginal improvement compared to its base model, BERT-Large, on five different classification datasets. The largest improvements are on the target domain. Pretrained transformer models, such as CT-BERT, are trained on a specific target domain and can be used for a wide variety of natural language processing tasks, including classification, question-answering and chatbots. CT-BERT is optimised to be used on COVID-19 content, in particular social media posts from Twitter."
Quantum Natural Language Processing on Near-Term Quantum Computers,"In this work, we describe a full-stack pipeline for natural language processing on near-term quantum computers, aka QNLP. The language-modelling framework we employ is that of compositional distributional semantics (DisCoCat), which extends and complements the compositional structure of pregroup grammars. Within this model, the grammatical reduction of a sentence is interpreted as a diagram, encoding a specific interaction of words according to the grammar. It is this interaction which, together with a specific choice of word embedding, realises the meaning (or ""semantics"") of a sentence. Building on the formal quantum-like nature of such interactions, we present a method for mapping DisCoCat diagrams to quantum circuits. Our methodology is compatible both with NISQ devices and with established Quantum Machine Learning techniques, paving the way to near-term applications of quantum technology to natural language processing."
Gender Gap in Natural Language Processing Research: Disparities in Authorship and Citations,"Disparities in authorship and citations across gender can have substantial adverse consequences not just on the disadvantaged genders, but also on the field of study as a whole. Measuring gender gaps is a crucial step towards addressing them. In this work, we examine female first author percentages and the citations to their papers in Natural Language Processing (1965 to 2019). We determine aggregate-level statistics using an existing manually curated author--gender list as well as first names strongly associated with a gender. We find that only about 29% of first authors are female and only about 25% of last authors are female. Notably, this percentage has not improved since the mid 2000s. We also show that, on average, female first authors are cited less than male first authors, even when controlling for experience and area of research. Finally, we discuss the ethical considerations involved in automatic demographic analysis."
Examining Citations of Natural Language Processing Literature,"We extracted information from the ACL Anthology (AA) and Google Scholar (GS) to examine trends in citations of NLP papers. We explore questions such as: how well cited are papers of different types (journal articles, conference papers, demo papers, etc.)? how well cited are papers from different areas of within NLP? etc. Notably, we show that only about 56\% of the papers in AA are cited ten or more times. CL Journal has the most cited papers, but its citation dominance has lessened in recent years. On average, long papers get almost three times as many citations as short papers; and papers on sentiment classification, anaphora resolution, and entity recognition have the highest median citations. The analyses presented here, and the associated dataset of NLP papers mapped to citations, have a number of uses including: understanding how the field is growing and quantifying the impact of different types of papers."
Predicting Performance for Natural Language Processing Tasks,"Given the complexity of combinations of tasks, languages, and domains in natural language processing (NLP) research, it is computationally prohibitive to exhaustively test newly proposed models on each possible experimental setting. In this work, we attempt to explore the possibility of gaining plausible judgments of how well an NLP model can perform under an experimental setting, without actually training or testing the model. To do so, we build regression models to predict the evaluation score of an NLP experiment given the experimental settings as input. Experimenting on 9 different NLP tasks, we find that our predictors can produce meaningful predictions over unseen languages and different modeling architectures, outperforming reasonable baselines as well as human experts. Going further, we outline how our predictor can be used to find a small subset of representative experiments that should be run in order to obtain plausible predictions for all other experimental settings."
Revisiting Pre-Trained Models for Chinese Natural Language Processing,"Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) has shown marvelous improvements across various NLP tasks, and consecutive variants have been proposed to further improve the performance of the pre-trained language models. In this paper, we target on revisiting Chinese pre-trained language models to examine their effectiveness in a non-English language and release the Chinese pre-trained language model series to the community. We also propose a simple but effective model called MacBERT, which improves upon RoBERTa in several ways, especially the masking strategy that adopts MLM as correction (Mac). We carried out extensive experiments on eight Chinese NLP tasks to revisit the existing pre-trained language models as well as the proposed MacBERT. Experimental results show that MacBERT could achieve state-of-the-art performances on many NLP tasks, and we also ablate details with several findings that may help future research. Resources available: https://github.com/ymcui/MacBERT"
A Natural Language Processing Pipeline of Chinese Free-text Radiology Reports for Liver Cancer Diagnosis,"Despite the rapid development of natural language processing (NLP) implementation in electronic medical records (EMRs), Chinese EMRs processing remains challenging due to the limited corpus and specific grammatical characteristics, especially for radiology reports. In this study, we designed an NLP pipeline for the direct extraction of clinically relevant features from Chinese radiology reports, which is the first key step in computer-aided radiologic diagnosis. The pipeline was comprised of named entity recognition, synonyms normalization, and relationship extraction to finally derive the radiological features composed of one or more terms. In named entity recognition, we incorporated lexicon into deep learning model bidirectional long short-term memory-conditional random field (BiLSTM-CRF), and the model finally achieved an F1 score of 93.00%. With the extracted radiological features, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and machine learning methods (support vector machine, random forest, decision tree, and logistic regression) were used to build the classifiers for liver cancer prediction. For liver cancer diagnosis, random forest had the highest predictive performance in liver cancer diagnosis (F1 score 86.97%, precision 87.71%, and recall 86.25%). This work was a comprehensive NLP study focusing on Chinese radiology reports and the application of NLP in cancer risk prediction. The proposed NLP pipeline for the radiological feature extraction could be easily implemented in other kinds of Chinese clinical texts and other disease predictive tasks."
Towards an evolutionary-based approach for natural language processing,"Tasks related to Natural Language Processing (NLP) have recently been the focus of a large research endeavor by the machine learning community. The increased interest in this area is mainly due to the success of deep learning methods. Genetic Programming (GP), however, was not under the spotlight with respect to NLP tasks. Here, we propose a first proof-of-concept that combines GP with the well established NLP tool word2vec for the next word prediction task. The main idea is that, once words have been moved into a vector space, traditional GP operators can successfully work on vectors, thus producing meaningful words as the output. To assess the suitability of this approach, we perform an experimental evaluation on a set of existing newspaper headlines. Individuals resulting from this (pre-)training phase can be employed as the initial population in other NLP tasks, like sentence generation, which will be the focus of future investigations, possibly employing adversarial co-evolutionary approaches."
Unnatural Language Processing: Bridging the Gap Between Synthetic and Natural Language Data,"Large, human-annotated datasets are central to the development of natural language processing models. Collecting these datasets can be the most challenging part of the development process. We address this problem by introducing a general purpose technique for ``simulation-to-real'' transfer in language understanding problems with a delimited set of target behaviors, making it possible to develop models that can interpret natural utterances without natural training data. We begin with a synthetic data generation procedure, and train a model that can accurately interpret utterances produced by the data generator. To generalize to natural utterances, we automatically find projections of natural language utterances onto the support of the synthetic language, using learned sentence embeddings to define a distance metric. With only synthetic training data, our approach matches or outperforms state-of-the-art models trained on natural language data in several domains. These results suggest that simulation-to-real transfer is a practical framework for developing NLP applications, and that improved models for transfer might provide wide-ranging improvements in downstream tasks."
Introducing a framework to assess newly created questions with Natural Language Processing,"Statistical models such as those derived from Item Response Theory (IRT) enable the assessment of students on a specific subject, which can be useful for several purposes (e.g., learning path customization, drop-out prediction). However, the questions have to be assessed as well and, although it is possible to estimate with IRT the characteristics of questions that have already been answered by several students, this technique cannot be used on newly generated questions. In this paper, we propose a framework to train and evaluate models for estimating the difficulty and discrimination of newly created Multiple Choice Questions by extracting meaningful features from the text of the question and of the possible choices. We implement one model using this framework and test it on a real-world dataset provided by CloudAcademy, showing that it outperforms previously proposed models, reducing by 6.7% the RMSE for difficulty estimation and by 10.8% the RMSE for discrimination estimation. We also present the results of an ablation study performed to support our features choice and to show the effects of different characteristics of the questions' text on difficulty and discrimination."
Natural language processing for achieving sustainable development: the case of neural labelling to enhance community profiling,"In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in the application of Artificial Intelligence - and especially Machine Learning - to the field of Sustainable Development (SD). However, until now, NLP has not been applied in this context. In this research paper, we show the high potential of NLP applications to enhance the sustainability of projects. In particular, we focus on the case of community profiling in developing countries, where, in contrast to the developed world, a notable data gap exists. In this context, NLP could help to address the cost and time barrier of structuring qualitative data that prohibits its widespread use and associated benefits. We propose the new task of Automatic UPV classification, which is an extreme multi-class multi-label classification problem. We release Stories2Insights, an expert-annotated dataset, provide a detailed corpus analysis, and implement a number of strong neural baselines to address the task. Experimental results show that the problem is challenging, and leave plenty of room for future research at the intersection of NLP and SD."
What are We Depressed about When We Talk about COVID19: Mental Health Analysis on Tweets Using Natural Language Processing,"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) recently has affected human life to a great extent. Besides direct physical and economic threats, the pandemic also indirectly impact people's mental health conditions, which can be overwhelming but difficult to measure. The problem may come from various reasons such as unemployment status, stay-at-home policy, fear for the virus, and so forth. In this work, we focus on applying natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze tweets in terms of mental health. We trained deep models that classify each tweet into the following emotions: anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise and trust. We build the EmoCT (Emotion-Covid19-Tweet) dataset for the training purpose by manually labeling 1,000 English tweets. Furthermore, we propose and compare two methods to find out the reasons that are causing sadness and fear."
Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning for Medical Adverse Event Detection from Free-Text Medical Narratives: A Case Study of Detecting Total Hip Replacement Dislocation,"Accurate and timely detection of medical adverse events (AEs) from free-text medical narratives is challenging. Natural language processing (NLP) with deep learning has already shown great potential for analyzing free-text data, but its application for medical AE detection has been limited. In this study we proposed deep learning based NLP (DL-NLP) models for efficient and accurate hip dislocation AE detection following total hip replacement from standard (radiology notes) and non-standard (follow-up telephone notes) free-text medical narratives. We benchmarked these proposed models with a wide variety of traditional machine learning based NLP (ML-NLP) models, and also assessed the accuracy of International Classification of Diseases (ICD) and Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes in capturing these hip dislocation AEs in a multi-center orthopaedic registry. All DL-NLP models out-performed all of the ML-NLP models, with a convolutional neural network (CNN) model achieving the best overall performance (Kappa = 0.97 for radiology notes, and Kappa = 1.00 for follow-up telephone notes). On the other hand, the ICD/CPT codes of the patients who sustained a hip dislocation AE were only 75.24% accurate, showing the potential of the proposed model to be used in largescale orthopaedic registries for accurate and efficient hip dislocation AE detection to improve the quality of care and patient outcome."
A hybrid classical-quantum workflow for natural language processing,"Natural language processing (NLP) problems are ubiquitous in classical computing, where they often require significant computational resources to infer sentence meanings. With the appearance of quantum computing hardware and simulators, it is worth developing methods to examine such problems on these platforms. In this manuscript we demonstrate the use of quantum computing models to perform NLP tasks, where we represent corpus meanings, and perform comparisons between sentences of a given structure. We develop a hybrid workflow for representing small and large scale corpus data sets to be encoded, processed, and decoded using a quantum circuit model. In addition, we provide our results showing the efficacy of the method, and release our developed toolkit as an open software suite."
Improving Emergency Department ESI Acuity Assignment Using Machine Learning and Clinical Natural Language Processing,"Effective triage is critical to mitigating the effect of increased volume by accurately determining patient acuity, need for resources, and establishing effective acuity-based patient prioritization. The purpose of this retrospective study was to determine whether historical EHR data can be extracted and synthesized with clinical natural language processing (C-NLP) and the latest ML algorithms (KATE) to produce highly accurate ESI predictive models. An ML model (KATE) for the triage process was developed using 166,175 patient encounters from two participating hospitals. The model was then tested against a gold set that was derived from a random sample of triage encounters at the study sites and correct acuity assignments were recorded by study clinicians using the Emergency Severity Index (ESI) standard as a guide. At the two study sites, KATE predicted accurate ESI acuity assignments 75.9% of the time, compared to nurses (59.8%) and average individual study clinicians (75.3%). KATE accuracy was 26.9% higher than the average nurse accuracy (p-value < 0.0001). On the boundary between ESI 2 and ESI 3 acuity assignments, which relates to the risk of decompensation, KATE was 93.2% higher with 80% accuracy, compared to triage nurses with 41.4% accuracy (p-value < 0.0001). KATE provides a triage acuity assignment substantially more accurate than the triage nurses in this study sample. KATE operates independently of contextual factors, unaffected by the external pressures that can cause under triage and may mitigate the racial and social biases that can negatively affect the accuracy of triage assignment. Future research should focus on the impact of KATE providing feedback to triage nurses in real time, KATEs impact on mortality and morbidity, ED throughput, resource optimization, and nursing outcomes."
Calibrating Structured Output Predictors for Natural Language Processing,"We address the problem of calibrating prediction confidence for output entities of interest in natural language processing (NLP) applications. It is important that NLP applications such as named entity recognition and question answering produce calibrated confidence scores for their predictions, especially if the system is to be deployed in a safety-critical domain such as healthcare. However, the output space of such structured prediction models is often too large to adapt binary or multi-class calibration methods directly. In this study, we propose a general calibration scheme for output entities of interest in neural-network based structured prediction models. Our proposed method can be used with any binary class calibration scheme and a neural network model. Additionally, we show that our calibration method can also be used as an uncertainty-aware, entity-specific decoding step to improve the performance of the underlying model at no additional training cost or data requirements. We show that our method outperforms current calibration techniques for named-entity-recognition, part-of-speech and question answering. We also improve our model's performance from our decoding step across several tasks and benchmark datasets. Our method improves the calibration and model performance on out-of-domain test scenarios as well."
Natural language processing for word sense disambiguation and information extraction,"This research work deals with Natural Language Processing (NLP) and extraction of essential information in an explicit form. The most common among the information management strategies is Document Retrieval (DR) and Information Filtering. DR systems may work as combine harvesters, which bring back useful material from the vast fields of raw material. With large amount of potentially useful information in hand, an Information Extraction (IE) system can then transform the raw material by refining and reducing it to a germ of original text. A Document Retrieval system collects the relevant documents carrying the required information, from the repository of texts. An IE system then transforms them into information that is more readily digested and analyzed. It isolates relevant text fragments, extracts relevant information from the fragments, and then arranges together the targeted information in a coherent framework. The thesis presents a new approach for Word Sense Disambiguation using thesaurus. The illustrative examples supports the effectiveness of this approach for speedy and effective disambiguation. A Document Retrieval method, based on Fuzzy Logic has been described and its application is illustrated. A question-answering system describes the operation of information extraction from the retrieved text documents. The process of information extraction for answering a query is considerably simplified by using a Structured Description Language (SDL) which is based on cardinals of queries in the form of who, what, when, where and why. The thesis concludes with the presentation of a novel strategy based on Dempster-Shafer theory of evidential reasoning, for document retrieval and information extraction. This strategy permits relaxation of many limitations, which are inherent in Bayesian probabilistic approach."
Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Requirements Engineering: A Systematic Mapping Study,"Natural language processing supported requirements engineering is an area of research and development that seeks to apply NLP techniques, tools and resources to a variety of requirements documents or artifacts to support a range of linguistic analysis tasks performed at various RE phases. Such tasks include detecting language issues, identifying key domain concepts and establishing traceability links between requirements. This article surveys the landscape of NLP4RE research to understand the state of the art and identify open problems. The systematic mapping study approach is used to conduct this survey, which identified 404 relevant primary studies and reviewed them according to five research questions, cutting across five aspects of NLP4RE research, concerning the state of the literature, the state of empirical research, the research focus, the state of the practice, and the NLP technologies used. Results: 1) NLP4RE is an active and thriving research area in RE that has amassed a large number of publications and attracted widespread attention from diverse communities; 2) most NLP4RE studies are solution proposals having only been evaluated using a laboratory experiment or an example application; 3) most studies have focused on the analysis phase, with detection as their central linguistic analysis task and requirements specification as their commonly processed document type; 4) 130 new tools have been proposed to support a range of linguistic analysis tasks, but there is little evidence of adoption in the long term, although some industrial applications have been published; 5) 140 NLP techniques, 66 NLP tools and 25 NLP resources are extracted from the selected studies."
"Multi-Class classification of vulnerabilities in Smart Contracts using AWD-LSTM, with pre-trained encoder inspired from natural language processing","Vulnerability detection and safety of smart contracts are of paramount importance because of their immutable nature. Symbolic tools like OYENTE and MAIAN are typically used for vulnerability prediction in smart contracts. As these tools are computationally expensive, they are typically used to detect vulnerabilities until some predefined invocation depth. These tools require more search time as the invocation depth increases. Since the number of smart contracts is increasing exponentially, it is difficult to analyze the contracts using these traditional tools. Recently a machine learning technique called Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) has been used for binary classification, i.e., to predict whether a smart contract is vulnerable or not. This technique requires nearly constant search time as the invocation depth increases. In the present article, we have shown a multi-class classification, where we classify a smart contract in Suicidal, Prodigal, Greedy, or Normal categories. We used Average Stochastic Gradient Descent Weight-Dropped LSTM (AWD-LSTM), which is a variant of LSTM, to perform classification. We reduced the class imbalance (a large number of normal contracts as compared to other categories) by considering only the distinct opcode combination for normal contracts. We have achieved a weighted average Fbeta score of 90.0%. Hence, such techniques can be used to analyze a large number of smart contracts and help to improve the security of these contracts."
Pre-trained Models for Natural Language Processing: A Survey,"Recently, the emergence of pre-trained models (PTMs) has brought natural language processing (NLP) to a new era. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of PTMs for NLP. We first briefly introduce language representation learning and its research progress. Then we systematically categorize existing PTMs based on a taxonomy with four perspectives. Next, we describe how to adapt the knowledge of PTMs to the downstream tasks. Finally, we outline some potential directions of PTMs for future research. This survey is purposed to be a hands-on guide for understanding, using, and developing PTMs for various NLP tasks."
Multi-label natural language processing to identify diagnosis and procedure codes from MIMIC-III inpatient notes,"In the United States, 25% or greater than 200 billion dollars of hospital spending accounts for administrative costs that involve services for medical coding and billing. With the increasing number of patient records, manual assignment of the codes performed is overwhelming, time-consuming and error-prone, causing billing errors. Natural language processing can automate the extraction of codes/labels from unstructured clinical notes, which can aid human coders to save time, increase productivity, and verify medical coding errors. Our objective is to identify appropriate diagnosis and procedure codes from clinical notes by performing multi-label classification. We used de-identified data of critical care patients from the MIMIC-III database and subset the data to select the ten (top-10) and fifty (top-50) most common diagnoses and procedures, which covers 47.45% and 74.12% of all admissions respectively. We implemented state-of-the-art Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) to fine-tune the language model on 80% of the data and validated on the remaining 20%. The model achieved an overall accuracy of 87.08%, an F1 score of 85.82%, and an AUC of 91.76% for top-10 codes. For the top-50 codes, our model achieved an overall accuracy of 93.76%, an F1 score of 92.24%, and AUC of 91%. When compared to previously published research, our model outperforms in predicting codes from the clinical text. We discuss approaches to generalize the knowledge discovery process of our MIMIC-BERT to other clinical notes. This can help human coders to save time, prevent backlogs, and additional costs due to coding errors."
Stanza: A Python Natural Language Processing Toolkit for Many Human Languages,"We introduce Stanza, an open-source Python natural language processing toolkit supporting 66 human languages. Compared to existing widely used toolkits, Stanza features a language-agnostic fully neural pipeline for text analysis, including tokenization, multi-word token expansion, lemmatization, part-of-speech and morphological feature tagging, dependency parsing, and named entity recognition. We have trained Stanza on a total of 112 datasets, including the Universal Dependencies treebanks and other multilingual corpora, and show that the same neural architecture generalizes well and achieves competitive performance on all languages tested. Additionally, Stanza includes a native Python interface to the widely used Java Stanford CoreNLP software, which further extends its functionality to cover other tasks such as coreference resolution and relation extraction. Source code, documentation, and pretrained models for 66 languages are available at https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanza."
Med7: a transferable clinical natural language processing model for electronic health records,"The field of clinical natural language processing has been advanced significantly since the introduction of deep learning models. The self-supervised representation learning and the transfer learning paradigm became the methods of choice in many natural language processing application, in particular in the settings with the dearth of high quality manually annotated data. Electronic health record systems are ubiquitous and the majority of patients' data are now being collected electronically and in particular in the form of free text. Identification of medical concepts and information extraction is a challenging task, yet important ingredient for parsing unstructured data into structured and tabulated format for downstream analytical tasks. In this work we introduced a named-entity recognition model for clinical natural language processing. The model is trained to recognise seven categories: drug names, route, frequency, dosage, strength, form, duration. The model was first self-supervisedly pre-trained by predicting the next word, using a collection of 2 million free-text patients' records from MIMIC-III corpora and then fine-tuned on the named-entity recognition task. The model achieved a lenient (strict) micro-averaged F1 score of 0.957 (0.893) across all seven categories. Additionally, we evaluated the transferability of the developed model using the data from the Intensive Care Unit in the US to secondary care mental health records (CRIS) in the UK. A direct application of the trained NER model to CRIS data resulted in reduced performance of F1=0.762, however after fine-tuning on a small sample from CRIS, the model achieved a reasonable performance of F1=0.944. This demonstrated that despite a close similarity between the data sets and the NER tasks, it is essential to fine-tune on the target domain data in order to achieve more accurate results."
Natural Language Processing Advancements By Deep Learning: A Survey,"Natural Language Processing (NLP) helps empower intelligent machines by enhancing a better understanding of the human language for linguistic-based human-computer communication. Recent developments in computational power and the advent of large amounts of linguistic data have heightened the need and demand for automating semantic analysis using data-driven approaches. The utilization of data-driven strategies is pervasive now due to the significant improvements demonstrated through the usage of deep learning methods in areas such as Computer Vision, Automatic Speech Recognition, and in particular, NLP. This survey categorizes and addresses the different aspects and applications of NLP that have benefited from deep learning. It covers core NLP tasks and applications and describes how deep learning methods and models advance these areas. We further analyze and compare different approaches and state-of-the-art models."
TextBrewer: An Open-Source Knowledge Distillation Toolkit for Natural Language Processing,"In this paper, we introduce TextBrewer, an open-source knowledge distillation toolkit designed for natural language processing. It works with different neural network models and supports various kinds of supervised learning tasks, such as text classification, reading comprehension, sequence labeling. TextBrewer provides a simple and uniform workflow that enables quick setting up of distillation experiments with highly flexible configurations. It offers a set of predefined distillation methods and can be extended with custom code. As a case study, we use TextBrewer to distill BERT on several typical NLP tasks. With simple configurations, we achieve results that are comparable with or even higher than the public distilled BERT models with similar numbers of parameters. Our toolkit is available through: http://textbrewer.hfl-rc.com"
Sketching Transformed Matrices with Applications to Natural Language Processing,"Suppose we are given a large matrix A=(a_{i,j}) that cannot be stored in memory but is in a disk or is presented in a data stream. However, we need to compute a matrix decomposition of the entry-wisely transformed matrix, f(A):=(f(a_{i,j})) for some function f. Is it possible to do it in a space efficient way? Many machine learning applications indeed need to deal with such large transformed matrices, for example word embedding method in NLP needs to work with the pointwise mutual information (PMI) matrix, while the entrywise transformation makes it difficult to apply known linear algebraic tools. Existing approaches for this problem either need to store the whole matrix and perform the entry-wise transformation afterwards, which is space consuming or infeasible, or need to redesign the learning method, which is application specific and requires substantial remodeling.  In this paper, we first propose a space-efficient sketching algorithm for computing the product of a given small matrix with the transformed matrix. It works for a general family of transformations with provable small error bounds and thus can be used as a primitive in downstream learning tasks. We then apply this primitive to a concrete application: low-rank approximation. We show that our approach obtains small error and is efficient in both space and time. We complement our theoretical results with experiments on synthetic and real data."
Exploring Chemical Space using Natural Language Processing Methodologies for Drug Discovery,Text-based representations of chemicals and proteins can be thought of as unstructured languages codified by humans to describe domain-specific knowledge. Advances in natural language processing (NLP) methodologies in the processing of spoken languages accelerated the application of NLP to elucidate hidden knowledge in textual representations of these biochemical entities and then use it to construct models to predict molecular properties or to design novel molecules. This review outlines the impact made by these advances on drug discovery and aims to further the dialogue between medicinal chemists and computer scientists.
HULK: An Energy Efficiency Benchmark Platform for Responsible Natural Language Processing,"Computation-intensive pretrained models have been taking the lead of many natural language processing benchmarks such as GLUE. However, energy efficiency in the process of model training and inference becomes a critical bottleneck. We introduce HULK, a multi-task energy efficiency benchmarking platform for responsible natural language processing. With HULK, we compare pretrained models' energy efficiency from the perspectives of time and cost. Baseline benchmarking results are provided for further analysis. The fine-tuning efficiency of different pretrained models can differ a lot among different tasks and fewer parameter number does not necessarily imply better efficiency. We analyzed such phenomenon and demonstrate the method of comparing the multi-task efficiency of pretrained models. Our platform is available at https://sites.engineering.ucsb.edu/~xiyou/hulk/."
Lightweight Convolutional Representations for On-Device Natural Language Processing,"The increasing computational and memory complexities of deep neural networks have made it difficult to deploy them on low-resource electronic devices (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, wearables). Practitioners have developed numerous model compression methods to address these concerns, but few have condensed input representations themselves. In this work, we propose a fast, accurate, and lightweight convolutional representation that can be swapped into any neural model and compressed significantly (up to 32x) with a negligible reduction in performance. In addition, we show gains over recurrent representations when considering resource-centric metrics (e.g., model file size, latency, memory usage) on a Samsung Galaxy S9."
From Natural Language Instructions to Complex Processes: Issues in Chaining Trigger Action Rules,"Automation services for complex business processes usually require a high level of information technology literacy. There is a strong demand for a smartly assisted process automation (IPA: intelligent process automation) service that enables even general users to easily use advanced automation. A natural language interface for such automation is expected as an elemental technology for the IPA realization. The workflow targeted by IPA is generally composed of a combination of multiple tasks. However, semantic parsing, one of the natural language processing methods, for such complex workflows has not yet been fully studied. The reasons are that (1) the formal expression and grammar of the workflow required for semantic analysis have not been sufficiently examined and (2) the dataset of the workflow formal expression with its corresponding natural language description required for learning workflow semantics did not exist. This paper defines a new grammar for complex workflows with chaining machine-executable meaning representations for semantic parsing. The representations are at a high abstraction level. Additionally, an approach to creating datasets is proposed based on this grammar."
Natural language processing of MIMIC-III clinical notes for identifying diagnosis and procedures with neural networks,"Coding diagnosis and procedures in medical records is a crucial process in the healthcare industry, which includes the creation of accurate billings, receiving reimbursements from payers, and creating standardized patient care records. In the United States, Billing and Insurance related activities cost around $471 billion in 2012 which constitutes about 25% of all the U.S hospital spending. In this paper, we report the performance of a natural language processing model that can map clinical notes to medical codes, and predict final diagnosis from unstructured entries of history of present illness, symptoms at the time of admission, etc. Previous studies have demonstrated that deep learning models perform better at such mapping when compared to conventional machine learning models. Therefore, we employed state-of-the-art deep learning method, ULMFiT on the largest emergency department clinical notes dataset MIMIC III which has 1.2M clinical notes to select for the top-10 and top-50 diagnosis and procedure codes. Our models were able to predict the top-10 diagnoses and procedures with 80.3% and 80.5% accuracy, whereas the top-50 ICD-9 codes of diagnosis and procedures are predicted with 70.7% and 63.9% accuracy. Prediction of diagnosis and procedures from unstructured clinical notes benefit human coders to save time, eliminate errors and minimize costs. With promising scores from our present model, the next step would be to deploy this on a small-scale real-world scenario and compare it with human coders as the gold standard. We believe that further research of this approach can create highly accurate predictions that can ease the workflow in a clinical setting."
Predictive Biases in Natural Language Processing Models: A Conceptual Framework and Overview,"An increasing number of works in natural language processing have addressed the effect of bias on the predicted outcomes, introducing mitigation techniques that act on different parts of the standard NLP pipeline (data and models). However, these works have been conducted in isolation, without a unifying framework to organize efforts within the field. This leads to repetitive approaches, and puts an undue focus on the effects of bias, rather than on their origins. Research focused on bias symptoms rather than the underlying origins could limit the development of effective countermeasures. In this paper, we propose a unifying conceptualization: the predictive bias framework for NLP. We summarize the NLP literature and propose a general mathematical definition of predictive bias in NLP along with a conceptual framework, differentiating four main origins of biases: label bias, selection bias, model overamplification, and semantic bias. We discuss how past work has countered each bias origin. Our framework serves to guide an introductory overview of predictive bias in NLP, integrating existing work into a single structure and opening avenues for future research."
A Robust Predictive Model for Stock Price Prediction Using Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing,"Prediction of future movement of stock prices has been a subject matter of many research work. There is a gamut of literature of technical analysis of stock prices where the objective is to identify patterns in stock price movements and derive profit from it. Improving the prediction accuracy remains the single most challenge in this area of research. We propose a hybrid approach for stock price movement prediction using machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing. We select the NIFTY 50 index values of the National Stock Exchange of India, and collect its daily price movement over a period of three years (2015 to 2017). Based on the data of 2015 to 2017, we build various predictive models using machine learning, and then use those models to predict the closing value of NIFTY 50 for the period January 2018 till June 2019 with a prediction horizon of one week. For predicting the price movement patterns, we use a number of classification techniques, while for predicting the actual closing price of the stock, various regression models have been used. We also build a Long and Short-Term Memory - based deep learning network for predicting the closing price of the stocks and compare the prediction accuracies of the machine learning models with the LSTM model. We further augment the predictive model by integrating a sentiment analysis module on twitter data to correlate the public sentiment of stock prices with the market sentiment. This has been done using twitter sentiment and previous week closing values to predict stock price movement for the next week. We tested our proposed scheme using a cross validation method based on Self Organizing Fuzzy Neural Networks and found extremely interesting results."
Women in ISIS Propaganda: A Natural Language Processing Analysis of Topics and Emotions in a Comparison with Mainstream Religious Group,"Online propaganda is central to the recruitment strategies of extremist groups and in recent years these efforts have increasingly extended to women. To investigate ISIS' approach to targeting women in their online propaganda and uncover implications for counterterrorism, we rely on text mining and natural language processing (NLP). Specifically, we extract articles published in Dabiq and Rumiyah (ISIS's online English language publications) to identify prominent topics. To identify similarities or differences between these texts and those produced by non-violent religious groups, we extend the analysis to articles from a Catholic forum dedicated to women. We also perform an emotional analysis of both of these resources to better understand the emotional components of propaganda. We rely on Depechemood (a lexical-base emotion analysis method) to detect emotions most likely to be evoked in readers of these materials. The findings indicate that the emotional appeal of ISIS and Catholic materials are similar"
hauWE: Hausa Words Embedding for Natural Language Processing,"Words embedding (distributed word vector representations) have become an essential component of many natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as machine translation, sentiment analysis, word analogy, named entity recognition and word similarity. Despite this, the only work that provides word vectors for Hausa language is that of Bojanowski et al. [1] trained using fastText, consisting of only a few words vectors. This work presents words embedding models using Word2Vec's Continuous Bag of Words (CBoW) and Skip Gram (SG) models. The models, hauWE (Hausa Words Embedding), are bigger and better than the only previous model, making them more useful in NLP tasks. To compare the models, they were used to predict the 10 most similar words to 30 randomly selected Hausa words. hauWE CBoW's 88.7% and hauWE SG's 79.3% prediction accuracy greatly outperformed Bojanowski et al. [1]'s 22.3%."
Using natural language processing to extract health-related causality from Twitter messages,"Twitter messages (tweets) contain various types of information, which include health-related information. Analysis of health-related tweets would help us understand health conditions and concerns encountered in our daily life. In this work, we evaluated an approach to extracting causal relations from tweets using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. We focused on three health-related topics: stress"", ""insomnia"", and ""headache"". We proposed a set of lexico-syntactic patterns based on dependency parser outputs to extract causal information. A large dataset consisting of 24 million tweets were used. The results show that our approach achieved an average precision between 74.59% and 92.27%. Analysis of extracted relations revealed interesting findings about health-related in Twitter."
Inducing brain-relevant bias in natural language processing models,"Progress in natural language processing (NLP) models that estimate representations of word sequences has recently been leveraged to improve the understanding of language processing in the brain. However, these models have not been specifically designed to capture the way the brain represents language meaning. We hypothesize that fine-tuning these models to predict recordings of brain activity of people reading text will lead to representations that encode more brain-activity-relevant language information. We demonstrate that a version of BERT, a recently introduced and powerful language model, can improve the prediction of brain activity after fine-tuning. We show that the relationship between language and brain activity learned by BERT during this fine-tuning transfers across multiple participants. We also show that, for some participants, the fine-tuned representations learned from both magnetoencephalography (MEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are better for predicting fMRI than the representations learned from fMRI alone, indicating that the learned representations capture brain-activity-relevant information that is not simply an artifact of the modality. While changes to language representations help the model predict brain activity, they also do not harm the model's ability to perform downstream NLP tasks. Our findings are notable for research on language understanding in the brain."
Neural Graph Embedding Methods for Natural Language Processing,"Knowledge graphs are structured representations of facts in a graph, where nodes represent entities and edges represent relationships between them. Recent research has resulted in the development of several large KGs. However, all of them tend to be sparse with very few facts per entity. In the first part of the thesis, we propose two solutions to alleviate this problem: (1) KG Canonicalization, i.e., identifying and merging duplicate entities in a KG, (2) Relation Extraction which involves automating the process of extracting semantic relationships between entities from unstructured text. Traditional Neural Networks like CNNs and RNNs are constrained to handle Euclidean data. However, graphs in Natural Language Processing (NLP) are prominent. Recently, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have been proposed to address this shortcoming and have been successfully applied for several problems. In the second part of the thesis, we utilize GCNs for Document Timestamping problem and for learning word embeddings using dependency context of a word instead of sequential context. In this third part of the thesis, we address two limitations of existing GCN models, i.e., (1) The standard neighborhood aggregation scheme puts no constraints on the number of nodes that can influence the representation of a target node. This leads to a noisy representation of hub-nodes which coves almost the entire graph in a few hops. (2) Most of the existing GCN models are limited to handle undirected graphs. However, a more general and pervasive class of graphs are relational graphs where each edge has a label and direction associated with it. Existing approaches to handle such graphs suffer from over-parameterization and are restricted to learning representation of nodes only."
Evolution of transfer learning in natural language processing,"In this paper, we present a study of the recent advancements which have helped bring Transfer Learning to NLP through the use of semi-supervised training. We discuss cutting-edge methods and architectures such as BERT, GPT, ELMo, ULMFit among others. Classically, tasks in natural language processing have been performed through rule-based and statistical methodologies. However, owing to the vast nature of natural languages these methods do not generalise well and failed to learn the nuances of language. Thus machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes and decision trees coupled with traditional models such as Bag-of-Words and N-grams were used to usurp this problem. Eventually, with the advent of advanced recurrent neural network architectures such as the LSTM, we were able to achieve state-of-the-art performance in several natural language processing tasks such as text classification and machine translation. We talk about how Transfer Learning has brought about the well-known ImageNet moment for NLP. Several advanced architectures such as the Transformer and its variants have allowed practitioners to leverage knowledge gained from unrelated task to drastically fasten convergence and provide better performance on the target task. This survey represents an effort at providing a succinct yet complete understanding of the recent advances in natural language processing using deep learning in with a special focus on detailing transfer learning and its potential advantages."
Statically Detecting Vulnerabilities by Processing Programming Languages as Natural Languages,"Web applications continue to be a favorite target for hackers due to a combination of wide adoption and rapid deployment cycles, which often lead to the introduction of high impact vulnerabilities. Static analysis tools are important to search for bugs automatically in the program source code, supporting developers on their removal. However, building these tools requires programming the knowledge on how to discover the vulnerabilities. This paper presents an alternative approach in which tools learn to detect flaws automatically by resorting to artificial intelligence concepts, more concretely to natural language processing. The approach employs a sequence model to learn to characterize vulnerabilities based on an annotated corpus. Afterwards, the model is utilized to discover and identify vulnerabilities in the source code. It was implemented in the DEKANT tool and evaluated experimentally with a large set of PHP applications and WordPress plugins. Overall, we found several hundred vulnerabilities belonging to 12 classes of input validation vulnerabilities, where 62 of them were zero-day."
HuggingFace's Transformers: State-of-the-art Natural Language Processing,"Recent progress in natural language processing has been driven by advances in both model architecture and model pretraining.

Early Prediction of 30-day ICU Re-admissions Using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning,"ICU readmission is associated with longer hospitalization, mortality and adverse outcomes. An early recognition of ICU re-admission can help prevent patients from worse situation and lower treatment cost. As the abundance of Electronics Health Records (EHR), it is popular to design clinical decision tools with machine learning technique manipulating on healthcare large scale data. We designed data-driven predictive models to estimate the risk of ICU readmission. The discharge summary of each hospital admission was carefully represented by natural language processing techniques. Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) was further used to standardize inconsistency of discharge summaries. 5 machine learning classifiers were adopted to construct predictive models. The best configuration yielded a competitive AUC of 0.748. Our work suggests that natural language processing of discharge summaries is capable to send clinicians warning of unplanned 30-day readmission upon discharge."
On Controlled DeEntanglement for Natural Language Processing,"Latest addition to the toolbox of human species is Artificial Intelligence(AI). Thus far, AI has made significant progress in low stake low risk scenarios such as playing Go and we are currently in a transition toward medium stake scenarios such as Visual Dialog. In my thesis, I argue that we need to incorporate controlled de-entanglement as first class object to succeed in this transition. I present mathematical analysis from information theory to show that employing stochasticity leads to controlled de-entanglement of relevant factors of variation at various levels. Based on this, I highlight results from initial experiments that depict efficacy of the proposed framework. I conclude this writeup by a roadmap of experiments that show the applicability of this framework to scalability, flexibility and interpretibility."
Natural Language Processing via LDA Topic Model in Recommendation Systems,"Today, Internet is one of the widest available media worldwide. Recommendation systems are increasingly being used in various applications such as movie recommendation, mobile recommendation, article recommendation and etc. Collaborative Filtering (CF) and Content-Based (CB) are Well-known techniques for building recommendation systems. Topic modeling based on LDA, is a powerful technique for semantic mining and perform topic extraction. In the past few years, many articles have been published based on LDA technique for building recommendation systems. In this paper, we present taxonomy of recommendation systems and applications based on LDA. In addition, we utilize LDA and Gibbs sampling algorithms to evaluate ISWC and WWW conference publications in computer science. Our study suggest that the recommendation systems based on LDA could be effective in building smart recommendation system in online communities."
Analyzing Mass Media influence using natural language processing and time series analysis,"A key question of collective social behavior is related to the influence of Mass Media on public opinion. Different approaches have been developed to address quantitatively this issue, ranging from field experiments to mathematical models. In this work we propose a combination of tools involving natural language processing and time series analysis. We compare selected features of mass media news articles with measurable manifestation of public opinion. We apply our analysis to news articles belonging to the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. We compare variations in polls (as a proxy of public opinion) with changes in the connotation of the news (sentiment) or in the agenda (topics) of a selected group of media outlets. Our results suggest that the sentiment content by itself is not enough to understand the differences in polls, but the combination of topics coverage and sentiment content provides an useful insight of the context in which public opinion varies. The methodology employed in this work is far general and can be easily extended to other topics of interest."
A Quantum Search Decoder for Natural Language Processing,"Probabilistic language models, e.g. those based on an LSTM, often face the problem of finding a high probability prediction from a sequence of random variables over a set of tokens. This is commonly addressed using a form of greedy decoding such as beam search, where a limited number of highest-likelihood paths (the beam width) of the decoder are kept, and at the end the maximum-likelihood path is chosen. In this work, we construct a quantum algorithm to find the globally optimal parse (i.e. for infinite beam width) with high constant success probability. When the input to the decoder is distributed as a power-law with exponent k>0, our algorithm has runtime R^{n f(R,k)}, where R is the alphabet size, n the input length; here f<1/2, and f\rightarrow 0 exponentially fast with increasing k, hence making our algorithm always more than quadratically faster than its classical counterpart. We further modify our procedure to recover a finite beam width variant, which enables an even stronger empirical speedup while still retaining higher accuracy than possible classically. Finally, we apply this quantum beam search decoder to Mozilla's implementation of Baidu's DeepSpeech neural net, which we show to exhibit such a power law word rank frequency."
Towards Realistic Practices In Low-Resource Natural Language Processing: The Development Set,"Development sets are impractical to obtain for real low-resource languages, since using all available data for training is often more effective. However, development sets are widely used in research papers that purport to deal with low-resource natural language processing (NLP). Here, we aim to answer the following questions: Does using a development set for early stopping in the low-resource setting influence results as compared to a more realistic alternative, where the number of training epochs is tuned on development languages? And does it lead to overestimation or underestimation of performance? We repeat multiple experiments from recent work on neural models for low-resource NLP and compare results for models obtained by training with and without development sets. On average over languages, absolute accuracy differs by up to 1.4%. However, for some languages and tasks, differences are as big as 18.0% accuracy. Our results highlight the importance of realistic experimental setups in the publication of low-resource NLP research results."
Language Tasks and Language Games: On Methodology in Current Natural Language Processing Research,"""This paper introduces a new task and a new dataset"", ""we improve the state of the art in X by Y"" -- it is rare to find a current natural language processing paper (or AI paper more generally) that does not contain such statements. What is mostly left implicit, however, is the assumption that this necessarily constitutes progress, and what it constitutes progress towards. Here, we make more precise the normally impressionistically used notions of language task and language game and ask how a research programme built on these might make progress towards the goal of modelling general language competence."
Empirical Evaluation of Multi-task Learning in Deep Neural Networks for Natural Language Processing,"Multi-Task Learning (MTL) aims at boosting the overall performance of each individual task by leveraging useful information contained in multiple related tasks. It has shown great success in natural language processing (NLP). Currently, a number of MLT architectures and learning mechanisms have been proposed for various NLP tasks. However, there is no systematic exploration and comparison of different MLT architectures and learning mechanisms for their strong performance in-depth. In this paper, we conduct a thorough examination of typical MTL methods on a broad range of representative NLP tasks. Our primary goal is to understand the merits and demerits of existing MTL methods in NLP tasks, thus devising new hybrid architectures intended to combine their strengths."
Natural Language Processing of Clinical Notes on Chronic Diseases: Systematic Review,"Of the 2652 articles considered, 106 met the inclusion criteria. Review of the included papers resulted in identification of 43 chronic diseases, which were then further classified into 10 disease categories using ICD-10. The majority of studies focused on diseases of the circulatory system (n=38) while endocrine and metabolic diseases were fewest (n=14). This was due to the structure of clinical records related to metabolic diseases, which typically contain much more structured data, compared with medical records for diseases of the circulatory system, which focus more on unstructured data and consequently have seen a stronger focus of NLP. The review has shown that there is a significant increase in the use of machine learning methods compared to rule-based approaches; however, deep learning methods remain emergent (n=3). Consequently, the majority of works focus on classification of disease phenotype with only a handful of papers addressing extraction of comorbidities from the free text or integration of clinical notes with structured data. There is a notable use of relatively simple methods, such as shallow classifiers (or combination with rule-based methods), due to the interpretability of predictions, which still represents a significant issue for more complex methods. Finally, scarcity of publicly available data may also have contributed to insufficient development of more advanced methods, such as extraction of word embeddings from clinical notes. Further efforts are still required to improve (1) progression of clinical NLP methods from extraction toward understanding; (2) recognition of relations among entities rather than entities in isolation; (3) temporal extraction to understand past, current, and future clinical events; (4) exploitation of alternative sources of clinical knowledge; and (5) availability of large-scale, de-identified clinical corpora."
eRevise: Using Natural Language Processing to Provide Formative Feedback on Text Evidence Usage in Student Writing,"Writing a good essay typically involves students revising an initial paper draft after receiving feedback. We present eRevise, a web-based writing and revising environment that uses natural language processing features generated for rubric-based essay scoring to trigger formative feedback messages regarding students' use of evidence in response-to-text writing. By helping students understand the criteria for using text evidence during writing, eRevise empowers students to better revise their paper drafts. In a pilot deployment of eRevise in 7 classrooms spanning grades 5 and 6, the quality of text evidence usage in writing improved after students received formative feedback then engaged in paper revision."
Self-Knowledge Distillation in Natural Language Processing,"Since deep learning became a key player in natural language processing (NLP), many deep learning models have been showing remarkable performances in a variety of NLP tasks, and in some cases, they are even outperforming humans. Such high performance can be explained by efficient knowledge representation of deep learning models. While many methods have been proposed to learn more efficient representation, knowledge distillation from pretrained deep networks suggest that we can use more information from the soft target probability to train other neural networks. In this paper, we propose a new knowledge distillation method self-knowledge distillation, based on the soft target probabilities of the training model itself, where multimode information is distilled from the word embedding space right below the softmax layer. Due to the time complexity, our method approximates the soft target probabilities. In experiments, we applied the proposed method to two different and fundamental NLP tasks: language model and neural machine translation. The experiment results show that our proposed method improves performance on the tasks."
Thoth: Improved Rapid Serial Visual Presentation using Natural Language Processing,Thoth is a tool designed to combine many different types of speed reading technology. The largest insight is using natural language parsing for more optimal rapid serial visual presentation and more effective reading information.
SentiMATE: Learning to play Chess through Natural Language Processing,"We present SentiMATE, a novel end-to-end Deep Learning model for Chess, employing Natural Language Processing that aims to learn an effective evaluation function assessing move quality. This function is pre-trained on the sentiment of commentary associated with the training moves and is used to guide and optimize the agent's game-playing decision making. The contributions of this research are three-fold: we build and put forward both a classifier which extracts commentary describing the quality of Chess moves in vast commentary datasets, and a Sentiment Analysis model trained on Chess commentary to accurately predict the quality of said moves, to then use those predictions to evaluate the optimal next move of a Chess agent. Both classifiers achieve over 90 % classification accuracy. Lastly, we present a Chess engine, SentiMATE, which evaluates Chess moves based on a pre-trained sentiment evaluation function. Our results exhibit strong evidence to support our initial hypothesis - ""Can Natural Language Processing be used to train a novel and sample efficient evaluation function in Chess Engines?"" - as we integrate our evaluation function into modern Chess engines and play against agents with traditional Chess move evaluation functions, beating both random agents and a DeepChess implementation at a level-one search depth - representing the number of moves a traditional Chess agent (employing the alpha-beta search algorithm) looks ahead in order to evaluate a given chess state."
GluonCV and GluonNLP: Deep Learning in Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing,"We present GluonCV and GluonNLP, the deep learning toolkits for computer vision and natural language processing based on Apache MXNet (incubating). These toolkits provide state-of-the-art pre-trained models, training scripts, and training logs, to facilitate rapid prototyping and promote reproducible research. We also provide modular APIs with flexible building blocks to enable efficient customization. Leveraging the MXNet ecosystem, the deep learning models in GluonCV and GluonNLP can be deployed onto a variety of platforms with different programming languages. The Apache 2.0 license has been adopted by GluonCV and GluonNLP to allow for software distribution, modification, and usage."
Is artificial data useful for biomedical Natural Language Processing algorithms?,"A major obstacle to the development of Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods in the biomedical domain is data accessibility. This problem can be addressed by generating medical data artificially. Most previous studies have focused on the generation of short clinical text, and evaluation of the data utility has been limited. We propose a generic methodology to guide the generation of clinical text with key phrases. We use the artificial data as additional training data in two key biomedical NLP tasks: text classification and temporal relation extraction. We show that artificially generated training data used in conjunction with real training data can lead to performance boosts for data-greedy neural network algorithms. We also demonstrate the usefulness of the generated data for NLP setups where it fully replaces real training data."
Supervised Contextual Embeddings for Transfer Learning in Natural Language Processing Tasks,"Pre-trained word embeddings are the primary method for transfer learning in several Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Recent works have focused on using unsupervised techniques such as language modeling to obtain these embeddings. In contrast, this work focuses on extracting representations from multiple pre-trained supervised models, which enriches word embeddings with task and domain specific knowledge. Experiments performed in cross-task, cross-domain and cross-lingual settings indicate that such supervised embeddings are helpful, especially in the low-resource setting, but the extent of gains is dependent on the nature of the task and domain. We make our code publicly available."

Mitigating Gender Bias in Natural Language Processing: Literature Review,"As Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) tools rise in popularity, it becomes increasingly vital to recognize the role they play in shaping societal biases and stereotypes. Although NLP models have shown success in modeling various applications, they propagate and may even amplify gender bias found in text corpora. While the study of bias in artificial intelligence is not new, methods to mitigate gender bias in NLP are relatively nascent. In this paper, we review contemporary studies on recognizing and mitigating gender bias in NLP. We discuss gender bias based on four forms of representation bias and analyze methods recognizing gender bias. Furthermore, we discuss the advantages and drawbacks of existing gender debiasing methods. Finally, we discuss future studies for recognizing and mitigating gender bias in NLP."
Transfer Learning in Biomedical Natural Language Processing: An Evaluation of BERT and ELMo on Ten Benchmarking Datasets,"Inspired by the success of the General Language Understanding Evaluation benchmark, we introduce the Biomedical Language Understanding Evaluation (BLUE) benchmark to facilitate research in the development of pre-training language representations in the biomedicine domain. The benchmark consists of five tasks with ten datasets that cover both biomedical and clinical texts with different dataset sizes and difficulties. We also evaluate several baselines based on BERT and ELMo and find that the BERT model pre-trained on PubMed abstracts and MIMIC-III clinical notes achieves the best results. We make the datasets, pre-trained models, and codes publicly available at https://github.com/ncbi-nlp/BLUE_Benchmark."
Lightweight and Efficient Neural Natural Language Processing with Quaternion Networks,"Many state-of-the-art neural models for NLP are heavily parameterized and thus memory inefficient. This paper proposes a series of lightweight and memory efficient neural architectures for a potpourri of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. To this end, our models exploit computation using Quaternion algebra and hypercomplex spaces, enabling not only expressive inter-component interactions but also significantly (75\%) reduced parameter size due to lesser degrees of freedom in the Hamilton product. We propose Quaternion variants of models, giving rise to new architectures such as the Quaternion attention Model and Quaternion Transformer. Extensive experiments on a battery of NLP tasks demonstrates the utility of proposed Quaternion-inspired models, enabling up to 75\% reduction in parameter size without significant loss in performance."
Survey on Publicly Available Sinhala Natural Language Processing Tools and Research,"Sinhala is the native language of the Sinhalese people who make up the largest ethnic group of Sri Lanka. The language belongs to the globe-spanning language tree, Indo-European. However, due to poverty in both linguistic and economic capital, Sinhala, in the perspective of Natural Language Processing tools and research, remains a resource-poor language which has neither the economic drive its cousin English has nor the sheer push of the law of numbers a language such as Chinese has. A number of research groups from Sri Lanka have noticed this dearth and the resultant dire need for proper tools and research for Sinhala natural language processing. However, due to various reasons, these attempts seem to lack coordination and awareness of each other. The objective of this paper is to fill that gap of a comprehensive literature survey of the publicly available Sinhala natural language tools and research so that the researchers working in this field can better utilize contributions of their peers. As such, we shall be uploading this paper to arXiv and perpetually update it periodically to reflect the advances made in the field."
An Introduction to a New Text Classification and Visualization for Natural Language Processing Using Topological Data Analysis,"Topological Data Analysis (TDA) is a novel new and fast growing field of data science providing a set of new topological and geometric tools to derive relevant features out of complex high-dimensional data. In this paper we apply two of best methods in topological data analysis, ""Persistent Homology"" and ""Mapper"", in order to classify persian poems which has been composed by two of the best Iranian poets namely ""Ferdowsi"" and ""Hafez"". This article has two main parts, in the first part we explain the mathematics behind these two methods which is easy to understand for general audience and in the second part we describe our models and the results of applying TDA tools to NLP."
Using Natural Language Processing to Develop an Automated Orthodontic Diagnostic System,"We work on the task of automatically designing a treatment plan from the findings included in the medical certificate written by the dentist. To develop an artificial intelligence system that deals with free-form certificates written by dentists, we annotate the findings and utilized the natural language processing approach. As a result of the experiment using 990 certificates, 0.585 F1-score was achieved for the task of extracting orthodontic problems from findings, and 0.584 correlation coefficient with the human ranking was achieved for the treatment prioritization task."
Interpreting and improving natural-language processing (in machines) with natural language-processing (in the brain),"Neural networks models for NLP are typically implemented without the explicit encoding of language rules and yet they are able to break one performance record after another. This has generated a lot of research interest in interpreting the representations learned by these networks. We propose here a novel interpretation approach that relies on the only processing system we have that does understand language: the human brain. We use brain imaging recordings of subjects reading complex natural text to interpret word and sequence embeddings from 4 recent NLP models - ELMo, USE, BERT and Transformer-XL. We study how their representations differ across layer depth, context length, and attention type. Our results reveal differences in the context-related representations across these models. Further, in the transformer models, we find an interaction between layer depth and context length, and between layer depth and attention type. We finally hypothesize that altering BERT to better align with brain recordings would enable it to also better understand language. Probing the altered BERT using syntactic NLP tasks reveals that the model with increased brain-alignment outperforms the original model. Cognitive neuroscientists have already begun using NLP networks to study the brain, and this work closes the loop to allow the interaction between NLP and cognitive neuroscience to be a true cross-pollination."
Development of Deep Learning Based Natural Language Processing Model for Turkish,"Natural language is one of the most fundamental features that distinguish people from other living things and enable people to communicate each other. Language is a tool that enables people to express their feelings and thoughts and to transfers cultures through generations. Texts and audio are examples of natural language in daily life. In the natural language, many words disappear in time, on the other hand new words are derived. Therefore, while the process of natural language processing (NLP) is complex even for human, it is difficult to process in computer system. The area of linguistics examines how people use language. NLP, which requires the collaboration of linguists and computer scientists, plays an important role in human computer interaction. Studies in NLP have increased with the use of artificial intelligence technologies in the field of linguistics. With the deep learning methods which are one of the artificial intelligence study areas, platforms close to natural language are being developed. Developed platforms for language comprehension, machine translation and part of speech (POS) tagging benefit from deep learning methods. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), one of the deep learning architectures, is preferred for processing sequential data such as text or audio data. In this study, Turkish POS tagging model has been proposed by using Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (BLSTM) which is an RNN type. The proposed POS tagging model is provided to natural language researchers with a platform that allows them to perform and use their own analysis. In the development phase of the platform developed by using BLSTM, the error rate of the POS tagger has been reduced by taking feedback with expert opinion."
Using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing to Review and Classify the Medical Literature on Cancer Susceptibility Genes,"PURPOSE: The medical literature relevant to germline genetics is growing exponentially. Clinicians need tools monitoring and prioritizing the literature to understand the clinical implications of the pathogenic genetic variants. We developed and evaluated two machine learning models to classify abstracts as relevant to the penetrance (risk of cancer for germline mutation carriers) or prevalence of germline genetic mutations. METHODS: We conducted literature searches in PubMed and retrieved paper titles and abstracts to create an annotated dataset for training and evaluating the two machine learning classification models. Our first model is a support vector machine (SVM) which learns a linear decision rule based on the bag-of-ngrams representation of each title and abstract. Our second model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) which learns a complex nonlinear decision rule based on the raw title and abstract. We evaluated the performance of the two models on the classification of papers as relevant to penetrance or prevalence. RESULTS: For penetrance classification, we annotated 3740 paper titles and abstracts and used 60% for training the model, 20% for tuning the model, and 20% for evaluating the model. The SVM model achieves 89.53% accuracy (percentage of papers that were correctly classified) while the CNN model achieves 88.95 % accuracy. For prevalence classification, we annotated 3753 paper titles and abstracts. The SVM model achieves 89.14% accuracy while the CNN model achieves 89.13 % accuracy. CONCLUSION: Our models achieve high accuracy in classifying abstracts as relevant to penetrance or prevalence. By facilitating literature review, this tool could help clinicians and researchers keep abreast of the burgeoning knowledge of gene-cancer associations and keep the knowledge bases for clinical decision support tools up to date."
Efficiently Reusing Natural Language Processing Models for Phenotype-Mention Identification in Free-text Electronic Medical Records: Methodology Study,"Background: Many efforts have been put into the use of automated approaches, such as natural language processing (NLP), to mine or extract data from free-text medical records to construct comprehensive patient profiles for delivering better health-care. Reusing NLP models in new settings, however, remains cumbersome - requiring validation and/or retraining on new data iteratively to achieve convergent results.  Objective: The aim of this work is to minimize the effort involved in reusing NLP models on free-text medical records.  Methods: We formally define and analyse the model adaptation problem in phenotype-mention identification tasks. We identify ""duplicate waste"" and ""imbalance waste"", which collectively impede efficient model reuse. We propose a phenotype embedding based approach to minimize these sources of waste without the need for labelled data from new settings.  Results: We conduct experiments on data from a large mental health registry to reuse NLP models in four phenotype-mention identification tasks. The proposed approach can choose the best model for a new task, identifying up to 76% (duplicate waste), i.e. phenotype mentions without the need for validation and model retraining, and with very good performance (93-97% accuracy). It can also provide guidance for validating and retraining the selected model for novel language patterns in new tasks, saving around 80% (imbalance waste), i.e. the effort required in ""blind"" model-adaptation approaches.  Conclusions: Adapting pre-trained NLP models for new tasks can be more efficient and effective if the language pattern landscapes of old settings and new settings can be made explicit and comparable. Our experiments show that the phenotype-mention embedding approach is an effective way to model language patterns for phenotype-mention identification tasks and that its use can guide efficient NLP model reuse."
Arabic natural language processing: An overview,"Arabic is recognised as the 4th most used language of the Internet. Arabic has three main varieties: (1) classical Arabic (CA), (2) Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), (3) Arabic Dialect (AD). MSA and AD could be written either in Arabic or in Roman script (Arabizi), which corresponds to Arabic written with Latin letters, numerals and punctuation. Due to the complexity of this language and the number of corresponding challenges for NLP, many surveys have been conducted, in order to synthesise the work done on Arabic. However these surveys principally focus on two varieties of Arabic (MSA and AD, written in Arabic letters only), they are slightly old (no such survey since 2015) and therefore do not cover recent resources and tools. To bridge the gap, we propose a survey focusing on 90 recent research papers (74% of which were published after 2015). Our study presents and classifies the work done on the three varieties of Arabic, by concentrating on both Arabic and Arabizi, and associates each work to its publicly available resources whenever available."
SECNLP: A Survey of Embeddings in Clinical Natural Language Processing,"Traditional representations like Bag of words are high dimensional, sparse and ignore the order as well as syntactic and semantic information. Distributed vector representations or embeddings map variable length text to dense fixed length vectors as well as capture the prior knowledge which can transferred to downstream tasks. Even though embedding has become de facto standard for representations in deep learning based NLP tasks in both general and clinical domains, there is no survey paper which presents a detailed review of embeddings in Clinical Natural Language Processing. In this survey paper, we discuss various medical corpora and their characteristics, medical codes and present a brief overview as well as comparison of popular embeddings models. We classify clinical embeddings into nine types and discuss each embedding type in detail. We discuss various evaluation methods followed by possible solutions to various challenges in clinical embeddings. Finally, we conclude with some of the future directions which will advance the research in clinical embeddings."
Using natural language processing techniques to extract information on the properties and functionalities of energetic materials from large text corpora,"The number of scientific journal articles and reports being published about energetic materials every year is growing exponentially, and therefore extracting relevant information and actionable insights from the latest research is becoming a considerable challenge. In this work we explore how techniques from natural language processing and machine learning can be used to automatically extract chemical insights from large collections of documents. We first describe how to download and process documents from a variety of sources - journal articles, conference proceedings (including NTREM), the US Patent & Trademark Office, and the Defense Technical Information Center archive on archive.org. We present a custom NLP pipeline which uses open source NLP tools to identify the names of chemical compounds and relates them to function words (""underwater"", ""rocket"", ""pyrotechnic"") and property words (""elastomer"", ""non-toxic""). After explaining how word embeddings work we compare the utility of two popular word embeddings - word2vec and GloVe. Chemical-chemical and chemical-application relationships are obtained by doing computations with word vectors. We show that word embeddings capture latent information about energetic materials, so that related materials appear close together in the word embedding space."
ScispaCy: Fast and Robust Models for Biomedical Natural Language Processing,"Despite recent advances in natural language processing, many statistical models for processing text perform extremely poorly under domain shift. Processing biomedical and clinical text is a critically important application area of natural language processing, for which there are few robust, practical, publicly available models. This paper describes scispaCy, a new tool for practical biomedical/scientific text processing, which heavily leverages the spaCy library. We detail the performance of two packages of models released in scispaCy and demonstrate their robustness on several tasks and datasets. Models and code are available at https://allenai.github.io/scispacy/"
How is Your Mood When Writing Sexist tweets? Detecting the Emotion Type and Intensity of Emotion Using Natural Language Processing Techniques,"Online social platforms have been the battlefield of users with different emotions and attitudes toward each other in recent years. While sexism has been considered as a category of hateful speech in the literature, there is no comprehensive definition and category of sexism attracting natural language processing techniques. Categorizing sexism as either benevolent or hostile sexism is so broad that it easily ignores the other categories of sexism on social media. Sharifirad S and Matwin S 2018 proposed a well-defined category of sexism including indirect harassment, information threat, sexual harassment and physical harassment, inspired from social science for the purpose of natural language processing techniques. In this article, we take advantage of a newly released dataset in SemEval-2018 task1: Affect in tweets, to show the type of emotion and intensity of emotion in each category. We train, test and evaluate different classification methods on the SemEval- 2018 dataset and choose the classifier with highest accuracy for testing on each category of sexist tweets to know the mental state and the affectual state of the user who tweets in each category. It is a nice avenue to explore because not all the tweets are directly sexist and they carry different emotions from the users. This is the first work experimenting on affect detection this in depth on sexist tweets. Based on our best knowledge they are all new contributions to the field; we are the first to demonstrate the power of such in-depth sentiment analysis on the sexist tweets."
Attention in Natural Language Processing,"Attention is an increasingly popular mechanism used in a wide range of neural architectures. The mechanism itself has been realized in a variety of formats. However, because of the fast-paced advances in this domain, a systematic overview of attention is still missing. In this article, we define a unified model for attention architectures in natural language processing, with a focus on those designed to work with vector representations of the textual data. We propose a taxonomy of attention models according to four dimensions: the representation of the input, the compatibility function, the distribution function, and the multiplicity of the input and/or output. We present the examples of how prior information can be exploited in attention models and discuss ongoing research efforts and open challenges in the area, providing the first extensive categorization of the vast body of literature in this exciting domain."
"Natural Language Processing, Sentiment Analysis and Clinical Analytics","Recent advances in Big Data has prompted health care practitioners to utilize the data available on social media to discern sentiment and emotions expression. Health Informatics and Clinical Analytics depend heavily on information gathered from diverse sources. Traditionally, a healthcare practitioner will ask a patient to fill out a questionnaire that will form the basis of diagnosing the medical condition. However, medical practitioners have access to many sources of data including the patients writings on various media. Natural Language Processing (NLP) allows researchers to gather such data and analyze it to glean the underlying meaning of such writings. The field of sentiment analysis (applied to many other domains) depend heavily on techniques utilized by NLP. This work will look into various prevalent theories underlying the NLP field and how they can be leveraged to gather users sentiments on social media. Such sentiments can be culled over a period of time thus minimizing the errors introduced by data input and other stressors. Furthermore, we look at some applications of sentiment analysis and application of NLP to mental health. The reader will also learn about the NLTK toolkit that implements various NLP theories and how they can make the data scavenging process a lot easier."
Adversarial Attacks on Deep Learning Models in Natural Language Processing: A Survey,"With the development of high computational devices, deep neural networks (DNNs), in recent years, have gained significant popularity in many Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications. However, previous efforts have shown that DNNs were vulnerable to strategically modified samples, named adversarial examples. These samples are generated with some imperceptible perturbations but can fool the DNNs to give false predictions. Inspired by the popularity of generating adversarial examples for image DNNs, research efforts on attacking DNNs for textual applications emerges in recent years. However, existing perturbation methods for images cannotbe directly applied to texts as text data is discrete. In this article, we review research works that address this difference and generatetextual adversarial examples on DNNs. We collect, select, summarize, discuss and analyze these works in a comprehensive way andcover all the related information to make the article self-contained. Finally, drawing on the reviewed literature, we provide further discussions and suggestions on this topic."
A Cross-Architecture Instruction Embedding Model for Natural Language Processing-Inspired Binary Code Analysis,"Given a closed-source program, such as most of proprietary software and viruses, binary code analysis is indispensable for many tasks, such as code plagiarism detection and malware analysis. Today, source code is very often compiled for various architectures, making cross-architecture binary code analysis increasingly important. A binary, after being disassembled, is expressed in an assembly languages. Thus, recent work starts exploring Natural Language Processing (NLP) inspired binary code analysis. In NLP, words are usually represented in high-dimensional vectors (i.e., embeddings) to facilitate further processing, which is one of the most common and critical steps in many NLP tasks. We regard instructions as words in NLP-inspired binary code analysis, and aim to represent instructions as embeddings as well.  To facilitate cross-architecture binary code analysis, our goal is that similar instructions, regardless of their architectures, have embeddings close to each other. To this end, we propose a joint learning approach to generating instruction embeddings that capture not only the semantics of instructions within an architecture, but also their semantic relationships across architectures. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on building cross-architecture instruction embedding model. As a showcase, we apply the model to resolving one of the most fundamental problems for binary code similarity comparison---semantics-based basic block comparison, and the solution outperforms the code statistics based approach. It demonstrates that it is promising to apply the model to other cross-architecture binary code analysis tasks."
Relevant Word Order Vectorization for Improved Natural Language Processing in Electronic Healthcare Records,"Objective: Electronic health records (EHR) represent a rich resource for conducting observational studies, supporting clinical trials, and more. However, much of the relevant information is stored in an unstructured format that makes it difficult to use. Natural language processing approaches that attempt to automatically classify the data depend on vectorization algorithms that impose structure on the text, but these algorithms were not designed for the unique characteristics of EHR. Here, we propose a new algorithm for structuring so-called free-text that may help researchers make better use of EHR. We call this method Relevant Word Order Vectorization (RWOV).  Materials and Methods: As a proof-of-concept, we attempted to classify the hormone receptor status of breast cancer patients treated at the University of Kansas Medical Center during a recent year, from the unstructured text of pathology reports. Our approach attempts to account for the semi-structured way that healthcare providers often enter information. We compared this approach to the ngrams and word2vec methods.  Results: Our approach resulted in the most consistently high accuracy, as measured by F1 score and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).  Discussion: Our results suggest that methods of structuring free text that take into account its context may show better performance, and that our approach is promising.  Conclusion: By using a method that accounts for the fact that healthcare providers tend to use certain key words repetitively and that the order of these key words is important, we showed improved performance over methods that do not."
Report on the 3rd Joint Workshop on Bibliometric-enhanced Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing for Digital Libraries (BIRNDL 2018),"The 3^{rd} joint BIRNDL workshop was held at the 41st ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval (SIGIR 2018) in Ann Arbor, USA. BIRNDL 2018 intended to stimulate IR researchers and digital library professionals to elaborate on new approaches in natural language processing, information retrieval, scientometrics, and recommendation techniques that can advance the state-of-the-art in scholarly document understanding, analysis, and retrieval at scale. The workshop incorporated three paper sessions and the 4^{th} edition of the CL-SciSumm Shared Task."
Creating a contemporary corpus of similes in Serbian by using natural language processing,"Simile is a figure of speech that compares two things through the use of connection words, but where comparison is not intended to be taken literally. They are often used in everyday communication, but they are also a part of linguistic cultural heritage. In this paper we present a methodology for semi-automated collection of similes from the World Wide Web using text mining and machine learning techniques. We expanded an existing corpus by collecting 442 similes from the internet and adding them to the existing corpus collected by Vuk Stefanovic Karadzic that contained 333 similes. We, also, introduce crowdsourcing to the collection of figures of speech, which helped us to build corpus containing 787 unique similes."
Quantifying Uncertainties in Natural Language Processing Tasks,"Reliable uncertainty quantification is a first step towards building explainable, transparent, and accountable artificial intelligent systems. Recent progress in Bayesian deep learning has made such quantification realizable. In this paper, we propose novel methods to study the benefits of characterizing model and data uncertainties for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. With empirical experiments on sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and language modeling using convolutional and recurrent neural network models, we show that explicitly modeling uncertainties is not only necessary to measure output confidence levels, but also useful at enhancing model performances in various NLP tasks."
A Survey on Natural Language Processing for Fake News Detection,"Fake news detection is a critical yet challenging problem in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The rapid rise of social networking platforms has not only yielded a vast increase in information accessibility but has also accelerated the spread of fake news. Thus, the effect of fake news has been growing, sometimes extending to the offline world and threatening public safety. Given the massive amount of Web content, automatic fake news detection is a practical NLP problem useful to all online content providers, in order to reduce the human time and effort to detect and prevent the spread of fake news. In this paper, we describe the challenges involved in fake news detection and also describe related tasks. We systematically review and compare the task formulations, datasets and NLP solutions that have been developed for this task, and also discuss the potentials and limitations of them. Based on our insights, we outline promising research directions, including more fine-grained, detailed, fair, and practical detection models. We also highlight the difference between fake news detection and other related tasks, and the importance of NLP solutions for fake news detection."
Implicit Regularization of Stochastic Gradient Descent in Natural Language Processing: Observations and Implications,"Deep neural networks with remarkably strong generalization performances are usually over-parameterized. Despite explicit regularization strategies are used for practitioners to avoid over-fitting, the impacts are often small. Some theoretical studies have analyzed the implicit regularization effect of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on simple machine learning models with certain assumptions. However, how it behaves practically in state-of-the-art models and real-world datasets is still unknown. To bridge this gap, we study the role of SGD implicit regularization in deep learning systems. We show pure SGD tends to converge to minimas that have better generalization performances in multiple natural language processing (NLP) tasks. This phenomenon coexists with dropout, an explicit regularizer. In addition, neural network's finite learning capability does not impact the intrinsic nature of SGD's implicit regularization effect. Specifically, under limited training samples or with certain corrupted labels, the implicit regularization effect remains strong. We further analyze the stability by varying the weight initialization range. We corroborate these experimental findings with a decision boundary visualization using a 3-layer neural network for interpretation. Altogether, our work enables a deepened understanding on how implicit regularization affects the deep learning model and sheds light on the future study of the over-parameterized model's generalization ability."
Bayesian Compression for Natural Language Processing,"In natural language processing, a lot of the tasks are successfully solved with recurrent neural networks, but such models have a huge number of parameters. The majority of these parameters are often concentrated in the embedding layer, which size grows proportionally to the vocabulary length. We propose a Bayesian sparsification technique for RNNs which allows compressing the RNN dozens or hundreds of times without time-consuming hyperparameters tuning. We also generalize the model for vocabulary sparsification to filter out unnecessary words and compress the RNN even further. We show that the choice of the kept words is interpretable. Code is available on github: https://github.com/tipt0p/SparseBayesianRNN"
Sequence-to-Sequence Models for Data-to-Text Natural Language Generation: Word- vs. Character-based Processing and Output Diversity,"We present a comparison of word-based and character-based sequence-to-sequence models for data-to-text natural language generation, which generate natural language descriptions for structured inputs. On the datasets of two recent generation challenges, our models achieve comparable or better automatic evaluation results than the best challenge submissions. Subsequent detailed statistical and human analyses shed light on the differences between the two input representations and the diversity of the generated texts. In a controlled experiment with synthetic training data generated from templates, we demonstrate the ability of neural models to learn novel combinations of the templates and thereby generalize beyond the linguistic structures they were trained on."
Constructing Financial Sentimental Factors in Chinese Market Using Natural Language Processing,"In this paper, we design an integrated algorithm to evaluate the sentiment of Chinese market. Firstly, with the help of the web browser automation, we crawl a lot of news and comments from several influential financial websites automatically. Secondly, we use techniques of Natural Language Processing(NLP) under Chinese context, including tokenization, Word2vec word embedding and semantic database WordNet, to compute Senti-scores of these news and comments, and then construct the sentimental factor. Here, we build a finance-specific sentimental lexicon so that the sentimental factor can reflect the sentiment of financial market but not the general sentiments as happiness, sadness, etc. Thirdly, we also implement an adjustment of the standard sentimental factor. Our experimental performance shows that there is a significant correlation between our standard sentimental factor and the Chinese market, and the adjusted factor is even more informative, having a stronger correlation with the Chinese market. Therefore, our sentimental factors can be important references when making investment decisions. Especially during the Chinese market crash in 2015, the Pearson correlation coefficient of adjusted sentimental factor with SSE is 0.5844, which suggests that our model can provide a solid guidance, especially in the special period when the market is influenced greatly by public sentiment."
Predicting the Programming Language of Questions and Snippets of StackOverflow Using Natural Language Processing,"Stack Overflow is the most popular Q&A website among software developers. As a platform for knowledge sharing and acquisition, the questions posted in Stack Overflow usually contain a code snippet. Stack Overflow relies on users to properly tag the programming language of a question and it simply assumes that the programming language of the snippets inside a question is the same as the tag of the question itself. In this paper, we propose a classifier to predict the programming language of questions posted in Stack Overflow using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML). The classifier achieves an accuracy of 91.1% in predicting the 24 most popular programming languages by combining features from the title, body and the code snippets of the question. We also propose a classifier that only uses the title and body of the question and has an accuracy of 81.1%. Finally, we propose a classifier of code snippets only that achieves an accuracy of 77.7%. These results show that deploying Machine Learning techniques on the combination of text and the code snippets of a question provides the best performance. These results demonstrate also that it is possible to identify the programming language of a snippet of few lines of source code. We visualize the feature space of two programming languages Java and SQL in order to identify some special properties of information inside the questions in Stack Overflow corresponding to these languages."
Deep CNN Frame Interpolation with Lessons Learned from Natural Language Processing,"A major area of growth within deep learning has been the study and implementation of convolutional neural networks. The general explanation within the deep learning community of the robustness of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) within image recognition rests upon the idea that CNNs are able to extract localized features. However, recent developments in fields such as Natural Language Processing are demonstrating that this paradigm may be incorrect. In this paper, we analyze the current state of the field concerning CNN's and present a hypothesis that provides a novel explanation for the robustness of CNN models. From there, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by presenting novel deep CNN frame interpolation architecture that is comparable to the state of the art interpolation models with a fraction of the complexity."
A natural language processing and geospatial clustering framework for harvesting local place names from geotagged housing advertisements,"Local place names are frequently used by residents living in a geographic region. Such place names may not be recorded in existing gazetteers, due to their vernacular nature, relative insignificance to a gazetteer covering a large area (e.g., the entire world), recent establishment (e.g., the name of a newly-opened shopping center), or other reasons. While not always recorded, local place names play important roles in many applications, from supporting public participation in urban planning to locating victims in disaster response. In this paper, we propose a computational framework for harvesting local place names from geotagged housing advertisements. We make use of those advertisements posted on local-oriented websites, such as Craigslist, where local place names are often mentioned. The proposed framework consists of two stages: natural language processing (NLP) and geospatial clustering. The NLP stage examines the textual content of housing advertisements, and extracts place name candidates. The geospatial stage focuses on the coordinates associated with the extracted place name candidates, and performs multi-scale geospatial clustering to filter out the non-place names. We evaluate our framework by comparing its performance with those of six baselines. We also compare our result with four existing gazetteers to demonstrate the not-yet-recorded local place names discovered by our framework."
Deep Bayesian Active Learning for Natural Language Processing: Results of a Large-Scale Empirical Study,"Several recent papers investigate Active Learning (AL) for mitigating the data dependence of deep learning for natural language processing. However, the applicability of AL to real-world problems remains an open question. While in supervised learning, practitioners can try many different methods, evaluating each against a validation set before selecting a model, AL affords no such luxury. Over the course of one AL run, an agent annotates its dataset exhausting its labeling budget. Thus, given a new task, an active learner has no opportunity to compare models and acquisition functions. This paper provides a large scale empirical study of deep active learning, addressing multiple tasks and, for each, multiple datasets, multiple models, and a full suite of acquisition functions. We find that across all settings, Bayesian active learning by disagreement, using uncertainty estimates provided either by Dropout or Bayes-by Backprop significantly improves over i.i.d. baselines and usually outperforms classic uncertainty sampling."
Deep Learning Based Natural Language Processing for End to End Speech Translation,"Deep Learning methods employ multiple processing layers to learn hierarchial representations of data. They have already been deployed in a humongous number of applications and have produced state-of-the-art results. Recently with the growth in processing power of computers to be able to do high dimensional tensor calculations, Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications have been given a significant boost in terms of efficiency as well as accuracy. In this paper, we will take a look at various signal processing techniques and then application of them to produce a speech-to-text system using Deep Recurrent Neural Networks."
Gender Bias in Neural Natural Language Processing,"We examine whether neural natural language processing (NLP) systems reflect historical biases in training data. We define a general benchmark to quantify gender bias in a variety of neural NLP tasks. Our empirical evaluation with state-of-the-art neural coreference resolution and textbook RNN-based language models trained on benchmark datasets finds significant gender bias in how models view occupations. We then mitigate bias with CDA: a generic methodology for corpus augmentation via causal interventions that breaks associations between gendered and gender-neutral words. We empirically show that CDA effectively decreases gender bias while preserving accuracy. We also explore the space of mitigation strategies with CDA, a prior approach to word embedding debiasing (WED), and their compositions. We show that CDA outperforms WED, drastically so when word embeddings are trained. For pre-trained embeddings, the two methods can be effectively composed. We also find that as training proceeds on the original data set with gradient descent the gender bias grows as the loss reduces, indicating that the optimization encourages bias; CDA mitigates this behavior."
A Survey of the Usages of Deep Learning in Natural Language Processing,"Over the last several years, the field of natural language processing has been propelled forward by an explosion in the use of deep learning models. This survey provides a brief introduction to the field and a quick overview of deep learning architectures and methods. It then sifts through the plethora of recent studies and summarizes a large assortment of relevant contributions. Analyzed research areas include several core linguistic processing issues in addition to a number of applications of computational linguistics. A discussion of the current state of the art is then provided along with recommendations for future research in the field."
Modular Mechanistic Networks: On Bridging Mechanistic and Phenomenological Models with Deep Neural Networks in Natural Language Processing,"Natural language processing (NLP) can be done using either top-down (theory driven) and bottom-up (data driven) approaches, which we call mechanistic and phenomenological respectively. The approaches are frequently considered to stand in opposition to each other. Examining some recent approaches in deep learning we argue that deep neural networks incorporate both perspectives and, furthermore, that leveraging this aspect of deep learning may help in solving complex problems within language technology, such as modelling language and perception in the domain of spatial cognition."
Developing a Portable Natural Language Processing Based Phenotyping System,"This paper presents a portable phenotyping system that is capable of integrating both rule-based and statistical machine learning based approaches. Our system utilizes UMLS to extract clinically relevant features from the unstructured text and then facilitates portability across different institutions and data systems by incorporating OHDSI's OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) to standardize necessary data elements. Our system can also store the key components of rule-based systems (e.g., regular expression matches) in the format of OMOP CDM, thus enabling the reuse, adaptation and extension of many existing rule-based clinical NLP systems. We experimented with our system on the corpus from i2b2's Obesity Challenge as a pilot study. Our system facilitates portable phenotyping of obesity and its 15 comorbidities based on the unstructured patient discharge summaries, while achieving a performance that often ranked among the top 10 of the challenge participants. This standardization enables a consistent application of numerous rule-based and machine learning based classification techniques downstream."
Concept-Based Embeddings for Natural Language Processing,"In this work, we focus on effectively leveraging and integrating information from concept-level as well as word-level via projecting concepts and words into a lower dimensional space while retaining most critical semantics. In a broad context of opinion understanding system, we investigate the use of the fused embedding for several core NLP tasks: named entity detection and classification, automatic speech recognition reranking, and targeted sentiment analysis."
Natural Language Processing for Information Extraction,"With rise of digital age, there is an explosion of information in the form of news, articles, social media, and so on. Much of this data lies in unstructured form and manually managing and effectively making use of it is tedious, boring and labor intensive. This explosion of information and need for more sophisticated and efficient information handling tools gives rise to Information Extraction(IE) and Information Retrieval(IR) technology. Information Extraction systems takes natural language text as input and produces structured information specified by certain criteria, that is relevant to a particular application. Various sub-tasks of IE such as Named Entity Recognition, Coreference Resolution, Named Entity Linking, Relation Extraction, Knowledge Base reasoning forms the building blocks of various high end Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks such as Machine Translation, Question-Answering System, Natural Language Understanding, Text Summarization and Digital Assistants like Siri, Cortana and Google Now. This paper introduces Information Extraction technology, its various sub-tasks, highlights state-of-the-art research in various IE subtasks, current challenges and future research directions."
Natural Language Processing for Music Knowledge Discovery,"Today, a massive amount of musical knowledge is stored in written form, with testimonies dated as far back as several centuries ago. In this work, we present different Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches to harness the potential of these text collections for automatic music knowledge discovery, covering different phases in a prototypical NLP pipeline, namely corpus compilation, text-mining, information extraction, knowledge graph generation and sentiment analysis. Each of these approaches is presented alongside different use cases (i.e., flamenco, Renaissance and popular music) where large collections of documents are processed, and conclusions stemming from data-driven analyses are presented and discussed."
Modeling Language Variation and Universals: A Survey on Typological Linguistics for Natural Language Processing,"Linguistic typology aims to capture structural and semantic variation across the world's languages. A large-scale typology could provide excellent guidance for multilingual Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly for languages that suffer from the lack of human labeled resources. We present an extensive literature survey on the use of typological information in the development of NLP techniques. Our survey demonstrates that to date, the use of information in existing typological databases has resulted in consistent but modest improvements in system performance. We show that this is due to both intrinsic limitations of databases (in terms of coverage and feature granularity) and under-employment of the typological features included in them. We advocate for a new approach that adapts the broad and discrete nature of typological categories to the contextual and continuous nature of machine learning algorithms used in contemporary NLP. In particular, we suggest that such approach could be facilitated by recent developments in data-driven induction of typological knowledge."
The Interplay between Lexical Resources and Natural Language Processing,"Incorporating linguistic, world and common sense knowledge into AI/NLP systems is currently an important research area, with several open problems and challenges. At the same time, processing and storing this knowledge in lexical resources is not a straightforward task. This tutorial proposes to address these complementary goals from two methodological perspectives: the use of NLP methods to help the process of constructing and enriching lexical resources and the use of lexical resources for improving NLP applications. Two main types of audience can benefit from this tutorial: those working on language resources who are interested in becoming acquainted with automatic NLP techniques, with the end goal of speeding and/or easing up the process of resource curation; and on the other hand, researchers in NLP who would like to benefit from the knowledge of lexical resources to improve their systems and models. The slides of the tutorial are available at https://bitbucket.org/luisespinosa/lr-nlp/"
Natural Language Processing for EHR-Based Computational Phenotyping,"This article reviews recent advances in applying natural language processing (NLP) to Electronic Health Records (EHRs) for computational phenotyping. NLP-based computational phenotyping has numerous applications including diagnosis categorization, novel phenotype discovery, clinical trial screening, pharmacogenomics, drug-drug interaction (DDI) and adverse drug event (ADE) detection, as well as genome-wide and phenome-wide association studies. Significant progress has been made in algorithm development and resource construction for computational phenotyping. Among the surveyed methods, well-designed keyword search and rule-based systems often achieve good performance. However, the construction of keyword and rule lists requires significant manual effort, which is difficult to scale. Supervised machine learning models have been favored because they are capable of acquiring both classification patterns and structures from data. Recently, deep learning and unsupervised learning have received growing attention, with the former favored for its performance and the latter for its ability to find novel phenotypes. Integrating heterogeneous data sources have become increasingly important and have shown promise in improving model performance. Often better performance is achieved by combining multiple modalities of information. Despite these many advances, challenges and opportunities remain for NLP-based computational phenotyping, including better model interpretability and generalizability, and proper characterization of feature relations in clinical narratives"

"Incremental Natural Language Processing: Challenges, Strategies, and Evaluation","Incrementality is ubiquitous in human-human interaction and beneficial for human-computer interaction. It has been a topic of research in different parts of the NLP community, mostly with focus on the specific topic at hand even though incremental systems have to deal with similar challenges regardless of domain. In this survey, I consolidate and categorize the approaches, identifying similarities and differences in the computation and data, and show trade-offs that have to be considered. A focus lies on evaluating incremental systems because the standard metrics often fail to capture the incremental properties of a system and coming up with a suitable evaluation scheme is non-trivial."
Convolutional neural network compression for natural language processing,"Convolutional neural networks are modern models that are very efficient in many classification tasks. They were originally created for image processing purposes. Then some trials were performed to use them in different domains like natural language processing. The artificial intelligence systems (like humanoid robots) are very often based on embedded systems with constraints on memory, power consumption etc. Therefore convolutional neural network because of its memory capacity should be reduced to be mapped to given hardware. In this paper, results are presented of compressing the efficient convolutional neural networks for sentiment analysis. The main steps are quantization and pruning processes. The method responsible for mapping compressed network to FPGA and results of this implementation are presented. The described simulations showed that 5-bit width is enough to have no drop in accuracy from floating point version of the network. Additionally, significant memory footprint reduction was achieved (from 85% up to 93%)."
NEURON: Query Optimization Meets Natural Language Processing For Augmenting Database Education,"Relational database management system (RDBMS) is a major undergraduate course taught in many universities worldwide as part of their computer science program. A core component of such course is the design and implementation of the query optimizer in a RDBMS. The goal of the query optimizer is to automatically identify the most efficient execution strategies for executing the declarative SQL queries submitted by users. The query optimization process produces a query execution plan (QEP) which represents an execution strategy for the query. Due to the complexity of the underlying query optimizer, comprehension of a QEP demands that a student is knowledgeable of implementation-specific issues related to the RDBMS. In practice, this is an unrealistic assumption to make as most students are learning database technology for the first time. Hence, it is often difficult for them to comprehend the query execution strategy undertaken by a DBMS by perusing the QEP, hindering their learning process. In this demonstration, we present a novel system called NEURON that facilitates natural language interaction with QEPs to enhance its understanding. NEURON accepts a SQL query (which may include joins, aggregation, nesting, among other things) as input, executes it, and generates a simplified natural language-based description (both in text and voice form) of the execution strategy deployed by the underlying RDBMS. Furthermore, it facilitates understanding of various features related to the QEP through a natural language-based question answering framework. We advocate that such tool, world's first of its kind, can greatly enhance students' learning of the query optimization topic."
AllenNLP: A Deep Semantic Natural Language Processing Platform,"This paper describes AllenNLP, a platform for research on deep learning methods in natural language understanding. AllenNLP is designed to support researchers who want to build novel language understanding models quickly and easily. It is built on top of PyTorch, allowing for dynamic computation graphs, and provides (1) a flexible data API that handles intelligent batching and padding, (2) high-level abstractions for common operations in working with text, and (3) a modular and extensible experiment framework that makes doing good science easy. It also includes reference implementations of high quality approaches for both core semantic problems (e.g. semantic role labeling (Palmer et al., 2005)) and language understanding applications (e.g. machine comprehension (Rajpurkar et al., 2016)). AllenNLP is an ongoing open-source effort maintained by engineers and researchers at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence."
Dynamic Natural Language Processing with Recurrence Quantification Analysis,"Writing and reading are dynamic processes. As an author composes a text, a sequence of words is produced. This sequence is one that, the author hopes, causes a revisitation of certain thoughts and ideas in others. These processes of composition and revisitation by readers are ordered in time. This means that text itself can be investigated under the lens of dynamical systems. A common technique for analyzing the behavior of dynamical systems, known as recurrence quantification analysis (RQA), can be used as a method for analyzing sequential structure of text. RQA treats text as a sequential measurement, much like a time series, and can thus be seen as a kind of dynamic natural language processing (NLP). The extension has several benefits. Because it is part of a suite of time series analysis tools, many measures can be extracted in one common framework. Secondly, the measures have a close relationship with some commonly used measures from natural language processing. Finally, using recurrence analysis offers an opportunity expand analysis of text by developing theoretical descriptions derived from complex dynamic systems. We showcase an example analysis on 8,000 texts from the Gutenberg Project, compare it to well-known NLP approaches, and describe an R package (crqanlp) that can be used in conjunction with R library crqa."
Learning beyond datasets: Knowledge Graph Augmented Neural Networks for Natural language Processing,"Machine Learning has been the quintessential solution for many AI problems, but learning is still heavily dependent on the specific training data. Some learning models can be incorporated with a prior knowledge in the Bayesian set up, but these learning models do not have the ability to access any organised world knowledge on demand. In this work, we propose to enhance learning models with world knowledge in the form of Knowledge Graph (KG) fact triples for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Our aim is to develop a deep learning model that can extract relevant prior support facts from knowledge graphs depending on the task using attention mechanism. We introduce a convolution-based model for learning representations of knowledge graph entity and relation clusters in order to reduce the attention space. We show that the proposed method is highly scalable to the amount of prior information that has to be processed and can be applied to any generic NLP task. Using this method we show significant improvement in performance for text classification with News20, DBPedia datasets and natural language inference with Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) dataset. We also demonstrate that a deep learning model can be trained well with substantially less amount of labeled training data, when it has access to organised world knowledge in the form of knowledge graph."
A Comparison of Word Embeddings for the Biomedical Natural Language Processing,"Word embeddings have been widely used in biomedical Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications as they provide vector representations of words capturing the semantic properties of words and the linguistic relationship between words. Many biomedical applications use different textual resources (e.g., Wikipedia and biomedical articles) to train word embeddings and apply these word embeddings to downstream biomedical applications. However, there has been little work on evaluating the word embeddings trained from these resources.In this study, we provide an empirical evaluation of word embeddings trained from four different resources, namely clinical notes, biomedical publications, Wikipedia, and news. We performed the evaluation qualitatively and quantitatively. For the qualitative evaluation, we manually inspected five most similar medical words to a given set of target medical words, and then analyzed word embeddings through the visualization of those word embeddings. For the quantitative evaluation, we conducted both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation. Based on the evaluation results, we can draw the following conclusions. First, the word embeddings trained on clinical notes and biomedical publications can capture the semantics of medical terms better, and find more relevant similar medical terms, and are closer to human experts' judgments, compared to these trained on Wikipedia and news. Second, there does not exist a consistent global ranking of word embedding quality for downstream biomedical NLP applications. However, adding word embeddings as extra features will improve results on most downstream tasks. Finally, the word embeddings trained on biomedical domain corpora do not necessarily have better performance than those trained on other general domain corpora for any downstream biomedical NLP tasks."
VnCoreNLP: A Vietnamese Natural Language Processing Toolkit,"We present an easy-to-use and fast toolkit, namely VnCoreNLP---a Java NLP annotation pipeline for Vietnamese. Our VnCoreNLP supports key natural language processing (NLP) tasks including word segmentation, part-of-speech (POS) tagging, named entity recognition (NER) and dependency parsing, and obtains state-of-the-art (SOTA) results for these tasks. We release VnCoreNLP to provide rich linguistic annotations to facilitate research work on Vietnamese NLP. Our VnCoreNLP is open-source and available at: https://github.com/vncorenlp/VnCoreNLP"
Sequence Mining and Pattern Analysis in Drilling Reports with Deep Natural Language Processing,"Drilling activities in the oil and gas industry have been reported over decades for thousands of wells on a daily basis, yet the analysis of this text at large-scale for information retrieval, sequence mining, and pattern analysis is very challenging. Drilling reports contain interpretations written by drillers from noting measurements in downhole sensors and surface equipment, and can be used for operation optimization and accident mitigation. In this initial work, a methodology is proposed for automatic classification of sentences written in drilling reports into three relevant labels (EVENT, SYMPTOM and ACTION) for hundreds of wells in an actual field. Some of the main challenges in the text corpus were overcome, which include the high frequency of technical symbols, mistyping/abbreviation of technical terms, and the presence of incomplete sentences in the drilling reports. We obtain state-of-the-art classification accuracy within this technical language and illustrate advanced queries enabled by the tool."
Complex Structure Leads to Overfitting: A Structure Regularization Decoding Method for Natural Language Processing,"Recent systems on structured prediction focus on increasing the level of structural dependencies within the model. However, our study suggests that complex structures entail high overfitting risks. To control the structure-based overfitting, we propose to conduct structure regularization decoding (SR decoding). The decoding of the complex structure model is regularized by the additionally trained simple structure model. We theoretically analyze the quantitative relations between the structural complexity and the overfitting risk. The analysis shows that complex structure models are prone to the structure-based overfitting. Empirical evaluations show that the proposed method improves the performance of the complex structure models by reducing the structure-based overfitting. On the sequence labeling tasks, the proposed method substantially improves the performance of the complex neural network models. The maximum F1 error rate reduction is 36.4% for the third-order model. The proposed method also works for the parsing task. The maximum UAS improvement is 5.5% for the tri-sibling model. The results are competitive with or better than the state-of-the-art results."
Application of Natural Language Processing to Determine User Satisfaction in Public Services,"Research on customer satisfaction has increased substantially in recent years. However, the relative importance and relationships between different determinants of satisfaction remains uncertain. Moreover, quantitative studies to date tend to test for significance of pre-determined factors thought to have an influence with no scalable means to identify other causes of user satisfaction. The gaps in knowledge make it difficult to use available knowledge on user preference for public service improvement. Meanwhile, digital technology development has enabled new methods to collect user feedback, for example through online forums where users can comment freely on their experience. New tools are needed to analyze large volumes of such feedback. Use of topic models is proposed as a feasible solution to aggregate open-ended user opinions that can be easily deployed in the public sector. Generated insights can contribute to a more inclusive decision-making process in public service provision. This novel methodological approach is applied to a case of service reviews of publicly-funded primary care practices in England. Findings from the analysis of 145,000 reviews covering almost 7,700 primary care centers indicate that the quality of interactions with staff and bureaucratic exigencies are the key issues driving user satisfaction across England."
MMCR4NLP: Multilingual Multiway Corpora Repository for Natural Language Processing,"Multilinguality is gradually becoming ubiquitous in the sense that more and more researchers have successfully shown that using additional languages help improve the results in many Natural Language Processing tasks. Multilingual Multiway Corpora (MMC) contain the same sentence in multiple languages. Such corpora have been primarily used for Multi-Source and Pivot Language Machine Translation but are also useful for developing multilingual sequence taggers by transfer learning. While these corpora are available, they are not organized for multilingual experiments and researchers need to write boilerplate code every time they want to use said corpora. Moreover, because there is no official MMC collection it becomes difficult to compare against existing approaches. As such we present our work on creating a unified and systematically organized repository of MMC spanning a large number of languages. We also provide training, development and test splits for corpora where official splits are unavailable. We hope that this will help speed up the pace of multilingual NLP research and ensure that NLP researchers obtain results that are more trustable since they can be compared easily. We indicate corpora sources, extraction procedures if any and relevant statistics. We also make our collection public for research purposes."
Replicability Analysis for Natural Language Processing: Testing Significance with Multiple Datasets,"With the ever-growing amounts of textual data from a large variety of languages, domains, and genres, it has become standard to evaluate NLP algorithms on multiple datasets in order to ensure consistent performance across heterogeneous setups. However, such multiple comparisons pose significant challenges to traditional statistical analysis methods in NLP and can lead to erroneous conclusions. In this paper, we propose a Replicability Analysis framework for a statistically sound analysis of multiple comparisons between algorithms for NLP tasks. We discuss the theoretical advantages of this framework over the current, statistically unjustified, practice in the NLP literature, and demonstrate its empirical value across four applications: multi-domain dependency parsing, multilingual POS tagging, cross-domain sentiment classification and word similarity prediction."
Data Innovation for International Development: An overview of natural language processing for qualitative data analysis,"Availability, collection and access to quantitative data, as well as its limitations, often make qualitative data the resource upon which development programs heavily rely. Both traditional interview data and social media analysis can provide rich contextual information and are essential for research, appraisal, monitoring and evaluation. These data may be difficult to process and analyze both systematically and at scale. This, in turn, limits the ability of timely data driven decision-making which is essential in fast evolving complex social systems. In this paper, we discuss the potential of using natural language processing to systematize analysis of qualitative data, and to inform quick decision-making in the development context. We illustrate this with interview data generated in a format of micro-narratives for the UNDP Fragments of Impact project."
Modelling Word Burstiness in Natural Language: A Generalised Polya Process for Document Language Models in Information Retrieval,"We introduce a generalised multivariate Polya process for document language modelling. The framework outlined here generalises a number of statistical language models used in information retrieval for modelling document generation. In particular, we show that the choice of replacement matrix M ultimately defines the type of random process and therefore defines a particular type of document language model. We show that a particular variant of the general model is useful for modelling term-specific burstiness. Furthermore, via experimentation we show that this variant significantly improves retrieval effectiveness over a strong baseline on a number of small test collections."
"Natural Language Processing: State of The Art, Current Trends and Challenges","Natural language processing (NLP) has recently gained much attention for representing and analysing human language computationally. It has spread its applications in various fields such as machine translation, email spam detection, information extraction, summarization, medical, and question answering etc. The paper distinguishes four phases by discussing different levels of NLP and components of Natural Language Generation (NLG) followed by presenting the history and evolution of NLP, state of the art presenting the various applications of NLP and current trends and challenges."
Recent Trends in Deep Learning Based Natural Language Processing,"Deep learning methods employ multiple processing layers to learn hierarchical representations of data and have produced state-of-the-art results in many domains. Recently, a variety of model designs and methods have blossomed in the context of natural language processing (NLP). In this paper, we review significant deep learning related models and methods that have been employed for numerous NLP tasks and provide a walk-through of their evolution. We also summarize, compare and contrast the various models and put forward a detailed understanding of the past, present and future of deep learning in NLP."
Natural Language Processing with Small Feed-Forward Networks,"We show that small and shallow feed-forward neural networks can achieve near state-of-the-art results on a range of unstructured and structured language processing tasks while being considerably cheaper in memory and computational requirements than deep recurrent models. Motivated by resource-constrained environments like mobile phones, we showcase simple techniques for obtaining such small neural network models, and investigate different tradeoffs when deciding how to allocate a small memory budget."
An Interactive Tool for Natural Language Processing on Clinical Text,"Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems often make use of machine learning techniques that are unfamiliar to end-users who are interested in analyzing clinical records. Although NLP has been widely used in extracting information from clinical text, current systems generally do not support model revision based on feedback from domain experts.  We present a prototype tool that allows end users to visualize and review the outputs of an NLP system that extracts binary variables from clinical text. Our tool combines multiple visualizations to help the users understand these results and make any necessary corrections, thus forming a feedback loop and helping improve the accuracy of the NLP models. We have tested our prototype in a formative think-aloud user study with clinicians and researchers involved in colonoscopy research. Results from semi-structured interviews and a System Usability Scale (SUS) analysis show that the users are able to quickly start refining NLP models, despite having very little or no experience with machine learning. Observations from these sessions suggest revisions to the interface to better support review workflow and interpretation of results."
Racial Disparity in Natural Language Processing: A Case Study of Social Media African-American English,"We highlight an important frontier in algorithmic fairness: disparity in the quality of natural language processing algorithms when applied to language from authors of different social groups. For example, current systems sometimes analyze the language of females and minorities more poorly than they do of whites and males. We conduct an empirical analysis of racial disparity in language identification for tweets written in African-American English, and discuss implications of disparity in NLP."
Is Natural Language a Perigraphic Process? The Theorem about Facts and Words Revisited,"As we discuss, a stationary stochastic process is nonergodic when a random persistent topic can be detected in the infinite random text sampled from the process, whereas we call the process strongly nonergodic when an infinite sequence of independent random bits, called probabilistic facts, is needed to describe this topic completely. Replacing probabilistic facts with an algorithmically random sequence of bits, called algorithmic facts, we adapt this property back to ergodic processes. Subsequently, we call a process perigraphic if the number of algorithmic facts which can be inferred from a finite text sampled from the process grows like a power of the text length. We present a simple example of such a process. Moreover, we demonstrate an assertion which we call the theorem about facts and words. This proposition states that the number of probabilistic or algorithmic facts which can be inferred from a text drawn from a process must be roughly smaller than the number of distinct word-like strings detected in this text by means of the PPM compression algorithm. We also observe that the number of the word-like strings for a sample of plays by Shakespeare follows an empirical stepwise power law, in a stark contrast to Markov processes. Hence we suppose that natural language considered as a process is not only non-Markov but also perigraphic."
Joint Workshop on Bibliometric-enhanced Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing for Digital Libraries (BIRNDL 2017),"The large scale of scholarly publications poses a challenge for scholars in information seeking and sensemaking. Bibliometrics, information retrieval (IR), text mining and NLP techniques could help in these search and look-up activities, but are not yet widely used. This workshop is intended to stimulate IR researchers and digital library professionals to elaborate on new approaches in natural language processing, information retrieval, scientometrics, text mining and recommendation techniques that can advance the state-of-the-art in scholarly document understanding, analysis, and retrieval at scale. The BIRNDL workshop at SIGIR 2017 will incorporate an invited talk, paper sessions and the third edition of the Computational Linguistics (CL) Scientific Summarization Shared Task."
"From Imitation to Prediction, Data Compression vs Recurrent Neural Networks for Natural Language Processing","In recent studies [1][13][12] Recurrent Neural Networks were used for generative processes and their surprising performance can be explained by their ability to create good predictions. In addition, data compression is also based on predictions. What the problem comes down to is whether a data compressor could be used to perform as well as recurrent neural networks in natural language processing tasks. If this is possible,then the problem comes down to determining if a compression algorithm is even more intelligent than a neural network in specific tasks related to human language. In our journey we discovered what we think is the fundamental difference between a Data Compression Algorithm and a Recurrent Neural Network."
A Short Review of Ethical Challenges in Clinical Natural Language Processing,"Clinical NLP has an immense potential in contributing to how clinical practice will be revolutionized by the advent of large scale processing of clinical records. However, this potential has remained largely untapped due to slow progress primarily caused by strict data access policies for researchers. In this paper, we discuss the concern for privacy and the measures it entails. We also suggest sources of less sensitive data. Finally, we draw attention to biases that can compromise the validity of empirical research and lead to socially harmful applications."
A Tidy Data Model for Natural Language Processing using cleanNLP,"The package cleanNLP provides a set of fast tools for converting a textual corpus into a set of normalized tables. The underlying natural language processing pipeline utilizes Stanford's CoreNLP library, exposing a number of annotation tasks for text written in English, French, German, and Spanish. Annotators include tokenization, part of speech tagging, named entity recognition, entity linking, sentiment analysis, dependency parsing, coreference resolution, and information extraction."
Comparative Study of CNN and RNN for Natural Language Processing,"Deep neural networks (DNN) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP). Convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN), the two main types of DNN architectures, are widely explored to handle various NLP tasks. CNN is supposed to be good at extracting position-invariant features and RNN at modeling units in sequence. The state of the art on many NLP tasks often switches due to the battle between CNNs and RNNs. This work is the first systematic comparison of CNN and RNN on a wide range of representative NLP tasks, aiming to give basic guidance for DNN selection."
Multilingual Multi-modal Embeddings for Natural Language Processing,"We propose a novel discriminative model that learns embeddings from multilingual and multi-modal data, meaning that our model can take advantage of images and descriptions in multiple languages to improve embedding quality. To that end, we introduce a modification of a pairwise contrastive estimation optimisation function as our training objective. We evaluate our embeddings on an image-sentence ranking (ISR), a semantic textual similarity (STS), and a neural machine translation (NMT) task. We find that the additional multilingual signals lead to improvements on both the ISR and STS tasks, and the discriminative cost can also be used in re-ranking n-best lists produced by NMT models, yielding strong improvements."
"Symbolic, Distributed and Distributional Representations for Natural Language Processing in the Era of Deep Learning: a Survey","Natural language is inherently a discrete symbolic representation of human knowledge. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) and in natural language processing (NLP) seem to contradict the above intuition: discrete symbols are fading away, erased by vectors or tensors called distributed and distributional representations. However, there is a strict link between distributed/distributional representations and discrete symbols, being the first an approximation of the second. A clearer understanding of the strict link between distributed/distributional representations and symbols may certainly lead to radically new deep learning networks. In this paper we make a survey that aims to renew the link between symbolic representations and distributed/distributional representations. This is the right time to revitalize the area of interpreting how discrete symbols are represented inside neural networks."
Syntactic Enhancement to VSIMM for Roadmap Based Anomalous Trajectory Detection: A Natural Language Processing Approach,"The aim of syntactic tracking is to classify spatio-temporal patterns of a target's motion using natural language processing models. In this paper, we generalize earlier work by considering a constrained stochastic context free grammar (CSCFG) for modeling patterns confined to a roadmap. The constrained grammar facilitates modeling specific directions and road names in a roadmap. We present a novel particle filtering algorithm that exploits the CSCFG model for estimating the target's patterns. This meta-level algorithm operates in conjunction with a base-level tracking algorithm. Extensive numerical results using simulated ground moving target indicator (GMTI) radar measurements show substantial improvement in target tracking accuracy."
Cruciform: Solving Crosswords with Natural Language Processing,"Crossword puzzles are popular word games that require not only a large vocabulary, but also a broad knowledge of topics. Answering each clue is a natural language task on its own as many clues contain nuances, puns, or counter-intuitive word definitions. Additionally, it can be extremely difficult to ascertain definitive answers without the constraints of the crossword grid itself. This task is challenging for both humans and computers. We describe here a new crossword solving system, Cruciform. We employ a group of natural language components, each of which returns a list of candidate words with scores when given a clue. These lists are used in conjunction with the fill intersections in the puzzle grid to formulate a constraint satisfaction problem, in a manner similar to the one used in the Dr. Fill system. We describe the results of several of our experiments with the system."
Introduction: Cognitive Issues in Natural Language Processing,"This special issue is dedicated to get a better picture of the relationships between computational linguistics and cognitive science. It specifically raises two questions: ""what is the potential contribution of computational language modeling to cognitive science?"" and conversely: ""what is the influence of cognitive science in contemporary computational linguistics?"""
Survey on the Use of Typological Information in Natural Language Processing,"In recent years linguistic typology, which classifies the world's languages according to their functional and structural properties, has been widely used to support multilingual NLP. While the growing importance of typological information in supporting multilingual tasks has been recognised, no systematic survey of existing typological resources and their use in NLP has been published. This paper provides such a survey as well as discussion which we hope will both inform and inspire future work in the area."
Using Natural Language Processing and Qualitative Analysis to Intervene in Gang Violence: A Collaboration Between Social Work Researchers and Data Scientists,"The U.S. has the highest rate of firearm-related deaths when compared to other industrialized countries. Violence particularly affects low-income, urban neighborhoods in cities like Chicago, which saw a 40% increase in firearm violence from 2014 to 2015 to more than 3,000 shooting victims. While recent studies have found that urban, gang-involved individuals curate a unique and complex communication style within and between social media platforms, organizations focused on reducing gang violence are struggling to keep up with the growing complexity of social media platforms and the sheer volume of data they present. In this paper, describe the Digital Urban Violence Analysis Approach (DUVVA), a collaborative qualitative analysis method used in a collaboration between data scientists and social work researchers to develop a suite of systems for decoding the high- stress language of urban, gang-involved youth. Our approach leverages principles of grounded theory when analyzing approximately 800 tweets posted by Chicago gang members and participation of youth from Chicago neighborhoods to create a language resource for natural language processing (NLP) methods. In uncovering the unique language and communication style, we developed automated tools with the potential to detect aggressive language on social media and aid individuals and groups in performing violence prevention and interruption."
Using Natural Language Processing to Screen Patients with Active Heart Failure: An Exploration for Hospital-wide Surveillance,"In this paper, we proposed two different approaches, a rule-based approach and a machine-learning based approach, to identify active heart failure cases automatically by analyzing electronic health records (EHR). For the rule-based approach, we extracted cardiovascular data elements from clinical notes and matched patients to different colors according their heart failure condition by using rules provided by experts in heart failure. It achieved 69.4% accuracy and 0.729 F1-Score. For the machine learning approach, with bigram of clinical notes as features, we tried four different models while SVM with linear kernel achieved the best performance with 87.5% accuracy and 0.86 F1-Score. Also, from the classification comparison between the four different models, we believe that linear models fit better for this problem. Once we combine the machine-learning and rule-based algorithms, we will enable hospital-wide surveillance of active heart failure through increased accuracy and interpretability of the outputs."
Performance Evaluation of a Natural Language Processing approach applied in White Collar crime investigation,"In today world we are confronted with increasing amounts of information every day coming from a large variety of sources. People and co-operations are producing data on a large scale, and since the rise of the internet, e-mail and social media the amount of produced data has grown exponentially. From a law enforcement perspective we have to deal with these huge amounts of data when a criminal investigation is launched against an individual or company. Relevant questions need to be answered like who committed the crime, who were involved, what happened and on what time, who were communicating and about what? Not only the amount of available data to investigate has increased enormously, but also the complexity of this data has increased. When these communication patterns need to be combined with for instance a seized financial administration or corporate document shares a complex investigation problem arises. Recently, criminal investigators face a huge challenge when evidence of a crime needs to be found in the Big Data environment where they have to deal with large and complex datasets especially in financial and fraud investigations. To tackle this problem, a financial and fraud investigation unit of a European country has developed a new tool named LES that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to help criminal investigators handle large amounts of textual information in a more efficient and faster way. In this paper, we present briefly this tool and we focus on the evaluation its performance in terms of the requirements of forensic investigation: speed, smarter and easier for investigators. In order to evaluate this LES tool, we use different performance metrics. We also show experimental results of our evaluation with large and complex datasets from real-world application."
Natural Language Processing using Hadoop and KOSHIK,"Natural language processing, as a data analytics related technology, is used widely in many research areas such as artificial intelligence, human language processing, and translation. At present, due to explosive growth of data, there are many challenges for natural language processing. Hadoop is one of the platforms that can process the large amount of data required for natural language processing. KOSHIK is one of the natural language processing architectures, and utilizes Hadoop and contains language processing components such as Stanford CoreNLP and OpenNLP. This study describes how to build a KOSHIK platform with the relevant tools, and provides the steps to analyze wiki data. Finally, it evaluates and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of the KOSHIK architecture, and gives recommendations on improving the processing performance."
Quantum Algorithms for Compositional Natural Language Processing,"We propose a new application of quantum computing to the field of natural language processing.  Ongoing work in this field attempts to incorporate grammatical structure into algorithms that compute meaning.  In (Coecke, Sadrzadeh and Clark, 2010), the authors introduce such a model (the CSC model) based on tensor product composition. While this algorithm has many advantages, its implementation is hampered by the large classical computational resources that it requires. In this work we show how computational shortcomings of the  CSC approach could be resolved using quantum computation (possibly in addition to existing techniques for dimension reduction). We address the value of quantum RAM (Giovannetti,2008) for this model and extend an algorithm from Wiebe, Braun and Lloyd (2012) into a quantum algorithm to categorize  sentences in CSC. Our new algorithm demonstrates a quadratic speedup over classical methods under certain conditions."
Mining Arguments from Cancer Documents Using Natural Language Processing and Ontologies,"In the medical domain, the continuous stream of scientific research contains contradictory results supported by arguments and counter-arguments. As medical expertise occurs at different levels, part of the human agents have difficulties to face the huge amount of studies, but also to understand the reasons and pieces of evidences claimed by the proponents and the opponents of the debated topic. To better understand the supporting arguments for new findings related to current state of the art in the medical domain we need tools able to identify arguments in scientific papers. Our work here aims to fill the above technological gap.  Quite aware of the difficulty of this task, we embark to this road by relying on the well-known interleaving of domain knowledge with natural language processing. To formalise the existing medical knowledge, we rely on ontologies. To structure the argumentation model we use also the expressivity and reasoning capabilities of Description Logics. To perform argumentation mining we formalise various linguistic patterns in a rule-based language. We tested our solution against a corpus of scientific papers related to breast cancer. The run experiments show a F-measure between 0.71 and 0.86 for identifying conclusions of an argument and between 0.65 and 0.86 for identifying premises of an argument."
Processing Natural Language About Ongoing Actions,"Actions may not proceed as planned; they may be interrupted, resumed or overridden. This is a challenge to handle in a natural language understanding system. We describe extensions to an existing implementation for the control of autonomous systems by natural language, to enable such systems to handle incoming language requests regarding actions. Language Communication with Autonomous Systems (LCAS) has been extended with support for X-nets, parameterized executable schemas representing actions. X-nets enable the system to control actions at a desired level of granularity, while providing a mechanism for language requests to be processed asynchronously. Standard semantics supported include requests to stop, continue, or override the existing action. The specific domain demonstrated is the control of motion of a simulated robot, but the approach is general, and could be applied to other domains."
"Robust Natural Language Processing - Combining Reasoning, Cognitive Semantics and Construction Grammar for Spatial Language","We present a system for generating and understanding of dynamic and static spatial relations in robotic interaction setups. Robots describe an environment of moving blocks using English phrases that include spatial relations such as ""across"" and ""in front of"". We evaluate the system in robot-robot interactions and show that the system can robustly deal with visual perception errors, language omissions and ungrammatical utterances."
Data-driven HR - Résumé Analysis Based on Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning,"Recruiters usually spend less than a minute looking at each résumé when deciding whether it's worth continuing the recruitment process with the candidate. Recruiters focus on keywords, and it's almost impossible to guarantee a fair process of candidate selection. The main scope of this paper is to tackle this issue by introducing a data-driven approach that shows how to process résumés automatically and give recruiters more time to only examine promising candidates. Furthermore, we show how to leverage Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing in order to extract all required information from the résumés. Once the information is extracted, a ranking score is calculated. The score describes how well the candidates fit based on their education, work experience and skills. Later this paper illustrates a prototype application that shows how this novel approach can increase the productivity of recruiters. The application enables them to filter and rank candidates based on predefined job descriptions. Guided by the ranking, recruiters can get deeper insights from candidate profiles and validate why and how the application ranked them. This application shows how to improve the hiring process by giving an unbiased hiring decision support."
Word2Vec is a special case of Kernel Correspondence Analysis and Kernels for Natural Language Processing,"We show that correspondence analysis (CA) is equivalent to defining a Gini index with appropriately scaled one-hot encoding. Using this relation, we introduce a nonlinear kernel extension to CA. This extended CA gives a known analysis for natural language via specialized kernels that use an appropriate contingency table. We propose a semi-supervised CA, which is a special case of the kernel extension to CA. Because CA requires excessive memory if applied to numerous categories, CA has not been used for natural language processing. We address this problem by introducing delayed evaluation to randomized singular value decomposition. The memory-efficient CA is then applied to a word-vector representation task. We propose a tail-cut kernel, which is an extension to the skip-gram within the kernel extension to CA. Our tail-cut kernel outperforms existing word-vector representation methods."
Large-scale Analysis of Counseling Conversations: An Application of Natural Language Processing to Mental Health,"Mental illness is one of the most pressing public health issues of our time. While counseling and psychotherapy can be effective treatments, our knowledge about how to conduct successful counseling conversations has been limited due to lack of large-scale data with labeled outcomes of the conversations. In this paper, we present a large-scale, quantitative study on the discourse of text-message-based counseling conversations. We develop a set of novel computational discourse analysis methods to measure how various linguistic aspects of conversations are correlated with conversation outcomes. Applying techniques such as sequence-based conversation models, language model comparisons, message clustering, and psycholinguistics-inspired word frequency analyses, we discover actionable conversation strategies that are associated with better conversation outcomes."
GeoTextTagger: High-Precision Location Tagging of Textual Documents using a Natural Language Processing Approach,"Location tagging, also known as geotagging or geolocation, is the process of assigning geographical coordinates to input data. In this paper we present an algorithm for location tagging of textual documents. Our approach makes use of previous work in natural language processing by using a state-of-the-art part-of-speech tagger and named entity recognizer to find blocks of text which may refer to locations. A knowledge base (OpenStreatMap) is then used to find a list of possible locations for each block. Finally, one location is chosen for each block by assigning distance-based scores to each location and repeatedly selecting the location and block with the best score. We tested our geolocation algorithm with Wikipedia articles about topics with a well-defined geographical location that are geotagged by the articles' authors, where classification approaches have achieved median errors as low as 11 km, with attainable accuracy limited by the class size. Our approach achieved a 10th percentile error of 490 metres and median error of 54 kilometres on the Wikipedia dataset we used. When considering the five location tags with the greatest scores, 50% of articles were assigned at least one tag within 8.5 kilometres of the article's author-assigned true location. We also tested our approach on Twitter messages that are tagged with the location from which the message was sent. Twitter texts are challenging because they are short and unstructured and often do not contain words referring to the location they were sent from, but we obtain potentially useful results. We explain how we use the Spark framework for data analytics to collect and process our test data. In general, classification-based approaches for location tagging may be reaching their upper accuracy limit, but our precision-focused approach has high accuracy for some texts and shows significant potential for improvement overall."
Information retrieval in folktales using natural language processing,Our aim is to extract information about literary characters in unstructured texts. We employ natural language processing and reasoning on domain ontologies. The first task is to identify the main characters and the parts of the story where these characters are described or act. We illustrate the system in a scenario in the folktale domain. The system relies on a folktale ontology that we have developed based on Propp's model for folktales morphology.
Object Oriented Analysis using Natural Language Processing concepts: A Review,"The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) starts with eliciting requirements of the customers in the form of Software Requirement Specification (SRS). SRS document needed for software development is mostly written in Natural Language(NL) convenient for the client. From the SRS document only, the class name, its attributes and the functions incorporated in the body of the class are traced based on pre-knowledge of analyst. The paper intends to present a review on Object Oriented (OO) analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. This analysis can be manual where domain expert helps to generate the required diagram or automated system, where the system generates the required diagram, from the input in the form of SRS."
A Primer on Neural Network Models for Natural Language Processing,"Over the past few years, neural networks have re-emerged as powerful machine-learning models, yielding state-of-the-art results in fields such as image recognition and speech processing. More recently, neural network models started to be applied also to textual natural language signals, again with very promising results. This tutorial surveys neural network models from the perspective of natural language processing research, in an attempt to bring natural-language researchers up to speed with the neural techniques. The tutorial covers input encoding for natural language tasks, feed-forward networks, convolutional networks, recurrent networks and recursive networks, as well as the computation graph abstraction for automatic gradient computation."
Characterizing Phishing Threats with Natural Language Processing,"Spear phishing is a widespread concern in the modern network security landscape, but there are few metrics that measure the extent to which reconnaissance is performed on phishing targets. Spear phishing emails closely match the expectations of the recipient, based on details of their experiences and interests, making them a popular propagation vector for harmful malware. In this work we use Natural Language Processing techniques to investigate a specific real-world phishing campaign and quantify attributes that indicate a targeted spear phishing attack. Our phishing campaign data sample comprises 596 emails - all containing a web bug and a Curriculum Vitae (CV) PDF attachment - sent to our institution by a foreign IP space. The campaign was found to exclusively target specific demographics within our institution. Performing a semantic similarity analysis between the senders' CV attachments and the recipients' LinkedIn profiles, we conclude with high statistical certainty (p < 10^{-4}) that the attachments contain targeted rather than randomly selected material. Latent Semantic Analysis further demonstrates that individuals who were a primary focus of the campaign received CVs that are highly topically clustered. These findings differentiate this campaign from one that leverages random spam."
Posterior calibration and exploratory analysis for natural language processing models,"Many models in natural language processing define probabilistic distributions over linguistic structures. We argue that (1) the quality of a model' s posterior distribution can and should be directly evaluated, as to whether probabilities correspond to empirical frequencies, and (2) NLP uncertainty can be projected not only to pipeline components, but also to exploratory data analysis, telling a user when to trust and not trust the NLP analysis. We present a method to analyze calibration, and apply it to compare the miscalibration of several commonly used models. We also contribute a coreference sampling algorithm that can create confidence intervals for a political event extraction task."
Learning Structural Kernels for Natural Language Processing,"Structural kernels are a flexible learning paradigm that has been widely used in Natural Language Processing. However, the problem of model selection in kernel-based methods is usually overlooked. Previous approaches mostly rely on setting default values for kernel hyperparameters or using grid search, which is slow and coarse-grained. In contrast, Bayesian methods allow efficient model selection by maximizing the evidence on the training data through gradient-based methods. In this paper we show how to perform this in the context of structural kernels by using Gaussian Processes. Experimental results on tree kernels show that this procedure results in better prediction performance compared to hyperparameter optimization via grid search. The framework proposed in this paper can be adapted to other structures besides trees, e.g., strings and graphs, thereby extending the utility of kernel-based methods."
Ask Me Anything: Dynamic Memory Networks for Natural Language Processing,"Most tasks in natural language processing can be cast into question answering (QA) problems over language input. We introduce the dynamic memory network (DMN), a neural network architecture which processes input sequences and questions, forms episodic memories, and generates relevant answers. Questions trigger an iterative attention process which allows the model to condition its attention on the inputs and the result of previous iterations. These results are then reasoned over in a hierarchical recurrent sequence model to generate answers. The DMN can be trained end-to-end and obtains state-of-the-art results on several types of tasks and datasets: question answering (Facebook's bAbI dataset), text classification for sentiment analysis (Stanford Sentiment Treebank) and sequence modeling for part-of-speech tagging (WSJ-PTB). The training for these different tasks relies exclusively on trained word vector representations and input-question-answer triplets."
Gap Analysis of Natural Language Processing Systems with respect to Linguistic Modality,"Modality is one of the important components of grammar in linguistics. It lets speaker to express attitude towards, or give assessment or potentiality of state of affairs. It implies different senses and thus has different perceptions as per the context. This paper presents an account showing the gap in the functionality of the current state of art Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems. The contextual nature of linguistic modality is studied. In this paper, the works and logical approaches employed by Natural Language Processing systems dealing with modality are reviewed. It sees human cognition and intelligence as multi-layered approach that can be implemented by intelligent systems for learning. Lastly, current flow of research going on within this field is talked providing futurology."
Towards Easier and Faster Sequence Labeling for Natural Language Processing: A Search-based Probabilistic Online Learning Framework (SAPO),"There are two major approaches for sequence labeling. One is the probabilistic gradient-based methods such as conditional random fields (CRF) and neural networks (e.g., RNN), which have high accuracy but drawbacks: slow training, and no support of search-based optimization (which is important in many cases). The other is the search-based learning methods such as structured perceptron and margin infused relaxed algorithm (MIRA), which have fast training but also drawbacks: low accuracy, no probabilistic information, and non-convergence in real-world tasks. We propose a novel and ""easy"" solution, a search-based probabilistic online learning method, to address most of those issues. The method is ""easy"", because the optimization algorithm at the training stage is as simple as the decoding algorithm at the test stage. This method searches the output candidates, derives probabilities, and conducts efficient online learning. We show that this method with fast training and theoretical guarantee of convergence, which is easy to implement, can support search-based optimization and obtain top accuracy. Experiments on well-known tasks show that our method has better accuracy than CRF and BiLSTM\footnote{The SAPO code is released at \url{https://github.com/lancopku/SAPO}.}."
Open System Categorical Quantum Semantics in Natural Language Processing,"Originally inspired by categorical quantum mechanics (Abramsky and Coecke, LiCS'04), the categorical compositional distributional model of natural language meaning of Coecke, Sadrzadeh and Clark provides a conceptually motivated procedure to compute the meaning of a sentence, given its grammatical structure within a Lambek pregroup and a vectorial representation of the meaning of its parts. The predictions of this first model have outperformed that of other models in mainstream empirical language processing tasks on large scale data. Moreover, just like CQM allows for varying the model in which we interpret quantum axioms, one can also vary the model in which we interpret word meaning.  In this paper we show that further developments in categorical quantum mechanics are relevant to natural language processing too. Firstly, Selinger's CPM-construction allows for explicitly taking into account lexical ambiguity and distinguishing between the two inherently different notions of homonymy and polysemy. In terms of the model in which we interpret word meaning, this means a passage from the vector space model to density matrices. Despite this change of model, standard empirical methods for comparing meanings can be easily adopted, which we demonstrate by a small-scale experiment on real-world data. This experiment moreover provides preliminary evidence of the validity of our proposed new model for word meaning.  Secondly, commutative classical structures as well as their non-commutative counterparts that arise in the image of the CPM-construction allow for encoding relative pronouns, verbs and adjectives, and finally, iteration of the CPM-construction, something that has no counterpart in the quantum realm, enables one to accommodate both entailment and ambiguity."
Optimisation using Natural Language Processing: Personalized Tour Recommendation for Museums,This paper proposes a new method to provide personalized tour recommendation for museum visits. It combines an optimization of preference criteria of visitors with an automatic extraction of artwork importance from museum information based on Natural Language Processing using textual energy. This project includes researchers from computer and social sciences. Some results are obtained with numerical experiments. They show that our model clearly improves the satisfaction of the visitor who follows the proposed tour. This work foreshadows some interesting outcomes and applications about on-demand personalized visit of museums in a very near future.
A perspective on the advancement of natural language processing tasks via topological analysis of complex networks,"Comment on ""Approaching human language with complex networks"" by Cong and Liu (Physics of Life Reviews, Volume 11, Issue 4, December 2014, Pages 598-618)."
Semi-supervised Classification for Natural Language Processing,"Semi-supervised classification is an interesting idea where classification models are learned from both labeled and unlabeled data. It has several advantages over supervised classification in natural language processing domain. For instance, supervised classification exploits only labeled data that are expensive, often difficult to get, inadequate in quantity, and require human experts for annotation. On the other hand, unlabeled data are inexpensive and abundant. Despite the fact that many factors limit the wide-spread use of semi-supervised classification, it has become popular since its level of performance is empirically as good as supervised classification. This study explores the possibilities and achievements as well as complexity and limitations of semi-supervised classification for several natural langue processing tasks like parsing, biomedical information processing, text classification, and summarization."
Controlled Natural Language Processing as Answer Set Programming: an Experiment,"Most controlled natural languages (CNLs) are processed with the help of a pipeline architecture that relies on different software components. We investigate in this paper in an experimental way how well answer set programming (ASP) is suited as a unifying framework for parsing a CNL, deriving a formal representation for the resulting syntax trees, and for reasoning with that representation. We start from a list of input tokens in ASP notation and show how this input can be transformed into a syntax tree using an ASP grammar and then into reified ASP rules in form of a set of facts. These facts are then processed by an ASP meta-interpreter that allows us to infer new knowledge."
Architecture of a Web-based Predictive Editor for Controlled Natural Language Processing,"In this paper, we describe the architecture of a web-based predictive text editor being developed for the controlled natural language PENG^{ASP). This controlled language can be used to write non-monotonic specifications that have the same expressive power as Answer Set Programs. In order to support the writing process of these specifications, the predictive text editor communicates asynchronously with the controlled natural language processor that generates lookahead categories and additional auxiliary information for the author of a specification text. The text editor can display multiple sets of lookahead categories simultaneously for different possible sentence completions, anaphoric expressions, and supports the addition of new content words to the lexicon."
Autonomous requirements specification processing using natural language processing,"We describe our ongoing research that centres on the application of natural language processing (NLP) to software engineering and systems development activities. In particular, this paper addresses the use of NLP in the requirements analysis and systems design processes. We have developed a prototype toolset that can assist the systems analyst or software engineer to select and verify terms relevant to a project. In this paper we describe the processes employed by the system to extract and classify objects of interest from requirements documents. These processes are illustrated using a small example."
A Tutorial on Dual Decomposition and Lagrangian Relaxation for Inference in Natural Language Processing,"Dual decomposition, and more generally Lagrangian relaxation, is a classical method for combinatorial optimization; it has recently been applied to several inference problems in natural language processing (NLP). This tutorial gives an overview of the technique. We describe example algorithms, describe formal guarantees for the method, and describe practical issues in implementing the algorithms. While our examples are predominantly drawn from the NLP literature, the material should be of general relevance to inference problems in machine learning. A central theme of this tutorial is that Lagrangian relaxation is naturally applied in conjunction with a broad class of combinatorial algorithms, allowing inference in models that go significantly beyond previous work on Lagrangian relaxation for inference in graphical models."
Wikipedia-based Semantic Interpretation for Natural Language Processing,"Adequate representation of natural language semantics requires access to vast amounts of common sense and domain-specific world knowledge. Prior work in the field was based on purely statistical techniques that did not make use of background knowledge, on limited lexicographic knowledge bases such as WordNet, or on huge manual efforts such as the CYC project. Here we propose a novel method, called Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA), for fine-grained semantic interpretation of unrestricted natural language texts. Our method represents meaning in a high-dimensional space of concepts derived from Wikipedia, the largest encyclopedia in existence. We explicitly represent the meaning of any text in terms of Wikipedia-based concepts. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method on text categorization and on computing the degree of semantic relatedness between fragments of natural language text. Using ESA results in significant improvements over the previous state of the art in both tasks. Importantly, due to the use of natural concepts, the ESA model is easy to explain to human users."
Natural Language Processing in Biomedicine: A Unified System Architecture Overview,"In modern electronic medical records (EMR) much of the clinically important data - signs and symptoms, symptom severity, disease status, etc. - are not provided in structured data fields, but rather are encoded in clinician generated narrative text. Natural language processing (NLP) provides a means of ""unlocking"" this important data source for applications in clinical decision support, quality assurance, and public health. This chapter provides an overview of representative NLP systems in biomedicine based on a unified architectural view. A general architecture in an NLP system consists of two main components: background knowledge that includes biomedical knowledge resources and a framework that integrates NLP tools to process text. Systems differ in both components, which we will review briefly. Additionally, challenges facing current research efforts in biomedical NLP include the paucity of large, publicly available annotated corpora, although initiatives that facilitate data sharing, system evaluation, and collaborative work between researchers in clinical NLP are starting to emerge."
NILE: Fast Natural Language Processing for Electronic Health Records,"Objective: Narrative text in Electronic health records (EHR) contain rich information for medical and data science studies. This paper introduces the design and performance of Narrative Information Linear Extraction (NILE), a natural language processing (NLP) package for EHR analysis that we share with the medical informatics community. Methods: NILE uses a modified prefix-tree search algorithm for named entity recognition, which can detect prefix and suffix sharing. The semantic analyses are implemented as rule-based finite state machines. Analyses include negation, location, modification, family history, and ignoring. Result: The processing speed of NILE is hundreds to thousands times faster than existing NLP software for medical text. The accuracy of presence analysis of NILE is on par with the best performing models on the 2010 i2b2/VA NLP challenge data. Conclusion: The speed, accuracy, and being able to operate via API make NILE a valuable addition to the NLP software for medical informatics and data science."
Tagging Scientific Publications using Wikipedia and Natural Language Processing Tools. Comparison on the ArXiv Dataset,"In this work, we compare two simple methods of tagging scientific publications with labels reflecting their content. As a first source of labels Wikipedia is employed, second label set is constructed from the noun phrases occurring in the analyzed corpus. We examine the statistical properties and the effectiveness of both approaches on the dataset consisting of abstracts from 0.7 million of scientific documents deposited in the ArXiv preprint collection. We believe that obtained tags can be later on applied as useful document features in various machine learning tasks (document similarity, clustering, topic modelling, etc.)."
The Quantum Challenge in Concept Theory and Natural Language Processing,"The mathematical formalism of quantum theory has been successfully used in human cognition to model decision processes and to deliver representations of human knowledge. As such, quantum cognition inspired tools have improved technologies for Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval. In this paper, we overview the quantum cognition approach developed in our Brussels team during the last two decades, specifically our identification of quantum structures in human concepts and language, and the modeling of data from psychological and corpus-text-based experiments. We discuss our quantum-theoretic framework for concepts and their conjunctions/disjunctions in a Fock-Hilbert space structure, adequately modeling a large amount of data collected on concept combinations. Inspired by this modeling, we put forward elements for a quantum contextual and meaning-based approach to information technologies in which 'entities of meaning' are inversely reconstructed from texts, which are considered as traces of these entities' states."
PyPLN: a Distributed Platform for Natural Language Processing,"This paper presents a distributed platform for Natural Language Processing called PyPLN. PyPLN leverages a vast array of NLP and text processing open source tools, managing the distribution of the workload on a variety of configurations: from a single server to a cluster of linux servers. PyPLN is developed using Python 2.7.3 but makes it very easy to incorporate other softwares for specific tasks as long as a linux version is available. PyPLN facilitates analyses both at document and corpus level, simplifying management and publication of corpora and analytical results through an easy to use web interface. In the current (beta) release, it supports English and Portuguese languages with support to other languages planned for future releases. To support the Portuguese language PyPLN uses the PALAVRAS parser\citep{Bick2000}. Currently PyPLN offers the following features: Text extraction with encoding normalization (to UTF-8), part-of-speech tagging, token frequency, semantic annotation, n-gram extraction, word and sentence repertoire, and full-text search across corpora. The platform is licensed as GPL-v3."
A Rhetorical Analysis Approach to Natural Language Processing,"The goal of this research was to find a way to extend the capabilities of computers through the processing of language in a more human way, and present applications which demonstrate the power of this method. This research presents a novel approach, Rhetorical Analysis, to solving problems in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The main benefit of Rhetorical Analysis, as opposed to previous approaches, is that it does not require the accumulation of large sets of training data, but can be used to solve a multitude of problems within the field of NLP. The NLP problems investigated with Rhetorical Analysis were the Author Identification problem - predicting the author of a piece of text based on its rhetorical strategies, Election Prediction - predicting the winner of a presidential candidate's re-election campaign based on rhetorical strategies within that president's inaugural address, Natural Language Generation - having a computer produce text containing rhetorical strategies, and Document Summarization. The results of this research indicate that an Author Identification system based on Rhetorical Analysis could predict the correct author 100% of the time, that a re-election predictor based on Rhetorical Analysis could predict the correct winner of a re-election campaign 55% of the time, that a Natural Language Generation system based on Rhetorical Analysis could output text with up to 87.3% similarity to Shakespeare in style, and that a Document Summarization system based on Rhetorical Analysis could extract highly relevant sentences. Overall, this study demonstrated that Rhetorical Analysis could be a useful approach to solving problems in NLP."
Language Without Words: A Pointillist Model for Natural Language Processing,"This paper explores two separate questions: Can we perform natural language processing tasks without a lexicon?; and, Should we? Existing natural language processing techniques are either based on words as units or use units such as grams only for basic classification tasks. How close can a machine come to reasoning about the meanings of words and phrases in a corpus without using any lexicon, based only on grams?  Our own motivation for posing this question is based on our efforts to find popular trends in words and phrases from online Chinese social media. This form of written Chinese uses so many neologisms, creative character placements, and combinations of writing systems that it has been dubbed the ""Martian Language."" Readers must often use visual queues, audible queues from reading out loud, and their knowledge and understanding of current events to understand a post. For analysis of popular trends, the specific problem is that it is difficult to build a lexicon when the invention of new ways to refer to a word or concept is easy and common. For natural language processing in general, we argue in this paper that new uses of language in social media will challenge machines' abilities to operate with words as the basic unit of understanding, not only in Chinese but potentially in other languages."
Natural Language Processing - A Survey,"The utility and power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) seems destined to change our technological society in profound and fundamental ways. However there are, to date, few accessible descriptions of the science of NLP that have been written for a popular audience, or even for an audience of intelligent, but uninitiated scientists. This paper aims to provide just such an overview. In short, the objective of this article is to describe the purpose, procedures and practical applications of NLP in a clear, balanced, and readable way. We will examine the most recent literature describing the methods and processes of NLP, analyze some of the challenges that researchers are faced with, and briefly survey some of the current and future applications of this science to IT research in general."
Recent Technological Advances in Natural Language Processing and Artificial Intelligence,"A recent advance in computer technology has permitted scientists to implement and test algorithms that were known from quite some time (or not) but which were computationally expensive. Two such projects are IBM's Jeopardy as a part of its DeepQA project [1] and Wolfram's Wolframalpha[2]. Both these methods implement natural language processing (another goal of AI scientists) and try to answer questions as asked by the user. Though the goal of the two projects is similar, both of them have a different procedure at it's core. In the following sections, the mechanism and history of IBM's Jeopardy and Wolfram alpha has been explained followed by the implications of these projects in realizing Ray Kurzweil's [3] dream of passing the Turing test by 2029. A recipe of taking the above projects to a new level is also explained."
A Pointillism Approach for Natural Language Processing of Social Media,"The Chinese language poses challenges for natural language processing based on the unit of a word even for formal uses of the Chinese language, social media only makes word segmentation in Chinese even more difficult. In this document we propose a pointillism approach to natural language processing. Rather than words that have individual meanings, the basic unit of a pointillism approach is trigrams of characters. These grams take on meaning in aggregate when they appear together in a way that is correlated over time.  Our results from three kinds of experiments show that when words and topics do have a meme-like trend, they can be reconstructed from only trigrams. For example, for 4-character idioms that appear at least 99 times in one day in our data, the unconstrained precision (that is, precision that allows for deviation from a lexicon when the result is just as correct as the lexicon version of the word or phrase) is 0.93. For longer words and phrases collected from Wiktionary, including neologisms, the unconstrained precision is 0.87. We consider these results to be very promising, because they suggest that it is feasible for a machine to reconstruct complex idioms, phrases, and neologisms with good precision without any notion of words. Thus the colorful and baroque uses of language that typify social media in challenging languages such as Chinese may in fact be accessible to machines."
Roget's Thesaurus as a Lexical Resource for Natural Language Processing,"WordNet proved that it is possible to construct a large-scale electronic lexical database on the principles of lexical semantics. It has been accepted and used extensively by computational linguists ever since it was released. Inspired by WordNet's success, we propose as an alternative a similar resource, based on the 1987 Penguin edition of Roget's Thesaurus of English Words and Phrases.  Peter Mark Roget published his first Thesaurus over 150 years ago. Countless writers, orators and students of the English language have used it. Computational linguists have employed Roget's for almost 50 years in Natural Language Processing, however hesitated in accepting Roget's Thesaurus because a proper machine tractable version was not available.  This dissertation presents an implementation of a machine-tractable version of the 1987 Penguin edition of Roget's Thesaurus - the first implementation of its kind to use an entire current edition. It explains the steps necessary for taking a machine-readable file and transforming it into a tractable system. This involves converting the lexical material into a format that can be more easily exploited, identifying data structures and designing classes to computerize the Thesaurus. Roget's organization is studied in detail and contrasted with WordNet's.  We show two applications of the computerized Thesaurus: computing semantic similarity between words and phrases, and building lexical chains in a text. The experiments are performed using well-known benchmarks and the results are compared to those of other systems that use Roget's, WordNet and statistical techniques. Roget's has turned out to be an excellent resource for measuring semantic similarity; lexical chains are easily built but more difficult to evaluate. We also explain ways in which Roget's Thesaurus and WordNet can be combined."
IDL-Expressions: A Formalism for Representing and Parsing Finite Languages in Natural Language Processing,"We  propose  a  formalism  for  representation  of  finite  languages, referred to  as the class of IDL-expressions,  which combines concepts that were  only considered in  isolation in existing  formalisms.  The suggested  applications  are  in  natural  language  processing,  more specifically  in surface  natural language  generation and  in machine translation, where a sentence is  obtained by first generating a large set of candidate sentences, represented  in a compact way, and then by filtering  such a  set  through  a parser.   We  study several  formal properties of IDL-expressions and compare this new formalism with more standard  ones.   We  also  present  a  novel  parsing  algorithm  for IDL-expressions  and  prove a  non-trivial  upper  bound  on its  time complexity."
Natural Language Processing (almost) from Scratch,"We propose a unified neural network architecture and learning algorithm that can be applied to various natural language processing tasks including: part-of-speech tagging, chunking, named entity recognition, and semantic role labeling. This versatility is achieved by trying to avoid task-specific engineering and therefore disregarding a lot of prior knowledge. Instead of exploiting man-made input features carefully optimized for each task, our system learns internal representations on the basis of vast amounts of mostly unlabeled training data. This work is then used as a basis for building a freely available tagging system with good performance and minimal computational requirements."
Fuzzy Modeling and Natural Language Processing for Panini's Sanskrit Grammar,"Indian languages have long history in World Natural languages. Panini was the first to define Grammar for Sanskrit language with about 4000 rules in fifth century. These rules contain uncertainty information. It is not possible to Computer processing of Sanskrit language with uncertain information. In this paper, fuzzy logic and fuzzy reasoning are proposed to deal to eliminate uncertain information for reasoning with Sanskrit grammar. The Sanskrit language processing is also discussed in this paper."

Document Searching System based on Natural Language Query Processing for Vietnam Open Courseware Library,"The necessary of buiding the searching system being able to support users expressing their searching by natural language queries is very important and opens the researching direction with many potential. It combines the traditional methods of information retrieval and the researching of Question Answering (QA). In this paper, we introduce a searching system built by us for searching courses on the Vietnam OpenCourseWare Program (VOCW). It can be considered as the first tool to be able to perform the user's Vietnamese questions. The experiment results are rather good when we evaluate this system on the precision"
Autogenic Training With Natural Language Processing Modules: A Recent Tool For Certain Neuro Cognitive Studies,"Learning to respond to voice-text input involves the subject's ability in understanding the phonetic and text based contents and his/her ability to communicate based on his/her experience. The neuro-cognitive facility of the subject has to support two important domains in order to make the learning process complete. In many cases, though the understanding is complete, the response is partial. This is one valid reason why we need to support the information from the subject with scalable techniques such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) for abstraction of the contents from the output. This paper explores the feasibility of using NLP modules interlaced with Neural Networks to perform the required task in autogenic training related to medical applications."
"""I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that"": Linguistics, Statistics, and Natural Language Processing circa 2001","A brief, general-audience overview of the history of natural language processing, focusing on data-driven approaches.Topics include ""Ambiguity and language analysis"", ""Firth things first"", ""A 'C' change"", and ""The empiricists strike back""."
Using the DIFF Command for Natural Language Processing,"Diff is a software program that detects differences between two data sets and is useful in natural language processing. This paper shows several examples of the application of diff. They include the detection of differences between two different datasets, extraction of rewriting rules, merging of two different datasets, and the optimal matching of two different data sets. Since diff comes with any standard UNIX system, it is readily available and very easy to use. Our studies showed that diff is a practical tool for research into natural language processing."
File mapping Rule-based DBMS and Natural Language Processing,"This paper describes the system of storage, extract and processing of information structured similarly to the natural language. For recursive inference the system uses the rules having the same representation, as the data. The environment of storage of information is provided with the File Mapping (SHM) mechanism of operating system. In the paper the main principles of construction of dynamic data structure and language for record of the inference rules are stated; the features of available implementation are considered and the description of the application realizing semantic information retrieval on the natural language is given."
Retrieval from Captioned Image Databases Using Natural Language Processing,"It might appear that natural language processing should improve the accuracy of information retrieval systems, by making available a more detailed analysis of queries and documents. Although past results appear to show that this is not so, if the focus is shifted to short phrases rather than full documents, the situation becomes somewhat different. The ANVIL system uses a natural language technique to obtain high accuracy retrieval of images which have been annotated with a descriptive textual caption. The natural language techniques also allow additional contextual information to be derived from the relation between the query and the caption, which can help users to understand the overall collection of retrieval results. The techniques have been successfully used in a information retrieval system which forms both a testbed for research and the basis of a commercial system."
Probabilistic Constraint Logic Programming. Formal Foundations of Quantitative and Statistical Inference in Constraint-Based Natural Language Processing,"In this thesis, we present two approaches to a rigorous mathematical and algorithmic foundation of quantitative and statistical inference in constraint-based natural language processing. The first approach, called quantitative constraint logic programming, is conceptualized in a clear logical framework, and presents a sound and complete system of quantitative inference for definite clauses annotated with subjective weights. This approach combines a rigorous formal semantics for quantitative inference based on subjective weights with efficient weight-based pruning for constraint-based systems. The second approach, called probabilistic constraint logic programming, introduces a log-linear probability distribution on the proof trees of a constraint logic program and an algorithm for statistical inference of the parameters and properties of such probability models from incomplete, i.e., unparsed data. The possibility of defining arbitrary properties of proof trees as properties of the log-linear probability model and efficiently estimating appropriate parameter values for them permits the probabilistic modeling of arbitrary context-dependencies in constraint logic programs. The usefulness of these ideas is evaluated empirically in a small-scale experiment on finding the correct parses of a constraint-based grammar. In addition, we address the problem of computational intractability of the calculation of expectations in the inference task and present various techniques to approximately solve this task. Moreover, we present an approximate heuristic technique for searching for the most probable analysis in probabilistic constraint logic programs."
Exploiting Diversity in Natural Language Processing: Combining Parsers,"Three state-of-the-art statistical parsers are combined to produce more accurate parses, as well as new bounds on achievable Treebank parsing accuracy. Two general approaches are presented and two combination techniques are described for each approach. Both parametric and non-parametric models are explored. The resulting parsers surpass the best previously published performance results for the Penn Treebank."
Mixed-Level Knowledge Representation and Variable-Depth Inference in Natural Language Processing,A system is described that uses a mixed-level knowledge representation based on standard Horn Clause Logic to represent (part of) the meaning of natural language documents. A variable-depth search strategy is outlined that distinguishes between the different levels of abstraction in the knowledge representation to locate specific passages in the documents. A detailed description of the linguistic aspects of the system is given. Mixed-level representations as well as variable-depth search strategies are applicable in fields outside that of NLP.
"Using Single Layer Networks for Discrete, Sequential Data: An Example from Natural Language Processing","A natural language parser which has been successfully implemented is described. This is a hybrid system, in which neural networks operate within a rule based framework. It can be accessed via telnet for users to try on their own text. (For details, contact the author.) Tested on technical manuals, the parser finds the subject and head of the subject in over 90% of declarative sentences.  The neural processing components belong to the class of Generalized Single Layer Networks (GSLN). In general, supervised, feed-forward networks need more than one layer to process data. However, in some cases data can be pre-processed with a non-linear transformation, and then presented in a linearly separable form for subsequent processing by a single layer net. Such networks offer advantages of functional transparency and operational speed.  For our parser, the initial stage of processing maps linguistic data onto a higher order representation, which can then be analysed by a single layer network. This transformation is supported by information theoretic analysis."
Similarity-Based Approaches to Natural Language Processing,"This thesis presents two similarity-based approaches to sparse data problems. The first approach is to build soft, hierarchical clusters: soft, because each event belongs to each cluster with some probability; hierarchical, because cluster centroids are iteratively split to model finer distinctions. Our second approach is a nearest-neighbor approach: instead of calculating a centroid for each class, as in the hierarchical clustering approach, we in essence build a cluster around each word. We compare several such nearest-neighbor approaches on a word sense disambiguation task and find that as a whole, their performance is far superior to that of standard methods. In another set of experiments, we show that using estimation techniques based on the nearest-neighbor model enables us to achieve perplexity reductions of more than 20 percent over standard techniques in the prediction of low-frequency events, and statistically significant speech recognition error-rate reduction."
The Theoretical Status of Ontologies in Natural Language Processing,"This paper discusses the use of `ontologies' in Natural Language Processing. It classifies various kinds of ontologies that have been employed in NLP and discusses various benefits and problems with those designs. Particular focus is then placed on experiences gained in the use of the Upper Model, a linguistically-motivated `ontology' originally designed for use with the Penman text generation system. Some proposals for further NLP ontology design criteria are then made."
Software Infrastructure for Natural Language Processing,"We classify and review current approaches to software infrastructure for research, development and delivery of NLP systems. The task is motivated by a discussion of current trends in the field of NLP and Language Engineering. We describe a system called GATE (a General Architecture for Text Engineering) that provides a software infrastructure on top of which heterogeneous NLP processing modules may be evaluated and refined individually, or may be combined into larger application systems. GATE aims to support both researchers and developers working on component technologies (e.g. parsing, tagging, morphological analysis) and those working on developing end-user applications (e.g. information extraction, text summarisation, document generation, machine translation, and second language learning). GATE promotes reuse of component technology, permits specialisation and collaboration in large-scale projects, and allows for the comparison and evaluation of alternative technologies. The first release of GATE is now available - see http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/research/groups/nlp/gate/"
TSNLP - Test Suites for Natural Language Processing,"The TSNLP project has investigated various aspects of the construction, maintenance and application of systematic test suites as diagnostic and evaluation tools for NLP applications. The paper summarizes the motivation and main results of the project: besides the solid methodological foundation, TSNLP has produced substantial multi-purpose and multi-user test suites for three European languages together with a set of specialized tools that facilitate the construction, extension, maintenance, retrieval, and customization of the test data. As TSNLP results, including the data and technology, are made publicly available, the project presents a valuable linguistic resourc e that has the potential of providing a wide-spread pre-standard diagnostic and evaluation tool for both developers and users of NLP applications."
Natural Language Processing: Structure and Complexity,"We introduce a method for analyzing the complexity of natural language processing tasks, and for predicting the difficulty new NLP tasks.  Our complexity measures are derived from the Kolmogorov complexity of a class of automata --- {\it meaning automata}, whose purpose is to extract relevant pieces of information from sentences. Natural language semantics is defined only relative to the set of questions an automaton can answer.  The paper shows examples of complexity estimates for various NLP programs and tasks, and some recipes for complexity management. It positions natural language processing as a subdomain of software engineering, and lays down its formal foundation."
"Natural language processing: she needs something old and something new (maybe something borrowed and something blue, too)","Given the present state of work in natural language processing, this address argues first, that advance in both science and applications requires a revival of concern about what language is about, broadly speaking the world; and second, that an attack on the summarising task, which is made ever more important by the growth of electronic text resources and requires an understanding of the role of large-scale discourse structure in marking important text content, is a good way forward."
Robust Processing of Natural Language,"Previous approaches to robustness in natural language processing usually treat deviant input by relaxing grammatical constraints whenever a successful analysis cannot be provided by ``normal'' means. This schema implies, that error detection always comes prior to error handling, a behaviour which hardly can compete with its human model, where many erroneous situations are treated without even noticing them. The paper analyses the necessary preconditions for achieving a higher degree of robustness in natural language processing and suggests a quite different approach based on a procedure for structural disambiguation. It not only offers the possibility to cope with robustness issues in a more natural way but eventually might be suited to accommodate quite different aspects of robust behaviour within a single framework."
Constraint Logic Programming for Natural Language Processing,"This paper proposes an evaluation of the adequacy of the constraint logic programming paradigm for natural language processing. Theoretical aspects of this question have been discussed in several works. We adopt here a pragmatic point of view and our argumentation relies on concrete solutions. Using actual contraints (in the CLP sense) is neither easy nor direct. However, CLP can improve parsing techniques in several aspects such as concision, control, efficiency or direct representation of linguistic formalism. This discussion is illustrated by several examples and the presentation of an HPSG parser."
