Quantum Natural Language Processing based Sentiment Analysis using lambeq Toolkit,"Sentiment classification is one the best use case of classical natural language processing (NLP) where we can witness its power in various daily life domains such as banking, business and marketing industry. We already know how classical AI and machine learning can change and improve technology. Quantum natural language processing (QNLP) is a young and gradually emerging technology which has the potential to provide quantum advantage for NLP tasks. In this paper we show the first application of QNLP for sentiment analysis and achieve perfect test set accuracy for three different kinds of simulations and a decent accuracy for experiments ran on a noisy quantum device. We utilize the lambeq QNLP toolkit and t|ket> by Cambridge Quantum (Quantinuum) to bring out the results."
Mapping ChatGPT in Mainstream Media: Early Quantitative Insights through Sentiment Analysis and Word Frequency Analysis,"The exponential growth in user acquisition and popularity of ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence(AI) powered chatbot, was accompanied by widespread mainstream media coverage. This article presents a quantitative data analysis of the early trends and sentiments revealed by conducting text mining and NLP methods onto a corpus of 10,902 mainstream news headlines related to the subject of ChatGPT and artificial intelligence, from the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022 to March 2023. The findings revealed in sentiment analysis, ChatGPT and artificial intelligence, were perceived more positively than negatively in the mainstream media. In regards to word frequency results, over sixty-five percent of the top frequency words were focused on Big Tech issues and actors while topics such as jobs, diversity, ethics, copyright, gender and women were poorly represented or completely absent and only accounted for six percent of the total corpus. This article is a critical analysis into the power structures and collusions between Big Tech and Big Media in their matrix of domination."
RuSentNE-2023: Evaluating Entity-Oriented Sentiment Analysis on Russian News Texts,"The paper describes the RuSentNE-2023 evaluation devoted to targeted sentiment analysis in Russian news texts. The task is to predict sentiment towards a named entity in a single sentence. The dataset for RuSentNE-2023 evaluation is based on the Russian news corpus RuSentNE having rich sentiment-related annotation. The corpus is annotated with named entities and sentiments towards these entities, along with related effects and emotional states. The evaluation was organized using the CodaLab competition framework. The main evaluation measure was macro-averaged measure of positive and negative classes. The best results achieved were of 66% Macro F-measure (Positive+Negative classes). We also tested ChatGPT on the test set from our evaluation and found that the zero-shot answers provided by ChatGPT reached 60% of the F-measure, which corresponds to 4th place in the evaluation. ChatGPT also provided detailed explanations of its conclusion. This can be considered as quite high for zero-shot application."
Sentiment Analysis Using Aligned Word Embeddings for Uralic Languages,"In this paper, we present an approach for translating word embeddings from a majority language into 4 minority languages: Erzya, Moksha, Udmurt and Komi-Zyrian. Furthermore, we align these word embeddings and present a novel neural network model that is trained on English data to conduct sentiment analysis and then applied on endangered language data through the aligned word embeddings. To test our model, we annotated a small sentiment analysis corpus for the 4 endangered languages and Finnish. Our method reached at least 56\% accuracy for each endangered language. The models and the sentiment corpus will be released together with this paper. Our research shows that state-of-the-art neural models can be used with endangered languages with the only requirement being a dictionary between the endangered language and a majority language."
Sentiment Analysis in the Era of Large Language Models: A Reality Check,"Sentiment analysis (SA) has been a long-standing research area in natural language processing. It can offer rich insights into human sentiments and opinions and has thus seen considerable interest from both academia and industry. With the advent of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, there is a great potential for their employment on SA problems. However, the extent to which existing LLMs can be leveraged for different sentiment analysis tasks remains unclear. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive investigation into the capabilities of LLMs in performing various sentiment analysis tasks, from conventional sentiment classification to aspect-based sentiment analysis and multifaceted analysis of subjective texts. We evaluate performance across 13 tasks on 26 datasets and compare the results against small language models (SLMs) trained on domain-specific datasets. Our study reveals that while LLMs demonstrate satisfactory performance in simpler tasks, they lag behind in more complex tasks requiring deeper understanding or structured sentiment information. However, LLMs significantly outperform SLMs in few-shot learning settings, suggesting their potential when annotation resources are limited. We also highlight the limitations of current evaluation practices in assessing LLMs' SA abilities and propose a novel benchmark, \textsc{SentiEval}, for a more comprehensive and realistic evaluation. Data and code during our investigations are available at \url{https://github.com/DAMO-NLP-SG/LLM-Sentiment}."
Exploring Sentiment Analysis Techniques in Natural Language Processing: A Comprehensive Review,"Sentiment analysis (SA) is the automated process of detecting and understanding the emotions conveyed through written text. Over the past decade, SA has gained significant popularity in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). With the widespread use of social media and online platforms, SA has become crucial for companies to gather customer feedback and shape their marketing strategies. Additionally, researchers rely on SA to analyze public sentiment on various topics. In this particular research study, a comprehensive survey was conducted to explore the latest trends and techniques in SA. The survey encompassed a wide range of methods, including lexicon-based, graph-based, network-based, machine learning, deep learning, ensemble-based, rule-based, and hybrid techniques. The paper also addresses the challenges and opportunities in SA, such as dealing with sarcasm and irony, analyzing multi-lingual data, and addressing ethical concerns. To provide a practical case study, Twitter was chosen as one of the largest online social media platforms. Furthermore, the researchers shed light on the diverse application areas of SA, including social media, healthcare, marketing, finance, and politics. The paper also presents a comparative and comprehensive analysis of existing trends and techniques, datasets, and evaluation metrics. The ultimate goal is to offer researchers and practitioners a systematic review of SA techniques, identify existing gaps, and suggest possible improvements. This study aims to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of SA processes, leading to smoother and error-free outcomes."
Support for Stock Trend Prediction Using Transformers and Sentiment Analysis,"Stock trend analysis has been an influential time-series prediction topic due to its lucrative and inherently chaotic nature. Many models looking to accurately predict the trend of stocks have been based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). However, due to the limitations of RNNs, such as gradient vanish and long-term dependencies being lost as sequence length increases, in this paper we develop a Transformer based model that uses technical stock data and sentiment analysis to conduct accurate stock trend prediction over long time windows. This paper also introduces a novel dataset containing daily technical stock data and top news headline data spanning almost three years. Stock prediction based solely on technical data can suffer from lag caused by the inability of stock indicators to effectively factor in breaking market news. The use of sentiment analysis on top headlines can help account for unforeseen shifts in market conditions caused by news coverage. We measure the performance of our model against RNNs over sequence lengths spanning 5 business days to 30 business days to mimic different length trading strategies. This reveals an improvement in directional accuracy over RNNs as sequence length is increased, with the largest improvement being close to 18.63% at 30 business days."
Cross-Attention is Not Enough: Incongruity-Aware Multimodal Sentiment Analysis and Emotion Recognition,"Fusing multiple modalities for affective computing tasks has proven effective for performance improvement. However, how multimodal fusion works is not well understood, and its use in the real world usually results in large model sizes. In this work, on sentiment and emotion analysis, we first analyze how the salient affective information in one modality can be affected by the other in crossmodal attention. We find that inter-modal incongruity exists at the latent level due to crossmodal attention. Based on this finding, we propose a lightweight model via Hierarchical Crossmodal Transformer with Modality Gating (HCT-MG), which determines a primary modality according to its contribution to the target task and then hierarchically incorporates auxiliary modalities to alleviate inter-modal incongruity and reduce information redundancy. The experimental evaluation on three benchmark datasets: CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and IEMOCAP verifies the efficacy of our approach, showing that it: 1) outperforms major prior work by achieving competitive results and can successfully recognize hard samples; 2) mitigates the inter-modal incongruity at the latent level when modalities have mismatched affective tendencies; 3) reduces model size to less than 1M parameters while outperforming existing models of similar sizes."
Cross-lingual Transfer Can Worsen Bias in Sentiment Analysis,"Sentiment analysis (SA) systems are widely deployed in many of the world's languages, and there is well-documented evidence of demographic bias in these systems. In languages beyond English, scarcer training data is often supplemented with transfer learning using pre-trained models, including multilingual models trained on other languages. In some cases, even supervision data comes from other languages. Does cross-lingual transfer also import new biases? To answer this question, we use counterfactual evaluation to test whether gender or racial biases are imported when using cross-lingual transfer, compared to a monolingual transfer setting. Across five languages, we find that systems using cross-lingual transfer usually become more biased than their monolingual counterparts. We also find racial biases to be much more prevalent than gender biases. To spur further research on this topic, we release the sentiment models we used for this study, and the intermediate checkpoints throughout training, yielding 1,525 distinct models; we also release our evaluation code."
SEntFiN 1.0: Entity-Aware Sentiment Analysis for Financial News,"Fine-grained financial sentiment analysis on news headlines is a challenging task requiring human-annotated datasets to achieve high performance. Limited studies have tried to address the sentiment extraction task in a setting where multiple entities are present in a news headline. In an effort to further research in this area, we make publicly available SEntFiN 1.0, a human-annotated dataset of 10,753 news headlines with entity-sentiment annotations, of which 2,847 headlines contain multiple entities, often with conflicting sentiments. We augment our dataset with a database of over 1,000 financial entities and their various representations in news media amounting to over 5,000 phrases. We propose a framework that enables the extraction of entity-relevant sentiments using a feature-based approach rather than an expression-based approach. For sentiment extraction, we utilize 12 different learning schemes utilizing lexicon-based and pre-trained sentence representations and five classification approaches. Our experiments indicate that lexicon-based n-gram ensembles are above par with pre-trained word embedding schemes such as GloVe. Overall, RoBERTa and finBERT (domain-specific BERT) achieve the highest average accuracy of 94.29% and F1-score of 93.27%. Further, using over 210,000 entity-sentiment predictions, we validate the economic effect of sentiments on aggregate market movements over a long duration."
Bias Beyond English: Counterfactual Tests for Bias in Sentiment Analysis in Four Languages,"Sentiment analysis (SA) systems are used in many products and hundreds of languages. Gender and racial biases are well-studied in English SA systems, but understudied in other languages, with few resources for such studies. To remedy this, we build a counterfactual evaluation corpus for gender and racial/migrant bias in four languages. We demonstrate its usefulness by answering a simple but important question that an engineer might need to answer when deploying a system: What biases do systems import from pre-trained models when compared to a baseline with no pre-training? Our evaluation corpus, by virtue of being counterfactual, not only reveals which models have less bias, but also pinpoints changes in model bias behaviour, which enables more targeted mitigation strategies. We release our code and evaluation corpora to facilitate future research."
Few-shot Joint Multimodal Aspect-Sentiment Analysis Based on Generative Multimodal Prompt,"We have witnessed the rapid proliferation of multimodal data on numerous social media platforms. Conventional studies typically require massive labeled data to train models for Multimodal Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (MABSA). However, collecting and annotating fine-grained multimodal data for MABSA is tough. To alleviate the above issue, we perform three MABSA-related tasks with quite a small number of labeled multimodal samples. We first build diverse and comprehensive multimodal few-shot datasets according to the data distribution. To capture the specific prompt for each aspect term in a few-shot scenario, we propose a novel Generative Multimodal Prompt (GMP) model for MABSA, which includes the Multimodal Encoder module and the N-Stream Decoders module. We further introduce a subtask to predict the number of aspect terms in each instance to construct the multimodal prompt. Extensive experiments on two datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms strong baselines on two MABSA-related tasks in the few-shot setting."
Bidirectional Generative Framework for Cross-domain Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis,"Cross-domain aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims to perform various fine-grained sentiment analysis tasks on a target domain by transferring knowledge from a source domain. Since labeled data only exists in the source domain, a model is expected to bridge the domain gap for tackling cross-domain ABSA. Though domain adaptation methods have proven to be effective, most of them are based on a discriminative model, which needs to be specifically designed for different ABSA tasks. To offer a more general solution, we propose a unified bidirectional generative framework to tackle various cross-domain ABSA tasks. Specifically, our framework trains a generative model in both text-to-label and label-to-text directions. The former transforms each task into a unified format to learn domain-agnostic features, and the latter generates natural sentences from noisy labels for data augmentation, with which a more accurate model can be trained. To investigate the effectiveness and generality of our framework, we conduct extensive experiments on four cross-domain ABSA tasks and present new state-of-the-art results on all tasks. Our data and code are publicly available at \url{https://github.com/DAMO-NLP-SG/BGCA}."
Shared and Private Information Learning in Multimodal Sentiment Analysis with Deep Modal Alignment and Self-supervised Multi-Task Learning,"Designing an effective representation learning method for multimodal sentiment analysis tasks is a crucial research direction. The challenge lies in learning both shared and private information in a complete modal representation, which is difficult with uniform multimodal labels and a raw feature fusion approach. In this work, we propose a deep modal shared information learning module based on the covariance matrix to capture the shared information between modalities. Additionally, we use a label generation module based on a self-supervised learning strategy to capture the private information of the modalities. Our module is plug-and-play in multimodal tasks, and by changing the parameterization, it can adjust the information exchange relationship between the modes and learn the private or shared information between the specified modes. We also employ a multi-task learning strategy to help the model focus its attention on the modal differentiation training data. We provide a detailed formulation derivation and feasibility proof for the design of the deep modal shared information learning module. We conduct extensive experiments on three common multimodal sentiment analysis baseline datasets, and the experimental results validate the reliability of our model. Furthermore, we explore more combinatorial techniques for the use of the module. Our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on most of the metrics of the three public datasets."
Multimodal Sentiment Analysis: A Survey,"Multimodal sentiment analysis has become an important research area in the field of artificial intelligence. With the latest advances in deep learning, this technology has reached new heights. It has great potential for both application and research, making it a popular research topic. This review provides an overview of the definition, background, and development of multimodal sentiment analysis. It also covers recent datasets and advanced models, emphasizing the challenges and future prospects of this technology. Finally, it looks ahead to future research directions. It should be noted that this review provides constructive suggestions for promising research directions and building better performing multimodal sentiment analysis models, which can help researchers in this field."
BanglaBook: A Large-scale Bangla Dataset for Sentiment Analysis from Book Reviews,"The analysis of consumer sentiment, as expressed through reviews, can provide a wealth of insight regarding the quality of a product. While the study of sentiment analysis has been widely explored in many popular languages, relatively less attention has been given to the Bangla language, mostly due to a lack of relevant data and cross-domain adaptability. To address this limitation, we present BanglaBook, a large-scale dataset of Bangla book reviews consisting of 158,065 samples classified into three broad categories: positive, negative, and neutral. We provide a detailed statistical analysis of the dataset and employ a range of machine learning models to establish baselines including SVM, LSTM, and Bangla-BERT. Our findings demonstrate a substantial performance advantage of pre-trained models over models that rely on manually crafted features, emphasizing the necessity for additional training resources in this domain. Additionally, we conduct an in-depth error analysis by examining sentiment unigrams, which may provide insight into common classification errors in under-resourced languages like Bangla. Our codes and data are publicly available at https://github.com/mohsinulkabir14/BanglaBook."
Interpretable multimodal sentiment analysis based on textual modality descriptions by using large-scale language models,"Multimodal sentiment analysis is an important area for understanding the user's internal states. Deep learning methods were effective, but the problem of poor interpretability has gradually gained attention. Previous works have attempted to use attention weights or vector distributions to provide interpretability. However, their explanations were not intuitive and can be influenced by different trained models. This study proposed a novel approach to provide interpretability by converting nonverbal modalities into text descriptions and by using large-scale language models for sentiment predictions. This provides an intuitive approach to directly interpret what models depend on with respect to making decisions from input texts, thus significantly improving interpretability. Specifically, we convert descriptions based on two feature patterns for the audio modality and discrete action units for the facial modality. Experimental results on two sentiment analysis tasks demonstrated that the proposed approach maintained, or even improved effectiveness for sentiment analysis compared to baselines using conventional features, with the highest improvement of 2.49% on the F1 score. The results also showed that multimodal descriptions have similar characteristics on fusing modalities as those of conventional fusion methods. The results demonstrated that the proposed approach is interpretable and effective for multimodal sentiment analysis."
CrudeBERT: Applying Economic Theory towards fine-tuning Transformer-based Sentiment Analysis Models to the Crude Oil Market,"Predicting market movements based on the sentiment of news media has a long tradition in data analysis. With advances in natural language processing, transformer architectures have emerged that enable contextually aware sentiment classification. Nevertheless, current methods built for the general financial market such as FinBERT cannot distinguish asset-specific value-driving factors. This paper addresses this shortcoming by presenting a method that identifies and classifies events that impact supply and demand in the crude oil markets within a large corpus of relevant news headlines. We then introduce CrudeBERT, a new sentiment analysis model that draws upon these events to contextualize and fine-tune FinBERT, thereby yielding improved sentiment classifications for headlines related to the crude oil futures market. An extensive evaluation demonstrates that CrudeBERT outperforms proprietary and open-source solutions in the domain of crude oil."
Structured Sentiment Analysis as Transition-based Dependency Parsing,"Structured sentiment analysis (SSA) aims to automatically extract people's opinions from a text in natural language and adequately represent that information in a graph structure. One of the most accurate methods for performing SSA was recently proposed and consists of approaching it as a dependency parsing task. Although we can find in the literature how transition-based algorithms excel in dependency parsing in terms of accuracy and efficiency, all proposed attempts to tackle SSA following that approach were based on graph-based models. In this article, we present the first transition-based method to address SSA as dependency parsing. Specifically, we design a transition system that processes the input text in a left-to-right pass, incrementally generating the graph structure containing all identified opinions. To effectively implement our final transition-based model, we resort to a Pointer Network architecture as a backbone. From an extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that our model offers the best performance to date in practically all cases among prior dependency-based methods, and surpass recent task-specific techniques on the most challenging datasets. We additionally include an in-depth analysis and empirically prove that the overall time-complexity cost of our approach is quadratic in the sentence length, being more efficient than top-performing graph-based parsers."
"The MuSe 2023 Multimodal Sentiment Analysis Challenge: Mimicked Emotions, Cross-Cultural Humour, and Personalisation","The MuSe 2023 is a set of shared tasks addressing three different contemporary multimodal affect and sentiment analysis problems: In the Mimicked Emotions Sub-Challenge (MuSe-Mimic), participants predict three continuous emotion targets. This sub-challenge utilises the Hume-Vidmimic dataset comprising of user-generated videos. For the Cross-Cultural Humour Detection Sub-Challenge (MuSe-Humour), an extension of the Passau Spontaneous Football Coach Humour (Passau-SFCH) dataset is provided. Participants predict the presence of spontaneous humour in a cross-cultural setting. The Personalisation Sub-Challenge (MuSe-Personalisation) is based on the Ulm-Trier Social Stress Test (Ulm-TSST) dataset, featuring recordings of subjects in a stressed situation. Here, arousal and valence signals are to be predicted, whereas parts of the test labels are made available in order to facilitate personalisation. MuSe 2023 seeks to bring together a broad audience from different research communities such as audio-visual emotion recognition, natural language processing, signal processing, and health informatics. In this baseline paper, we introduce the datasets, sub-challenges, and provided feature sets. As a competitive baseline system, a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)-Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is employed. On the respective sub-challenges' test datasets, it achieves a mean (across three continuous intensity targets) Pearson's Correlation Coefficient of .4727 for MuSe-Mimic, an Area Under the Curve (AUC) value of .8310 for MuSe-Humor and Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) values of .7482 for arousal and .7827 for valence in the MuSe-Personalisation sub-challenge."
New Adversarial Image Detection Based on Sentiment Analysis,"Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial examples, while adversarial attack models, e.g., DeepFool, are on the rise and outrunning adversarial example detection techniques. This paper presents a new adversarial example detector that outperforms state-of-the-art detectors in identifying the latest adversarial attacks on image datasets. Specifically, we propose to use sentiment analysis for adversarial example detection, qualified by the progressively manifesting impact of an adversarial perturbation on the hidden-layer feature maps of a DNN under attack. Accordingly, we design a modularized embedding layer with the minimum learnable parameters to embed the hidden-layer feature maps into word vectors and assemble sentences ready for sentiment analysis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the new detector consistently surpasses the state-of-the-art detection algorithms in detecting the latest attacks launched against ResNet and Inception neutral networks on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and SVHN datasets. The detector only has about 2 million parameters, and takes shorter than 4.6 milliseconds to detect an adversarial example generated by the latest attack models using a Tesla K80 GPU card."
Stars Are All You Need: A Distantly Supervised Pyramid Network for Document-Level End-to-End Sentiment Analysis,"In this paper, we propose document-level end-to-end sentiment analysis to efficiently understand aspect and review sentiment expressed in online reviews in a unified manner. In particular, we assume that star rating labels are a ""coarse-grained synthesis"" of aspect ratings across in the review. We propose a Distantly Supervised Pyramid Network (DSPN) to efficiently perform Aspect-Category Detection, Aspect-Category Sentiment Analysis, and Rating Prediction using only document star rating labels for training. By performing these three related sentiment subtasks in an end-to-end manner, DSPN can extract aspects mentioned in the review, identify the corresponding sentiments, and predict the star rating labels. We evaluate DSPN on multi-aspect review datasets in English and Chinese and find that with only star rating labels for supervision, DSPN can perform comparably well to a variety of benchmark models. We also demonstrate the interpretability of DSPN's outputs on reviews to show the pyramid structure inherent in document level end-to-end sentiment analysis."
NLNDE at SemEval-2023 Task 12: Adaptive Pretraining and Source Language Selection for Low-Resource Multilingual Sentiment Analysis,"This paper describes our system developed for the SemEval-2023 Task 12 ""Sentiment Analysis for Low-resource African Languages using Twitter Dataset"". Sentiment analysis is one of the most widely studied applications in natural language processing. However, most prior work still focuses on a small number of high-resource languages. Building reliable sentiment analysis systems for low-resource languages remains challenging, due to the limited training data in this task. In this work, we propose to leverage language-adaptive and task-adaptive pretraining on African texts and study transfer learning with source language selection on top of an African language-centric pretrained language model. Our key findings are: (1) Adapting the pretrained model to the target language and task using a small yet relevant corpus improves performance remarkably by more than 10 F1 score points. (2) Selecting source languages with positive transfer gains during training can avoid harmful interference from dissimilar languages, leading to better results in multilingual and cross-lingual settings. In the shared task, our system wins 8 out of 15 tracks and, in particular, performs best in the multilingual evaluation."
Entity-Level Sentiment Analysis (ELSA): An exploratory task survey,"This paper explores the task of identifying the overall sentiment expressed towards volitional entities (persons and organizations) in a document -- what we refer to as Entity-Level Sentiment Analysis (ELSA). While identifying sentiment conveyed towards an entity is well researched for shorter texts like tweets, we find little to no research on this specific task for longer texts with multiple mentions and opinions towards the same entity. This lack of research would be understandable if ELSA can be derived from existing tasks and models. To assess this, we annotate a set of professional reviews for their overall sentiment towards each volitional entity in the text. We sample from data already annotated for document-level, sentence-level, and target-level sentiment in a multi-domain review corpus, and our results indicate that there is no single proxy task that provides this overall sentiment we seek for the entities at a satisfactory level of performance. We present a suite of experiments aiming to assess the contribution towards ELSA provided by document-, sentence-, and target-level sentiment analysis, and provide a discussion of their shortcomings. We show that sentiment in our dataset is expressed not only with an entity mention as target, but also towards targets with a sentiment-relevant relation to a volitional entity. In our data, these relations extend beyond anaphoric coreference resolution, and our findings call for further research of the topic. Finally, we also present a survey of previous relevant work."
HausaNLP at SemEval-2023 Task 12: Leveraging African Low Resource TweetData for Sentiment Analysis,"We present the findings of SemEval-2023 Task 12, a shared task on sentiment analysis for low-resource African languages using Twitter dataset. The task featured three subtasks; subtask A is monolingual sentiment classification with 12 tracks which are all monolingual languages, subtask B is multilingual sentiment classification using the tracks in subtask A and subtask C is a zero-shot sentiment classification. We present the results and findings of subtask A, subtask B and subtask C. We also release the code on github. Our goal is to leverage low-resource tweet data using pre-trained Afro-xlmr-large, AfriBERTa-Large, Bert-base-arabic-camelbert-da-sentiment (Arabic-camelbert), Multilingual-BERT (mBERT) and BERT models for sentiment analysis of 14 African languages. The datasets for these subtasks consists of a gold standard multi-class labeled Twitter datasets from these languages. Our results demonstrate that Afro-xlmr-large model performed better compared to the other models in most of the languages datasets. Similarly, Nigerian languages: Hausa, Igbo, and Yoruba achieved better performance compared to other languages and this can be attributed to the higher volume of data present in the languages."
GMNLP at SemEval-2023 Task 12: Sentiment Analysis with Phylogeny-Based Adapters,"This report describes GMU's sentiment analysis system for the SemEval-2023 shared task AfriSenti-SemEval. We participated in all three sub-tasks: Monolingual, Multilingual, and Zero-Shot. Our approach uses models initialized with AfroXLMR-large, a pre-trained multilingual language model trained on African languages and fine-tuned correspondingly. We also introduce augmented training data along with original training data. Alongside finetuning, we perform phylogeny-based adapter tuning to create several models and ensemble the best models for the final submission. Our system achieves the best F1-score on track 5: Amharic, with 6.2 points higher F1-score than the second-best performing system on this track. Overall, our system ranks 5th among the 10 systems participating in all 15 tracks."
KINLP at SemEval-2023 Task 12: Kinyarwanda Tweet Sentiment Analysis,"This paper describes the system entered by the author to the SemEval-2023 Task 12: Sentiment analysis for African languages. The system focuses on the Kinyarwanda language and uses a language-specific model. Kinyarwanda morphology is modeled in a two tier transformer architecture and the transformer model is pre-trained on a large text corpus using multi-task masked morphology prediction. The model is deployed on an experimental platform that allows users to experiment with the pre-trained language model fine-tuning without the need to write machine learning code. Our final submission to the shared task achieves second ranking out of 34 teams in the competition, achieving 72.50% weighted F1 score. Our analysis of the evaluation results highlights challenges in achieving high accuracy on the task and identifies areas for improvement."
UBC-DLNLP at SemEval-2023 Task 12: Impact of Transfer Learning on African Sentiment Analysis,"We describe our contribution to the SemEVAl 2023 AfriSenti-SemEval shared task, where we tackle the task of sentiment analysis in 14 different African languages. We develop both monolingual and multilingual models under a full supervised setting (subtasks A and B). We also develop models for the zero-shot setting (subtask C). Our approach involves experimenting with transfer learning using six language models, including further pertaining of some of these models as well as a final finetuning stage. Our best performing models achieve an F1-score of 70.36 on development data and an F1-score of 66.13 on test data. Unsurprisingly, our results demonstrate the effectiveness of transfer learning and fine-tuning techniques for sentiment analysis across multiple languages. Our approach can be applied to other sentiment analysis tasks in different languages and domains."
"On the Robustness of Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis: Rethinking Model, Data, and Training","Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims at automatically inferring the specific sentiment polarities toward certain aspects of products or services behind the social media texts or reviews, which has been a fundamental application to the real-world society. Since the early 2010s, ABSA has achieved extraordinarily high accuracy with various deep neural models. However, existing ABSA models with strong in-house performances may fail to generalize to some challenging cases where the contexts are variable, i.e., low robustness to real-world environments. In this study, we propose to enhance the ABSA robustness by systematically rethinking the bottlenecks from all possible angles, including model, data, and training. First, we strengthen the current best-robust syntax-aware models by further incorporating the rich external syntactic dependencies and the labels with aspect simultaneously with a universal-syntax graph convolutional network. In the corpus perspective, we propose to automatically induce high-quality synthetic training data with various types, allowing models to learn sufficient inductive bias for better robustness. Last, we based on the rich pseudo data perform adversarial training to enhance the resistance to the context perturbation and meanwhile employ contrastive learning to reinforce the representations of instances with contrastive sentiments. Extensive robustness evaluations are conducted. The results demonstrate that our enhanced syntax-aware model achieves better robustness performances than all the state-of-the-art baselines. By additionally incorporating our synthetic corpus, the robust testing results are pushed with around 10% accuracy, which are then further improved by installing the advanced training strategies. In-depth analyses are presented for revealing the factors influencing the ABSA robustness."
SemEval-2023 Task 12: Sentiment Analysis for African Languages (AfriSenti-SemEval),"We present the first Africentric SemEval Shared task, Sentiment Analysis for African Languages (AfriSenti-SemEval) - The dataset is available at https://github.com/afrisenti-semeval/afrisent-semeval-2023. AfriSenti-SemEval is a sentiment classification challenge in 14 African languages: Amharic, Algerian Arabic, Hausa, Igbo, Kinyarwanda, Moroccan Arabic, Mozambican Portuguese, Nigerian Pidgin, Oromo, Swahili, Tigrinya, Twi, Xitsonga, and Yorùbá (Muhammad et al., 2023), using data labeled with 3 sentiment classes. We present three subtasks: (1) Task A: monolingual classification, which received 44 submissions; (2) Task B: multilingual classification, which received 32 submissions; and (3) Task C: zero-shot classification, which received 34 submissions. The best performance for tasks A and B was achieved by NLNDE team with 71.31 and 75.06 weighted F1, respectively. UCAS-IIE-NLP achieved the best average score for task C with 58.15 weighted F1. We describe the various approaches adopted by the top 10 systems and their approaches."
Masakhane-Afrisenti at SemEval-2023 Task 12: Sentiment Analysis using Afro-centric Language Models and Adapters for Low-resource African Languages,"AfriSenti-SemEval Shared Task 12 of SemEval-2023. The task aims to perform monolingual sentiment classification (sub-task A) for 12 African languages, multilingual sentiment classification (sub-task B), and zero-shot sentiment classification (task C). For sub-task A, we conducted experiments using classical machine learning classifiers, Afro-centric language models, and language-specific models. For task B, we fine-tuned multilingual pre-trained language models that support many of the languages in the task. For task C, we used we make use of a parameter-efficient Adapter approach that leverages monolingual texts in the target language for effective zero-shot transfer. Our findings suggest that using pre-trained Afro-centric language models improves performance for low-resource African languages. We also ran experiments using adapters for zero-shot tasks, and the results suggest that we can obtain promising results by using adapters with a limited amount of resources."
Transfer Learning for Low-Resource Sentiment Analysis,"Sentiment analysis is the process of identifying and extracting subjective information from text. Despite the advances to employ cross-lingual approaches in an automatic way, the implementation and evaluation of sentiment analysis systems require language-specific data to consider various sociocultural and linguistic peculiarities. In this paper, the collection and annotation of a dataset are described for sentiment analysis of Central Kurdish. We explore a few classical machine learning and neural network-based techniques for this task. Additionally, we employ an approach in transfer learning to leverage pretrained models for data augmentation. We demonstrate that data augmentation achieves a high F_1 score and accuracy despite the difficulty of the task."
Classifying COVID-19 Related Tweets for Fake News Detection and Sentiment Analysis with BERT-based Models,"The present paper is about the participation of our team ""techno"" on CERIST'22 shared tasks. We used an available dataset ""task1.c"" related to covid-19 pandemic. It comprises 4128 tweets for sentiment analysis task and 8661 tweets for fake news detection task. We used natural language processing tools with the combination of the most renowned pre-trained language models BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). The results shows the efficacy of pre-trained language models as we attained an accuracy of 0.93 for the sentiment analysis task and 0.90 for the fake news detection task."
Taureau: A Stock Market Movement Inference Framework Based on Twitter Sentiment Analysis,"With the advent of fast-paced information dissemination and retrieval, it has become inherently important to resort to automated means of predicting stock market prices. In this paper, we propose Taureau, a framework that leverages Twitter sentiment analysis for predicting stock market movement. The aim of our research is to determine whether Twitter, which is assumed to be representative of the general public, can give insight into the public perception of a particular company and has any correlation to that company's stock price movement. We intend to utilize this correlation to predict stock price movement. We first utilize Tweepy and getOldTweets to obtain historical tweets indicating public opinions for a set of top companies during periods of major events. We filter and label the tweets using standard programming libraries. We then vectorize and generate word embedding from the obtained tweets. Afterward, we leverage TextBlob, a state-of-the-art sentiment analytics engine, to assess and quantify the users' moods based on the tweets. Next, we correlate the temporal dimensions of the obtained sentiment scores with monthly stock price movement data. Finally, we design and evaluate a predictive model to forecast stock price movement from lagged sentiment scores. We evaluate our framework using actual stock price movement data to assess its ability to predict movement direction."
Exploring celebrity influence on public attitude towards the COVID-19 pandemic: social media shared sentiment analysis,"The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced new opportunities for health communication, including an increase in the public use of online outlets for health-related emotions. People have turned to social media networks to share sentiments related to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper we examine the role of social messaging shared by Persons in the Public Eye (i.e. athletes, politicians, news personnel) in determining overall public discourse direction. We harvested approximately 13 million tweets ranging from 1 January 2020 to 1 March 2022. The sentiment was calculated for each tweet using a fine-tuned DistilRoBERTa model, which was used to compare COVID-19 vaccine-related Twitter posts (tweets) that co-occurred with mentions of People in the Public Eye. Our findings suggest the presence of consistent patterns of emotional content co-occurring with messaging shared by Persons in the Public Eye for the first two years of the COVID-19 pandemic influenced public opinion and largely stimulated online public discourse. We demonstrate that as the pandemic progressed, public sentiment shared on social networks was shaped by risk perceptions, political ideologies and health-protective behaviours shared by Persons in the Public Eye, often in a negative light."
Exploring Multimodal Sentiment Analysis via CBAM Attention and Double-layer BiLSTM Architecture,"Because multimodal data contains more modal information, multimodal sentiment analysis has become a recent research hotspot. However, redundant information is easily involved in feature fusion after feature extraction, which has a certain impact on the feature representation after fusion. Therefore, in this papaer, we propose a new multimodal sentiment analysis model. In our model, we use BERT + BiLSTM as new feature extractor to capture the long-distance dependencies in sentences and consider the position information of input sequences to obtain richer text features. To remove redundant information and make the network pay more attention to the correlation between image and text features, CNN and CBAM attention are added after splicing text features and picture features, to improve the feature representation ability. On the MVSA-single dataset and HFM dataset, compared with the baseline model, the ACC of our model is improved by 1.78% and 1.91%, and the F1 value is enhanced by 3.09% and 2.0%, respectively. The experimental results show that our model achieves a sound effect, similar to the advanced model."
"Types of Approaches, Applications and Challenges in the Development of Sentiment Analysis Systems","Today, the web has become a mandatory platform to express users' opinions, emotions and feelings about various events. Every person using his smartphone can give his opinion about the purchase of a product, the occurrence of an accident, the occurrence of a new disease, etc. in blogs and social networks such as (Twitter, WhatsApp, Telegram and Instagram) register. Therefore, millions of comments are recorded daily and it creates a huge volume of unstructured text data that can extract useful knowledge from this type of data by using natural language processing methods. Sentiment analysis is one of the important applications of natural language processing and machine learning, which allows us to analyze the sentiments of comments and other textual information recorded by web users. Therefore, the analysis of sentiments, approaches and challenges in this field will be explained in the following."
Memotion 3: Dataset on Sentiment and Emotion Analysis of Codemixed Hindi-English Memes,"Memes are the new-age conveyance mechanism for humor on social media sites. Memes often include an image and some text. Memes can be used to promote disinformation or hatred, thus it is crucial to investigate in details. We introduce Memotion 3, a new dataset with 10,000 annotated memes. Unlike other prevalent datasets in the domain, including prior iterations of Memotion, Memotion 3 introduces Hindi-English Codemixed memes while prior works in the area were limited to only the English memes. We describe the Memotion task, the data collection and the dataset creation methodologies. We also provide a baseline for the task. The baseline code and dataset will be made available at https://github.com/Shreyashm16/Memotion-3.0"
Cryptocurrency Price Prediction using Twitter Sentiment Analysis,"The cryptocurrency ecosystem has been the centre of discussion on many social media platforms, following its noted volatility and varied opinions. Twitter is rapidly being utilised as a news source and a medium for bitcoin discussion. Our algorithm seeks to use historical prices and sentiment of tweets to forecast the price of Bitcoin. In this study, we develop an end-to-end model that can forecast the sentiment of a set of tweets (using a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers - based Neural Network Model) and forecast the price of Bitcoin (using Gated Recurrent Unit) using the predicted sentiment and other metrics like historical cryptocurrency price data, tweet volume, a user's following, and whether or not a user is verified. The sentiment prediction gave a Mean Absolute Percentage Error of 9.45%, an average of real-time data, and test data. The mean absolute percent error for the price prediction was 3.6%."
An evaluation of Google Translate for Sanskrit to English translation via sentiment and semantic analysis,"Google Translate has been prominent for language translation; however, limited work has been done in evaluating the quality of translation when compared to human experts. Sanskrit one of the oldest written languages in the world. In 2022, the Sanskrit language was added to the Google Translate engine. Sanskrit is known as the mother of languages such as Hindi and an ancient source of the Indo-European group of languages. Sanskrit is the original language for sacred Hindu texts such as the Bhagavad Gita. In this study, we present a framework that evaluates the Google Translate for Sanskrit using the Bhagavad Gita. We first publish a translation of the Bhagavad Gita in Sanskrit using Google Translate. Our framework then compares Google Translate version of Bhagavad Gita with expert translations using sentiment and semantic analysis via BERT-based language models. Our results indicate that in terms of sentiment and semantic analysis, there is low level of similarity in selected verses of Google Translate when compared to expert translations. In the qualitative evaluation, we find that Google translate is unsuitable for translation of certain Sanskrit words and phrases due to its poetic nature, contextual significance, metaphor and imagery. The mistranslations are not surprising since the Bhagavad Gita is known as a difficult text not only to translate, but also to interpret since it relies on contextual, philosophical and historical information. Our framework lays the foundation for automatic evaluation of other languages by Google Translate"
Reducing Spurious Correlations for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis with Variational Information Bottleneck and Contrastive Learning,"Deep learning techniques have dominated the literature on aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), yielding state-of-the-art results. However, these deep models generally suffer from spurious correlation problems between input features and output labels, which creates significant barriers to robustness and generalization capability. In this paper, we propose a novel Contrastive Variational Information Bottleneck framework (called CVIB) to reduce spurious correlations for ABSA. The proposed CVIB framework is composed of an original network and a self-pruned network, and these two networks are optimized simultaneously via contrastive learning. Concretely, we employ the Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) principle to learn an informative and compressed network (self-pruned network) from the original network, which discards the superfluous patterns or spurious correlations between input features and prediction labels. Then, self-pruning contrastive learning is devised to pull together semantically similar positive pairs and push away dissimilar pairs, where the representations of the anchor learned by the original and self-pruned networks respectively are regarded as a positive pair while the representations of two different sentences within a mini-batch are treated as a negative pair. To verify the effectiveness of our CVIB method, we conduct extensive experiments on five benchmark ABSA datasets and the experimental results show that our approach achieves better performance than the strong competitors in terms of overall prediction performance, robustness, and generalization."
FinXABSA: Explainable Finance through Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis,"This paper presents a novel approach for explainability in financial analysis by utilizing the Pearson correlation coefficient to establish a relationship between aspect-based sentiment analysis and stock prices. The proposed methodology involves constructing an aspect list from financial news articles and analyzing sentiment intensity scores for each aspect. These scores are then compared to the stock prices for the relevant companies using the Pearson coefficient to determine any significant correlations. The results indicate that the proposed approach provides a more detailed and accurate understanding of the relationship between sentiment analysis and stock prices, which can be useful for investors and financial analysts in making informed decisions. Additionally, this methodology offers a transparent and interpretable way to explain the sentiment analysis results and their impact on stock prices. Overall, the findings of this paper demonstrate the importance of explainability in financial analysis and highlight the potential benefits of utilizing the Pearson coefficient for analyzing aspect-based sentiment analysis and stock prices. The proposed approach offers a valuable tool for understanding the complex relationships between financial news sentiment and stock prices, providing a new perspective on the financial market and aiding in making informed investment decisions."
Meme Sentiment Analysis Enhanced with Multimodal Spatial Encoding and Facial Embedding,"Internet memes are characterised by the interspersing of text amongst visual elements. State-of-the-art multimodal meme classifiers do not account for the relative positions of these elements across the two modalities, despite the latent meaning associated with where text and visual elements are placed. Against two meme sentiment classification datasets, we systematically show performance gains from incorporating the spatial position of visual objects, faces, and text clusters extracted from memes. In addition, we also present facial embedding as an impactful enhancement to image representation in a multimodal meme classifier. Finally, we show that incorporating this spatial information allows our fully automated approaches to outperform their corresponding baselines that rely on additional human validation of OCR-extracted text."
Soft Prompt Guided Joint Learning for Cross-Domain Sentiment Analysis,"Aspect term extraction is a fundamental task in fine-grained sentiment analysis, which aims at detecting customer's opinion targets from reviews on product or service. The traditional supervised models can achieve promising results with annotated datasets, however, the performance dramatically decreases when they are applied to the task of cross-domain aspect term extraction. Existing cross-domain transfer learning methods either directly inject linguistic features into Language models, making it difficult to transfer linguistic knowledge to target domain, or rely on the fixed predefined prompts, which is time-consuming to construct the prompts over all potential aspect term spans. To resolve the limitations, we propose a soft prompt-based joint learning method for cross domain aspect term extraction in this paper. Specifically, by incorporating external linguistic features, the proposed method learn domain-invariant representations between source and target domains via multiple objectives, which bridges the gap between domains with varied distributions of aspect terms. Further, the proposed method interpolates a set of transferable soft prompts consisted of multiple learnable vectors that are beneficial to detect aspect terms in target domain. Extensive experiments are conducted on the benchmark datasets and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for cross-domain aspect terms extraction."
SynGen: A Syntactic Plug-and-play Module for Generative Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis,"Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is a sentiment analysis task at fine-grained level. Recently, generative frameworks have attracted increasing attention in ABSA due to their ability to unify subtasks and their continuity to upstream pre-training tasks. However, these generative models suffer from the neighboring dependency problem that induces neighboring words to get higher attention. In this paper, we propose SynGen, a plug-and-play syntactic information aware module. As a plug-in module, our SynGen can be easily applied to any generative framework backbones. The key insight of our module is to add syntactic inductive bias to attention assignment and thus direct attention to the correct target words. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first one to introduce syntactic information to generative ABSA frameworks. Our module design is based on two main principles: (1) maintaining the structural integrity of backbone PLMs and (2) disentangling the added syntactic information and original semantic information. Empirical results on four popular ABSA datasets demonstrate that SynGen enhanced model achieves a comparable performance to the state-of-the-art model with relaxed labeling specification and less training consumption."
AfriSenti: A Twitter Sentiment Analysis Benchmark for African Languages,"Africa is home to over 2000 languages from over six language families and has the highest linguistic diversity among all continents. This includes 75 languages with at least one million speakers each. Yet, there is little NLP research conducted on African languages. Crucial in enabling such research is the availability of high-quality annotated datasets. In this paper, we introduce AfriSenti, which consists of 14 sentiment datasets of 110,000+ tweets in 14 African languages (Amharic, Algerian Arabic, Hausa, Igbo, Kinyarwanda, Moroccan Arabic, Mozambican Portuguese, Nigerian Pidgin, Oromo, Swahili, Tigrinya, Twi, Xitsonga, and Yorùbá) from four language families annotated by native speakers. The data is used in SemEval 2023 Task 12, the first Afro-centric SemEval shared task. We describe the data collection methodology, annotation process, and related challenges when curating each of the datasets. We conduct experiments with different sentiment classification baselines and discuss their usefulness. We hope AfriSenti enables new work on under-represented languages. The dataset is available at https://github.com/afrisenti-semeval/afrisent-semeval-2023 and can also be loaded as a huggingface datasets (https://huggingface.co/datasets/shmuhammad/AfriSenti)."
InstructABSA: Instruction Learning for Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis,"In this paper, we present InstructABSA, Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) using the instruction learning paradigm for the ABSA subtasks: Aspect Term Extraction (ATE), Aspect Term Sentiment Classification (ATSC), and Joint Task modeling. Our method introduces positive, negative, and neutral examples to each training sample, and instruction tunes the model (Tk-Instruct) the ABSA subtasks, yielding significant performance improvements. Experimental results on the Sem Eval 2014, 15, and 16 datasets demonstrate that InstructABSA outperforms the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches on the three ABSA subtasks (ATE, ATSC, and Joint Task) by a significant margin, outperforming 7x larger models. In particular, InstructABSA surpasses the SOTA on the Rest14 ATE subtask by 5.69% points, Rest15 ATSC subtask by 9.59% points, and on the Lapt14 Joint Task by 3.37% points. Our results also suggest a strong generalization ability to new domains across all three subtasks"
Applying BERT and ChatGPT for Sentiment Analysis of Lyme Disease in Scientific Literature,"This chapter presents a practical guide for conducting Sentiment Analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques in the domain of tick-borne disease text. The aim is to demonstrate the process of how the presence of bias in the discourse surrounding chronic manifestations of the disease can be evaluated. The goal is to use a dataset of 5643 abstracts collected from scientific journals on the topic of chronic Lyme disease to demonstrate using Python, the steps for conducting sentiment analysis using pre-trained language models and the process of validating the preliminary results using both interpretable machine learning tools, as well as a novel methodology of using emerging state-of-the-art large language models like ChatGPT. This serves as a useful resource for researchers and practitioners interested in using NLP techniques for sentiment analysis in the medical domain."
Sentiment analysis and opinion mining on educational data: A survey,"Sentiment analysis AKA opinion mining is one of the most widely used NLP applications to identify human intentions from their reviews. In the education sector, opinion mining is used to listen to student opinions and enhance their learning-teaching practices pedagogically. With advancements in sentiment annotation techniques and AI methodologies, student comments can be labelled with their sentiment orientation without much human intervention. In this review article, (1) we consider the role of emotional analysis in education from four levels: document level, sentence level, entity level, and aspect level, (2) sentiment annotation techniques including lexicon-based and corpus-based approaches for unsupervised annotations are explored, (3) the role of AI in sentiment analysis with methodologies like machine learning, deep learning, and transformers are discussed, (4) the impact of sentiment analysis on educational procedures to enhance pedagogy, decision-making, and evaluation are presented. Educational institutions have been widely invested to build sentiment analysis tools and process their student feedback to draw their opinions and insights. Applications built on sentiment analysis of student feedback are reviewed in this study. Challenges in sentiment analysis like multi-polarity, polysemous, negation words, and opinion spam detection are explored and their trends in the research space are discussed. The future directions of sentiment analysis in education are discussed."
Sentiment Analysis on YouTube Smart Phone Unboxing Video Reviews in Sri Lanka,"Product-related reviews are based on users' experiences that are mostly shared on videos in YouTube. It is the second most popular website globally in 2021. People prefer to watch videos on recently released products prior to purchasing, in order to gather overall feedback and make worthy decisions. These videos are created by vloggers who are enthusiastic about technical materials and feedback is usually placed by experienced users of the product or its brand. Analyzing the sentiment of the user reviews gives useful insights into the product in general. This study is focused on three smartphone reviews, namely, Apple iPhone 13, Google Pixel 6, and Samsung Galaxy S21 which were released in 2021. VADER, which is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool was used to classify each comment to its appropriate positive or negative orientation. All three smartphones show a positive sentiment from the users' perspective and iPhone 13 has the highest number of positive reviews. The resulting models have been tested using Näive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine. Among these three classifiers, Support Vector Machine shows higher accuracies and F1-scores."
Rating Sentiment Analysis Systems for Bias through a Causal Lens,"Sentiment Analysis Systems (SASs) are data-driven Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems that, given a piece of text, assign one or more numbers conveying the polarity and emotional intensity expressed in the input. Like other automatic machine learning systems, they have also been known to exhibit model uncertainty where a (small) change in the input leads to drastic swings in the output. This can be especially problematic when inputs are related to protected features like gender or race since such behavior can be perceived as a lack of fairness, i.e., bias. We introduce a novel method to assess and rate SASs where inputs are perturbed in a controlled causal setting to test if the output sentiment is sensitive to protected variables even when other components of the textual input, e.g., chosen emotion words, are fixed. We then use the result to assign labels (ratings) at fine-grained and overall levels to convey the robustness of the SAS to input changes. The ratings serve as a principled basis to compare SASs and choose among them based on behavior. It benefits all users, especially developers who reuse off-the-shelf SASs to build larger AI systems but do not have access to their code or training data to compare."
Automated Sentiment and Hate Speech Analysis of Facebook Data by Employing Multilingual Transformer Models,"In recent years, there has been a heightened consensus within academia and in the public discourse that Social Media Platforms (SMPs), amplify the spread of hateful and negative sentiment content. Researchers have identified how hateful content, political propaganda, and targeted messaging contributed to real-world harms including insurrections against democratically elected governments, genocide, and breakdown of social cohesion due to heightened negative discourse towards certain communities in parts of the world. To counter these issues, SMPs have created semi-automated systems that can help identify toxic speech. In this paper we analyse the statistical distribution of hateful and negative sentiment contents within a representative Facebook dataset (n= 604,703) scrapped through 648 public Facebook pages which identify themselves as proponents (and followers) of far-right Hindutva actors. These pages were identified manually using keyword searches on Facebook and on CrowdTangleand classified as far-right Hindutva pages based on page names, page descriptions, and discourses shared on these pages. We employ state-of-the-art, open-source XLM-T multilingual transformer-based language models to perform sentiment and hate speech analysis of the textual contents shared on these pages over a period of 5.5 years. The result shows the statistical distributions of the predicted sentiment and the hate speech labels; top actors, and top page categories. We further discuss the benchmark performances and limitations of these pre-trained language models."
EDSA-Ensemble: an Event Detection Sentiment Analysis Ensemble Architecture,"As global digitization continues to grow, technology becomes more affordable and easier to use, and social media platforms thrive, becoming the new means of spreading information and news. Communities are built around sharing and discussing current events. Within these communities, users are enabled to share their opinions about each event. Using Sentiment Analysis to understand the polarity of each message belonging to an event, as well as the entire event, can help to better understand the general and individual feelings of significant trends and the dynamics on online social networks. In this context, we propose a new ensemble architecture, EDSA-Ensemble (Event Detection Sentiment Analysis Ensemble), that uses Event Detection and Sentiment Analysis to improve the detection of the polarity for current events from Social Media. For Event Detection, we use techniques based on Information Diffusion taking into account both the time span and the topics. To detect the polarity of each event, we preprocess the text and employ several Machine and Deep Learning models to create an ensemble model. The preprocessing step includes several word representation models, i.e., raw frequency, TFIDF, Word2Vec, and Transformers. The proposed EDSA-Ensemble architecture improves the event sentiment classification over the individual Machine and Deep Learning models."
"Presence of informal language, such as emoticons, hashtags, and slang, impact the performance of sentiment analysis models on social media text?","This study aimed to investigate the influence of the presence of informal language, such as emoticons and slang, on the performance of sentiment analysis models applied to social media text. A convolutional neural network (CNN) model was developed and trained on three datasets: a sarcasm dataset, a sentiment dataset, and an emoticon dataset. The model architecture was held constant for all experiments and the model was trained on 80% of the data and tested on 20%. The results revealed that the model achieved an accuracy of 96.47% on the sarcasm dataset, with the lowest accuracy for class 1. On the sentiment dataset, the model achieved an accuracy of 95.28%. The amalgamation of sarcasm and sentiment datasets improved the accuracy of the model to 95.1%, and the addition of emoticon dataset has a slight positive impact on the accuracy of the model to 95.37%. The study suggests that the presence of informal language has a restricted impact on the performance of sentiment analysis models applied to social media text. However, the inclusion of emoticon data to the model can enhance the accuracy slightly."
Applications and Challenges of Sentiment Analysis in Real-life Scenarios,"Sentiment analysis has benefited from the availability of lexicons and benchmark datasets created over decades of research. However, its applications to the real world are a driving force for research in SA. This chapter describes some of these applications and related challenges in real-life scenarios. In this chapter, we focus on five applications of SA: health, social policy, e-commerce, digital humanities and other areas of NLP. This chapter is intended to equip an NLP researcher with the `what', `why' and `how' of applications of SA: what is the application about, why it is important and challenging and how current research in SA deals with the application. We note that, while the use of deep learning techniques is a popular paradigm that spans these applications, challenges around privacy and selection bias of datasets is a recurring theme across several applications."
StockEmotions: Discover Investor Emotions for Financial Sentiment Analysis and Multivariate Time Series,"There has been growing interest in applying NLP techniques in the financial domain, however, resources are extremely limited. This paper introduces StockEmotions, a new dataset for detecting emotions in the stock market that consists of 10,000 English comments collected from StockTwits, a financial social media platform. Inspired by behavioral finance, it proposes 12 fine-grained emotion classes that span the roller coaster of investor emotion. Unlike existing financial sentiment datasets, StockEmotions presents granular features such as investor sentiment classes, fine-grained emotions, emojis, and time series data. To demonstrate the usability of the dataset, we perform a dataset analysis and conduct experimental downstream tasks. For financial sentiment/emotion classification tasks, DistilBERT outperforms other baselines, and for multivariate time series forecasting, a Temporal Attention LSTM model combining price index, text, and emotion features achieves the best performance than using a single feature."
Sentiment Analysis for Measuring Hope and Fear from Reddit Posts During the 2022 Russo-Ukrainian Conflict,"This paper proposes a novel lexicon-based unsupervised sentimental analysis method to measure the ``\textit{hope}"" and ``\textit{fear}"" for the 2022 Ukrainian-Russian Conflict. \textit{Reddit.com} is utilised as the main source of human reactions to daily events during nearly the first three months of the conflict. The top 50 ``hot"" posts of six different subreddits about Ukraine and news (Ukraine, worldnews, Ukraina, UkrainianConflict, UkraineWarVideoReport, UkraineWarReports) and their relative comments are scraped and a data set is created. On this corpus, multiple analyses such as (1) public interest, (2) hope/fear score, (3) stock price interaction are employed. We promote using a dictionary approach, which scores the hopefulness of every submitted user post. The Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm of topic modelling is also utilised to understand the main issues raised by users and what are the key talking points. Experimental analysis shows that the hope strongly decreases after the symbolic and strategic losses of Azovstal (Mariupol) and Severodonetsk. Spikes in hope/fear, both positives and negatives, are present after important battles, but also some non-military events, such as Eurovision and football games."
Summative Student Course Review Tool Based on Machine Learning Sentiment Analysis to Enhance Life Science Feedback Efficacy,"Machine learning enables the development of new, supplemental, and empowering tools that can either expand existing technologies or invent new ones. In education, space exists for a tool that supports generic student course review formats to organize and recapitulate students' views on the pedagogical practices to which they are exposed. Often, student opinions are gathered with a general comment section that solicits their feelings towards their courses without polling specifics about course contents. Herein, we show a novel approach to summarizing and organizing students' opinions via analyzing their sentiment towards a course as a function of the language/vocabulary used to convey their opinions about a class and its contents. This analysis is derived from their responses to a general comment section encountered at the end of post-course review surveys. This analysis, accomplished with Python, LaTeX, and Google's Natural Language API, allows for the conversion of unstructured text data into both general and topic-specific sub-reports that convey students' views in a unique, novel way."
The use of new technologies to support Public Administration. Sentiment analysis and the case of the app IO,"App IO is an app developed for the Italian PA. It is definitely useful for citizens to interact with the PA and to get services that were not digitized yet. Nevertheless, it was not perceived in a good way by the citizens and it has been criticized. As we wanted to find the root that caused all these bad reviews we scraped feedback from mobile app stores using custom-coded automated tools and - after that - we trained two machine learning models to perform both sentiment analysis and emotion detection to understand what caused the bad reviews."
SAIDS: A Novel Approach for Sentiment Analysis Informed of Dialect and Sarcasm,"Sentiment analysis becomes an essential part of every social network, as it enables decision-makers to know more about users' opinions in almost all life aspects. Despite its importance, there are multiple issues it encounters like the sentiment of the sarcastic text which is one of the main challenges of sentiment analysis. This paper tackles this challenge by introducing a novel system (SAIDS) that predicts the sentiment, sarcasm and dialect of Arabic tweets. SAIDS uses its prediction of sarcasm and dialect as known information to predict the sentiment. It uses MARBERT as a language model to generate sentence embedding, then passes it to the sarcasm and dialect models, and then the outputs of the three models are concatenated and passed to the sentiment analysis model. Multiple system design setups were experimented with and reported. SAIDS was applied to the ArSarcasm-v2 dataset where it outperforms the state-of-the-art model for the sentiment analysis task. By training all tasks together, SAIDS achieves results of 75.98 FPN, 59.09 F1-score and 71.13 F1-score for sentiment analysis, sarcasm detection, and dialect identification respectively. The system design can be used to enhance the performance of any task which is dependent on other tasks."
Sentiment Analysis of COVID-19 Public Activity Restriction (PPKM) Impact using BERT Method,"Covid-19 has grown rapidly in all parts of the world and is considered an international disaster because of its wide-reaching impact. The impact of Covid-19 has spread to Indonesia, especially in the slowdown in economic growth. This was influenced by the implementation of Community Activity Restrictions (PPKM) which limited community economic activities. This study aims to analyze the mapping of public sentiment towards PPKM policies in Indonesia during the pandemic based on Twitter data. Knowing the mapping of public sentiment regarding PPKM is expected to help stakeholders in the policy evaluation process for each region. The method used is BERT with IndoBERT specific model. The results showed the evaluation value of IndoBERT f-1 score reached 84%, precision 86%, and recall 84%. Meanwhile for the evaluation of the use of SVM f-1 score 70%, 72% precision, and 70% recall. Multinominal Naïve Bayes evaluation shows f-1 score 83%, precision 78%, and recall 80%. As a conclusion, BERT method with the IndoBERT model is proven to be higher than classical methods such as SVM and Multinominal Naïve Bayes."
"Search, Structure, and Sentiment: A Comparative Analysis of Network Opinion in Different Query Types on Twitter","Understanding the relationship between structure and sentiment is essential in highlighting future operations with online social networks. More specifically, within popular conversation on Twitter. This paper provides a development on the relationship between the two variables: structure, defined as the composition of a directed network, and sentiment, a quantified value of the positive/negative connotations of a conversation. We highlight thread sentiment to be inversely proportional to the strength and connectivity of a network. The second portion of this paper highlights differences in query types, specifically how the aforementioned behavior differs within four key query types. This paper focuses on topical, event-based, geographic, and individual queries as orientations which have differing behavior. Using cross-query analysis, we see that the relationship between structure and sentiment, though still inversely proportional, differs greatly across query types. We find this relationship to be the most clear within the individual queries and the least prevalent within the event-based queries. This paper provides a sociological progression in our understanding of opinion and networks, while providing a methodological advancement for future studies on similar subjects."
What do LLMs Know about Financial Markets? A Case Study on Reddit Market Sentiment Analysis,"Market sentiment analysis on social media content requires knowledge of both financial markets and social media jargon, which makes it a challenging task for human raters. The resulting lack of high-quality labeled data stands in the way of conventional supervised learning methods. Instead, we approach this problem using semi-supervised learning with a large language model (LLM). Our pipeline generates weak financial sentiment labels for Reddit posts with an LLM and then uses that data to train a small model that can be served in production. We find that prompting the LLM to produce Chain-of-Thought summaries and forcing it through several reasoning paths helps generate more stable and accurate labels, while using a regression loss further improves distillation quality. With only a handful of prompts, the final model performs on par with existing supervised models. Though production applications of our model are limited by ethical considerations, the model's competitive performance points to the great potential of using LLMs for tasks that otherwise require skill-intensive annotation."
Impact of Sentiment Analysis in Fake Review Detection,"Fake review identification is an important topic and has gained the interest of experts all around the world. Identifying fake reviews is challenging for researchers, and there are several primary challenges to fake review detection. We propose developing an initial research paper for investigating fake reviews by using sentiment analysis. Ten research papers are identified that show fake reviews, and they discuss currently available solutions for predicting or detecting fake reviews. They also show the distribution of fake and truthful reviews through the analysis of sentiment. We summarize and compare previous studies related to fake reviews. We highlight the most significant challenges in the sentiment evaluation process and demonstrate that there is a significant impact on sentiment scores used to identify fake feedback."
Exploiting Rich Textual User-Product Context for Improving Sentiment Analysis,"User and product information associated with a review is useful for sentiment polarity prediction. Typical approaches incorporating such information focus on modeling users and products as implicitly learned representation vectors. Most do not exploit the potential of historical reviews, or those that currently do require unnecessary modifications to model architecture or do not make full use of user/product associations. The contribution of this work is twofold: i) a method to explicitly employ historical reviews belonging to the same user/product to initialize representations, and ii) efficient incorporation of textual associations between users and products via a user-product cross-context module. Experiments on IMDb, Yelp-2013 and Yelp-2014 benchmarks show that our approach substantially outperforms previous state-of-the-art. Since we employ BERT-base as the encoder, we additionally provide experiments in which our approach performs well with Span-BERT and Longformer. Furthermore, experiments where the reviews of each user/product in the training data are downsampled demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach under a low-resource setting."
Multi-task Learning for Cross-Lingual Sentiment Analysis,"This paper presents a cross-lingual sentiment analysis of news articles using zero-shot and few-shot learning. The study aims to classify the Croatian news articles with positive, negative, and neutral sentiments using the Slovene dataset. The system is based on a trilingual BERT-based model trained in three languages: English, Slovene, Croatian. The paper analyses different setups using datasets in two languages and proposes a simple multi-task model to perform sentiment classification. The evaluation is performed using the few-shot and zero-shot scenarios in single-task and multi-task experiments for Croatian and Slovene."
"Sentiment Analysis of Persian Language: Review of Algorithms, Approaches and Datasets","Sentiment analysis aims to extract people's emotions and opinion from their comments on the web. It widely used in businesses to detect sentiment in social data, gauge brand reputation, and understand customers. Most of articles in this area have concentrated on the English language whereas there are limited resources for Persian language. In this review paper, recent published articles between 2018 and 2022 in sentiment analysis in Persian Language have been collected and their methods, approach and dataset will be explained and analyzed. Almost all the methods used to solve sentiment analysis are machine learning and deep learning. The purpose of this paper is to examine 40 different approach sentiment analysis in the Persian Language, analysis datasets along with the accuracy of the algorithms applied to them and also review strengths and weaknesses of each. Among all the methods, transformers such as BERT and RNN Neural Networks such as LSTM and Bi-LSTM have achieved higher accuracy in the sentiment analysis. In addition to the methods and approaches, the datasets reviewed are listed between 2018 and 2022 and information about each dataset and its details are provided."
Comparative Study of Sentiment Analysis for Multi-Sourced Social Media Platforms,"There is a vast amount of data generated every second due to the rapidly growing technology in the current world. This area of research attempts to determine the feelings or opinions of people on social media posts. The dataset we used was a multi-source dataset from the comment section of various social networking sites like Twitter, Reddit, etc. Natural Language Processing Techniques were employed to perform sentiment analysis on the obtained dataset. In this paper, we provide a comparative analysis using techniques of lexicon-based, machine learning and deep learning approaches. The Machine Learning algorithm used in this work is Naive Bayes, the Lexicon-based approach used in this work is TextBlob, and the deep-learning algorithm used in this work is LSTM."
Video Games as a Corpus: Sentiment Analysis using Fallout New Vegas Dialog,"We present a method for extracting a multilingual sentiment annotated dialog data set from Fallout New Vegas. The game developers have preannotated every line of dialog in the game in one of the 8 different sentiments: \textit{anger, disgust, fear, happy, neutral, pained, sad } and \textit{surprised}. The game has been translated into English, Spanish, German, French and Italian. We conduct experiments on multilingual, multilabel sentiment analysis on the extracted data set using multilingual BERT, XLMRoBERTa and language specific BERT models. In our experiments, multilingual BERT outperformed XLMRoBERTa for most of the languages, also language specific models were slightly better than multilingual BERT for most of the languages. The best overall accuracy was 54\% and it was achieved by using multilingual BERT on Spanish data. The extracted data set presents a challenging task for sentiment analysis. We have released the data, including the testing and training splits, openly on Zenodo. The data set has been shuffled for copyright reasons."
An LSTM model for Twitter Sentiment Analysis,"Sentiment analysis on social media such as Twitter provides organizations and individuals an effective way to monitor public emotions towards them and their competitors. As a result, sentiment analysis has become an important and challenging task. In this work, we have collected seven publicly available and manually annotated twitter sentiment datasets. We create a new training and testing dataset from the collected datasets. We develop an LSTM model to classify sentiment of a tweet and evaluate the model with the new dataset."
Adapted Multimodal BERT with Layer-wise Fusion for Sentiment Analysis,"Multimodal learning pipelines have benefited from the success of pretrained language models. However, this comes at the cost of increased model parameters. In this work, we propose Adapted Multimodal BERT (AMB), a BERT-based architecture for multimodal tasks that uses a combination of adapter modules and intermediate fusion layers. The adapter adjusts the pretrained language model for the task at hand, while the fusion layers perform task-specific, layer-wise fusion of audio-visual information with textual BERT representations. During the adaptation process the pre-trained language model parameters remain frozen, allowing for fast, parameter-efficient training. In our ablations we see that this approach leads to efficient models, that can outperform their fine-tuned counterparts and are robust to input noise. Our experiments on sentiment analysis with CMU-MOSEI show that AMB outperforms the current state-of-the-art across metrics, with 3.4% relative reduction in the resulting error and 2.1% relative improvement in 7-class classification accuracy."
Sentiment analysis and opinion mining on E-commerce site,"Sentiment analysis or opinion mining help to illustrate the phrase NLP (Natural Language Processing). Sentiment analysis has been the most significant topic in recent years. The goal of this study is to solve the sentiment polarity classification challenges in sentiment analysis. A broad technique for categorizing sentiment opposition is presented, along with comprehensive process explanations. With the results of the analysis, both sentence-level classification and review-level categorization are conducted. Finally, we discuss our plans for future sentiment analysis research."
Fine-tuned Sentiment Analysis of COVID-19 Vaccine-Related Social Media Data: Comparative Study,"This study investigated and compared public sentiment related to COVID-19 vaccines expressed on two popular social media platforms, Reddit and Twitter, harvested from January 1, 2020, to March 1, 2022. To accomplish this task, we created a fine-tuned DistilRoBERTa model to predict sentiments of approximately 9.5 million Tweets and 70 thousand Reddit comments. To fine-tune our model, our team manually labeled the sentiment of 3600 Tweets and then augmented our dataset by the method of back-translation. Text sentiment for each social media platform was then classified with our fine-tuned model using Python and the Huggingface sentiment analysis pipeline. Our results determined that the average sentiment expressed on Twitter was more negative (52% positive) than positive and the sentiment expressed on Reddit was more positive than negative (53% positive). Though average sentiment was found to vary between these social media platforms, both displayed similar behavior related to sentiment shared at key vaccine-related developments during the pandemic. Considering this similar trend in shared sentiment demonstrated across social media platforms, Twitter and Reddit continue to be valuable data sources that public health officials can utilize to strengthen vaccine confidence and combat misinformation. As the spread of misinformation poses a range of psychological and psychosocial risks (anxiety, fear, etc.), there is an urgency in understanding the public perspective and attitude toward shared falsities. Comprehensive educational delivery systems tailored to the population's expressed sentiments that facilitate digital literacy, health information-seeking behavior, and precision health promotion could aid in clarifying such misinformation."
Robust-MSA: Understanding the Impact of Modality Noise on Multimodal Sentiment Analysis,"Improving model robustness against potential modality noise, as an essential step for adapting multimodal models to real-world applications, has received increasing attention among researchers. For Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA), there is also a debate on whether multimodal models are more effective against noisy features than unimodal ones. Stressing on intuitive illustration and in-depth analysis of these concerns, we present Robust-MSA, an interactive platform that visualizes the impact of modality noise as well as simple defence methods to help researchers know better about how their models perform with imperfect real-world data."
Improving Visual-textual Sentiment Analysis by Fusing Expert Features,"Visual-textual sentiment analysis aims to predict sentiment with the input of a pair of image and text. The main challenge of visual-textual sentiment analysis is how to learn effective visual features for sentiment prediction since input images are often very diverse. To address this challenge, we propose a new method that improves visual-textual sentiment analysis by introducing powerful expert visual features. The proposed method consists of four parts: (1) a visual-textual branch to learn features directly from data for sentiment analysis, (2) a visual expert branch with a set of pre-trained ""expert"" encoders to extract effective visual features, (3) a CLIP branch to implicitly model visual-textual correspondence, and (4) a multimodal feature fusion network based on either BERT or MLP to fuse multimodal features and make sentiment prediction. Extensive experiments on three datasets show that our method produces better visual-textual sentiment analysis performance than existing methods."
UniMSE: Towards Unified Multimodal Sentiment Analysis and Emotion Recognition,"Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) and emotion recognition in conversation (ERC) are key research topics for computers to understand human behaviors. From a psychological perspective, emotions are the expression of affect or feelings during a short period, while sentiments are formed and held for a longer period. However, most existing works study sentiment and emotion separately and do not fully exploit the complementary knowledge behind the two. In this paper, we propose a multimodal sentiment knowledge-sharing framework (UniMSE) that unifies MSA and ERC tasks from features, labels, and models. We perform modality fusion at the syntactic and semantic levels and introduce contrastive learning between modalities and samples to better capture the difference and consistency between sentiments and emotions. Experiments on four public benchmark datasets, MOSI, MOSEI, MELD, and IEMOCAP, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and achieve consistent improvements compared with state-of-the-art methods."
LSTM based models stability in the context of Sentiment Analysis for social media,"Deep learning techniques have proven their effectiveness for Sentiment Analysis (SA) related tasks. Recurrent neural networks (RNN), especially Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional LSTM, have become a reference for building accurate predictive models. However, the models complexity and the number of hyperparameters to configure raises several questions related to their stability. In this paper, we present various LSTM models and their key parameters, and we perform experiments to test the stability of these models in the context of Sentiment Analysis."
BERT-Deep CNN: State-of-the-Art for Sentiment Analysis of COVID-19 Tweets,"The free flow of information has been accelerated by the rapid development of social media technology. There has been a significant social and psychological impact on the population due to the outbreak of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The COVID-19 pandemic is one of the current events being discussed on social media platforms. In order to safeguard societies from this pandemic, studying people's emotions on social media is crucial. As a result of their particular characteristics, sentiment analysis of texts like tweets remains challenging. Sentiment analysis is a powerful text analysis tool. It automatically detects and analyzes opinions and emotions from unstructured data. Texts from a wide range of sources are examined by a sentiment analysis tool, which extracts meaning from them, including emails, surveys, reviews, social media posts, and web articles. To evaluate sentiments, natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques are used, which assign weights to entities, topics, themes, and categories in sentences or phrases. Machine learning tools learn how to detect sentiment without human intervention by examining examples of emotions in text. In a pandemic situation, analyzing social media texts to uncover sentimental trends can be very helpful in gaining a better understanding of society's needs and predicting future trends. We intend to study society's perception of the COVID-19 pandemic through social media using state-of-the-art BERT and Deep CNN models. The superiority of BERT models over other deep models in sentiment analysis is evident and can be concluded from the comparison of the various research studies mentioned in this article."
Generative Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis with Contrastive Learning and Expressive Structure,"Generative models have demonstrated impressive results on Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) tasks, particularly for the emerging task of extracting Aspect-Category-Opinion-Sentiment (ACOS) quadruples. However, these models struggle with implicit sentiment expressions, which are commonly observed in opinionated content such as online reviews. In this work, we introduce GEN-SCL-NAT, which consists of two techniques for improved structured generation for ACOS quadruple extraction. First, we propose GEN-SCL, a supervised contrastive learning objective that aids quadruple prediction by encouraging the model to produce input representations that are discriminable across key input attributes, such as sentiment polarity and the existence of implicit opinions and aspects. Second, we introduce GEN-NAT, a new structured generation format that better adapts autoregressive encoder-decoder models to extract quadruples in a generative fashion. Experimental results show that GEN-SCL-NAT achieves top performance across three ACOS datasets, averaging 1.48% F1 improvement, with a maximum 1.73% increase on the LAPTOP-L1 dataset. Additionally, we see significant gains on implicit aspect and opinion splits that have been shown as challenging for existing ACOS approaches."
FinBERT-LSTM: Deep Learning based stock price prediction using News Sentiment Analysis,"Economy is severely dependent on the stock market. An uptrend usually corresponds to prosperity while a downtrend correlates to recession. Predicting the stock market has thus been a centre of research and experiment for a long time. Being able to predict short term movements in the market enables investors to reap greater returns on their investments. Stock prices are extremely volatile and sensitive to financial market. In this paper we use Deep Learning networks to predict stock prices, assimilating financial, business and technology news articles which present information about the market. First, we create a simple Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) network and then expand into more complex Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) like Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), and finally propose FinBERT-LSTM model, which integrates news article sentiments to predict stock price with greater accuracy by analysing short-term market information. We then train the model on NASDAQ-100 index stock data and New York Times news articles to evaluate the performance of MLP, LSTM, FinBERT-LSTM models using mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and accuracy metrics."
Few-shot Multimodal Sentiment Analysis based on Multimodal Probabilistic Fusion Prompts,"Multimodal sentiment analysis is a trending topic with the explosion of multimodal content on the web. Present studies in multimodal sentiment analysis rely on large-scale supervised data. Collating supervised data is time-consuming and labor-intensive. As such, it is essential to investigate the problem of few-shot multimodal sentiment analysis. Previous works in few-shot models generally use language model prompts, which can improve performance in low-resource settings. However, the textual prompt ignores the information from other modalities. We propose Multimodal Probabilistic Fusion Prompts, which can provide diverse cues for multimodal sentiment detection. We first design a unified multimodal prompt to reduce the discrepancy in different modal prompts. To improve the robustness of our model, we then leverage multiple diverse prompts for each input and propose a probabilistic method to fuse the output predictions. Extensive experiments conducted on three datasets confirm the effectiveness of our approach."
DiaASQ : A Benchmark of Conversational Aspect-based Sentiment Quadruple Analysis,"The rapid development of aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) within recent decades shows great potential for real-world society. The current ABSA works, however, are mostly limited to the scenario of a single text piece, leaving the study in dialogue contexts unexplored. To bridge the gap between fine-grained sentiment analysis and conversational opinion mining, in this work, we introduce a novel task of conversational aspect-based sentiment quadruple analysis, namely DiaASQ, aiming to detect the quadruple of target-aspect-opinion-sentiment in a dialogue. We manually construct a large-scale high-quality DiaASQ dataset in both Chinese and English languages. We deliberately develop a neural model to benchmark the task, which advances in effectively performing end-to-end quadruple prediction, and manages to incorporate rich dialogue-specific and discourse feature representations for better cross-utterance quadruple extraction. We hope the new benchmark will spur more advancements in the sentiment analysis community."
Exploring Robustness of Prefix Tuning in Noisy Data: A Case Study in Financial Sentiment Analysis,"The invention of transformer-based models such as BERT, GPT, and RoBERTa has enabled researchers and financial companies to finetune these powerful models and use them in different downstream tasks to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Recently, a lightweight alternative (approximately 0.1% - 3% of the original model parameters) to fine-tuning, known as prefix tuning has been introduced. This method freezes the model parameters and only updates the prefix to achieve performance comparable to full fine-tuning. Prefix tuning enables researchers and financial practitioners to achieve similar results with much fewer parameters. In this paper, we explore the robustness of prefix tuning when facing noisy data. Our experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning is more robust to noise than prefix tuning -- the latter method faces a significant decrease in performance on most corrupted data sets with increasing noise levels. Furthermore, prefix tuning has high variances in the F1 scores compared to fine-tuning in many corruption methods. We strongly advocate that caution should be carefully taken when applying the state-of-the-art prefix tuning method to noisy data."
Syntax-Guided Domain Adaptation for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis,"Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims at extracting opinionated aspect terms in review texts and determining their sentiment polarities, which is widely studied in both academia and industry. As a fine-grained classification task, the annotation cost is extremely high. Domain adaptation is a popular solution to alleviate the data deficiency issue in new domains by transferring common knowledge across domains. Most cross-domain ABSA studies are based on structure correspondence learning (SCL), and use pivot features to construct auxiliary tasks for narrowing down the gap between domains. However, their pivot-based auxiliary tasks can only transfer knowledge of aspect terms but not sentiment, limiting the performance of existing models. In this work, we propose a novel Syntax-guided Domain Adaptation Model, named SDAM, for more effective cross-domain ABSA. SDAM exploits syntactic structure similarities for building pseudo training instances, during which aspect terms of target domain are explicitly related to sentiment polarities. Besides, we propose a syntax-based BERT mask language model for further capturing domain-invariant features. Finally, to alleviate the sentiment inconsistency issue in multi-gram aspect terms, we introduce a span-based joint aspect term and sentiment analysis module into the cross-domain End2End ABSA. Experiments on five benchmark datasets show that our model consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines with respect to Micro-F1 metric for the cross-domain End2End ABSA task."
BERT-Based Combination of Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Network for Indonesian Sentiment Analysis,"Sentiment analysis is the computational study of opinions and emotions ex-pressed in text. Deep learning is a model that is currently producing state-of-the-art in various application domains, including sentiment analysis. Many researchers are using a hybrid approach that combines different deep learning models and has been shown to improve model performance. In sentiment analysis, input in text data is first converted into a numerical representation. The standard method used to obtain a text representation is the fine-tuned embedding method. However, this method does not pay attention to each word's context in the sentence. Therefore, the Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformer (BERT) model is used to obtain text representations based on the context and position of words in sentences. This research extends the previous hybrid deep learning using BERT representation for Indonesian sentiment analysis. Our simulation shows that the BERT representation improves the accuracies of all hybrid architectures. The BERT-based LSTM-CNN also reaches slightly better accuracies than other BERT-based hybrid architectures."
Proactive Detractor Detection Framework Based on Message-Wise Sentiment Analysis Over Customer Support Interactions,"In this work, we propose a framework relying solely on chat-based customer support (CS) interactions for predicting the recommendation decision of individual users. For our case study, we analyzed a total number of 16.4k users and 48.7k customer support conversations within the financial vertical of a large e-commerce company in Latin America. Consequently, our main contributions and objectives are to use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to assess and predict the recommendation behavior where, in addition to using static sentiment analysis, we exploit the predictive power of each user's sentiment dynamics. Our results show that, with respective feature interpretability, it is possible to predict the likelihood of a user to recommend a product or service, based solely on the message-wise sentiment evolution of their CS conversations in a fully automated way."
AX-MABSA: A Framework for Extremely Weakly Supervised Multi-label Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis,"Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis is a dominant research area with potential applications in social media analytics, business, finance, and health. Prior works in this area are primarily based on supervised methods, with a few techniques using weak supervision limited to predicting a single aspect category per review sentence. In this paper, we present an extremely weakly supervised multi-label Aspect Category Sentiment Analysis framework which does not use any labelled data. We only rely on a single word per class as an initial indicative information. We further propose an automatic word selection technique to choose these seed categories and sentiment words. We explore unsupervised language model post-training to improve the overall performance, and propose a multi-label generator model to generate multiple aspect category-sentiment pairs per review sentence. Experiments conducted on four benchmark datasets showcase our method to outperform other weakly supervised baselines by a significant margin."
A Comparison of Automatic Labelling Approaches for Sentiment Analysis,"Labelling a large quantity of social media data for the task of supervised machine learning is not only time-consuming but also difficult and expensive. On the other hand, the accuracy of supervised machine learning models is strongly related to the quality of the labelled data on which they train, and automatic sentiment labelling techniques could reduce the time and cost of human labelling. We have compared three automatic sentiment labelling techniques: TextBlob, Vader, and Afinn to assign sentiments to tweets without any human assistance. We compare three scenarios: one uses training and testing datasets with existing ground truth labels; the second experiment uses automatic labels as training and testing datasets; and the third experiment uses three automatic labelling techniques to label the training dataset and uses the ground truth labels for testing. The experiments were evaluated on two Twitter datasets: SemEval-2013 (DS-1) and SemEval-2016 (DS-2). Results show that the Afinn labelling technique obtains the highest accuracy of 80.17% (DS-1) and 80.05% (DS-2) using a BiLSTM deep learning model. These findings imply that automatic text labelling could provide significant benefits, and suggest a feasible alternative to the time and cost of human labelling efforts."
A Case Study of Chinese Sentiment Analysis on Social Media Reviews Based on LSTM,"Network public opinion analysis is obtained by a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and public opinion supervision, and is crucial for monitoring public mood and trends. Therefore, network public opinion analysis can identify and solve potential and budding social problems. This study aims to realize an analysis of Chinese sentiment in social media reviews using a long short-term memory network (LSTM) model. The dataset was obtained from Sina Weibo using a web crawler and was cleaned with Pandas. First, Chinese comments regarding the legal sentencing in of Tangshan attack and Jiang Ge Case were segmented and vectorized. Then, a binary LSTM model was trained and tested. Finally, sentiment analysis results were obtained by analyzing the comments with the LSTM model. The accuracy of the proposed model has reached approximately 92%."
On the Use of Modality-Specific Large-Scale Pre-Trained Encoders for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis,"This paper investigates the effectiveness and implementation of modality-specific large-scale pre-trained encoders for multimodal sentiment analysis~(MSA). Although the effectiveness of pre-trained encoders in various fields has been reported, conventional MSA methods employ them for only linguistic modality, and their application has not been investigated. This paper compares the features yielded by large-scale pre-trained encoders with conventional heuristic features. One each of the largest pre-trained encoders publicly available for each modality are used; CLIP-ViT, WavLM, and BERT for visual, acoustic, and linguistic modalities, respectively. Experiments on two datasets reveal that methods with domain-specific pre-trained encoders attain better performance than those with conventional features in both unimodal and multimodal scenarios. We also find it better to use the outputs of the intermediate layers of the encoders than those of the output layer. The codes are available at https://github.com/ando-hub/MSA_Pretrain."
Improving the Modality Representation with Multi-View Contrastive Learning for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis,"Modality representation learning is an important problem for multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA), since the highly distinguishable representations can contribute to improving the analysis effect. Previous works of MSA have usually focused on multimodal fusion strategies, and the deep study of modal representation learning was given less attention. Recently, contrastive learning has been confirmed effective at endowing the learned representation with stronger discriminate ability. Inspired by this, we explore the improvement approaches of modality representation with contrastive learning in this study. To this end, we devise a three-stages framework with multi-view contrastive learning to refine representations for the specific objectives. At the first stage, for the improvement of unimodal representations, we employ the supervised contrastive learning to pull samples within the same class together while the other samples are pushed apart. At the second stage, a self-supervised contrastive learning is designed for the improvement of the distilled unimodal representations after cross-modal interaction. At last, we leverage again the supervised contrastive learning to enhance the fused multimodal representation. After all the contrast trainings, we next achieve the classification task based on frozen representations. We conduct experiments on three open datasets, and results show the advance of our model."
Retrieving Users' Opinions on Social Media with Multimodal Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis,"People post their opinions and experiences on social media, yielding rich databases of end-users' sentiments. This paper shows to what extent machine learning can analyze and structure these databases. An automated data analysis pipeline is deployed to provide insights into user-generated content for researchers in other domains. First, the domain expert can select an image and a term of interest. Then, the pipeline uses image retrieval to find all images showing similar content and applies aspect-based sentiment analysis to outline users' opinions about the selected term. As part of an interdisciplinary project between architecture and computer science researchers, an empirical study of Hamburg's Elbphilharmonie was conveyed. Therefore, we selected 300 thousand posts with the hashtag \enquote{\texttt{hamburg}} from the platform Flickr. Image retrieval methods generated a subset of slightly more than 1.5 thousand images displaying the Elbphilharmonie. We found that these posts mainly convey a neutral or positive sentiment towards it. With this pipeline, we suggest a new semantic computing method that offers novel insights into end-users opinions, e.g., for architecture domain experts."
Multimodal Contrastive Learning via Uni-Modal Coding and Cross-Modal Prediction for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis,"Multimodal representation learning is a challenging task in which previous work mostly focus on either uni-modality pre-training or cross-modality fusion. In fact, we regard modeling multimodal representation as building a skyscraper, where laying stable foundation and designing the main structure are equally essential. The former is like encoding robust uni-modal representation while the later is like integrating interactive information among different modalities, both of which are critical to learning an effective multimodal representation. Recently, contrastive learning has been successfully applied in representation learning, which can be utilized as the pillar of the skyscraper and benefit the model to extract the most important features contained in the multimodal data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named MultiModal Contrastive Learning (MMCL) for multimodal representation to capture intra- and inter-modality dynamics simultaneously. Specifically, we devise uni-modal contrastive coding with an efficient uni-modal feature augmentation strategy to filter inherent noise contained in acoustic and visual modality and acquire more robust uni-modality representations. Besides, a pseudo siamese network is presented to predict representation across different modalities, which successfully captures cross-modal dynamics. Moreover, we design two contrastive learning tasks, instance- and sentiment-based contrastive learning, to promote the process of prediction and learn more interactive information related to sentiment. Extensive experiments conducted on two public datasets demonstrate that our method surpasses the state-of-the-art methods."
Progressive Sentiment Analysis for Code-Switched Text Data,"Multilingual transformer language models have recently attracted much attention from researchers and are used in cross-lingual transfer learning for many NLP tasks such as text classification and named entity recognition. However, similar methods for transfer learning from monolingual text to code-switched text have not been extensively explored mainly due to the following challenges: (1) Code-switched corpus, unlike monolingual corpus, consists of more than one language and existing methods can't be applied efficiently, (2) Code-switched corpus is usually made of resource-rich and low-resource languages and upon using multilingual pre-trained language models, the final model might bias towards resource-rich language. In this paper, we focus on code-switched sentiment analysis where we have a labelled resource-rich language dataset and unlabelled code-switched data. We propose a framework that takes the distinction between resource-rich and low-resource language into account. Instead of training on the entire code-switched corpus at once, we create buckets based on the fraction of words in the resource-rich language and progressively train from resource-rich language dominated samples to low-resource language dominated samples. Extensive experiments across multiple language pairs demonstrate that progressive training helps low-resource language dominated samples."
Entity-level Sentiment Analysis in Contact Center Telephone Conversations,"Entity-level sentiment analysis predicts the sentiment about entities mentioned in a given text. It is very useful in a business context to understand user emotions towards certain entities, such as products or companies. In this paper, we demonstrate how we developed an entity-level sentiment analysis system that analyzes English telephone conversation transcripts in contact centers to provide business insight. We present two approaches, one entirely based on the transformer-based DistilBERT model, and another that uses a convolutional neural network supplemented with some heuristic rules."
Volatility forecasting using Deep Learning and sentiment analysis,"Several studies have shown that deep learning models can provide more accurate volatility forecasts than the traditional methods used within this domain. This paper presents a composite model that merges a deep learning approach with sentiment analysis for predicting market volatility. To classify public sentiment, we use a Convolutional Neural Network, which obtained data from Reddit global news headlines. We then describe a composite forecasting model, a Long-Short-Term-Memory Neural Network method, to use historical sentiment and the previous day's volatility to make forecasts. We employed this method on the past volatility of the S&P500 and the major BRICS indices to corroborate its effectiveness. Our results demonstrate that including sentiment can improve Deep Learning volatility forecasting models. However, in contrast to return forecasting, the performance benefits of including sentiment appear for volatility forecasting appears to be market specific."
Sentiment-Aware Word and Sentence Level Pre-training for Sentiment Analysis,"Most existing pre-trained language representation models (PLMs) are sub-optimal in sentiment analysis tasks, as they capture the sentiment information from word-level while under-considering sentence-level information. In this paper, we propose SentiWSP, a novel Sentiment-aware pre-trained language model with combined Word-level and Sentence-level Pre-training tasks. The word level pre-training task detects replaced sentiment words, via a generator-discriminator framework, to enhance the PLM's knowledge about sentiment words. The sentence level pre-training task further strengthens the discriminator via a contrastive learning framework, with similar sentences as negative samples, to encode sentiments in a sentence. Extensive experimental results show that SentiWSP achieves new state-of-the-art performance on various sentence-level and aspect-level sentiment classification benchmarks. We have made our code and model publicly available at https://github.com/XMUDM/SentiWSP."
Identification of Common Trends in Political Speech in Social Media using Sentiment Analysis,"Social Media have been extensively used for commercial and political communication, besides their initial scope of providing an easy-to-use outlet to produce and consume user-generated content. Besides being a popular medium, Social Media have definitely changed the way we express ourselves or where we look for emerging news and commentary, especially during troubled times. In this paper, we examine a corpus assembled from the Twitter accounts of politicians in the United States and annotated with respect to their audience and the sentiment they convey with each post. Our purpose is to examine whether there are stylistic differences among representatives of different political ideologies, directed to different audiences or with dissimilar agendas. Our findings verify existing knowledge from conventional written communication and can be used to evaluate the quality and depth of political expression and dialogue, especially during the period leading to an election."
Frustratingly Easy Sentiment Analysis of Text Streams: Generating High-Quality Emotion Arcs Using Emotion Lexicons,"Automatically generated emotion arcs -- that capture how an individual or a population feels over time -- are widely used in industry and research. However, there is little work on evaluating the generated arcs. This is in part due to the difficulty of establishing the true (gold) emotion arc. Our work, for the first time, systematically and quantitatively evaluates automatically generated emotion arcs. We also compare two common ways of generating emotion arcs: Machine-Learning (ML) models and Lexicon-Only (LexO) methods. Using a number of diverse datasets, we systematically study the relationship between the quality of an emotion lexicon and the quality of the emotion arc that can be generated with it. We also study the relationship between the quality of an instance-level emotion detection system (say from an ML model) and the quality of emotion arcs that can be generated with it. We show that despite being markedly poor at instance level, LexO methods are highly accurate at generating emotion arcs by aggregating information from hundreds of instances. This has wide-spread implications for commercial development, as well as research in psychology, public health, digital humanities, etc. that values simple interpretable methods and disprefers the need for domain-specific training data, programming expertise, and high-carbon-footprint models."
On the Evaluation of the Plausibility and Faithfulness of Sentiment Analysis Explanations,"Current Explainable AI (ExAI) methods, especially in the NLP field, are conducted on various datasets by employing different metrics to evaluate several aspects. The lack of a common evaluation framework is hindering the progress tracking of such methods and their wider adoption. In this work, inspired by offline information retrieval, we propose different metrics and techniques to evaluate the explainability of SA models from two angles. First, we evaluate the strength of the extracted ""rationales"" in faithfully explaining the predicted outcome. Second, we measure the agreement between ExAI methods and human judgment on a homegrown dataset1 to reflect on the rationales plausibility. Our conducted experiments comprise four dimensions: (1) the underlying architectures of SA models, (2) the approach followed by the ExAI method, (3) the reasoning difficulty, and (4) the homogeneity of the ground-truth rationales. We empirically demonstrate that anchors explanations are more aligned with the human judgment and can be more confident in extracting supporting rationales. As can be foreseen, the reasoning complexity of sentiment is shown to thwart ExAI methods from extracting supporting evidence. Moreover, a remarkable discrepancy is discerned between the results of different explainability methods on the various architectures suggesting the need for consolidation to observe enhanced performance. Predominantly, transformers are shown to exhibit better explainability than convolutional and recurrent architectures. Our work paves the way towards designing more interpretable NLP models and enabling a common evaluation ground for their relative strengths and robustness."
Instruction Tuning for Few-Shot Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis,"Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is a fine-grained sentiment analysis task which involves four elements from user-generated texts: aspect term, aspect category, opinion term, and sentiment polarity. Most computational approaches focus on some of the ABSA sub-tasks such as tuple (aspect term, sentiment polarity) or triplet (aspect term, opinion term, sentiment polarity) extraction using either pipeline or joint modeling approaches. Recently, generative approaches have been proposed to extract all four elements as (one or more) quadruplets from text as a single task. In this work, we take a step further and propose a unified framework for solving ABSA, and the associated sub-tasks to improve the performance in few-shot scenarios. To this end, we fine-tune a T5 model with instructional prompts in a multi-task learning fashion covering all the sub-tasks, as well as the entire quadruple prediction task. In experiments with multiple benchmark data sets, we show that the proposed multi-task prompting approach brings performance boost (by absolute 6.75 F1) in the few-shot learning setting."
Transfer Learning with Joint Fine-Tuning for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis,"Most existing methods focus on sentiment analysis of textual data. However, recently there has been a massive use of images and videos on social platforms, motivating sentiment analysis from other modalities. Current studies show that exploring other modalities (e.g., images) increases sentiment analysis performance. State-of-the-art multimodal models, such as CLIP and VisualBERT, are pre-trained on datasets with the text paired with images. Although the results obtained by these models are promising, pre-training and sentiment analysis fine-tuning tasks of these models are computationally expensive. This paper introduces a transfer learning approach using joint fine-tuning for sentiment analysis. Our proposal achieved competitive results using a more straightforward alternative fine-tuning strategy that leverages different pre-trained unimodal models and efficiently combines them in a multimodal space. Moreover, our proposal allows flexibility when incorporating any pre-trained model for texts and images during the joint fine-tuning stage, being especially interesting for sentiment classification in low-resource scenarios."
Missing Modality meets Meta Sampling (M3S): An Efficient Universal Approach for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis with Missing Modality,"Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) is an important way of observing mental activities with the help of data captured from multiple modalities. However, due to the recording or transmission error, some modalities may include incomplete data. Most existing works that address missing modalities usually assume a particular modality is completely missing and seldom consider a mixture of missing across multiple modalities. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective meta-sampling approach for multimodal sentiment analysis with missing modalities, namely Missing Modality-based Meta Sampling (M3S). To be specific, M3S formulates a missing modality sampling strategy into the modal agnostic meta-learning (MAML) framework. M3S can be treated as an efficient add-on training component on existing models and significantly improve their performances on multimodal data with a mixture of missing modalities. We conduct experiments on IEMOCAP, SIMS and CMU-MOSI datasets, and superior performance is achieved compared with recent state-of-the-art methods."
Improving Sentiment Analysis By Emotion Lexicon Approach on Vietnamese Texts,"The sentiment analysis task has various applications in practice. In the sentiment analysis task, words and phrases that represent positive and negative emotions are important. Finding out the words that represent the emotion from the text can improve the performance of the classification models for the sentiment analysis task. In this paper, we propose a methodology that combines the emotion lexicon with the classification model to enhance the accuracy of the models. Our experimental results show that the emotion lexicon combined with the classification model improves the performance of models."
Sentiment Analysis of ESG disclosures on Stock Market,"In this paper, we look at the impact of Environment, Social and Governance related news articles and social media data on the stock market performance. We pick four stocks of companies which are widely known in their domain to understand the complete effect of ESG as the newly opted investment style remains restricted to only the stocks with widespread information. We summarise live data of both twitter tweets and newspaper articles and create a sentiment index using a dictionary technique based on online information for the month of July, 2022. We look at the stock price data for all the four companies and calculate the percentage change in each of them. We also compare the overall sentiment of the company to its percentage change over a specific historical period."
Lex2Sent: A bagging approach to unsupervised sentiment analysis,"Unsupervised sentiment analysis is traditionally performed by counting those words in a text that are stored in a sentiment lexicon and then assigning a label depending on the proportion of positive and negative words registered. While these ""counting"" methods are considered to be beneficial as they rate a text deterministically, their classification rates decrease when the analyzed texts are short or the vocabulary differs from what the lexicon considers default. The model proposed in this paper, called Lex2Sent, is an unsupervised sentiment analysis method to improve the classification of sentiment lexicon methods. For this purpose, a Doc2Vec-model is trained to determine the distances between document embeddings and the embeddings of the positive and negative part of a sentiment lexicon. These distances are then evaluated for multiple executions of Doc2Vec on resampled documents and are averaged to perform the classification task. For three benchmark datasets considered in this paper, the proposed Lex2Sent outperforms every evaluated lexicon, including state-of-the-art lexica like VADER or the Opinion Lexicon in terms of classification rate."
Deep Learning-Based Sentiment Analysis of COVID-19 Vaccination Responses from Twitter Data,"This COVID-19 pandemic is so dreadful that it leads to severe anxiety, phobias, and complicated feelings or emotions. Even after vaccination against Coronavirus has been initiated, people feelings have become more diverse and complex, and our goal is to understand and unravel their sentiments in this research using some Deep Learning techniques. Social media is currently the best way to express feelings and emotions, and with the help of it, specifically Twitter, one can have a better idea of what is trending and what is going on in people minds. Our motivation for this research is to understand the sentiment of people regarding the vaccination process, and their diverse thoughts regarding this. In this research, the timeline of the collected tweets was from December 21 to July 21, and contained tweets about the most common vaccines available recently from all across the world. The sentiments of people regarding vaccines of all sorts were assessed by using a Natural Language Processing (NLP) tool named Valence Aware Dictionary for sEntiment Reasoner (VADER). By initializing the sentiment polarities into 3 groups (positive, negative and neutral), the overall scenario was visualized here and our findings came out as 33.96% positive, 17.55% negative and 48.49% neutral responses. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) oriented architecture such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM and Bi-LSTM) is used to assess the performance of the predictive models, with LSTM achieving an accuracy of 90.59% and Bi-LSTM achieving an accuracy of 90.83%. Other performance metrics such as Precision, Recall, F-1 score, and Confusion matrix were also shown to validate our models and findings more effectively. This study will help everyone understand public opinion on the COVID-19 vaccines and impact the aim of eradicating the Coronavirus from our beautiful world."
Adaptation of domain-specific transformer models with text oversampling for sentiment analysis of social media posts on Covid-19 vaccines,"Covid-19 has spread across the world and several vaccines have been developed to counter its surge. To identify the correct sentiments associated with the vaccines from social media posts, we fine-tune various state-of-the-art pre-trained transformer models on tweets associated with Covid-19 vaccines. Specifically, we use the recently introduced state-of-the-art pre-trained transformer models RoBERTa, XLNet and BERT, and the domain-specific transformer models CT-BERT and BERTweet that are pre-trained on Covid-19 tweets. We further explore the option of text augmentation by oversampling using Language Model based Oversampling Technique (LMOTE) to improve the accuracies of these models, specifically, for small sample datasets where there is an imbalanced class distribution among the positive, negative and neutral sentiment classes. Our results summarize our findings on the suitability of text oversampling for imbalanced small sample datasets that are used to fine-tune state-of-the-art pre-trained transformer models, and the utility of domain-specific transformer models for the classification task."
Linear Transformations for Cross-lingual Sentiment Analysis,"This paper deals with cross-lingual sentiment analysis in Czech, English and French languages. We perform zero-shot cross-lingual classification using five linear transformations combined with LSTM and CNN based classifiers. We compare the performance of the individual transformations, and in addition, we confront the transformation-based approach with existing state-of-the-art BERT-like models. We show that the pre-trained embeddings from the target domain are crucial to improving the cross-lingual classification results, unlike in the monolingual classification, where the effect is not so distinctive."
Web 3.0 Adoption Behavior: PLS-SEM and Sentiment Analysis,"Web 3.0 is considered as future of Internet where decentralization, user personalization and privacy protection would be the main aspects of Internet. Aim of this research work is to elucidate the adoption behavior of Web 3.0through a multi-analytical approach based on Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) and Twitter sentiment analysis. A theoretical framework centered on Performance Expectancy (PE), Electronic Word-of-Mouth (eWOM) and Digital Dexterity (DD), was hypothesized towards Behavioral Intention (INT) of the Web 3.0 adoption. Surveyed data were collected through online questionnaires and 167 responses were analyzed through PLS-SEM. While 3,989 tweets of Web3 were analyzed by VADER sentiment analysis tool in RapidMiner. PLS-SEM results showed that DD and eWOM had significant impact while PE had no effect on INT. Moreover, these results were also validated by PLS-Predict method. While sentiment analysis explored that 56% tweets on Web 3.0 were positive in sense and 7% depicted negative sentiment while remaining were neutral. Such inferences are novel in nature and an innovative addition to web informatics and could support the stakeholders towards web technology integration"
A multiclass Q-NLP sentiment analysis experiment using DisCoCat,"Sentiment analysis is a branch of Natural Language Processing (NLP) which goal is to assign sentiments or emotions to particular sentences or words. Performing this task is particularly useful for companies wishing to take into account customer feedback through chatbots or verbatim. This has been done extensively in the literature using various approaches, ranging from simple models to deep transformer neural networks. In this paper, we will tackle sentiment analysis in the Noisy Intermediate Scale Computing (NISQ) era, using the DisCoCat model of language. We will first present the basics of quantum computing and the DisCoCat model. This will enable us to define a general framework to perform NLP tasks on a quantum computer. We will then extend the two-class classification that was performed by Lorenz et al. (2021) to a four-class sentiment analysis experiment on a much larger dataset, showing the scalability of such a framework."
Quantitative Stopword Generation for Sentiment Analysis via Recursive and Iterative Deletion,"Stopwords carry little semantic information and are often removed from text data to reduce dataset size and improve machine learning model performance. Consequently, researchers have sought to develop techniques for generating effective stopword sets. Previous approaches have ranged from qualitative techniques relying upon linguistic experts, to statistical approaches that extract word importance using correlations or frequency-dependent metrics computed on a corpus. We present a novel quantitative approach that employs iterative and recursive feature deletion algorithms to see which words can be deleted from a pre-trained transformer's vocabulary with the least degradation to its performance, specifically for the task of sentiment analysis. Empirically, stopword lists generated via this approach drastically reduce dataset size while negligibly impacting model performance, in one such example shrinking the corpus by 28.4% while improving the accuracy of a trained logistic regression model by 0.25%. In another instance, the corpus was shrunk by 63.7% with a 2.8% decrease in accuracy. These promising results indicate that our approach can generate highly effective stopword sets for specific NLP tasks."
Video-based Cross-modal Auxiliary Network for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis,"Multimodal sentiment analysis has a wide range of applications due to its information complementarity in multimodal interactions. Previous works focus more on investigating efficient joint representations, but they rarely consider the insufficient unimodal features extraction and data redundancy of multimodal fusion. In this paper, a Video-based Cross-modal Auxiliary Network (VCAN) is proposed, which is comprised of an audio features map module and a cross-modal selection module. The first module is designed to substantially increase feature diversity in audio feature extraction, aiming to improve classification accuracy by providing more comprehensive acoustic representations. To empower the model to handle redundant visual features, the second module is addressed to efficiently filter the redundant visual frames during integrating audiovisual data. Moreover, a classifier group consisting of several image classification networks is introduced to predict sentiment polarities and emotion categories. Extensive experimental results on RAVDESS, CMU-MOSI, and CMU-MOSEI benchmarks indicate that VCAN is significantly superior to the state-of-the-art methods for improving the classification accuracy of multimodal sentiment analysis."
A Spanish dataset for Targeted Sentiment Analysis of political headlines,"Subjective texts have been studied by several works as they can induce certain behaviours in their users. Most work focuses on user-generated texts in social networks, but some other texts also comprise opinions on certain topics and could influence judgement criteria during political decisions. In this work, we address the task of Targeted Sentiment Analysis for the domain of news headlines, published by the main outlets during the 2019 Argentinean Presidential Elections. For this purpose, we present a polarity dataset of 1,976 headlines mentioning candidates in the 2019 elections at the target level. Preliminary experiments with state-of-the-art classification algorithms based on pre-trained linguistic models suggest that target information is helpful for this task. We make our data and pre-trained models publicly available."
Cross-Modality Gated Attention Fusion for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis,"Multimodal sentiment analysis is an important research task to predict the sentiment score based on the different modality data from a specific opinion video. Many previous pieces of research have proved the significance of utilizing the shared and unique information across different modalities. However, the high-order combined signals from multimodal data would also help extract satisfied representations. In this paper, we propose CMGA, a Cross-Modality Gated Attention fusion model for MSA that tends to make adequate interaction across different modality pairs. CMGA also adds a forget gate to filter the noisy and redundant signals introduced in the interaction procedure. We experiment on two benchmark datasets in MSA, MOSI, and MOSEI, illustrating the performance of CMGA over several baseline models. We also conduct the ablation study to demonstrate the function of different components inside CMGA."
A Hierarchical Interactive Network for Joint Span-based Aspect-Sentiment Analysis,"Recently, some span-based methods have achieved encouraging performances for joint aspect-sentiment analysis, which first extract aspects (aspect extraction) by detecting aspect boundaries and then classify the span-level sentiments (sentiment classification). However, most existing approaches either sequentially extract task-specific features, leading to insufficient feature interactions, or they encode aspect features and sentiment features in a parallel manner, implying that feature representation in each task is largely independent of each other except for input sharing. Both of them ignore the internal correlations between the aspect extraction and sentiment classification. To solve this problem, we novelly propose a hierarchical interactive network (HI-ASA) to model two-way interactions between two tasks appropriately, where the hierarchical interactions involve two steps: shallow-level interaction and deep-level interaction. First, we utilize cross-stitch mechanism to combine the different task-specific features selectively as the input to ensure proper two-way interactions. Second, the mutual information technique is applied to mutually constrain learning between two tasks in the output layer, thus the aspect input and the sentiment input are capable of encoding features of the other task via backpropagation. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate HI-ASA's superiority over baselines."
"An Exploratory Study of Tweets about the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron Variant: Insights from Sentiment Analysis, Language Interpretation, Source Tracking, Type Classification, and Embedded URL Detection","This paper presents the findings of an exploratory study on the continuously generating Big Data on Twitter related to the sharing of information, news, views, opinions, ideas, feedback, and experiences about the COVID-19 pandemic, with a specific focus on the Omicron variant, which is the globally dominant variant of SARS-CoV-2 at this time. A total of 12028 tweets about the Omicron variant were studied, and the specific characteristics of tweets that were analyzed include - sentiment, language, source, type, and embedded URLs. The findings of this study are manifold. First, from sentiment analysis, it was observed that 50.5% of tweets had a neutral emotion. The other emotions - bad, good, terrible, and great were found in 15.6%, 14.0%, 12.5%, and 7.5% of the tweets, respectively. Second, the findings of language interpretation showed that 65.9% of the tweets were posted in English. It was followed by Spanish, French, Italian, and other languages. Third, the findings from source tracking showed that Twitter for Android was associated with 35.2% of tweets. It was followed by Twitter Web App, Twitter for iPhone, Twitter for iPad, and other sources. Fourth, studying the type of tweets revealed that retweets accounted for 60.8% of the tweets, it was followed by original tweets and replies that accounted for 19.8% and 19.4% of the tweets, respectively. Fifth, in terms of embedded URL analysis, the most common domain embedded in the tweets was found to be twitter.com, which was followed by biorxiv.org, nature.com, and other domains. Finally, to support similar research in this field, we have developed a Twitter dataset that comprises more than 500,000 tweets about the SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant since the first detected case of this variant on November 24, 2021."
Causal Intervention Improves Implicit Sentiment Analysis,"Despite having achieved great success for sentiment analysis, existing neural models struggle with implicit sentiment analysis. This may be due to the fact that they may latch onto spurious correlations (""shortcuts"", e.g., focusing only on explicit sentiment words), resulting in undermining the effectiveness and robustness of the learned model. In this work, we propose a causal intervention model for Implicit Sentiment Analysis using Instrumental Variable (ISAIV). We first review sentiment analysis from a causal perspective and analyze the confounders existing in this task. Then, we introduce an instrumental variable to eliminate the confounding causal effects, thus extracting the pure causal effect between sentence and sentiment. We compare the proposed ISAIV model with several strong baselines on both the general implicit sentiment analysis and aspect-based implicit sentiment analysis tasks. The results indicate the great advantages of our model and the efficacy of implicit sentiment reasoning."
Mere Contrastive Learning for Cross-Domain Sentiment Analysis,"Cross-domain sentiment analysis aims to predict the sentiment of texts in the target domain using the model trained on the source domain to cope with the scarcity of labeled data. Previous studies are mostly cross-entropy-based methods for the task, which suffer from instability and poor generalization. In this paper, we explore contrastive learning on the cross-domain sentiment analysis task. We propose a modified contrastive objective with in-batch negative samples so that the sentence representations from the same class will be pushed close while those from the different classes become further apart in the latent space. Experiments on two widely used datasets show that our model can achieve state-of-the-art performance in both cross-domain and multi-domain sentiment analysis tasks. Meanwhile, visualizations demonstrate the effectiveness of transferring knowledge learned in the source domain to the target domain and the adversarial test verifies the robustness of our model."
Efficient Multimodal Transformer with Dual-Level Feature Restoration for Robust Multimodal Sentiment Analysis,"With the proliferation of user-generated online videos, Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) has attracted increasing attention recently. Despite significant progress, there are still two major challenges on the way towards robust MSA: 1) inefficiency when modeling cross-modal interactions in unaligned multimodal data; and 2) vulnerability to random modality feature missing which typically occurs in realistic settings. In this paper, we propose a generic and unified framework to address them, named Efficient Multimodal Transformer with Dual-Level Feature Restoration (EMT-DLFR). Concretely, EMT employs utterance-level representations from each modality as the global multimodal context to interact with local unimodal features and mutually promote each other. It not only avoids the quadratic scaling cost of previous local-local cross-modal interaction methods but also leads to better performance. To improve model robustness in the incomplete modality setting, on the one hand, DLFR performs low-level feature reconstruction to implicitly encourage the model to learn semantic information from incomplete data. On the other hand, it innovatively regards complete and incomplete data as two different views of one sample and utilizes siamese representation learning to explicitly attract their high-level representations. Comprehensive experiments on three popular datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in both complete and incomplete modality settings."
"Characterizing the 2022 Russo-Ukrainian Conflict Through the Lenses of Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis: Dataset, Methodology, and Preliminary Findings","Online social networks (OSNs) play a crucial role in today's world. On the one hand, they allow free speech, information sharing, and social-movements organization, to cite a few. On the other hand, they are the tool of choice to spread disinformation, hate speech, and to support propaganda. For these reasons, OSNs data mining and analysis aimed at detecting disinformation campaigns that may arm the society and, more in general, poison the democratic posture of states, are essential activities during key events such as elections, pandemics, and conflicts. In this paper, we studied the 2022 Russo-Ukrainian conflict on Twitter, one of the most used OSNs. We quantitatively and qualitatively analyze a dataset of more than 5.5+ million tweets related to the subject, generated by 1.8+ million unique users. By leveraging statistical analysis techniques and aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), we discover hidden insights in the collected data and abnormal patterns in the users' sentiment that in some cases confirm while in other cases disprove common beliefs on the conflict. In particular, based on our findings and contrary to what suggested in some mainstream media, there is no evidence of massive disinformation campaigns. However, we have identified several anomalies in the behavior of particular accounts and in the sentiment trend for some subjects that represent a starting point for further analysis in the field. The adopted techniques, the availability of the data, the replicability of the experiments, and the preliminary findings, other than being interesting on their own, also pave the way to further research in the domain."
"Hybrid Multimodal Feature Extraction, Mining and Fusion for Sentiment Analysis","In this paper, we present our solutions for the Multimodal Sentiment Analysis Challenge (MuSe) 2022, which includes MuSe-Humor, MuSe-Reaction and MuSe-Stress Sub-challenges. The MuSe 2022 focuses on humor detection, emotional reactions and multimodal emotional stress utilizing different modalities and data sets. In our work, different kinds of multimodal features are extracted, including acoustic, visual, text and biological features. These features are fused by TEMMA and GRU with self-attention mechanism frameworks. In this paper, 1) several new audio features, facial expression features and paragraph-level text embeddings are extracted for accuracy improvement. 2) we substantially improve the accuracy and reliability of multimodal sentiment prediction by mining and blending the multimodal features. 3) effective data augmentation strategies are applied in model training to alleviate the problem of sample imbalance and prevent the model from learning biased subject characters. For the MuSe-Humor sub-challenge, our model obtains the AUC score of 0.8932. For the MuSe-Reaction sub-challenge, the Pearson's Correlations Coefficient of our approach on the test set is 0.3879, which outperforms all other participants. For the MuSe-Stress sub-challenge, our approach outperforms the baseline in both arousal and valence on the test dataset, reaching a final combined result of 0.5151."
PyABSA: A Modularized Framework for Reproducible Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis,"The advancement of aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) has urged the lack of a user-friendly framework that can largely lower the difficulty of reproducing state-of-the-art ABSA performance, especially for beginners. To meet the demand, we present \our, a modularized framework built on PyTorch for reproducible ABSA. To facilitate ABSA research, PyABSA supports several ABSA subtasks, including aspect term extraction, aspect sentiment classification, and end-to-end aspect-based sentiment analysis. Concretely, PyABSA integrates 29 models and 26 datasets. With just a few lines of code, the result of a model on a specific dataset can be reproduced. With a modularized design, PyABSA can also be flexiblely extended to considered models, datasets, and other related tasks. Besides, PyABSA highlights its data augmentation and annotation features, which significantly address data scarity. All are welcome to have a try at \url{https://github.com/yangheng95/PyABSA}."
CubeMLP: An MLP-based Model for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis and Depression Estimation,"Multimodal sentiment analysis and depression estimation are two important research topics that aim to predict human mental states using multimodal data. Previous research has focused on developing effective fusion strategies for exchanging and integrating mind-related information from different modalities. Some MLP-based techniques have recently achieved considerable success in a variety of computer vision tasks. Inspired by this, we explore multimodal approaches with a feature-mixing perspective in this study. To this end, we introduce CubeMLP, a multimodal feature processing framework based entirely on MLP. CubeMLP consists of three independent MLP units, each of which has two affine transformations. CubeMLP accepts all relevant modality features as input and mixes them across three axes. After extracting the characteristics using CubeMLP, the mixed multimodal features are flattened for task predictions. Our experiments are conducted on sentiment analysis datasets: CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI, and depression estimation dataset: AVEC2019. The results show that CubeMLP can achieve state-of-the-art performance with a much lower computing cost."
Enhancing Collaborative Filtering Recommender with Prompt-Based Sentiment Analysis,"Collaborative Filtering(CF) recommender is a crucial application in the online market and ecommerce. However, CF recommender has been proven to suffer from persistent problems related to sparsity of the user rating that will further lead to a cold-start issue. Existing methods address the data sparsity issue by applying token-level sentiment analysis that translate text review into sentiment scores as a complement of the user rating. In this paper, we attempt to optimize the sentiment analysis with advanced NLP models including BERT and RoBERTa, and experiment on whether the CF recommender has been further enhanced. We build the recommenders on the Amazon US Reviews dataset, and tune the pretrained BERT and RoBERTa with the traditional fine-tuned paradigm as well as the new prompt-based learning paradigm. Experimental result shows that the recommender enhanced with the sentiment ratings predicted by the fine-tuned RoBERTa has the best performance, and achieved 30.7% overall gain by comparing MAP, NDCG and precision at K to the baseline recommender. Prompt-based learning paradigm, although superior to traditional fine-tune paradigm in pure sentiment analysis, fail to further improve the CF recommender."
Counterfactual Reasoning for Out-of-distribution Multimodal Sentiment Analysis,"Existing studies on multimodal sentiment analysis heavily rely on textual modality and unavoidably induce the spurious correlations between textual words and sentiment labels. This greatly hinders the model generalization ability. To address this problem, we define the task of out-of-distribution (OOD) multimodal sentiment analysis. This task aims to estimate and mitigate the bad effect of textual modality for strong OOD generalization. To this end, we embrace causal inference, which inspects the causal relationships via a causal graph. From the graph, we find that the spurious correlations are attributed to the direct effect of textual modality on the model prediction while the indirect one is more reliable by considering multimodal semantics. Inspired by this, we devise a model-agnostic counterfactual framework for multimodal sentiment analysis, which captures the direct effect of textual modality via an extra text model and estimates the indirect one by a multimodal model. During the inference, we first estimate the direct effect by the counterfactual inference, and then subtract it from the total effect of all modalities to obtain the indirect effect for reliable prediction. Extensive experiments show the superior effectiveness and generalization ability of our proposed framework."
Aspect-specific Context Modeling for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis,"Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims at predicting sentiment polarity (SC) or extracting opinion span (OE) expressed towards a given aspect. Previous work in ABSA mostly relies on rather complicated aspect-specific feature induction. Recently, pretrained language models (PLMs), e.g., BERT, have been used as context modeling layers to simplify the feature induction structures and achieve state-of-the-art performance. However, such PLM-based context modeling can be not that aspect-specific. Therefore, a key question is left under-explored: how the aspect-specific context can be better modeled through PLMs? To answer the question, we attempt to enhance aspect-specific context modeling with PLM in a non-intrusive manner. We propose three aspect-specific input transformations, namely aspect companion, aspect prompt, and aspect marker. Informed by these transformations, non-intrusive aspect-specific PLMs can be achieved to promote the PLM to pay more attention to the aspect-specific context in a sentence. Additionally, we craft an adversarial benchmark for ABSA (advABSA) to see how aspect-specific modeling can impact model robustness. Extensive experimental results on standard and adversarial benchmarks for SC and OE demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method, yielding new state-of-the-art performance on OE and competitive performance on SC."
On the Subjectivity of Emotions in Software Projects: How Reliable are Pre-Labeled Data Sets for Sentiment Analysis?,"Social aspects of software projects become increasingly important for research and practice. Different approaches analyze the sentiment of a development team, ranging from simply asking the team to so-called sentiment analysis on text-based communication. These sentiment analysis tools are trained using pre-labeled data sets from different sources, including GitHub and Stack Overflow. In this paper, we investigate if the labels of the statements in the data sets coincide with the perception of potential members of a software project team. Based on an international survey, we compare the median perception of 94 participants with the pre-labeled data sets as well as every single participant's agreement with the predefined labels. Our results point to three remarkable findings: (1) Although the median values coincide with the predefined labels of the data sets in 62.5% of the cases, we observe a huge difference between the single participant's ratings and the labels; (2) there is not a single participant who totally agrees with the predefined labels; and (3) the data set whose labels are based on guidelines performs better than the ad hoc labeled data set."
"The MuSe 2022 Multimodal Sentiment Analysis Challenge: Humor, Emotional Reactions, and Stress","The Multimodal Sentiment Analysis Challenge (MuSe) 2022 is dedicated to multimodal sentiment and emotion recognition. For this year's challenge, we feature three datasets: (i) the Passau Spontaneous Football Coach Humor (Passau-SFCH) dataset that contains audio-visual recordings of German football coaches, labelled for the presence of humour; (ii) the Hume-Reaction dataset in which reactions of individuals to emotional stimuli have been annotated with respect to seven emotional expression intensities, and (iii) the Ulm-Trier Social Stress Test (Ulm-TSST) dataset comprising of audio-visual data labelled with continuous emotion values (arousal and valence) of people in stressful dispositions. Using the introduced datasets, MuSe 2022 2022 addresses three contemporary affective computing problems: in the Humor Detection Sub-Challenge (MuSe-Humor), spontaneous humour has to be recognised; in the Emotional Reactions Sub-Challenge (MuSe-Reaction), seven fine-grained `in-the-wild' emotions have to be predicted; and in the Emotional Stress Sub-Challenge (MuSe-Stress), a continuous prediction of stressed emotion values is featured. The challenge is designed to attract different research communities, encouraging a fusion of their disciplines. Mainly, MuSe 2022 targets the communities of audio-visual emotion recognition, health informatics, and symbolic sentiment analysis. This baseline paper describes the datasets as well as the feature sets extracted from them. A recurrent neural network with LSTM cells is used to set competitive baseline results on the test partitions for each sub-challenge. We report an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of .8480 for MuSe-Humor; .2801 mean (from 7-classes) Pearson's Correlations Coefficient for MuSe-Reaction, as well as .4931 Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) and .4761 for valence and arousal in MuSe-Stress, respectively."
Sensitivity Analysis on Transferred Neural Architectures of BERT and GPT-2 for Financial Sentiment Analysis,"The explosion in novel NLP word embedding and deep learning techniques has induced significant endeavors into potential applications. One of these directions is in the financial sector. Although there is a lot of work done in state-of-the-art models like GPT and BERT, there are relatively few works on how well these methods perform through fine-tuning after being pre-trained, as well as info on how sensitive their parameters are. We investigate the performance and sensitivity of transferred neural architectures from pre-trained GPT-2 and BERT models. We test the fine-tuning performance based on freezing transformer layers, batch size, and learning rate. We find the parameters of BERT are hypersensitive to stochasticity in fine-tuning and that GPT-2 is more stable in such practice. It is also clear that the earlier layers of GPT-2 and BERT contain essential word pattern information that should be maintained."
Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis using Local Context Focus Mechanism with DeBERTa,"Text sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is research on the calculation of people's views, evaluations, attitude and emotions expressed by entities. Text sentiment analysis can be divided into text-level sentiment analysis, sen-tence-level sentiment analysis and aspect-level sentiment analysis. Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is a fine-grained task in the field of sentiment analysis, which aims to predict the polarity of aspects. The research of pre-training neural model has significantly improved the performance of many natural language processing tasks. In recent years, pre training model (PTM) has been applied in ABSA. Therefore, there has been a question, which is whether PTMs contain sufficient syntactic information for ABSA. In this paper, we explored the recent DeBERTa model (Decoding-enhanced BERT with disentangled attention) to solve Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis problem. DeBERTa is a kind of neural language model based on transformer, which uses self-supervised learning to pre-train on a large number of original text corpora. Based on the Local Context Focus (LCF) mechanism, by integrating DeBERTa model, we purpose a multi-task learning model for aspect-based sentiment analysis. The experiments result on the most commonly used the laptop and restaurant datasets of SemEval-2014 and the ACL twitter dataset show that LCF mechanism with DeBERTa has significant improvement."
A Comprehensive Review of Visual-Textual Sentiment Analysis from Social Media Networks,"Social media networks have become a significant aspect of people's lives, serving as a platform for their ideas, opinions and emotions. Consequently, automated sentiment analysis (SA) is critical for recognising people's feelings in ways that other information sources cannot. The analysis of these feelings revealed various applications, including brand evaluations, YouTube film reviews and healthcare applications. As social media continues to develop, people post a massive amount of information in different forms, including text, photos, audio and video. Thus, traditional SA algorithms have become limited, as they do not consider the expressiveness of other modalities. By including such characteristics from various material sources, these multimodal data streams provide new opportunities for optimising the expected results beyond text-based SA. Our study focuses on the forefront field of multimodal SA, which examines visual and textual data posted on social media networks. Many people are more likely to utilise this information to express themselves on these platforms. To serve as a resource for academics in this rapidly growing field, we introduce a comprehensive overview of textual and visual SA, including data pre-processing, feature extraction techniques, sentiment benchmark datasets, and the efficacy of multiple classification methodologies suited to each field. We also provide a brief introduction of the most frequently utilised data fusion strategies and a summary of existing research on visual-textual SA. Finally, we highlight the most significant challenges and investigate several important sentiment applications."
MACSA: A Multimodal Aspect-Category Sentiment Analysis Dataset with Multimodal Fine-grained Aligned Annotations,"Multimodal fine-grained sentiment analysis has recently attracted increasing attention due to its broad applications. However, the existing multimodal fine-grained sentiment datasets most focus on annotating the fine-grained elements in text but ignore those in images, which leads to the fine-grained elements in visual content not receiving the full attention they deserve. In this paper, we propose a new dataset, the Multimodal Aspect-Category Sentiment Analysis (MACSA) dataset, which contains more than 21K text-image pairs. The dataset provides fine-grained annotations for both textual and visual content and firstly uses the aspect category as the pivot to align the fine-grained elements between the two modalities. Based on our dataset, we propose the Multimodal ACSA task and a multimodal graph-based aligned model (MGAM), which adopts a fine-grained cross-modal fusion method. Experimental results show that our method can facilitate the baseline comparison for future research on this corpus. We will make the dataset and code publicly available."
Sentiment Analysis with R: Natural Language Processing for Semi-Automated Assessments of Qualitative Data,"Sentiment analysis is a sub-discipline in the field of natural language processing and computational linguistics and can be used for automated or semi-automated analyses of text documents. One of the aims of these analyses is to recognize an expressed attitude as positive or negative as it can be contained in comments on social media platforms or political documents and speeches as well as fictional and nonfictional texts. Regarding analyses of comments on social media platforms, this is an extension of the previous tutorial on semi-automated screenings of social media network data. A longitudinal perspective regarding social media comments as well as cross-sectional perspectives regarding fictional and nonfictional texts, e.g. entire books and libraries, can lead to extensive text documents. Their analyses can be simplified and accelerated by using sentiment analysis with acceptable inter-rater reliability. Therefore, this tutorial introduces the basic functions for performing a sentiment analysis with R and explains how text documents can be analysed step by step - regardless of their underlying formatting. All prerequisites and steps are described in detail and associated codes are available on GitHub. A comparison of two political speeches illustrates a possible use case."
Emoji-based Fine-grained Attention Network for Sentiment Analysis in the Microblog Comments,"Microblogs have become a social platform for people to express their emotions in real-time, and it is a trend to analyze user emotional tendencies from the information on Microblogs. The dynamic features of emojis can affect the sentiment polarity of microblog texts. Since existing models seldom consider the diversity of emoji sentiment polarity,the paper propose a microblog sentiment classification model based on ALBERT-FAET. We obtain text embedding via ALBERT pretraining model and learn the inter-emoji embedding with an attention-based LSTM network. In addition, a fine-grained attention mechanism is proposed to capture the word-level interactions between plain text and emoji. Finally, we concatenate these features and feed them into a CNN classifier to predict the sentiment labels of the microblogs. To verify the effectiveness of the model and the fine-grained attention network, we conduct comparison experiments and ablation experiments. The comparison experiments show that the model outperforms previous methods in three evaluation indicators (accuracy, precision, and recall) and the model can significantly improve sentiment classification. The ablation experiments show that compared with ALBERT-AET, the proposed model ALBERT-FAET is better in the metrics, indicating that the fine-grained attention network can understand the diversified information of emoticons."
SEnti-Analyzer: Joint Sentiment Analysis For Text-Based and Verbal Communication in Software Projects,"Social aspects in software development teams are of particular importance for a successful project closure. To analyze sentiments in software projects, there are several tools and approaches available. These tools analyze text-based communication based on the used words to predict whether they appear to be positive, negative, or neutral for the receiver of the message. In the research project ComContA, we investigate so-called sentiment analysis striving to analyze the content of text-based communication in development teams with regard to the statement's polarity. That is, we analyze whether the communication appears to be adequate (i.e., positive or neutral) or negative. In a workshop paper, we presented a tool called SEnti-Analyzer that allows to apply sentiment analysis to verbal communication in meetings of software projects. In this technical report, we present the extended functionalities of the SEnti-Analyzer by also allowing the analysis of text-based communication, we improve the prediction of the tool by including established sentiment analysis tools, and we evaluate the tool with respect to its accuracy. We evaluate the tool by comparing the prediction of the SEnti-Analyzer to pre-labeled established data sets used for sentiment analysis in software engineering and to perceptions of computer scientists. Our results indicate that in almost all cases at least two of the three votes coincide, but in only about half of the cases all three votes coincide. Our results raise the question of the ""ultimate truth"" of sentiment analysis outcomes: What do we want to predict with sentiment analysis tools? The pre-defined labels of established data sets? The perception of computer scientists? Or the perception of single computer scientists which appears to be the most meaningful objective?"
Multi-scale Cooperative Multimodal Transformers for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis in Videos,"Multimodal sentiment analysis in videos is a key task in many real-world applications, which usually requires integrating multimodal streams including visual, verbal and acoustic behaviors. To improve the robustness of multimodal fusion, some of the existing methods let different modalities communicate with each other and modal the crossmodal interaction via transformers. However, these methods only use the single-scale representations during the interaction but forget to exploit multi-scale representations that contain different levels of semantic information. As a result, the representations learned by transformers could be biased especially for unaligned multimodal data. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale cooperative multimodal transformer (MCMulT) architecture for multimodal sentiment analysis. On the whole, the ""multi-scale"" mechanism is capable of exploiting the different levels of semantic information of each modality which are used for fine-grained crossmodal interactions. Meanwhile, each modality learns its feature hierarchies via integrating the crossmodal interactions from multiple level features of its source modality. In this way, each pair of modalities progressively builds feature hierarchies respectively in a cooperative manner. The empirical results illustrate that our MCMulT model not only outperforms existing approaches on unaligned multimodal sequences but also has strong performance on aligned multimodal sequences."
OSN Dashboard Tool For Sentiment Analysis,"The amount of opinionated data on the internet is rapidly increasing. More and more people are sharing their ideas and opinions in reviews, discussion forums, microblogs and general social media. As opinions are central in all human activities, sentiment analysis has been applied to gain insights in this type of data. There are proposed several approaches for sentiment classification. The major drawback is the lack of standardized solutions for classification and high-level visualization. In this study, a sentiment analyzer dashboard for online social networking analysis is proposed. This, to enable people gaining insights in topics interesting to them. The tool allows users to run the desired sentiment analysis algorithm in the dashboard. In addition to providing several visualization types, the dashboard facilitates raw data results from the sentiment classification which can be downloaded for further analysis."
Sentiment analysis on electricity twitter posts,"In today's world, everyone is expressive in some way, and the focus of this project is on people's opinions about rising electricity prices in United Kingdom and India using data from Twitter, a micro-blogging platform on which people post messages, known as tweets. Because many people's incomes are not good and they have to pay so many taxes and bills, maintaining a home has become a disputed issue these days. Despite the fact that Government offered subsidy schemes to compensate people electricity bills but it is not welcomed by people. In this project, the aim is to perform sentiment analysis on people's expressions and opinions expressed on Twitter. In order to grasp the electricity prices opinion, it is necessary to carry out sentiment analysis for the government and consumers in energy market. Furthermore, text present on these medias are unstructured in nature, so to process them we firstly need to pre-process the data. There are so many feature extraction techniques such as Bag of Words, TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), word embedding, NLP based features like word count. In this project, we analysed the impact of feature TF-IDF word level on electricity bills dataset of sentiment analysis. We found that by using TF-IDF word level performance of sentiment analysis is 3-4 higher than using N-gram features. Analysis is done using four classification algorithms including Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression and considering F-Score, Accuracy, Precision, and Recall performance parameters."
Discriminative Models Can Still Outperform Generative Models in Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis,"Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) helps to explain customers' opinions towards products and services. In the past, ABSA models were discriminative, but more recently generative models have been used to generate aspects and polarities directly from text. In contrast, discriminative models commonly first select aspects from the text, and then classify the aspect's polarity. Previous results showed that generative models outperform discriminative models on several English ABSA datasets. Here, we evaluate and contrast two state-of-the-art discriminative and generative models in several settings: cross-lingual, cross-domain, and cross-lingual and domain, to understand generalizability in settings other than English mono-lingual in-domain. Our more thorough evaluation shows that, contrary to previous studies, discriminative models can still outperform generative models in almost all settings."
A sentiment analysis model for car review texts based on adversarial training and whole word mask BERT,"In the field of car evaluation, more and more netizens choose to express their opinions on the Internet platform, and these comments will affect the decision-making of buyers and the trend of car word-of-mouth. As an important branch of natural language processing (NLP), sentiment analysis provides an effective research method for analyzing the sentiment types of massive car review texts. However, due to the lexical professionalism and large text noise of review texts in the automotive field, when a general sentiment analysis model is applied to car reviews, the accuracy of the model will be poor. To overcome these above challenges, we aim at the sentiment analysis task of car review texts. From the perspective of word vectors, pre-training is carried out by means of whole word mask of proprietary vocabulary in the automotive field, and then training data is carried out through the strategy of an adversarial training set. Based on this, we propose a car review text sentiment analysis model based on adversarial training and whole word mask BERT(ATWWM-BERT)."
Sentiment Analysis of Online Travel Reviews Based on Capsule Network and Sentiment Lexicon,"With the development of online travel services, it has great application prospects to timely mine users' evaluation emotions for travel services and use them as indicators to guide the improvement of online travel service quality. In this paper, we study the text sentiment classification of online travel reviews based on social media online comments and propose the SCCL model based on capsule network and sentiment lexicon. SCCL model aims at the lack of consideration of local features and emotional semantic features of the text in the language model that can efficiently extract text context features like BERT and GRU. Then make the following improvements to their shortcomings. On the one hand, based on BERT-BiGRU, the capsule network is introduced to extract local features while retaining good context features. On the other hand, the sentiment lexicon is introduced to extract the emotional sequence of the text to provide richer emotional semantic features for the model. To enhance the universality of the sentiment lexicon, the improved SO-PMI algorithm based on TF-IDF is used to expand the lexicon, so that the lexicon can also perform well in the field of online travel reviews."
Uzbek Sentiment Analysis based on local Restaurant Reviews,"Extracting useful information for sentiment analysis and classification problems from a big amount of user-generated feedback, such as restaurant reviews, is a crucial task of natural language processing, which is not only for customer satisfaction where it can give personalized services, but can also influence the further development of a company. In this paper, we present a work done on collecting restaurant reviews data as a sentiment analysis dataset for the Uzbek language, a member of the Turkic family which is heavily affected by the low-resource constraint, and provide some further analysis of the novel dataset by evaluation using different techniques, from logistic regression based models, to support vector machines, and even deep learning models, such as recurrent neural networks, as well as convolutional neural networks. The paper includes detailed information on how the data was collected, how it was pre-processed for better quality optimization, as well as experimental setups for the evaluation process. The overall evaluation results indicate that by performing pre-processing steps, such as stemming for agglutinative languages, the system yields better results, eventually achieving 91% accuracy result in the best performing model"
A Knowledge-Enhanced Adversarial Model for Cross-lingual Structured Sentiment Analysis,"Structured sentiment analysis, which aims to extract the complex semantic structures such as holders, expressions, targets, and polarities, has obtained widespread attention from both industry and academia. Unfortunately, the existing structured sentiment analysis datasets refer to a few languages and are relatively small, limiting neural network models' performance. In this paper, we focus on the cross-lingual structured sentiment analysis task, which aims to transfer the knowledge from the source language to the target one. Notably, we propose a Knowledge-Enhanced Adversarial Model (\texttt{KEAM}) with both implicit distributed and explicit structural knowledge to enhance the cross-lingual transfer. First, we design an adversarial embedding adapter for learning an informative and robust representation by capturing implicit semantic information from diverse multi-lingual embeddings adaptively. Then, we propose a syntax GCN encoder to transfer the explicit semantic information (e.g., universal dependency tree) among multiple languages. We conduct experiments on five datasets and compare \texttt{KEAM} with both the supervised and unsupervised methods. The extensive experimental results show that our \texttt{KEAM} model outperforms all the unsupervised baselines in various metrics."
Enhancing Event-Level Sentiment Analysis with Structured Arguments,"Previous studies about event-level sentiment analysis (SA) usually model the event as a topic, a category or target terms, while the structured arguments (e.g., subject, object, time and location) that have potential effects on the sentiment are not well studied. In this paper, we redefine the task as structured event-level SA and propose an End-to-End Event-level Sentiment Analysis (\textit{E}^{3}\textit{SA}) approach to solve this issue. Specifically, we explicitly extract and model the event structure information for enhancing event-level SA. Extensive experiments demonstrate the great advantages of our proposed approach over the state-of-the-art methods. Noting the lack of the dataset, we also release a large-scale real-world dataset with event arguments and sentiment labelling for promoting more researches\footnote{The dataset is available at https://github.com/zhangqi-here/E3SA}."
Analyzing Modality Robustness in Multimodal Sentiment Analysis,"Building robust multimodal models are crucial for achieving reliable deployment in the wild. Despite its importance, less attention has been paid to identifying and improving the robustness of Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) models. In this work, we hope to address that by (i) Proposing simple diagnostic checks for modality robustness in a trained multimodal model. Using these checks, we find MSA models to be highly sensitive to a single modality, which creates issues in their robustness; (ii) We analyze well-known robust training strategies to alleviate the issues. Critically, we observe that robustness can be achieved without compromising on the original performance. We hope our extensive study-performed across five models and two benchmark datasets-and proposed procedures would make robustness an integral component in MSA research. Our diagnostic checks and robust training solutions are simple to implement and available at https://github. com/declare-lab/MSA-Robustness."
Grammar Detection for Sentiment Analysis through Improved Viterbi Algorithm,"Grammar Detection, also referred to as Parts of Speech Tagging of raw text, is considered an underlying building block of the various Natural Language Processing pipelines like named entity recognition, question answering, and sentiment analysis. In short, forgiven a sentence, Parts of Speech tagging is the task of specifying and tagging each word of a sentence with nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and more. Sentiment Analysis may well be a procedure accustomed to determining if a given sentence's emotional tone is neutral, positive or negative. To assign polarity scores to the thesis or entities within phrase, in-text analysis and analytics, machine learning and natural language processing, approaches are incorporated. This Sentiment Analysis using POS tagger helps us urge a summary of the broader public over a specific topic. For this, we are using the Viterbi algorithm, Hidden Markov Model, Constraint based Viterbi algorithm for POS tagging. By comparing the accuracies, we select the foremost accurate result of the model for Sentiment Analysis for determining the character of the sentence."
Multilevel sentiment analysis in arabic,"In this study, we aimed to improve the performance results of Arabic sentiment analysis. This can be achieved by investigating the most successful machine learning method and the most useful feature vector to classify sentiments in both term and document levels into two (positive or negative) categories. Moreover, specification of one polarity degree for the term that has more than one is investigated. Also to handle the negations and intensifications, some rules are developed. According to the obtained results, Artificial Neural Network classifier is nominated as the best classifier in both term and document level sentiment analysis (SA) for Arabic Language. Furthermore, the average F-score achieved in the term level SA for both positive and negative testing classes is 0.92. In the document level SA, the average F-score for positive testing classes is 0.94, while for negative classes is 0.93."
YouTube Ad View Sentiment Analysis using Deep Learning and Machine Learning,"Sentiment Analysis is currently a vital area of research. With the advancement in the use of the internet, the creation of social media, websites, blogs, opinions, ratings, etc. has increased rapidly. People express their feedback and emotions on social media posts in the form of likes, dislikes, comments, etc. The rapid growth in the volume of viewer-generated or user-generated data or content on YouTube has led to an increase in YouTube sentiment analysis. Due to this, analyzing the public reactions has become an essential need for information extraction and data visualization in the technical domain. This research predicts YouTube Ad view sentiments using Deep Learning and Machine Learning algorithms like Linear Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Finally, a comparative analysis is done based on experimental results acquired from different models."
Adaptive Prompt Learning-based Few-Shot Sentiment Analysis,"In the field of natural language processing, sentiment analysis via deep learning has a excellent performance by using large labeled datasets. Meanwhile, labeled data are insufficient in many sentiment analysis, and obtaining these data is time-consuming and laborious. Prompt learning devotes to resolving the data deficiency by reformulating downstream tasks with the help of prompt. In this way, the appropriate prompt is very important for the performance of the model. This paper proposes an adaptive prompting(AP) construction strategy using seq2seq-attention structure to acquire the semantic information of the input sequence. Then dynamically construct adaptive prompt which can not only improve the quality of the prompt, but also can effectively generalize to other fields by pre-trained prompt which is constructed by existing public labeled data. The experimental results on FewCLUE datasets demonstrate that the proposed method AP can effectively construct appropriate adaptive prompt regardless of the quality of hand-crafted prompt and outperform the state-of-the-art baselines."
Sentiment Analysis of Covid-related Reddits,This paper focuses on Sentiment Analysis of Covid-19 related messages from the r/Canada and r/Unitedkingdom subreddits of Reddit. We apply manual annotation and three Machine Learning algorithms to analyze sentiments conveyed in those messages. We use VADER and TextBlob to label messages for Machine Learning experiments. Our results show that removal of shortest and longest messages improves VADER and TextBlob agreement on positive sentiments and F-score of sentiment classification by all the three algorithms
A Dataset and BERT-based Models for Targeted Sentiment Analysis on Turkish Texts,"Targeted Sentiment Analysis aims to extract sentiment towards a particular target from a given text. It is a field that is attracting attention due to the increasing accessibility of the Internet, which leads people to generate an enormous amount of data. Sentiment analysis, which in general requires annotated data for training, is a well-researched area for widely studied languages such as English. For low-resource languages such as Turkish, there is a lack of such annotated data. We present an annotated Turkish dataset suitable for targeted sentiment analysis. We also propose BERT-based models with different architectures to accomplish the task of targeted sentiment analysis. The results demonstrate that the proposed models outperform the traditional sentiment analysis models for the targeted sentiment analysis task."
Multi-Domain Targeted Sentiment Analysis,"Targeted Sentiment Analysis (TSA) is a central task for generating insights from consumer reviews. Such content is extremely diverse, with sites like Amazon or Yelp containing reviews on products and businesses from many different domains. A real-world TSA system should gracefully handle that diversity. This can be achieved by a multi-domain model -- one that is robust to the domain of the analyzed texts, and performs well on various domains. To address this scenario, we present a multi-domain TSA system based on augmenting a given training set with diverse weak labels from assorted domains. These are obtained through self-training on the Yelp reviews corpus. Extensive experiments with our approach on three evaluation datasets across different domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution. We further analyze how restrictions imposed on the available labeled data affect the performance, and compare the proposed method to the costly alternative of manually gathering diverse TSA labeled data. Our results and analysis show that our approach is a promising step towards a practical domain-robust TSA system."
ETMS@IITKGP at SemEval-2022 Task 10: Structured Sentiment Analysis Using A Generative Approach,"Structured Sentiment Analysis (SSA) deals with extracting opinion tuples in a text, where each tuple (h, e, t, p) consists of h, the holder, who expresses a sentiment polarity p towards a target t through a sentiment expression e. While prior works explore graph-based or sequence labeling-based approaches for the task, we in this paper present a novel unified generative method to solve SSA, a SemEval2022 shared task. We leverage a BART-based encoder-decoder architecture and suitably modify it to generate, given a sentence, a sequence of opinion tuples. Each generated tuple consists of seven integers respectively representing the indices corresponding to the start and end positions of the holder, target, and expression spans, followed by the sentiment polarity class associated between the target and the sentiment expression. We perform rigorous experiments for both Monolingual and Cross-lingual subtasks, and achieve competitive Sentiment F1 scores on the leaderboard in both settings."
Tag-assisted Multimodal Sentiment Analysis under Uncertain Missing Modalities,"Multimodal sentiment analysis has been studied under the assumption that all modalities are available. However, such a strong assumption does not always hold in practice, and most of multimodal fusion models may fail when partial modalities are missing. Several works have addressed the missing modality problem; but most of them only considered the single modality missing case, and ignored the practically more general cases of multiple modalities missing. To this end, in this paper, we propose a Tag-Assisted Transformer Encoder (TATE) network to handle the problem of missing uncertain modalities. Specifically, we design a tag encoding module to cover both the single modality and multiple modalities missing cases, so as to guide the network's attention to those missing modalities. Besides, we adopt a new space projection pattern to align common vectors. Then, a Transformer encoder-decoder network is utilized to learn the missing modality features. At last, the outputs of the Transformer encoder are used for the final sentiment classification. Extensive experiments are conducted on CMU-MOSI and IEMOCAP datasets, showing that our method can achieve significant improvements compared with several baselines."
LyS_ACoruña at SemEval-2022 Task 10: Repurposing Off-the-Shelf Tools for Sentiment Analysis as Semantic Dependency Parsing,"This paper addressed the problem of structured sentiment analysis using a bi-affine semantic dependency parser, large pre-trained language models, and publicly available translation models. For the monolingual setup, we considered: (i) training on a single treebank, and (ii) relaxing the setup by training on treebanks coming from different languages that can be adequately processed by cross-lingual language models. For the zero-shot setup and a given target treebank, we relied on: (i) a word-level translation of available treebanks in other languages to get noisy, unlikely-grammatical, but annotated data (we release as much of it as licenses allow), and (ii) merging those translated treebanks to obtain training data. In the post-evaluation phase, we also trained cross-lingual models that simply merged all the English treebanks and did not use word-level translations, and yet obtained better results. According to the official results, we ranked 8th and 9th in the monolingual and cross-lingual setups."
Learn from Structural Scope: Improving Aspect-Level Sentiment Analysis with Hybrid Graph Convolutional Networks,"Aspect-level sentiment analysis aims to determine the sentiment polarity towards a specific target in a sentence. The main challenge of this task is to effectively model the relation between targets and sentiments so as to filter out noisy opinion words from irrelevant targets. Most recent efforts capture relations through target-sentiment pairs or opinion spans from a word-level or phrase-level perspective. Based on the observation that targets and sentiments essentially establish relations following the grammatical hierarchy of phrase-clause-sentence structure, it is hopeful to exploit comprehensive syntactic information for better guiding the learning process. Therefore, we introduce the concept of Scope, which outlines a structural text region related to a specific target. To jointly learn structural Scope and predict the sentiment polarity, we propose a hybrid graph convolutional network (HGCN) to synthesize information from constituency tree and dependency tree, exploring the potential of linking two syntax parsing methods to enrich the representation. Experimental results on four public datasets illustrate that our HGCN model outperforms current state-of-the-art baselines."
Sentiment Analysis of Cybersecurity Content on Twitter and Reddit,"Sentiment Analysis provides an opportunity to understand the subject(s), especially in the digital age, due to an abundance of public data and effective algorithms. Cybersecurity is a subject where opinions are plentiful and differing in the public domain. This descriptive research analyzed cybersecurity content on Twitter and Reddit to measure its sentiment, positive or negative, or neutral. The data from Twitter and Reddit was amassed via technology-specific APIs during a selected timeframe to create datasets, which were then analyzed individually for their sentiment by VADER, an NLP (Natural Language Processing) algorithm. A random sample of cybersecurity content (ten tweets and posts) was also classified for sentiments by twenty human annotators to evaluate the performance of VADER. Cybersecurity content on Twitter was at least 48% positive, and Reddit was at least 26.5% positive. The positive or neutral content far outweighed negative sentiments across both platforms. When compared to human classification, which was considered the standard or source of truth, VADER produced 60% accuracy for Twitter and 70% for Reddit in assessing the sentiment; in other words, some agreement between algorithm and human classifiers. Overall, the goal was to explore an uninhibited research topic about cybersecurity sentiment"
Social Media Sentiment Analysis for Cryptocurrency Market Prediction,"In this paper, we explore the usability of different natural language processing models for the sentiment analysis of social media applied to financial market prediction, using the cryptocurrency domain as a reference. We study how the different sentiment metrics are correlated with the price movements of Bitcoin. For this purpose, we explore different methods to calculate the sentiment metrics from a text finding most of them not very accurate for this prediction task. We find that one of the models outperforms more than 20 other public ones and makes it possible to fine-tune it efficiently given its interpretable nature. Thus we confirm that interpretable artificial intelligence and natural language processing methods might be more valuable practically than non-explainable and non-interpretable ones. In the end, we analyse potential causal connections between the different sentiment metrics and the price movements."
Vision-Language Pre-Training for Multimodal Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis,"As an important task in sentiment analysis, Multimodal Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (MABSA) has attracted increasing attention in recent years. However, previous approaches either (i) use separately pre-trained visual and textual models, which ignore the crossmodal alignment or (ii) use vision-language models pre-trained with general pre-training tasks, which are inadequate to identify finegrained aspects, opinions, and their alignments across modalities. To tackle these limitations, we propose a task-specific Vision-Language Pre-training framework for MABSA (VLPMABSA), which is a unified multimodal encoder-decoder architecture for all the pretraining and downstream tasks. We further design three types of task-specific pre-training tasks from the language, vision, and multimodal modalities, respectively. Experimental results show that our approach generally outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on three MABSA subtasks. Further analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of each pretraining task. The source code is publicly released at https://github.com/NUSTM/VLP-MABSA."
A Contrastive Cross-Channel Data Augmentation Framework for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis,"Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a fine-grained sentiment analysis task, which focuses on detecting the sentiment polarity towards the aspect in a sentence. However, it is always sensitive to the multi-aspect challenge, where features of multiple aspects in a sentence will affect each other. To mitigate this issue, we design a novel training framework, called Contrastive Cross-Channel Data Augmentation (C3 DA), which leverages an in-domain generator to construct more multi-aspect samples and then boosts the robustness of ABSA models via contrastive learning on these generated data. In practice, given a generative pretrained language model and some limited ABSA labeled data, we first employ some parameter-efficient approaches to perform the in-domain fine-tuning. Then, the obtained in-domain generator is used to generate the synthetic sentences from two channels, i.e., Aspect Augmentation Channel and Polarity Augmentation Channel, which generate the sentence condition on a given aspect and polarity respectively. Specifically, our C3 DA performs the sentence generation in a cross-channel manner to obtain more sentences, and proposes an Entropy-Minimization Filter to filter low-quality generated samples. Extensive experiments show that our C3 DA can outperform those baselines without any augmentations by about 1% on accuracy and Macro- F1. Code and data are released in https://github.com/wangbing1416/C3DA."
Challenges for Open-domain Targeted Sentiment Analysis,"Since previous studies on open-domain targeted sentiment analysis are limited in dataset domain variety and sentence level, we propose a novel dataset consisting of 6,013 human-labeled data to extend the data domains in topics of interest and document level. Furthermore, we offer a nested target annotation schema to extract the complete sentiment information in documents, boosting the practicality and effectiveness of open-domain targeted sentiment analysis. Moreover, we leverage the pre-trained model BART in a sequence-to-sequence generation method for the task. Benchmark results show that there exists large room for improvement of open-domain targeted sentiment analysis. Meanwhile, experiments have shown that challenges remain in the effective use of open-domain data, long documents, the complexity of target structure, and domain variances."
Sentiment Analysis of Political Tweets for Israel using Machine Learning,"Sentiment Analysis is a vital research topic in the field of Computer Science. With the accelerated development of Information Technology and social networks, a massive amount of data related to comment texts has been generated on web applications or social media platforms like Twitter. Due to this, people have actively started proliferating general information and the information related to political opinions, which becomes an important reason for analyzing public reactions. Most researchers have used social media specifics or contents to analyze and predict public opinion concerning political events. This research proposes an analytical study using Israeli political Twitter data to interpret public opinion towards the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. The attitudes of ethnic groups and opinion leaders in the form of tweets are analyzed using Machine Learning algorithms like Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Decision Tree (DT), and Naive Bayes (NB). Finally, a comparative analysis is done based on experimental results from different models."
Scratch as Social Network: Topic Modeling and Sentiment Analysis in Scratch Projects,"Societal matters like the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement influence software engineering, as the recent debate on replacing certain discriminatory terms such as whitelist/blacklist has shown. Identifying relevant and trending societal matters is important, and often done using social network analysis for traditional social media channels such as twitter. In this paper we explore whether this type of analysis can also be used for introspection of the software world, by looking at the thriving scene of young Scratch programmers. The educational programming language Scratch is not only used for teaching programming concepts, but offers a platform for young programmers to express and share their creativity on any topics of relevance. By analyzing titles and project comments in a dataset of 106.032 Scratch projects, we explore which topics are common in the Scratch community, whether socially relevant events are reflected and how how the sentiment in the comments is. It turns out that the diversity of topics within the Scratch projects make the analysis process challenging. Our results nevertheless show that topics from pop and net culture in particular are present, and even recent societal events such as the Covid-19 pandemic or BLM are to some extent reflected in Scratch. The tone in the comments is mostly positive with catchy youth language. Hence, despite the challenges, Scratch projects can be studied in the same way as social networks, which opens up new possibilities to improve our understanding of the behavior and motivation of novice programmers."
Stock Price Prediction using Sentiment Analysis and Deep Learning for Indian Markets,"Stock market prediction has been an active area of research for a considerable period. Arrival of computing, followed by Machine Learning has upgraded the speed of research as well as opened new avenues. As part of this research study, we aimed to predict the future stock movement of shares using the historical prices aided with availability of sentiment data. Two models were used as part of the exercise, LSTM was the first model with historical prices as the independent variable. Sentiment Analysis captured using Intensity Analyzer was used as the major parameter for Random Forest Model used for the second part, some macro parameters like Gold, Oil prices, USD exchange rate and Indian Govt. Securities yields were also added to the model for improved accuracy of the model. As the end product, prices of 4 stocks viz. Reliance, HDFC Bank, TCS and SBI were predicted using the aforementioned two models. The results were evaluated using RMSE metric."
Forecasting Cryptocurrency Returns from Sentiment Signals: An Analysis of BERT Classifiers and Weak Supervision,"Anticipating price developments in financial markets is a topic of continued interest in forecasting. Funneled by advancements in deep learning and natural language processing (NLP) together with the availability of vast amounts of textual data in form of news articles, social media postings, etc., an increasing number of studies incorporate text-based predictors in forecasting models. We contribute to this literature by introducing weak learning, a recently proposed NLP approach to address the problem that text data is unlabeled. Without a dependent variable, it is not possible to finetune pretrained NLP models on a custom corpus. We confirm that finetuning using weak labels enhances the predictive value of text-based features and raises forecast accuracy in the context of predicting cryptocurrency returns. More fundamentally, the modeling paradigm we present, weak labeling domain-specific text and finetuning pretrained NLP models, is universally applicable in (financial) forecasting and unlocks new ways to leverage text data."
A Generative Language Model for Few-shot Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis,"Sentiment analysis is an important task in natural language processing. In recent works, pre-trained language models are often used to achieve state-of-the-art results, especially when training data is scarce. It is common to fine-tune on the downstream task, usually by adding task-specific layers on top of the model. In this paper, we focus on aspect-based sentiment analysis, which involves extracting aspect term, category, and predicting their corresponding polarities. In particular, we are interested in few-shot settings. We propose to reformulate the extraction and prediction tasks into the sequence generation task, using a generative language model with unidirectional attention (GPT2 is used unless stated otherwise). This way, the model learns to accomplish the tasks via language generation without the need of training task-specific layers. Our evaluation results on the single-task polarity prediction show that our approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art (based on BERT) on average performance by a large margins in few-shot and full-shot settings. More importantly, our generative approach significantly reduces the model variance caused by low-resource data. We further demonstrate that the proposed generative language model can handle joint and multi-task settings, unlike previous work. We observe that the proposed sequence generation method achieves further improved performances on polarity prediction when the model is trained via joint and multi-task settings. Further evaluation on similar sentiment analysis datasets, SST-2, SST- and OOS intent detection validates the superiority and noise robustness of generative language model in few-shot settings."
Survey of Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis Datasets,"Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a natural language processing problem that requires analyzing user-generated reviews to determine: a) The target entity being reviewed, b) The high-level aspect to which it belongs, and c) The sentiment expressed toward the targets and the aspects. Numerous yet scattered corpora for ABSA make it difficult for researchers to identify corpora best suited for a specific ABSA subtask quickly. This study aims to present a database of corpora that can be used to train and assess autonomous ABSA systems. Additionally, we provide an overview of the major corpora for ABSA and its subtasks and highlight several features that researchers should consider when selecting a corpus. Finally, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of current collection approaches and make recommendations for future corpora creation. This survey examines 65 publicly available ABSA datasets covering over 25 domains, including 45 English and 20 other languages datasets."
"Mapping the Multilingual Margins: Intersectional Biases of Sentiment Analysis Systems in English, Spanish, and Arabic","As natural language processing systems become more widespread, it is necessary to address fairness issues in their implementation and deployment to ensure that their negative impacts on society are understood and minimized. However, there is limited work that studies fairness using a multilingual and intersectional framework or on downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce four multilingual Equity Evaluation Corpora, supplementary test sets designed to measure social biases, and a novel statistical framework for studying unisectional and intersectional social biases in natural language processing. We use these tools to measure gender, racial, ethnic, and intersectional social biases across five models trained on emotion regression tasks in English, Spanish, and Arabic. We find that many systems demonstrate statistically significant unisectional and intersectional social biases."
BiSyn-GAT+: Bi-Syntax Aware Graph Attention Network for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis,"Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a fine-grained sentiment analysis task that aims to align aspects and corresponding sentiments for aspect-specific sentiment polarity inference. It is challenging because a sentence may contain multiple aspects or complicated (e.g., conditional, coordinating, or adversative) relations. Recently, exploiting dependency syntax information with graph neural networks has been the most popular trend. Despite its success, methods that heavily rely on the dependency tree pose challenges in accurately modeling the alignment of the aspects and their words indicative of sentiment, since the dependency tree may provide noisy signals of unrelated associations (e.g., the ""conj"" relation between ""great"" and ""dreadful"" in Figure 2). In this paper, to alleviate this problem, we propose a Bi-Syntax aware Graph Attention Network (BiSyn-GAT+). Specifically, BiSyn-GAT+ fully exploits the syntax information (e.g., phrase segmentation and hierarchical structure) of the constituent tree of a sentence to model the sentiment-aware context of every single aspect (called intra-context) and the sentiment relations across aspects (called inter-context) for learning. Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that BiSyn-GAT+ outperforms the state-of-the-art methods consistently."
Product Market Demand Analysis Using NLP in Banglish Text with Sentiment Analysis and Named Entity Recognition,"Product market demand analysis plays a significant role for originating business strategies due to its noticeable impact on the competitive business field. Furthermore, there are roughly 228 million native Bengali speakers, the majority of whom use Banglish text to interact with one another on social media. Consumers are buying and evaluating items on social media with Banglish text as social media emerges as an online marketplace for entrepreneurs. People use social media to find preferred smartphone brands and models by sharing their positive and bad experiences with them. For this reason, our goal is to gather Banglish text data and use sentiment analysis and named entity identification to assess Bangladeshi market demand for smartphones in order to determine the most popular smartphones by gender. We scraped product related data from social media with instant data scrapers and crawled data from Wikipedia and other sites for product information with python web scrapers. Using Python's Pandas and Seaborn libraries, the raw data is filtered using NLP methods. To train our datasets for named entity recognition, we utilized Spacey's custom NER model, Amazon Comprehend Custom NER. A tensorflow sequential model was deployed with parameter tweaking for sentiment analysis. Meanwhile, we used the Google Cloud Translation API to estimate the gender of the reviewers using the BanglaLinga library. In this article, we use natural language processing (NLP) approaches and several machine learning models to identify the most in-demand items and services in the Bangladeshi market. Our model has an accuracy of 87.99% in Spacy Custom Named Entity recognition, 95.51% in Amazon Comprehend Custom NER, and 87.02% in the Sequential model for demand analysis. After Spacy's study, we were able to manage 80% of mistakes related to misspelled words using a mix of Levenshtein distance and ratio algorithms."
CL-XABSA: Contrastive Learning for Cross-lingual Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis,"As an extensive research in the field of natural language processing (NLP), aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is the task of predicting the sentiment expressed in a text relative to the corresponding aspect. Unfortunately, most languages lack sufficient annotation resources, thus more and more recent researchers focus on cross-lingual aspect-based sentiment analysis (XABSA). However, most recent researches only concentrate on cross-lingual data alignment instead of model alignment. To this end, we propose a novel framework, CL-XABSA: Contrastive Learning for Cross-lingual Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis. Based on contrastive learning, we close the distance between samples with the same label in different semantic spaces, thus achieving a convergence of semantic spaces of different languages. Specifically, we design two contrastive strategies, token level contrastive learning of token embeddings (TL-CTE) and sentiment level contrastive learning of token embeddings (SL-CTE), to regularize the semantic space of source and target language to be more uniform. Since our framework can receive datasets in multiple languages during training, our framework can be adapted not only for XABSA task but also for multilingual aspect-based sentiment analysis (MABSA). To further improve the performance of our model, we perform knowledge distillation technology leveraging data from unlabeled target language. In the distillation XABSA task, we further explore the comparative effectiveness of different data (source dataset, translated dataset, and code-switched dataset). The results demonstrate that the proposed method has a certain improvement in the three tasks of XABSA, distillation XABSA and MABSA. For reproducibility, our code for this paper is available at https://github.com/GKLMIP/CL-XABSA."
Incorporating Dynamic Semantics into Pre-Trained Language Model for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis,"Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) predicts sentiment polarity towards a specific aspect in the given sentence. While pre-trained language models such as BERT have achieved great success, incorporating dynamic semantic changes into ABSA remains challenging. To this end, in this paper, we propose to address this problem by Dynamic Re-weighting BERT (DR-BERT), a novel method designed to learn dynamic aspect-oriented semantics for ABSA. Specifically, we first take the Stack-BERT layers as a primary encoder to grasp the overall semantic of the sentence and then fine-tune it by incorporating a lightweight Dynamic Re-weighting Adapter (DRA). Note that the DRA can pay close attention to a small region of the sentences at each step and re-weigh the vitally important words for better aspect-aware sentiment understanding. Finally, experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and the rationality of our proposed model and provide good interpretable insights for future semantic modeling."
M-SENA: An Integrated Platform for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis,"M-SENA is an open-sourced platform for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis. It aims to facilitate advanced research by providing flexible toolkits, reliable benchmarks, and intuitive demonstrations. The platform features a fully modular video sentiment analysis framework consisting of data management, feature extraction, model training, and result analysis modules. In this paper, we first illustrate the overall architecture of the M-SENA platform and then introduce features of the core modules. Reliable baseline results of different modality features and MSA benchmarks are also reported. Moreover, we use model evaluation and analysis tools provided by M-SENA to present intermediate representation visualization, on-the-fly instance test, and generalization ability test results. The source code of the platform is publicly available at https://github.com/thuiar/M-SENA."
BERT-ASC: Implicit Aspect Representation Learning through Auxiliary-Sentence Construction for Sentiment Analysis,"Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) task aim at associating a piece of text with a set of aspects and meanwhile infer their respective sentimental polarities. The state-of-the-art approaches are built upon fine-tuning of various pre-trained language models. They commonly attempt to learn aspect-specific representation from the corpus. Unfortunately, the aspect is often expressed implicitly through a set of representatives and thus renders implicit mapping process unattainable unless sufficient labeled examples are available. However, high-quality labeled examples may not be readily available in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose to jointly address aspect categorization and aspect-based sentiment subtasks in a unified framework. Specifically, we first introduce a simple but effective mechanism to construct an auxiliary-sentence for the implicit aspect based on the semantic information in the corpus. Then, we encourage BERT to learn the aspect-specific representation in response to the automatically constructed auxiliary-sentence instead of the aspect itself. Finally, we empirically evaluate the performance of the proposed solution by a comparative study on real benchmark datasets for both ABSA and Targeted-ABSA tasks. Our extensive experiments show that it consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of aspect categorization and aspect-based sentiment across all datasets and the improvement margins are considerable. The code of BERT-ASC is available in GitHub: https://github.com/amurtadha/BERT-ASC."
Effective Token Graph Modeling using a Novel Labeling Strategy for Structured Sentiment Analysis,"The state-of-the-art model for structured sentiment analysis casts the task as a dependency parsing problem, which has some limitations: (1) The label proportions for span prediction and span relation prediction are imbalanced. (2) The span lengths of sentiment tuple components may be very large in this task, which will further exacerbate the imbalance problem. (3) Two nodes in a dependency graph cannot have multiple arcs, therefore some overlapped sentiment tuples cannot be recognized. In this work, we propose nichetargeting solutions for these issues. First, we introduce a novel labeling strategy, which contains two sets of token pair labels, namely essential label set and whole label set. The essential label set consists of the basic labels for this task, which are relatively balanced and applied in the prediction layer. The whole label set includes rich labels to help our model capture various token relations, which are applied in the hidden layer to softly influence our model. Moreover, we also propose an effective model to well collaborate with our labeling strategy, which is equipped with the graph attention networks to iteratively refine token representations, and the adaptive multi-label classifier to dynamically predict multiple relations between token pairs. We perform extensive experiments on 5 benchmark datasets in four languages. Experimental results show that our model outperforms previous SOTA models by a large margin."
HiSA-SMFM: Historical and Sentiment Analysis based Stock Market Forecasting Model,"One of the pillars to build a country's economy is the stock market. Over the years, people are investing in stock markets to earn as much profit as possible from the amount of money that they possess. Hence, it is vital to have a prediction model which can accurately predict future stock prices. With the help of machine learning, it is not an impossible task as the various machine learning techniques if modeled properly may be able to provide the best prediction values. This would enable the investors to decide whether to buy, sell or hold the share. The aim of this paper is to predict the future of the financial stocks of a company with improved accuracy. In this paper, we have proposed the use of historical as well as sentiment data to efficiently predict stock prices by applying LSTM. It has been found by analyzing the existing research in the area of sentiment analysis that there is a strong correlation between the movement of stock prices and the publication of news articles. Therefore, in this paper, we have integrated these factors to predict the stock prices more accurately."
Towards Unifying the Label Space for Aspect- and Sentence-based Sentiment Analysis,"The aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a fine-grained task that aims to determine the sentiment polarity towards targeted aspect terms occurring in the sentence. The development of the ABSA task is very much hindered by the lack of annotated data. To tackle this, the prior works have studied the possibility of utilizing the sentiment analysis (SA) datasets to assist in training the ABSA model, primarily via pretraining or multi-task learning. In this article, we follow this line, and for the first time, we manage to apply the Pseudo-Label (PL) method to merge the two homogeneous tasks. While it seems straightforward to use generated pseudo labels to handle this case of label granularity unification for two highly related tasks, we identify its major challenge in this paper and propose a novel framework, dubbed as Dual-granularity Pseudo Labeling (DPL). Further, similar to PL, we regard the DPL as a general framework capable of combining other prior methods in the literature. Through extensive experiments, DPL has achieved state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks surpassing the prior work significantly."
"A Survey on Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis: Tasks, Methods, and Challenges","As an important fine-grained sentiment analysis problem, aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), aiming to analyze and understand people's opinions at the aspect level, has been attracting considerable interest in the last decade. To handle ABSA in different scenarios, various tasks are introduced for analyzing different sentiment elements and their relations, including the aspect term, aspect category, opinion term, and sentiment polarity. Unlike early ABSA works focusing on a single sentiment element, many compound ABSA tasks involving multiple elements have been studied in recent years for capturing more complete aspect-level sentiment information. However, a systematic review of various ABSA tasks and their corresponding solutions is still lacking, which we aim to fill in this survey. More specifically, we provide a new taxonomy for ABSA which organizes existing studies from the axes of concerned sentiment elements, with an emphasis on recent advances of compound ABSA tasks. From the perspective of solutions, we summarize the utilization of pre-trained language models for ABSA, which improved the performance of ABSA to a new stage. Besides, techniques for building more practical ABSA systems in cross-domain/lingual scenarios are discussed. Finally, we review some emerging topics and discuss some open challenges to outlook potential future directions of ABSA."
Sentiment Word Aware Multimodal Refinement for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis with ASR Errors,"Multimodal sentiment analysis has attracted increasing attention and lots of models have been proposed. However, the performance of the state-of-the-art models decreases sharply when they are deployed in the real world. We find that the main reason is that real-world applications can only access the text outputs by the automatic speech recognition (ASR) models, which may be with errors because of the limitation of model capacity. Through further analysis of the ASR outputs, we find that in some cases the sentiment words, the key sentiment elements in the textual modality, are recognized as other words, which makes the sentiment of the text change and hurts the performance of multimodal sentiment models directly. To address this problem, we propose the sentiment word aware multimodal refinement model (SWRM), which can dynamically refine the erroneous sentiment words by leveraging multimodal sentiment clues. Specifically, we first use the sentiment word position detection module to obtain the most possible position of the sentiment word in the text and then utilize the multimodal sentiment word refinement module to dynamically refine the sentiment word embeddings. The refined embeddings are taken as the textual inputs of the multimodal feature fusion module to predict the sentiment labels. We conduct extensive experiments on the real-world datasets including MOSI-Speechbrain, MOSI-IBM, and MOSI-iFlytek and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, which surpasses the current state-of-the-art models on three datasets. Furthermore, our approach can be adapted for other multimodal feature fusion models easily. Data and code are available at https://github.com/albertwy/SWRM."
TraceNet: Tracing and Locating the Key Elements in Sentiment Analysis,"In this paper, we study sentiment analysis task where the outcomes are mainly contributed by a few key elements of the inputs. Motivated by the two-streams hypothesis, we propose a neural architecture, named TraceNet, to address this type of task. It not only learns discriminative representations for the target task via its encoders, but also traces key elements at the same time via its locators. In TraceNet, both encoders and locators are organized in a layer-wise manner, and a smoothness regularization is employed between adjacent encoder-locator combinations. Moreover, a sparsity constraints are enforced on locators for tracing purposes and items are proactively masked according to the item weights output by locators.A major advantage of TraceNet is that the outcomes are easier to understand, since the most responsible parts of inputs are identified. Also, under the guidance of locators, it is more robust to attacks due to its focus on key elements and the proactive masking training strategy. Experimental results show its effectiveness for sentiment classification. Moreover, we provide several case studies to demonstrate its robustness and interpretability."
KESA: A Knowledge Enhanced Approach For Sentiment Analysis,"Though some recent works focus on injecting sentiment knowledge into pre-trained language models, they usually design mask and reconstruction tasks in the post-training phase. In this paper, we aim to benefit from sentiment knowledge in a lighter way. To achieve this goal, we study sentence-level sentiment analysis and, correspondingly, propose two sentiment-aware auxiliary tasks named sentiment word cloze and conditional sentiment prediction. The first task learns to select the correct sentiment words within the input, given the overall sentiment polarity as prior knowledge. On the contrary, the second task predicts the overall sentiment polarity given the sentiment polarity of the word as prior knowledge. In addition, two kinds of label combination methods are investigated to unify multiple types of labels in each task. We argue that more information can promote the models to learn more profound semantic representation. We implement it in a straightforward way to verify this hypothesis. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms pre-trained models and is additive to existing knowledge-enhanced post-trained models. The code and data are released at https://github.com/lshowway/KESA."
Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis Using Spectral Temporal Graph Neural Network,"The objective of Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis is to capture the sentiment of reviewers associated with different aspects. However, complexity of the review sentences, presence of double negation and specific usage of words found in different domains make it difficult to predict the sentiment accurately and overall a challenging natural language understanding task. While recurrent neural network, attention mechanism and more recently, graph attention based models are prevalent, in this paper we propose graph Fourier transform based network with features created in the spectral domain. While this approach has found considerable success in the forecasting domain, it has not been explored earlier for any natural language processing task. The method relies on creating and learning an underlying graph from the raw data and thereby using the adjacency matrix to shift to the graph Fourier domain. Subsequently, Fourier transform is used to switch to the frequency (spectral) domain where new features are created. These series of transformation proved to be extremely efficient in learning the right representation as we have found that our model achieves the best result on both the SemEval-2014 datasets, i.e., ""Laptop"" and ""Restaurants"" domain. Our proposed model also found competitive results on the two other recently proposed datasets from the e-commerce domain."
Using Random Perturbations to Mitigate Adversarial Attacks on Sentiment Analysis Models,"Attacks on deep learning models are often difficult to identify and therefore are difficult to protect against. This problem is exacerbated by the use of public datasets that typically are not manually inspected before use. In this paper, we offer a solution to this vulnerability by using, during testing, random perturbations such as spelling correction if necessary, substitution by random synonym, or simply dropping the word. These perturbations are applied to random words in random sentences to defend NLP models against adversarial attacks. Our Random Perturbations Defense and Increased Randomness Defense methods are successful in returning attacked models to similar accuracy of models before attacks. The original accuracy of the model used in this work is 80% for sentiment classification. After undergoing attacks, the accuracy drops to accuracy between 0% and 44%. After applying our defense methods, the accuracy of the model is returned to the original accuracy within statistical significance."
Hindi/Bengali Sentiment Analysis Using Transfer Learning and Joint Dual Input Learning with Self Attention,"Sentiment Analysis typically refers to using natural language processing, text analysis and computational linguistics to extract affect and emotion based information from text data. Our work explores how we can effectively use deep neural networks in transfer learning and joint dual input learning settings to effectively classify sentiments and detect hate speech in Hindi and Bengali data. We start by training Word2Vec word embeddings for Hindi \textbf{HASOC dataset} and Bengali hate speech and then train LSTM and subsequently, employ parameter sharing based transfer learning to Bengali sentiment classifiers by reusing and fine-tuning the trained weights of Hindi classifiers with both classifier being used as baseline in our study. Finally, we use BiLSTM with self attention in joint dual input learning setting where we train a single neural network on Hindi and Bengali dataset simultaneously using their respective embeddings."
"Gender stereotypes in the mediated personalization of politics: Empirical evidence from a lexical, syntactic and sentiment analysis","The media attention to the personal sphere of famous and important individuals has become a key element of the gender narrative. Here we combine lexical, syntactic and sentiment analysis to investigate the role of gender in the personalization of a wide range of political office holders in Italy during the period 2017-2020. On the basis of a score for words that is introduced to account for gender unbalance in both representative and news coverage, we show that the political personalization in Italy is more detrimental for women than men, with the persistence of entrenched stereotypes including a masculine connotation of leadership, the resulting women's unsuitability to hold political functions, and a greater deal of focus on their attractiveness and body parts. In addition, women politicians are covered with a more negative tone than their men counterpart when personal details are reported. Further, the major contribution to the observed gender differences comes from online news rather than print news, suggesting that the expression of certain stereotypes may be better conveyed when click baiting and personal targeting have a major impact."
Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis through EDU-level Attentions,"A sentence may express sentiments on multiple aspects. When these aspects are associated with different sentiment polarities, a model's accuracy is often adversely affected. We observe that multiple aspects in such hard sentences are mostly expressed through multiple clauses, or formally known as elementary discourse units (EDUs), and one EDU tends to express a single aspect with unitary sentiment towards that aspect. In this paper, we propose to consider EDU boundaries in sentence modeling, with attentions at both word and EDU levels. Specifically, we highlight sentiment-bearing words in EDU through word-level sparse attention. Then at EDU level, we force the model to attend to the right EDU for the right aspect, by using EDU-level sparse attention and orthogonal regularization. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that our simple EDU-Attention model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Because EDU can be automatically segmented with high accuracy, our model can be applied to sentences directly without the need of manual EDU boundary annotation."
Zero-Shot Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis,"Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) typically requires in-domain annotated data for supervised training/fine-tuning. It is a big challenge to scale ABSA to a large number of new domains. This paper aims to train a unified model that can perform zero-shot ABSA without using any annotated data for a new domain. We propose a method called contrastive post-training on review Natural Language Inference (CORN). Later ABSA tasks can be cast into NLI for zero-shot transfer. We evaluate CORN on ABSA tasks, ranging from aspect extraction (AE), aspect sentiment classification (ASC), to end-to-end aspect-based sentiment analysis (E2E ABSA), which show ABSA can be conducted without any human annotated ABSA data."
Auto-ABSA: Automatic Detection of Aspects in Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis,"After transformer is proposed, lots of pre-trained language models have been come up with and sentiment analysis (SA) task has been improved. In this paper, we proposed a method that uses an auxiliary sentence about aspects that the sentence contains to help sentiment prediction. The first is aspect detection, which uses a multi-aspects detection model to predict all aspects that the sentence has. Combining the predicted aspects and the original sentence as Sentiment Analysis (SA) model's input. The second is to do out-of-domain aspect-based sentiment analysis(ABSA), train sentiment classification model with one kind of dataset and validate it with another kind of dataset. Finally, we created two baselines, they use no aspect and all aspects as sentiment classification model's input, respectively. Compare two baselines performance to our method, found that our method really makes sense."
Negativity Spreads Faster: A Large-Scale Multilingual Twitter Analysis on the Role of Sentiment in Political Communication,"Social media has become extremely influential when it comes to policy making in modern societies, especially in the western world, where platforms such as Twitter allow users to follow politicians, thus making citizens more involved in political discussion. In the same vein, politicians use Twitter to express their opinions, debate among others on current topics and promote their political agendas aiming to influence voter behaviour. In this paper, we attempt to analyse tweets of politicians from three European countries and explore the virality of their tweets. Previous studies have shown that tweets conveying negative sentiment are likely to be retweeted more frequently. By utilising state-of-the-art pre-trained language models, we performed sentiment analysis on hundreds of thousands of tweets collected from members of parliament in Greece, Spain and the United Kingdom, including devolved administrations. We achieved this by systematically exploring and analysing the differences between influential and less popular tweets. Our analysis indicates that politicians' negatively charged tweets spread more widely, especially in more recent times, and highlights interesting differences between political parties as well as between politicians and the general population."
A Simple Information-Based Approach to Unsupervised Domain-Adaptive Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis,"Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a fine-grained sentiment analysis task which aims to extract the aspects from sentences and identify their corresponding sentiments. Aspect term extraction (ATE) is the crucial step for ABSA. Due to the expensive annotation for aspect terms, we often lack labeled target domain data for fine-tuning. To address this problem, many approaches have been proposed recently to transfer common knowledge in an unsupervised way, but such methods have too many modules and require expensive multi-stage preprocessing. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective technique based on mutual information maximization, which can serve as an additional component to enhance any kind of model for cross-domain ABSA and ATE. Furthermore, we provide some analysis of this approach. Experiment results show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for cross-domain ABSA by 4.32% Micro-F1 on average over 10 different domain pairs. Apart from that, our method can be extended to other sequence labeling tasks, such as named entity recognition (NER)."
Predicting The Stock Trend Using News Sentiment Analysis and Technical Indicators in Spark,"Predicting the stock market trend has always been challenging since its movement is affected by many factors. Here, we approach the future trend prediction problem as a machine learning classification problem by creating tomorrow_trend feature as our label to be predicted. Different features are given to help the machine learning model predict the label of a given day; whether it is an uptrend or downtrend, those features are technical indicators generated from the stock's price history. In addition, as financial news plays a vital role in changing the investor's behavior, the overall sentiment score on a given day is created from all news released on that day and added to the model as another feature. Three different machine learning models are tested in Spark (big-data computing platform), Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Machine. Random Forest was the best performing model with a 63.58% test accuracy."
Multi-channel Attentive Graph Convolutional Network With Sentiment Fusion For Multimodal Sentiment Analysis,"Nowadays, with the explosive growth of multimodal reviews on social media platforms, multimodal sentiment analysis has recently gained popularity because of its high relevance to these social media posts. Although most previous studies design various fusion frameworks for learning an interactive representation of multiple modalities, they fail to incorporate sentimental knowledge into inter-modality learning. This paper proposes a Multi-channel Attentive Graph Convolutional Network (MAGCN), consisting of two main components: cross-modality interactive learning and sentimental feature fusion. For cross-modality interactive learning, we exploit the self-attention mechanism combined with densely connected graph convolutional networks to learn inter-modality dynamics. For sentimental feature fusion, we utilize multi-head self-attention to merge sentimental knowledge into inter-modality feature representations. Extensive experiments are conducted on three widely-used datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves competitive performance on accuracy and F1 scores compared to several state-of-the-art approaches."
Do Smart Glasses Dream of Sentimental Visions? Deep Emotionship Analysis for Eyewear Devices,"Emotion recognition in smart eyewear devices is highly valuable but challenging. One key limitation of previous works is that the expression-related information like facial or eye images is considered as the only emotional evidence. However, emotional status is not isolated; it is tightly associated with people's visual perceptions, especially those sentimental ones. However, little work has examined such associations to better illustrate the cause of different emotions. In this paper, we study the emotionship analysis problem in eyewear systems, an ambitious task that requires not only classifying the user's emotions but also semantically understanding the potential cause of such emotions. To this end, we devise EMOShip, a deep-learning-based eyewear system that can automatically detect the wearer's emotional status and simultaneously analyze its associations with semantic-level visual perceptions. Experimental studies with 20 participants demonstrate that, thanks to the emotionship awareness, EMOShip not only achieves superior emotion recognition accuracy over existing methods (80.2% vs. 69.4%), but also provides a valuable understanding of the cause of emotions. Pilot studies with 20 participants further motivate the potential use of EMOShip to empower emotion-aware applications, such as emotionship self-reflection and emotionship life-logging."
MMLatch: Bottom-up Top-down Fusion for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis,"Current deep learning approaches for multimodal fusion rely on bottom-up fusion of high and mid-level latent modality representations (late/mid fusion) or low level sensory inputs (early fusion). Models of human perception highlight the importance of top-down fusion, where high-level representations affect the way sensory inputs are perceived, i.e. cognition affects perception. These top-down interactions are not captured in current deep learning models. In this work we propose a neural architecture that captures top-down cross-modal interactions, using a feedback mechanism in the forward pass during network training. The proposed mechanism extracts high-level representations for each modality and uses these representations to mask the sensory inputs, allowing the model to perform top-down feature masking. We apply the proposed model for multimodal sentiment recognition on CMU-MOSEI. Our method shows consistent improvements over the well established MulT and over our strong late fusion baseline, achieving state-of-the-art results."
NaijaSenti: A Nigerian Twitter Sentiment Corpus for Multilingual Sentiment Analysis,"Sentiment analysis is one of the most widely studied applications in NLP, but most work focuses on languages with large amounts of data. We introduce the first large-scale human-annotated Twitter sentiment dataset for the four most widely spoken languages in Nigeria (Hausa, Igbo, Nigerian-Pidgin, and Yorùbá ) consisting of around 30,000 annotated tweets per language (and 14,000 for Nigerian-Pidgin), including a significant fraction of code-mixed tweets. We propose text collection, filtering, processing and labeling methods that enable us to create datasets for these low-resource languages. We evaluate a rangeof pre-trained models and transfer strategies on the dataset. We find that language-specific models and language-adaptivefine-tuning generally perform best. We release the datasets, trained models, sentiment lexicons, and code to incentivizeresearch on sentiment analysis in under-represented languages."
Sentiment Analysis: Predicting Yelp Scores,"In this work, we predict the sentiment of restaurant reviews based on a subset of the Yelp Open Dataset. We utilize the meta features and text available in the dataset and evaluate several machine learning and state-of-the-art deep learning approaches for the prediction task. Through several qualitative experiments, we show the success of the deep models with attention mechanism in learning a balanced model for reviews across different restaurants. Finally, we propose a novel Multi-tasked joint BERT model that improves the overall classification performance."
A Study on the Ambiguity in Human Annotation of German Oral History Interviews for Perceived Emotion Recognition and Sentiment Analysis,"For research in audiovisual interview archives often it is not only of interest what is said but also how. Sentiment analysis and emotion recognition can help capture, categorize and make these different facets searchable. In particular, for oral history archives, such indexing technologies can be of great interest. These technologies can help understand the role of emotions in historical remembering. However, humans often perceive sentiments and emotions ambiguously and subjectively. Moreover, oral history interviews have multi-layered levels of complex, sometimes contradictory, sometimes very subtle facets of emotions. Therefore, the question arises of the chance machines and humans have capturing and assigning these into predefined categories. This paper investigates the ambiguity in human perception of emotions and sentiment in German oral history interviews and the impact on machine learning systems. Our experiments reveal substantial differences in human perception for different emotions. Furthermore, we report from ongoing machine learning experiments with different modalities. We show that the human perceptual ambiguity and other challenges, such as class imbalance and lack of training data, currently limit the opportunities of these technologies for oral history archives. Nonetheless, our work uncovers promising observations and possibilities for further research."
Knowledge Graph Augmented Network Towards Multiview Representation Learning for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis,"Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a fine-grained task of sentiment analysis. To better comprehend long complicated sentences and obtain accurate aspect-specific information, linguistic and commonsense knowledge are generally required in this task. However, most current methods employ complicated and inefficient approaches to incorporate external knowledge, e.g., directly searching the graph nodes. Additionally, the complementarity between external knowledge and linguistic information has not been thoroughly studied. To this end, we propose a knowledge graph augmented network KGAN, which aims to effectively incorporate external knowledge with explicitly syntactic and contextual information. In particular, KGAN captures the sentiment feature representations from multiple different perspectives, i.e., context-, syntax- and knowledge-based. First, KGAN learns the contextual and syntactic representations in parallel to fully extract the semantic features. Then, KGAN integrates the knowledge graphs into the embedding space, based on which the aspect-specific knowledge representations are further obtained via an attention mechanism. Last, we propose a hierarchical fusion module to complement these multi-view representations in a local-to-global manner. Extensive experiments on five popular ABSA benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our KGAN. Notably, with the help of the pretrained model of RoBERTa, KGAN achieves a new record of state-of-the-art performance among all datasets."
Multimodal Representations Learning Based on Mutual Information Maximization and Minimization and Identity Embedding for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis,"Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) is a fundamental complex research problem due to the heterogeneity gap between different modalities and the ambiguity of human emotional expression. Although there have been many successful attempts to construct multimodal representations for MSA, there are still two challenges to be addressed: 1) A more robust multimodal representation needs to be constructed to bridge the heterogeneity gap and cope with the complex multimodal interactions, and 2) the contextual dynamics must be modeled effectively throughout the information flow. In this work, we propose a multimodal representation model based on Mutual information Maximization and Minimization and Identity Embedding (MMMIE). We combine mutual information maximization between modal pairs, and mutual information minimization between input data and corresponding features to mine the modal-invariant and task-related information. Furthermore, Identity Embedding is proposed to prompt the downstream network to perceive the contextual information. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model."
Sentiment Analysis with Deep Learning Models: A Comparative Study on a Decade of Sinhala Language Facebook Data,"The relationship between Facebook posts and the corresponding reaction feature is an interesting subject to explore and understand. To achieve this end, we test state-of-the-art Sinhala sentiment analysis models against a data set containing a decade worth of Sinhala posts with millions of reactions. For the purpose of establishing benchmarks and with the goal of identifying the best model for Sinhala sentiment analysis, we also test, on the same data set configuration, other deep learning models catered for sentiment analysis. In this study we report that the 3 layer Bidirectional LSTM model achieves an F1 score of 84.58% for Sinhala sentiment analysis, surpassing the current state-of-the-art model; Capsule B, which only manages to get an F1 score of 82.04%. Further, since all the deep learning models show F1 scores above 75% we conclude that it is safe to claim that Facebook reactions are suitable to predict the sentiment of a text."
Turkish Sentiment Analysis Using Machine Learning Methods: Application on Online Food Order Site Reviews,"Satisfaction measurement, which emerges in every sector today, is a very important factor for many companies. In this study, it is aimed to reach the highest accuracy rate with various machine learning algorithms by using the data on Yemek Sepeti and variations of this data. The accuracy values of each algorithm were calculated together with the various natural language processing methods used. While calculating these accuracy values, the parameters of the algorithms used were tried to be optimized. The models trained in this study on labeled data can be used on unlabeled data and can give companies an idea in measuring customer satisfaction. It was observed that 3 different natural language processing methods applied resulted in approximately 5% accuracy increase in most of the developed models."
BERT for Sentiment Analysis: Pre-trained and Fine-Tuned Alternatives,"BERT has revolutionized the NLP field by enabling transfer learning with large language models that can capture complex textual patterns, reaching the state-of-the-art for an expressive number of NLP applications. For text classification tasks, BERT has already been extensively explored. However, aspects like how to better cope with the different embeddings provided by the BERT output layer and the usage of language-specific instead of multilingual models are not well studied in the literature, especially for the Brazilian Portuguese language. The purpose of this article is to conduct an extensive experimental study regarding different strategies for aggregating the features produced in the BERT output layer, with a focus on the sentiment analysis task. The experiments include BERT models trained with Brazilian Portuguese corpora and the multilingual version, contemplating multiple aggregation strategies and open-source datasets with predefined training, validation, and test partitions to facilitate the reproducibility of the results. BERT achieved the highest ROC-AUC values for the majority of cases as compared to TF-IDF. Nonetheless, TF-IDF represents a good trade-off between the predictive performance and computational cost."
Semantic and sentiment analysis of selected Bhagavad Gita translations using BERT-based language framework,"It is well known that translations of songs and poems not only break rhythm and rhyming patterns, but can also result in loss of semantic information. The Bhagavad Gita is an ancient Hindu philosophical text originally written in Sanskrit that features a conversation between Lord Krishna and Arjuna prior to the Mahabharata war. The Bhagavad Gita is also one of the key sacred texts in Hinduism and is known as the forefront of the Vedic corpus of Hinduism. In the last two centuries, there has been a lot of interest in Hindu philosophy from western scholars; hence, the Bhagavad Gita has been translated in a number of languages. However, there is not much work that validates the quality of the English translations. Recent progress of language models powered by deep learning has enabled not only translations but a better understanding of language and texts with semantic and sentiment analysis. Our work is motivated by the recent progress of language models powered by deep learning methods. In this paper, we present a framework that compares selected translations (from Sanskrit to English) of the Bhagavad Gita using semantic and sentiment analyses. We use hand-labelled sentiment dataset for tuning state-of-art deep learning-based language model known as bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT). We provide sentiment and semantic analysis for selected chapters and verses across translations. Our results show that although the style and vocabulary in the respective translations vary widely, the sentiment analysis and semantic similarity shows that the message conveyed are mostly similar."
Sentiment Analysis and Sarcasm Detection of Indian General Election Tweets,"Social Media usage has increased to an all-time high level in today's digital world. The majority of the population uses social media tools (like Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, etc.) to share their thoughts and experiences with the community. Analysing the sentiments and opinions of the common public is very important for both the government and the business people. This is the reason behind the activeness of many media agencies during the election time for performing various kinds of opinion polls. In this paper, we have worked towards analysing the sentiments of the people of India during the Lok Sabha election of 2019 using the Twitter data of that duration. We have built an automatic tweet analyser using the Transfer Learning technique to handle the unsupervised nature of this problem. We have used the Linear Support Vector Classifiers method in our Machine Learning model, also, the Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) methodology for handling the textual data of tweets. Further, we have increased the capability of the model to address the sarcastic tweets posted by some of the users, which has not been yet considered by the researchers in this domain."
ConTrip: Consensus Sentiment review Analysis and Platform ratings in a single score,"People unequivocally employ reviews to decide on purchasing an item or an experience on the internet. In that regard, the growing significance and number of opinions have led to the development of methods to assess their sentiment content automatically. However, it is not straightforward for the models to create a consensus value that embodies the agreement of the different reviews and differentiates across equal ratings for an item. Based on the approach proposed by Nguyen et al. in 2020, we derive a novel consensus value named ConTrip that merges their consensus score and the overall rating of a platform for an item. ConTrip lies in the rating range values, which makes it more interpretable while maintaining the ability to differentiate across equally rated experiences. ConTrip is implemented and freely available under MIT license at https://github.com/pepebonet/contripscore"
"Fortunately, Discourse Markers Can Enhance Language Models for Sentiment Analysis","In recent years, pretrained language models have revolutionized the NLP world, while achieving state of the art performance in various downstream tasks. However, in many cases, these models do not perform well when labeled data is scarce and the model is expected to perform in the zero or few shot setting. Recently, several works have shown that continual pretraining or performing a second phase of pretraining (inter-training) which is better aligned with the downstream task, can lead to improved results, especially in the scarce data setting. Here, we propose to leverage sentiment-carrying discourse markers to generate large-scale weakly-labeled data, which in turn can be used to adapt language models for sentiment analysis. Extensive experimental results show the value of our approach on various benchmark datasets, including the finance domain. Code, models and data are available at https://github.com/ibm/tslm-discourse-markers."
"AI & Racial Equity: Understanding Sentiment Analysis Artificial Intelligence, Data Security, and Systemic Theory in Criminal Justice Systems","Various forms of implications of artificial intelligence that either exacerbate or decrease racial systemic injustice have been explored in this applied research endeavor. Taking each thematic area of identifying, analyzing, and debating an systemic issue have been leveraged in investigating merits and drawbacks of using algorithms to automate human decision making in racially sensitive environments. It has been asserted through the analysis of historical systemic patterns, implicit biases, existing algorithmic risks, and legal implications that natural language processing based AI, such as risk assessment tools, have racially disparate outcomes. It is concluded that more litigative policies are needed to regulate and restrict how internal government institutions and corporations utilize algorithms, privacy and security risks, and auditing requirements in order to diverge from racially injustice outcomes and practices of the past."
Domain Adaptation with Category Attention Network for Deep Sentiment Analysis,"Domain adaptation tasks such as cross-domain sentiment classification aim to utilize existing labeled data in the source domain and unlabeled or few labeled data in the target domain to improve the performance in the target domain via reducing the shift between the data distributions. Existing cross-domain sentiment classification methods need to distinguish pivots, i.e., the domain-shared sentiment words, and non-pivots, i.e., the domain-specific sentiment words, for excellent adaptation performance. In this paper, we first design a Category Attention Network (CAN), and then propose a model named CAN-CNN to integrate CAN and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). On the one hand, the model regards pivots and non-pivots as unified category attribute words and can automatically capture them to improve the domain adaptation performance; on the other hand, the model makes an attempt at interpretability to learn the transferred category attribute words. Specifically, the optimization objective of our model has three different components: 1) the supervised classification loss; 2) the distributions loss of category feature weights; 3) the domain invariance loss. Finally, the proposed model is evaluated on three public sentiment analysis datasets and the results demonstrate that CAN-CNN can outperform other various baseline methods."
Contextual Sentence Analysis for the Sentiment Prediction on Financial Data,"Newsletters and social networks can reflect the opinion about the market and specific stocks from the perspective of analysts and the general public on products and/or services provided by a company. Therefore, sentiment analysis of these texts can provide useful information to help investors trade in the market. In this paper, a hierarchical stack of Transformers model is proposed to identify the sentiment associated with companies and stocks, by predicting a score (of data type real) in a range between -1 and +1. Specifically, we fine-tuned a RoBERTa model to process headlines and microblogs and combined it with additional Transformer layers to process the sentence analysis with sentiment dictionaries to improve the sentiment analysis. We evaluated it on financial data released by SemEval-2017 task 5 and our proposition outperformed the best systems of SemEval-2017 task 5 and strong baselines. Indeed, the combination of contextual sentence analysis with the financial and general sentiment dictionaries provided useful information to our model and allowed it to generate more reliable sentiment scores."
Making sense of electrical vehicle discussions using sentiment analysis on closely related news and user comments,"We used a token-wise and document-wise sentiment analysis using both unsupervised and supervised models applied to both news and user reviews dataset. And our token-wise sentiment analysis found a statistically significant difference in sentiment between the two groups (both of which were very large N), our document-wise supervised sentiment analysis found no significant difference in sentiment."
Deep Models for Visual Sentiment Analysis of Disaster-related Multimedia Content,"This paper presents a solutions for the MediaEval 2021 task namely ""Visual Sentiment Analysis: A Natural Disaster Use-case"". The task aims to extract and classify sentiments perceived by viewers and the emotional message conveyed by natural disaster-related images shared on social media. The task is composed of three sub-tasks including, one single label multi-class image classification task, and, two multi-label multi-class image classification tasks, with different sets of labels. In our proposed solutions, we rely mainly on two different state-of-the-art models namely, Inception-v3 and VggNet-19, pre-trained on ImageNet, which are fine-tuned for each of the three task using different strategies. Overall encouraging results are obtained on all the three tasks. On the single-label classification task (i.e. Task 1), we obtained the weighted average F1-scores of 0.540 and 0.526 for the Inception-v3 and VggNet-19 based solutions, respectively. On the multi-label classification i.e., Task 2 and Task 3, the weighted F1-score of our Inception-v3 based solutions was 0.572 and 0.516, respectively. Similarly, the weighted F1-score of our VggNet-19 based solution on Task 2 and Task 3 was 0.584 and 0.495, respectively."
Multimodal Analysis of memes for sentiment extraction,"Memes are one of the most ubiquitous forms of social media communication. The study and processing of memes, which are intrinsically multimedia, is a popular topic right now. The study presented in this research is based on the Memotion dataset, which involves categorising memes based on irony, comedy, motivation, and overall-sentiment. Three separate innovative transformer-based techniques have been developed, and their outcomes have been thoroughly reviewed.The best algorithm achieved a macro F1 score of 0.633 for humour classification, 0.55 for motivation classification, 0.61 for sarcasm classification, and 0.575 for overall sentiment of the meme out of all our techniques."
ESAN: Efficient Sentiment Analysis Network of A-Shares Research Reports for Stock Price Prediction,"In this paper, we are going to develop a natural language processing model to help us to predict stocks in the long term. The whole network includes two modules. The first module is a natural language processing model which seeks out reliable factors from input reports. While the other is a time-series forecasting model which takes the factors as input and aims to predict stocks earnings yield. To indicate the efficiency of our model to combine the sentiment analysis module and the time-series forecasting module, we name our method ESAN."
Sentiment Analysis on Brazilian Portuguese User Reviews,"Sentiment Analysis is one of the most classical and primarily studied natural language processing tasks. This problem had a notable advance with the proposition of more complex and scalable machine learning models. Despite this progress, the Brazilian Portuguese language still disposes only of limited linguistic resources, such as datasets dedicated to sentiment classification, especially when considering the existence of predefined partitions in training, testing, and validation sets that would allow a more fair comparison of different algorithm alternatives. Motivated by these issues, this work analyzes the predictive performance of a range of document embedding strategies, assuming the polarity as the system outcome. This analysis includes five sentiment analysis datasets in Brazilian Portuguese, unified in a single dataset, and a reference partitioning in training, testing, and validation sets, both made publicly available through a digital repository. A cross-evaluation of dataset-specific models over different contexts is conducted to evaluate their generalization capabilities and the feasibility of adopting a unique model for addressing all scenarios."
Opinion Extraction as A Structured Sentiment Analysis using Transformers,"Relationship extraction and named entity recognition have always been considered as two distinct tasks that require different input data, labels, and models. However, both are essential for structured sentiment analysis. We believe that both tasks can be combined into a single stacked model with the same input data. We performed different experiments to find the best model to extract multiple opinion tuples from a single sentence. The opinion tuples will consist of holders, targets, and expressions. With the opinion tuples, we will be able to extract the relationship we need."
Sentiment Analysis and Effect of COVID-19 Pandemic using College SubReddit Data,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected our society and human well-being in various ways. In this study, we investigate how the pandemic has influenced people's emotions and psychological states compared to a pre-pandemic period using real-world data from social media.  Method: We collected Reddit social media data from 2019 (pre-pandemic) and 2020 (pandemic) from the subreddits communities associated with eight universities. We applied the pre-trained Robustly Optimized BERT pre-training approach (RoBERTa) to learn text embedding from the Reddit messages, and leveraged the relational information among posted messages to train a graph attention network (GAT) for sentiment classification. Finally, we applied model stacking to combine the prediction probabilities from RoBERTa and GAT to yield the final classification on sentiment. With the model-predicted sentiment labels on the collected data, we used a generalized linear mixed-effects model to estimate the effects of pandemic and in-person teaching during the pandemic on sentiment.  Results: The results suggest that the odds of negative sentiments in 2020 (pandemic) were 25.7% higher than the odds in 2019 (pre-pandemic) with a p-value <0.001; and the odds of negative sentiments associated in-person learning were 48.3% higher than with remote learning in 2020 with a p-value of 0.029.  Conclusions: Our study results are consistent with the findings in the literature on the negative impacts of the pandemic on people's emotions and psychological states. Our study contributes to the growing real-world evidence on the various negative impacts of the pandemic on our society; it also provides a good example of using both ML techniques and statistical modeling and inference to make better use of real-world data."
Zero-shot hashtag segmentation for multilingual sentiment analysis,"Hashtag segmentation, also known as hashtag decomposition, is a common step in preprocessing pipelines for social media datasets. It usually precedes tasks such as sentiment analysis and hate speech detection. For sentiment analysis in medium to low-resourced languages, previous research has demonstrated that a multilingual approach that resorts to machine translation can be competitive or superior to previous approaches to the task. We develop a zero-shot hashtag segmentation framework and demonstrate how it can be used to improve the accuracy of multilingual sentiment analysis pipelines. Our zero-shot framework establishes a new state-of-the-art for hashtag segmentation datasets, surpassing even previous approaches that relied on feature engineering and language models trained on in-domain data."
ScaleVLAD: Improving Multimodal Sentiment Analysis via Multi-Scale Fusion of Locally Descriptors,"Fusion technique is a key research topic in multimodal sentiment analysis. The recent attention-based fusion demonstrates advances over simple operation-based fusion. However, these fusion works adopt single-scale, i.e., token-level or utterance-level, unimodal representation. Such single-scale fusion is suboptimal because that different modality should be aligned with different granularities. This paper proposes a fusion model named ScaleVLAD to gather multi-Scale representation from text, video, and audio with shared Vectors of Locally Aggregated Descriptors to improve unaligned multimodal sentiment analysis. These shared vectors can be regarded as shared topics to align different modalities. In addition, we propose a self-supervised shifted clustering loss to keep the fused feature differentiation among samples. The backbones are three Transformer encoders corresponding to three modalities, and the aggregated features generated from the fusion module are feed to a Transformer plus a full connection to finish task predictions. Experiments on three popular sentiment analysis benchmarks, IEMOCAP, MOSI, and MOSEI, demonstrate significant gains over baselines."
Empirical evaluation of shallow and deep learning classifiers for Arabic sentiment analysis,"This work presents a detailed comparison of the performance of deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent units (GRU), their hybrids, and a selection of shallow learning classifiers for sentiment analysis of Arabic reviews. Additionally, the comparison includes state-of-the-art models such as the transformer architecture and the araBERT pre-trained model. The datasets used in this study are multi-dialect Arabic hotel and book review datasets, which are some of the largest publicly available datasets for Arabic reviews. Results showed deep learning outperforming shallow learning for binary and multi-label classification, in contrast with the results of similar work reported in the literature. This discrepancy in outcome was caused by dataset size as we found it to be proportional to the performance of deep learning models. The performance of deep and shallow learning techniques was analyzed in terms of accuracy and F1 score. The best performing shallow learning technique was Random Forest followed by Decision Tree, and AdaBoost. The deep learning models performed similarly using a default embedding layer, while the transformer model performed best when augmented with araBERT."
Adversarial Training for a Hybrid Approach to Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis,"The increasing popularity of the Web has subsequently increased the abundance of reviews on products and services. Mining these reviews for expressed sentiment is beneficial for both companies and consumers, as quality can be improved based on this information. In this paper, we consider the state-of-the-art HAABSA++ algorithm for aspect-based sentiment analysis tasked with identifying the sentiment expressed towards a given aspect in review sentences. Specifically, we train the neural network part of this algorithm using an adversarial network, a novel machine learning training method where a generator network tries to fool the classifier network by generating highly realistic new samples, as such increasing robustness. This method, as of yet never in its classical form applied to aspect-based sentiment analysis, is found to be able to considerably improve the out-of-sample accuracy of HAABSA++: for the SemEval 2015 dataset, accuracy was increased from 81.7% to 82.5%, and for the SemEval 2016 task, accuracy increased from 84.4% to 87.3%."
Customer Sentiment Analysis using Weak Supervision for Customer-Agent Chat,"Prior work on sentiment analysis using weak supervision primarily focuses on different reviews such as movies (IMDB), restaurants (Yelp), products (Amazon).~One under-explored field in this regard is customer chat data for a customer-agent chat in customer support due to the lack of availability of free public data. Here, we perform sentiment analysis on customer chat using weak supervision on our in-house dataset. We fine-tune the pre-trained language model (LM) RoBERTa as a sentiment classifier using weak supervision. Our contribution is as follows:1) We show that by using weak sentiment classifiers along with domain-specific lexicon-based rules as Labeling Functions (LF), we can train a fairly accurate customer chat sentiment classifier using weak supervision. 2) We compare the performance of our custom-trained model with off-the-shelf google cloud NLP API for sentiment analysis. We show that by injecting domain-specific knowledge using LFs, even with weak supervision, we can train a model to handle some domain-specific use cases better than off-the-shelf google cloud NLP API. 3) We also present an analysis of how customer sentiment in a chat relates to problem resolution."
Identification of Bias Against People with Disabilities in Sentiment Analysis and Toxicity Detection Models,"Sociodemographic biases are a common problem for natural language processing, affecting the fairness and integrity of its applications. Within sentiment analysis, these biases may undermine sentiment predictions for texts that mention personal attributes that unbiased human readers would consider neutral. Such discrimination can have great consequences in the applications of sentiment analysis both in the public and private sectors. For example, incorrect inferences in applications like online abuse and opinion analysis in social media platforms can lead to unwanted ramifications, such as wrongful censoring, towards certain populations. In this paper, we address the discrimination against people with disabilities, PWD, done by sentiment analysis and toxicity classification models. We provide an examination of sentiment and toxicity analysis models to understand in detail how they discriminate PWD. We present the Bias Identification Test in Sentiments (BITS), a corpus of 1,126 sentences designed to probe sentiment analysis models for biases in disability. We use this corpus to demonstrate statistically significant biases in four widely used sentiment analysis tools (TextBlob, VADER, Google Cloud Natural Language API and DistilBERT) and two toxicity analysis models trained to predict toxic comments on Jigsaw challenges (Toxic comment classification and Unintended Bias in Toxic comments). The results show that all exhibit strong negative biases on sentences that mention disability. We publicly release BITS Corpus for others to identify potential biases against disability in any sentiment analysis tools and also to update the corpus to be used as a test for other sociodemographic variables as well."
Visual Sentiment Analysis: A Natural DisasterUse-case Task at MediaEval 2021,"The Visual Sentiment Analysis task is being offered for the first time at MediaEval. The main purpose of the task is to predict the emotional response to images of natural disasters shared on social media. Disaster-related images are generally complex and often evoke an emotional response, making them an ideal use case of visual sentiment analysis. We believe being able to perform meaningful analysis of natural disaster-related data could be of great societal importance, and a joint effort in this regard can open several interesting directions for future research. The task is composed of three sub-tasks, each aiming to explore a different aspect of the challenge. In this paper, we provide a detailed overview of the task, the general motivation of the task, and an overview of the dataset and the metrics to be used for the evaluation of the proposed solutions."
Lexicon-based Methods vs. BERT for Text Sentiment Analysis,"The performance of sentiment analysis methods has greatly increased in recent years. This is due to the use of various models based on the Transformer architecture, in particular BERT. However, deep neural network models are difficult to train and poorly interpretable. An alternative approach is rule-based methods using sentiment lexicons. They are fast, require no training, and are well interpreted. But recently, due to the widespread use of deep learning, lexicon-based methods have receded into the background. The purpose of the article is to study the performance of the SO-CAL and SentiStrength lexicon-based methods, adapted for the Russian language. We have tested these methods, as well as the RuBERT neural network model, on 16 text corpora and have analyzed their results. RuBERT outperforms both lexicon-based methods on average, but SO-CAL surpasses RuBERT for four corpora out of 16."
Findings of the Sentiment Analysis of Dravidian Languages in Code-Mixed Text,"We present the results of the Dravidian-CodeMix shared task held at FIRE 2021, a track on sentiment analysis for Dravidian Languages in Code-Mixed Text. We describe the task, its organization, and the submitted systems. This shared task is the continuation of last year's Dravidian-CodeMix shared task held at FIRE 2020. This year's tasks included code-mixing at the intra-token and inter-token levels. Additionally, apart from Tamil and Malayalam, Kannada was also introduced. We received 22 systems for Tamil-English, 15 systems for Malayalam-English, and 15 for Kannada-English. The top system for Tamil-English, Malayalam-English and Kannada-English scored weighted average F1-score of 0.711, 0.804, and 0.630, respectively. In summary, the quality and quantity of the submission show that there is great interest in Dravidian languages in code-mixed setting and state of the art in this domain still needs more improvement."
Patent Sentiment Analysis to Highlight Patent Paragraphs,"Given a patent document, identifying distinct semantic annotations is an interesting research aspect. Text annotation helps the patent practitioners such as examiners and patent attorneys to quickly identify the key arguments of any invention, successively providing a timely marking of a patent text. In the process of manual patent analysis, to attain better readability, recognising the semantic information by marking paragraphs is in practice. This semantic annotation process is laborious and time-consuming. To alleviate such a problem, we proposed a novel dataset to train Machine Learning algorithms to automate the highlighting process. The contributions of this work are: i) we developed a multi-class, novel dataset of size 150k samples by traversing USPTO patents over a decade, ii) articulated statistics and distributions of data using imperative exploratory data analysis, iii) baseline Machine Learning models are developed to utilize the dataset to address patent paragraph highlighting task, iv) dataset and codes relating to this task are open-sourced through a dedicated GIT web page: https://github.com/Renuk9390/Patent_Sentiment_Analysis and v) future path to extend this work using Deep Learning and domain specific pre-trained language models to develop a tool to highlight is provided. This work assist patent practitioners in highlighting semantic information automatically and aid to create a sustainable and efficient patent analysis using the aptitude of Machine Learning."
"Seeking Common but Distinguishing Difference, A Joint Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis Model","Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) task consists of three typical subtasks: aspect term extraction, opinion term extraction, and sentiment polarity classification. These three subtasks are usually performed jointly to save resources and reduce the error propagation in the pipeline. However, most of the existing joint models only focus on the benefits of encoder sharing between subtasks but ignore the difference. Therefore, we propose a joint ABSA model, which not only enjoys the benefits of encoder sharing but also focuses on the difference to improve the effectiveness of the model. In detail, we introduce a dual-encoder design, in which a pair encoder especially focuses on candidate aspect-opinion pair classification, and the original encoder keeps attention on sequence labeling. Empirical results show that our proposed model shows robustness and significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on four benchmark datasets."
How Emotionally Stable is ALBERT? Testing Robustness with Stochastic Weight Averaging on a Sentiment Analysis Task,"Despite their success, modern language models are fragile. Even small changes in their training pipeline can lead to unexpected results. We study this phenomenon by examining the robustness of ALBERT (arXiv:1909.11942) in combination with Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA) (arXiv:1803.05407) -- a cheap way of ensembling -- on a sentiment analysis task (SST-2). In particular, we analyze SWA's stability via CheckList criteria (arXiv:2005.04118), examining the agreement on errors made by models differing only in their random seed. We hypothesize that SWA is more stable because it ensembles model snapshots taken along the gradient descent trajectory. We quantify stability by comparing the models' mistakes with Fleiss' Kappa (Fleiss, 1971) and overlap ratio scores. We find that SWA reduces error rates in general; yet the models still suffer from their own distinct biases (according to CheckList)."
Sentiment Analysis of Microblogging dataset on Coronavirus Pandemic,"Sentiment analysis can largely influence the people to get the update of the current situation. Coronavirus (COVID-19) is a contagious illness caused by the coronavirus 2 that causes severe respiratory symptoms. The lives of millions have continued to be affected by this pandemic, several countries have resorted to a full lockdown. During this lockdown, people have taken social networks to express their emotions to find a way to calm themselves down. People are spreading their sentiments through microblogging websites as one of the most preventive steps of this disease is the socialization to gain people's awareness to stay home and keep their distance when they are outside home. Twitter is a popular online social media platform for exchanging ideas. People can post their different sentiments, which can be used to aware people. But, some people want to spread fake news to frighten the people. So, it is necessary to identify the positive, negative, and neutral thoughts so that the positive opinions can be delivered to the mass people for spreading awareness to the people. Moreover, a huge volume of data is floating on Twitter. So, it is also important to identify the context of the dataset. In this paper, we have analyzed the Twitter dataset for evaluating the sentiment using several machine learning algorithms. Later, we have found out the context learning of the dataset based on the sentiments."
Which is Making the Contribution: Modulating Unimodal and Cross-modal Dynamics for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis,"Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) draws increasing attention with the availability of multimodal data. The boost in performance of MSA models is mainly hindered by two problems. On the one hand, recent MSA works mostly focus on learning cross-modal dynamics, but neglect to explore an optimal solution for unimodal networks, which determines the lower limit of MSA models. On the other hand, noisy information hidden in each modality interferes the learning of correct cross-modal dynamics. To address the above-mentioned problems, we propose a novel MSA framework \textbf{M}odulation \textbf{M}odel for \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{S}entiment \textbf{A}nalysis ({ M^3SA }) to identify the contribution of modalities and reduce the impact of noisy information, so as to better learn unimodal and cross-modal dynamics. Specifically, modulation loss is designed to modulate the loss contribution based on the confidence of individual modalities in each utterance, so as to explore an optimal update solution for each unimodal network. Besides, contrary to most existing works which fail to explicitly filter out noisy information, we devise a modality filter module to identify and filter out modality noise for the learning of correct cross-modal embedding. Extensive experiments on publicly datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance."
IIITT@Dravidian-CodeMix-FIRE2021: Transliterate or translate? Sentiment analysis of code-mixed text in Dravidian languages,"Sentiment analysis of social media posts and comments for various marketing and emotional purposes is gaining recognition. With the increasing presence of code-mixed content in various native languages, there is a need for ardent research to produce promising results. This research paper bestows a tiny contribution to this research in the form of sentiment analysis of code-mixed social media comments in the popular Dravidian languages Kannada, Tamil and Malayalam. It describes the work for the shared task conducted by Dravidian-CodeMix at FIRE 2021 by employing pre-trained models like ULMFiT and multilingual BERT fine-tuned on the code-mixed dataset, transliteration (TRAI) of the same, English translations (TRAA) of the TRAI data and the combination of all the three. The results are recorded in this research paper where the best models stood 4th, 5th and 10th ranks in the Tamil, Kannada and Malayalam tasks respectively."
Sentiment Analysis of Fashion Related Posts in Social Media,"The role of social media in fashion industry has been blooming as the years have continued on. In this work, we investigate sentiment analysis for fashion related posts in social media platforms. There are two main challenges of this task. On the first place, information of different modalities must be jointly considered to make the final predictions. On the second place, some unique fashion related attributes should be taken into account. While most existing works focus on traditional multimodal sentiment analysis, they always fail to exploit the fashion related attributes in this task. We propose a novel framework that jointly leverages the image vision, post text, as well as fashion attribute modality to determine the sentiment category. One characteristic of our model is that it extracts fashion attributes and integrates them with the image vision information for effective representation. Furthermore, it exploits the mutual relationship between the fashion attributes and the post texts via a mutual attention mechanism. Since there is no existing dataset suitable for this task, we prepare a large-scale sentiment analysis dataset of over 12k fashion related social media posts. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model."
Explainable Sentence-Level Sentiment Analysis for Amazon Product Reviews,"In this paper, we conduct a sentence level sentiment analysis on the product reviews from Amazon and thorough analysis on the model interpretability. For the sentiment analysis task, we use the BiLSTM model with attention mechanism. For the study of interpretability, we consider the attention weights distribution of single sentence and the attention weights of main aspect terms. The model has an accuracy of up to 0.96. And we find that the aspect terms have the same or even more attention weights than the sentimental words in sentences."
"Topic Modeling, Clade-assisted Sentiment Analysis, and Vaccine Brand Reputation Analysis of COVID-19 Vaccine-related Facebook Comments in the Philippines","Vaccine hesitancy and other COVID-19-related concerns and complaints in the Philippines are evident on social media. It is important to identify these different topics and sentiments in order to gauge public opinion, use the insights to develop policies, and make necessary adjustments or actions to improve public image and reputation of the administering agency and the COVID-19 vaccines themselves. This paper proposes a semi-supervised machine learning pipeline to perform topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and an analysis of vaccine brand reputation to obtain an in-depth understanding of national public opinion of Filipinos on Facebook. The methodology makes use of a multilingual version of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers or BERT for topic modeling, hierarchical clustering, five different classifiers for sentiment analysis, and cosine similarity of BERT topic embeddings for vaccine brand reputation analysis. Results suggest that any type of COVID-19 misinformation is an emergent property of COVID-19 public opinion, and that the detection of COVID-19 misinformation can be an unsupervised task. Sentiment analysis aided by hierarchical clustering reveal that 21 of the 25 topics extrapolated by topic modeling are negative topics. Such negative comments spike in count whenever the Department of Health in the Philippines posts about the COVID-19 situation in other countries. Additionally, the high numbers of laugh reactions on the Facebook posts by the same agency -- without any humorous content -- suggest that the reactors of these posts tend to react the way they do, not because of what the posts are about but because of who posted them."
Sentiment Analysis and Topic Modeling for COVID-19 Vaccine Discussions,"The outbreak of the novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has lasted for nearly two years and caused unprecedented impacts on people's daily life around the world. Even worse, the emergence of the COVID-19 Delta variant once again puts the world in danger. Fortunately, many countries and companies have started to develop coronavirus vaccines since the beginning of this disaster. Till now, more than 20 vaccines have been approved by the World Health Organization (WHO), bringing light to people besieged by the pandemic. The promotion of COVID-19 vaccination around the world also brings a lot of discussions on social media about different aspects of vaccines, such as efficacy and security. However, there does not exist much research work to systematically analyze public opinion towards COVID-19 vaccines. In this study, we conduct an in-depth analysis of tweets related to the coronavirus vaccine on Twitter to understand the trending topics and their corresponding sentimental polarities regarding the country and vaccine levels. The results show that a majority of people are confident in the effectiveness of vaccines and are willing to get vaccinated. In contrast, the negative tweets are often associated with the complaints of vaccine shortages, side effects after injections and possible death after being vaccinated. Overall, this study exploits popular NLP and topic modeling methods to mine people's opinions on the COVID-19 vaccines on social media and to analyse and visualise them objectively. Our findings can improve the readability of the noisy information on social media and provide effective data support for the government and policy makers."
Leveraging Sentiment Analysis Knowledge to Solve Emotion Detection Tasks,"Identifying and understanding underlying sentiment or emotions in text is a key component of multiple natural language processing applications. While simple polarity sentiment analysis is a well-studied subject, fewer advances have been made in identifying more complex, finer-grained emotions using only textual data. In this paper, we present a Transformer-based model with a Fusion of Adapter layers which leverages knowledge from more simple sentiment analysis tasks to improve the emotion detection task on large scale dataset, such as CMU-MOSEI, using the textual modality only. Results show that our proposed method is competitive with other approaches. We obtained state-of-the-art results for emotion recognition on CMU-MOSEI even while using only the textual modality."
End-to-End Annotator Bias Approximation on Crowdsourced Single-Label Sentiment Analysis,"Sentiment analysis is often a crowdsourcing task prone to subjective labels given by many annotators. It is not yet fully understood how the annotation bias of each annotator can be modeled correctly with state-of-the-art methods. However, resolving annotator bias precisely and reliably is the key to understand annotators' labeling behavior and to successfully resolve corresponding individual misconceptions and wrongdoings regarding the annotation task. Our contribution is an explanation and improvement for precise neural end-to-end bias modeling and ground truth estimation, which reduces an undesired mismatch in that regard of the existing state-of-the-art. Classification experiments show that it has potential to improve accuracy in cases where each sample is annotated only by one single annotator. We provide the whole source code publicly and release an own domain-specific sentiment dataset containing 10,000 sentences discussing organic food products. These are crawled from social media and are singly labeled by 10 non-expert annotators."
Learning Implicit Sentiment in Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis with Supervised Contrastive Pre-Training,"Aspect-based sentiment analysis aims to identify the sentiment polarity of a specific aspect in product reviews. We notice that about 30% of reviews do not contain obvious opinion words, but still convey clear human-aware sentiment orientation, which is known as implicit sentiment. However, recent neural network-based approaches paid little attention to implicit sentiment entailed in the reviews. To overcome this issue, we adopt Supervised Contrastive Pre-training on large-scale sentiment-annotated corpora retrieved from in-domain language resources. By aligning the representation of implicit sentiment expressions to those with the same sentiment label, the pre-training process leads to better capture of both implicit and explicit sentiment orientation towards aspects in reviews. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on SemEval2014 benchmarks, and comprehensive analysis validates its effectiveness on learning implicit sentiment."
FinEAS: Financial Embedding Analysis of Sentiment,"We introduce a new language representation model in finance called Financial Embedding Analysis of Sentiment (FinEAS). In financial markets, news and investor sentiment are significant drivers of security prices. Thus, leveraging the capabilities of modern NLP approaches for financial sentiment analysis is a crucial component in identifying patterns and trends that are useful for market participants and regulators. In recent years, methods that use transfer learning from large Transformer-based language models like BERT, have achieved state-of-the-art results in text classification tasks, including sentiment analysis using labelled datasets. Researchers have quickly adopted these approaches to financial texts, but best practices in this domain are not well-established. In this work, we propose a new model for financial sentiment analysis based on supervised fine-tuned sentence embeddings from a standard BERT model. We demonstrate our approach achieves significant improvements in comparison to vanilla BERT, LSTM, and FinBERT, a financial domain specific BERT."
Pay attention to emoji: Feature Fusion Network with EmoGraph2vec Model for Sentiment Analysis,"With the explosive growth of social media, opinionated postings with emojis have increased explosively. Many emojis are used to express emotions, attitudes, and opinions. Emoji representation learning can be helpful to improve the performance of emoji-related natural language processing tasks, especially in text sentiment analysis. However, most studies have only utilized the fixed descriptions provided by the Unicode Consortium without consideration of actual usage scenarios. As for the sentiment analysis task, many researchers ignore the emotional impact of the interaction between text and emojis. It results that the emotional semantics of emojis cannot be fully explored. In this work, we propose a method called EmoGraph2vec to learn emoji representations by constructing a co-occurrence graph network from social data and enriching the semantic information based on an external knowledge base EmojiNet to embed emoji nodes. Based on EmoGraph2vec model, we design a novel neural network to incorporate text and emoji information into sentiment analysis, which uses a hybrid-attention module combined with TextCNN-based classifier to improve performance. Experimental results show that the proposed model can outperform several baselines for sentiment analysis on benchmark datasets. Additionally, we conduct a series of ablation and comparison experiments to investigate the effectiveness and interpretability of our model."
Emoji-based Co-attention Network for Microblog Sentiment Analysis,"Emojis are widely used in online social networks to express emotions, attitudes, and opinions. As emotional-oriented characters, emojis can be modeled as important features of emotions towards the recipient or subject for sentiment analysis. However, existing methods mainly take emojis as heuristic information that fails to resolve the problem of ambiguity noise. Recent researches have utilized emojis as an independent input to classify text sentiment but they ignore the emotional impact of the interaction between text and emojis. It results that the emotional semantics of emojis cannot be fully explored. In this paper, we propose an emoji-based co-attention network that learns the mutual emotional semantics between text and emojis on microblogs. Our model adopts the co-attention mechanism based on bidirectional long short-term memory incorporating the text and emojis, and integrates a squeeze-and-excitation block in a convolutional neural network classifier to increase its sensitivity to emotional semantic features. Experimental results show that the proposed method can significantly outperform several baselines for sentiment analysis on short texts of social media."
Unified Instance and Knowledge Alignment Pretraining for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis,"Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) aims to determine the sentiment polarity towards an aspect. Because of the expensive and limited labelled data, the pretraining strategy has become the de-facto standard for ABSA. However, there always exists severe domain shift between the pretraining and downstream ABSA datasets, hindering the effective knowledge transfer when directly finetuning and making the downstream task performs sub-optimal. To mitigate such domain shift, we introduce a unified alignment pretraining framework into the vanilla pretrain-finetune pipeline with both instance- and knowledge-level alignments. Specifically, we first devise a novel coarse-to-fine retrieval sampling approach to select target domain-related instances from the large-scale pretraining dataset, thus aligning the instances between pretraining and target domains (First Stage). Then, we introduce a knowledge guidance-based strategy to further bridge the domain gap at the knowledge level. In practice, we formulate the model pretrained on the sampled instances into a knowledge guidance model and a learner model, respectively. On the target dataset, we design an on-the-fly teacher-student joint fine-tuning approach to progressively transfer the knowledge from the knowledge guidance model to the learner model (Second Stage). Thereby, the learner model can maintain more domain-invariant knowledge when learning new knowledge from the target dataset. In the Third Stage, the learner model is finetuned to better adapt its learned knowledge to the target dataset. Extensive experiments and analyses on several ABSA benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and universality of our proposed pretraining framework. Our source code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/WHU-ZQH/UIKA."
Distributionally Robust Classifiers in Sentiment Analysis,"In this paper, we propose sentiment classification models based on BERT integrated with DRO (Distributionally Robust Classifiers) to improve model performance on datasets with distributional shifts. We added 2-Layer Bi-LSTM, projection layer (onto simplex or Lp ball), and linear layer on top of BERT to achieve distributionally robustness. We considered one form of distributional shift (from IMDb dataset to Rotten Tomatoes dataset). We have confirmed through experiments that our DRO model does improve performance on our test set with distributional shift from the training set."
SentimentArcs: A Novel Method for Self-Supervised Sentiment Analysis of Time Series Shows SOTA Transformers Can Struggle Finding Narrative Arcs,"SOTA Transformer and DNN short text sentiment classifiers report over 97% accuracy on narrow domains like IMDB movie reviews. Real-world performance is significantly lower because traditional models overfit benchmarks and generalize poorly to different or more open domain texts. This paper introduces SentimentArcs, a new self-supervised time series sentiment analysis methodology that addresses the two main limitations of traditional supervised sentiment analysis: limited labeled training datasets and poor generalization. A large ensemble of diverse models provides a synthetic ground truth for self-supervised learning. Novel metrics jointly optimize an exhaustive search across every possible corpus:model combination. The joint optimization over both the corpus and model solves the generalization problem. Simple visualizations exploit the temporal structure in narratives so domain experts can quickly spot trends, identify key features, and note anomalies over hundreds of arcs and millions of data points. To our knowledge, this is the first self-supervised method for time series sentiment analysis and the largest survey directly comparing real-world model performance on long-form narratives."
Span Detection for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis in Vietnamese,"Aspect-based sentiment analysis plays an essential role in natural language processing and artificial intelligence. Recently, researchers only focused on aspect detection and sentiment classification but ignoring the sub-task of detecting user opinion span, which has enormous potential in practical applications. In this paper, we present a new Vietnamese dataset (UIT-ViSD4SA) consisting of 35,396 human-annotated spans on 11,122 feedback comments for evaluating the span detection in aspect-based sentiment analysis. Besides, we also propose a novel system using Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) with a Conditional Random Field (CRF) layer (BiLSTM-CRF) for the span detection task in Vietnamese aspect-based sentiment analysis. The best result is a 62.76% F1 score (macro) for span detection using BiLSTM-CRF with embedding fusion of syllable embedding, character embedding, and contextual embedding from XLM-RoBERTa. In future work, span detection will be extended in many NLP tasks such as constructive detection, emotion recognition, complaint analysis, and opinion mining. Our dataset is freely available at https://github.com/kimkim00/UIT-ViSD4SA for research purposes."
Solving Aspect Category Sentiment Analysis as a Text Generation Task,"Aspect category sentiment analysis has attracted increasing research attention. The dominant methods make use of pre-trained language models by learning effective aspect category-specific representations, and adding specific output layers to its pre-trained representation. We consider a more direct way of making use of pre-trained language models, by casting the ACSA tasks into natural language generation tasks, using natural language sentences to represent the output. Our method allows more direct use of pre-trained knowledge in seq2seq language models by directly following the task setting during pre-training. Experiments on several benchmarks show that our method gives the best reported results, having large advantages in few-shot and zero-shot settings."
Representation of professions in entertainment media: Insights into frequency and sentiment trends through computational text analysis,"Societal ideas and trends dictate media narratives and cinematic depictions which in turn influences people's beliefs and perceptions of the real world. Media portrayal of culture, education, government, religion, and family affect their function and evolution over time as people interpret and perceive these representations and incorporate them into their beliefs and actions. It is important to study media depictions of these social structures so that they do not propagate or reinforce negative stereotypes, or discriminate against any demographic section. In this work, we examine media representation of professions and provide computational insights into their incidence, and sentiment expressed, in entertainment media content. We create a searchable taxonomy of professional groups and titles to facilitate their retrieval from speaker-agnostic text passages like movie and television (TV) show subtitles. We leverage this taxonomy and relevant natural language processing (NLP) models to create a corpus of professional mentions in media content, spanning more than 136,000 IMDb titles over seven decades (1950-2017). We analyze the frequency and sentiment trends of different occupations, study the effect of media attributes like genre, country of production, and title type on these trends, and investigate if the incidence of professions in media subtitles correlate with their real-world employment statistics. We observe increased media mentions of STEM, arts, sports, and entertainment occupations in the analyzed subtitles, and a decreased frequency of manual labor jobs and military occupations. The sentiment expressed toward lawyers, police, and doctors is becoming negative over time, whereas astronauts, musicians, singers, and engineers are mentioned favorably. Professions that employ more people have increased media frequency, supporting our hypothesis that media acts as a mirror to society."
Exploring Conditional Text Generation for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis,"Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is an NLP task that entails processing user-generated reviews to determine (i) the target being evaluated, (ii) the aspect category to which it belongs, and (iii) the sentiment expressed towards the target and aspect pair. In this article, we propose transforming ABSA into an abstract summary-like conditional text generation task that uses targets, aspects, and polarities to generate auxiliary statements. To demonstrate the efficacy of our task formulation and a proposed system, we fine-tune a pre-trained model for conditional text generation tasks to get new state-of-the-art results on a few restaurant domains and urban neighborhoods domain benchmark datasets."
A Comparative Study of Sentiment Analysis Using NLP and Different Machine Learning Techniques on US Airline Twitter Data,"Today's business ecosystem has become very competitive. Customer satisfaction has become a major focus for business growth. Business organizations are spending a lot of money and human resources on various strategies to understand and fulfill their customer's needs. But, because of defective manual analysis on multifarious needs of customers, many organizations are failing to achieve customer satisfaction. As a result, they are losing customer's loyalty and spending extra money on marketing. We can solve the problems by implementing Sentiment Analysis. It is a combined technique of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML). Sentiment Analysis is broadly used to extract insights from wider public opinion behind certain topics, products, and services. We can do it from any online available data. In this paper, we have introduced two NLP techniques (Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF) and various ML classification algorithms (Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Random Forest) to find an effective approach for Sentiment Analysis on a large, imbalanced, and multi-classed dataset. Our best approaches provide 77% accuracy using Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression with Bag-of-Words technique."
Relation Analysis between Hotel Review Rating Scores and Sentiment Analysis of Reviews by Chinese Tourists Visiting Japan,"In current times, the importance of online hotel review sites has become more and more apparent. Users of these sites reference of reviews strongly influences their purchase behavior and as such, reviews are important to companies and researchers alike. The majority of review sites offer both text reviews and numerical hotel ratings, and both information sources are widely used by researchers as a representation of a customer's sentiment and opinion. However, an opinion is a difficult concept to measure, and as such, depending on the relation these two sources have, it would be apparent whether or not it is safe to consider them equally in research. In this study we utilize an entropy-based Support Vector Machine to classify positive and negative sentiments in hotel reviews from the site Ctrip, then calculating the ratio of positive and negative sentiment in each review and examine their correlation with said review's rating score using Spearman and Kendall Correlation coefficients and Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC)."
UserIdentifier: Implicit User Representations for Simple and Effective Personalized Sentiment Analysis,"Global models are trained to be as generalizable as possible, with user invariance considered desirable since the models are shared across multitudes of users. As such, these models are often unable to produce personalized responses for individual users, based on their data. Contrary to widely-used personalization techniques based on few-shot learning, we propose UserIdentifier, a novel scheme for training a single shared model for all users. Our approach produces personalized responses by adding fixed, non-trainable user identifiers to the input data. We empirically demonstrate that this proposed method outperforms the prefix-tuning based state-of-the-art approach by up to 13%, on a suite of sentiment analysis datasets. We also show that, unlike prior work, this method needs neither any additional model parameters nor any extra rounds of few-shot fine-tuning."
Overview of the Arabic Sentiment Analysis 2021 Competition at KAUST,"This paper provides an overview of the Arabic Sentiment Analysis Challenge organized by King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST). The task in this challenge is to develop machine learning models to classify a given tweet into one of the three categories Positive, Negative, or Neutral. From our recently released ASAD dataset, we provide the competitors with 55K tweets for training, and 20K tweets for validation, based on which the performance of participating teams are ranked on a leaderboard, https://www.kaggle.com/c/arabic-sentiment-analysis-2021-kaust. The competition received in total 1247 submissions from 74 teams (99 team members). The final winners are determined by another private set of 20K tweets that have the same distribution as the training and validation set. In this paper, we present the main findings in the competition and summarize the methods and tools used by the top ranked teams. The full dataset of 100K labeled tweets is also released for public usage, at https://www.kaggle.com/c/arabic-sentiment-analysis-2021-kaust/data."
Sentiment Analysis in Twitter for Macedonian,"We present work on sentiment analysis in Twitter for Macedonian. As this is pioneering work for this combination of language and genre, we created suitable resources for training and evaluating a system for sentiment analysis of Macedonian tweets. In particular, we developed a corpus of tweets annotated with tweet-level sentiment polarity (positive, negative, and neutral), as well as with phrase-level sentiment, which we made freely available for research purposes. We further bootstrapped several large-scale sentiment lexicons for Macedonian, motivated by previous work for English. The impact of several different pre-processing steps as well as of various features is shown in experiments that represent the first attempt to build a system for sentiment analysis in Twitter for the morphologically rich Macedonian language. Overall, our experimental results show an F1-score of 92.16, which is very strong and is on par with the best results for English, which were achieved in recent SemEval competitions."
Decision Making For Celebrity Branding: An Opinion Mining Approach Based On Polarity And Sentiment Analysis Using Twitter Consumer-Generated Content (CGC),"The volume of discussions concerning brands within social media provides digital marketers with great opportunities for tracking and analyzing the feelings and views of consumers toward brands, products, influencers, services, and ad campaigns in CGC. The present study aims to assess and compare the performance of firms and celebrities (i.e., influencers that with the experience of being in an ad campaign of those companies) with the automated sentiment analysis that was employed for CGC at social media while exploring the feeling of the consumers toward them to observe which influencer (of two for each company) had a closer effect with the corresponding corporation on consumer minds. For this purpose, several consumer tweets from the pages of brands and influencers were utilized to make a comparison of machine learning and lexicon-based approaches to the sentiment analysis through the Naive algorithm (lexicon-based) and Naive Bayes algorithm (machine learning method) and obtain the desired results to assess the campaigns. The findings suggested that the approaches were dissimilar in terms of accuracy; the machine learning method yielded higher accuracy. Finally, the results showed which influencer was more appropriate according to their existence in previous campaigns and helped choose the right influencer in the future for our company and have a better, more appropriate, and more efficient ad campaign subsequently. It is required to conduct further studies on the accuracy improvement of the sentiment classification. This approach should be employed for other social media CGC types. The results revealed decision-making for which sentiment analysis methods are the best approaches for the analysis of social media. It was also found that companies should be aware of their consumers' sentiments and choose the right person every time they think of a campaign."
A Comprehensive Overview of Recommender System and Sentiment Analysis,"Recommender system has been proven to be significantly crucial in many fields and is widely used by various domains. Most of the conventional recommender systems rely on the numeric rating given by a user to reflect his opinion about a consumed item; however, these ratings are not available in many domains. As a result, a new source of information represented by the user-generated reviews is incorporated in the recommendation process to compensate for the lack of these ratings. The reviews contain prosperous and numerous information related to the whole item or a specific feature that can be extracted using the sentiment analysis field. This paper gives a comprehensive overview to help researchers who aim to work with recommender system and sentiment analysis. It includes a background of the recommender system concept, including phases, approaches, and performance metrics used in recommender systems. Then, it discusses the sentiment analysis concept and highlights the main points in the sentiment analysis, including level, approaches, and focuses on aspect-based sentiment analysis."
SentiPrompt: Sentiment Knowledge Enhanced Prompt-Tuning for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis,"Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is an emerging fine-grained sentiment analysis task that aims to extract aspects, classify corresponding sentiment polarities and find opinions as the causes of sentiment. The latest research tends to solve the ABSA task in a unified way with end-to-end frameworks. Yet, these frameworks get fine-tuned from downstream tasks without any task-adaptive modification. Specifically, they do not use task-related knowledge well or explicitly model relations between aspect and opinion terms, hindering them from better performance. In this paper, we propose SentiPrompt to use sentiment knowledge enhanced prompts to tune the language model in the unified framework. We inject sentiment knowledge regarding aspects, opinions, and polarities into prompt and explicitly model term relations via constructing consistency and polarity judgment templates from the ground truth triplets. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can outperform strong baselines on Triplet Extraction, Pair Extraction, and Aspect Term Extraction with Sentiment Classification by a notable margin."
Ethics Sheet for Automatic Emotion Recognition and Sentiment Analysis,"The importance and pervasiveness of emotions in our lives makes affective computing a tremendously important and vibrant line of work. Systems for automatic emotion recognition (AER) and sentiment analysis can be facilitators of enormous progress (e.g., in improving public health and commerce) but also enablers of great harm (e.g., for suppressing dissidents and manipulating voters). Thus, it is imperative that the affective computing community actively engage with the ethical ramifications of their creations. In this paper, I have synthesized and organized information from AI Ethics and Emotion Recognition literature to present fifty ethical considerations relevant to AER. Notably, the sheet fleshes out assumptions hidden in how AER is commonly framed, and in the choices often made regarding the data, method, and evaluation. Special attention is paid to the implications of AER on privacy and social groups. Along the way, key recommendations are made for responsible AER. The objective of the sheet is to facilitate and encourage more thoughtfulness on why to automate, how to automate, and how to judge success well before the building of AER systems. Additionally, the sheet acts as a useful introductory document on emotion recognition (complementing survey articles)."
A literature survey on student feedback assessment tools and their usage in sentiment analysis,"Online learning is becoming increasingly popular, whether for convenience, to accommodate work hours, or simply to have the freedom to study from anywhere. Especially, during the Covid-19 pandemic, it has become the only viable option for learning. The effectiveness of teaching various hard-core programming courses with a mix of theoretical content is determined by the student interaction and responses. In contrast to a digital lecture through Zoom or Teams, a lecturer may rapidly acquire such responses from students' facial expressions, behavior, and attitude in a physical session, even if the listener is largely idle and non-interactive. However, student assessment in virtual learning is a challenging task. Despite the challenges, different technologies are progressively being integrated into teaching environments to boost student engagement and motivation. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of various in-class feedback assessment methods such as Kahoot!, Mentimeter, Padlet, and polling to assist a lecturer in obtaining real-time feedback from students throughout a session and adapting the teaching style accordingly. Furthermore, some of the topics covered by student suggestions include tutor suggestions, enhancing teaching style, course content, and other subjects. Any input gives the instructor valuable insight into how to improve the student's learning experience, however, manually going through all of the qualitative comments and extracting the ideas is tedious. Thus, in this paper, we propose a sentiment analysis model for extracting the explicit suggestions from the students' qualitative feedback comments."
Jointly Modeling Aspect and Polarity for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis in Persian Reviews,"Identification of user's opinions from natural language text has become an exciting field of research due to its growing applications in the real world. The research field is known as sentiment analysis and classification, where aspect category detection (ACD) and aspect category polarity (ACP) are two important sub-tasks of aspect-based sentiment analysis. The goal in ACD is to specify which aspect of the entity comes up in opinion while ACP aims to specify the polarity of each aspect category from the ACD task. The previous works mostly propose separate solutions for these two sub-tasks. This paper focuses on the ACD and ACP sub-tasks to solve both problems simultaneously. The proposed method carries out multi-label classification where four different deep models were employed and comparatively evaluated to examine their performance. A dataset of Persian reviews was collected from CinemaTicket website including 2200 samples from 14 categories. The developed models were evaluated using the collected dataset in terms of example-based and label-based metrics. The results indicate the high applicability and preference of the CNN and GRU models in comparison to LSTM and Bi-LSTM."
Learning to Aggregate and Refine Noisy Labels for Visual Sentiment Analysis,"Visual sentiment analysis has received increasing attention in recent years. However, the dataset's quality is a concern because the sentiment labels are crowd-sourcing, subjective, and prone to mistakes, and poses a severe threat to the data-driven models, especially the deep neural networks. The deep models would generalize poorly on the testing cases when trained to over-fit the training samples with noisy sentiment labels. Inspired by the recent progress on learning with noisy labels, we propose a robust learning method to perform robust visual sentiment analysis. Our method relies on external memory to aggregate and filters noisy labels during training. The memory is composed of the prototypes with corresponding labels, which can be updated online. The learned prototypes and their labels can be regarded as denoising features and labels for the local regions and can guide the training process to prevent the model from overfitting the noisy cases. We establish a benchmark for visual sentiment analysis with label noise using publicly available datasets. The experiment results of the proposed benchmark settings comprehensively show the effectiveness of our method."
Sentiment Analysis in Poems in Misurata Sub-dialect -- A Sentiment Detection in an Arabic Sub-dialect,"Over the recent decades, there has been a significant increase and development of resources for Arabic natural language processing. This includes the task of exploring Arabic Language Sentiment Analysis (ALSA) from Arabic utterances in both Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and different Arabic dialects. This study focuses on detecting sentiment in poems written in Misurata Arabic sub-dialect spoken in Misurata, Libya. The tools used to detect sentiment from the dataset are Sklearn as well as Mazajak sentiment tool 1. Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes (NB), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifiers are used with Sklearn, while the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is implemented with Mazajak. The results show that the traditional classifiers score a higher level of accuracy as compared to Mazajak which is built on an algorithm that includes deep learning techniques. More research is suggested to analyze Arabic sub-dialect poetry in order to investigate the aspects that contribute to sentiments in these multi-line texts; for example, the use of figurative language such as metaphors."
Sparse Fuzzy Attention for Structured Sentiment Analysis,"Attention scorers have achieved success in parsing tasks like semantic and syntactic dependency parsing. However, in tasks modeled into parsing, like structured sentiment analysis, ""dependency edges"" are very sparse which hinders parser performance. Thus we propose a sparse and fuzzy attention scorer with pooling layers which improves parser performance and sets the new state-of-the-art on structured sentiment analysis. We further explore the parsing modeling on structured sentiment analysis with second-order parsing and introduce a novel sparse second-order edge building procedure that leads to significant improvement in parsing performance."
Powering Comparative Classification with Sentiment Analysis via Domain Adaptive Knowledge Transfer,"We study Comparative Preference Classification (CPC) which aims at predicting whether a preference comparison exists between two entities in a given sentence and, if so, which entity is preferred over the other. High-quality CPC models can significantly benefit applications such as comparative question answering and review-based recommendations. Among the existing approaches, non-deep learning methods suffer from inferior performances. The state-of-the-art graph neural network-based ED-GAT (Ma et al., 2020) only considers syntactic information while ignoring the critical semantic relations and the sentiments to the compared entities. We proposed sentiment Analysis Enhanced COmparative Network (SAECON) which improves CPC ac-curacy with a sentiment analyzer that learns sentiments to individual entities via domain adaptive knowledge transfer. Experiments on the CompSent-19 (Panchenko et al., 2019) dataset present a significant improvement on the F1 scores over the best existing CPC approaches."
ExCode-Mixed: Explainable Approaches towards Sentiment Analysis on Code-Mixed Data using BERT models,"The increasing use of social media sites in countries like India has given rise to large volumes of code-mixed data. Sentiment analysis of this data can provide integral insights into people's perspectives and opinions. Developing robust explainability techniques which explain why models make their predictions becomes essential. In this paper, we propose an adequate methodology to integrate explainable approaches into code-mixed sentiment analysis."
Hybrid Contrastive Learning of Tri-Modal Representation for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis,"The wide application of smart devices enables the availability of multimodal data, which can be utilized in many tasks. In the field of multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA), most previous works focus on exploring intra- and inter-modal interactions. However, training a network with cross-modal information (language, visual, audio) is still challenging due to the modality gap, and existing methods still cannot ensure to sufficiently learn intra-/inter-modal dynamics. Besides, while learning dynamics within each sample draws great attention, the learning of inter-class relationships is neglected. Moreover, the size of datasets limits the generalization ability of existing methods. To address the afore-mentioned issues, we propose a novel framework HyCon for hybrid contrastive learning of tri-modal representation. Specifically, we simultaneously perform intra-/inter-modal contrastive learning and semi-contrastive learning (that is why we call it hybrid contrastive learning), with which the model can fully explore cross-modal interactions, preserve inter-class relationships and reduce the modality gap. Besides, a refinement term is devised to prevent the model falling into a sub-optimal solution. Moreover, HyCon can naturally generate a large amount of training pairs for better generalization and reduce the negative effect of limited datasets. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing works."
Improving Multimodal Fusion with Hierarchical Mutual Information Maximization for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis,"In multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA), the performance of a model highly depends on the quality of synthesized embeddings. These embeddings are generated from the upstream process called multimodal fusion, which aims to extract and combine the input unimodal raw data to produce a richer multimodal representation. Previous work either back-propagates the task loss or manipulates the geometric property of feature spaces to produce favorable fusion results, which neglects the preservation of critical task-related information that flows from input to the fusion results. In this work, we propose a framework named MultiModal InfoMax (MMIM), which hierarchically maximizes the Mutual Information (MI) in unimodal input pairs (inter-modality) and between multimodal fusion result and unimodal input in order to maintain task-related information through multimodal fusion. The framework is jointly trained with the main task (MSA) to improve the performance of the downstream MSA task. To address the intractable issue of MI bounds, we further formulate a set of computationally simple parametric and non-parametric methods to approximate their truth value. Experimental results on the two widely used datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. The implementation of this work is publicly available at https://github.com/declare-lab/Multimodal-Infomax."
The emojification of sentiment on social media: Collection and analysis of a longitudinal Twitter sentiment dataset,"Social media, as a means for computer-mediated communication, has been extensively used to study the sentiment expressed by users around events or topics. There is however a gap in the longitudinal study of how sentiment evolved in social media over the years. To fill this gap, we develop TM-Senti, a new large-scale, distantly supervised Twitter sentiment dataset with over 184 million tweets and covering a time period of over seven years. We describe and assess our methodology to put together a large-scale, emoticon- and emoji-based labelled sentiment analysis dataset, along with an analysis of the resulting dataset. Our analysis highlights interesting temporal changes, among others in the increasing use of emojis over emoticons. We publicly release the dataset for further research in tasks including sentiment analysis and text classification of tweets. The dataset can be fully rehydrated including tweet metadata and without missing tweets thanks to the archive of tweets publicly available on the Internet Archive, which the dataset is based on."
Public sentiment analysis and topic modeling regarding COVID-19 vaccines on the Reddit social media platform: A call to action for strengthening vaccine confidence,"The COVID-19 pandemic fueled one of the most rapid vaccine developments in history. However, misinformation spread through online social media often leads to negative vaccine sentiment and hesitancy. To investigate COVID-19 vaccine-related discussion in social media, we conducted a sentiment analysis and Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic modeling on textual data collected from 13 Reddit communities focusing on the COVID-19 vaccine from Dec 1, 2020, to May 15, 2021. Data were aggregated and analyzed by month to detect changes in any sentiment and latent topics. ty analysis suggested these communities expressed more positive sentiment than negative regarding the vaccine-related discussions and has remained static over time. Topic modeling revealed community members mainly focused on side effects rather than outlandish conspiracy theories. Covid-19 vaccine-related content from 13 subreddits show that the sentiments expressed in these communities are overall more positive than negative and have not meaningfully changed since December 2020. Keywords indicating vaccine hesitancy were detected throughout the LDA topic modeling. Public sentiment and topic modeling analysis regarding vaccines could facilitate the implementation of appropriate messaging, digital interventions, and new policies to promote vaccine confidence."
DuTrust: A Sentiment Analysis Dataset for Trustworthiness Evaluation,"While deep learning models have greatly improved the performance of most artificial intelligence tasks, they are often criticized to be untrustworthy due to the black-box problem. Consequently, many works have been proposed to study the trustworthiness of deep learning. However, as most open datasets are designed for evaluating the accuracy of model outputs, there is still a lack of appropriate datasets for evaluating the inner workings of neural networks. The lack of datasets obviously hinders the development of trustworthiness research. Therefore, in order to systematically evaluate the factors for building trustworthy systems, we propose a novel and well-annotated sentiment analysis dataset to evaluate robustness and interpretability. To evaluate these factors, our dataset contains diverse annotations about the challenging distribution of instances, manual adversarial instances and sentiment explanations. Several evaluation metrics are further proposed for interpretability and robustness. Based on the dataset and metrics, we conduct comprehensive comparisons for the trustworthiness of three typical models, and also study the relations between accuracy, robustness and interpretability. We release this trustworthiness evaluation dataset at \url{https://github/xyz} and hope our work can facilitate the progress on building more trustworthy systems for real-world applications."
Using GAN-based models to sentimental analysis on imbalanced datasets in education domain,"While the whole world is still struggling with the COVID-19 pandemic, online learning and home office become more common. Many schools transfer their courses teaching to the online classroom. Therefore, it is significant to mine the students' feedback and opinions from their reviews towards studies so that both schools and teachers can know where they need to improve. This paper trains machine learning and deep learning models using both balanced and imbalanced datasets for sentiment classification. Two SOTA category-aware text generation GAN models: CatGAN and SentiGAN, are utilized to synthesize text used to balance the highly imbalanced dataset. Results on three datasets with different imbalance degree from distinct domains show that when using generated text to balance the dataset, the F1-score of machine learning and deep learning model on sentiment classification increases 2.79% ~ 9.28%. Also, the results indicate that the average growth degree for CR100k is higher than CR23k, the average growth degree for deep learning is more increased than machine learning algorithms, and the average growth degree for more complex deep learning models is more increased than simpler deep learning models in experiments."
Collation of Feasible Solutions for Domain Based Problems: An Analysis of Sentiments Based on Codeathon Activity,"Codeathon activity is a practical approach for enduring the principles of Software Engineering and Object Oriented Modelling. Real world domain problem's solution was accomplished through team work. Analysing the problem and designing a feasible solution through a one day activity was achieved through virtual connection. There are three different sections in a semester, 13 teams were framed and assigned one problem statement. Individual team were supposed to prototype a solution which was further used to build one feasible solution. The feedback from students showed different sentiments associated with day long activity. Vivid emotions and expressions of students were analysed."
Sentiment Analysis on the News to Improve Mental Health,"The popularization of the internet created a revitalized digital media. With monetization driven by clicks, journalists have reprioritized their content for the highly competitive atmosphere of online news. The resulting negativity bias is harmful and can lead to anxiety and mood disturbance. We utilized a pipeline of 4 sentiment analysis models trained on various datasets - using Sequential, LSTM, BERT, and SVM models. When combined, the application, a mobile app, solely displays uplifting and inspiring stories for users to read. Results have been successful - 1,300 users rate the app at 4.9 stars, and 85% report improved mental health by using it."
Sentiment Analysis of the COVID-related r/Depression Posts,"Reddit.com is a popular social media platform among young people. Reddit users share their stories to seek support from other users, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. Messages posted on Reddit and their content have provided researchers with opportunity to analyze public concerns. In this study, we analyzed sentiments of COVID-related messages posted on r/Depression. Our study poses the following questions: a) What are the common topics that the Reddit users discuss? b) Can we use these topics to classify sentiments of the posts? c) What matters concern people more during the pandemic?  Key Words: Sentiment Classification, Depression, COVID-19, Reddit, LDA, BERT"
Position-based Contributive Embeddings for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis,"Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), exploring sentiment polarity of aspect-given sentence, is a fine-grained task in the field of nature language processing. Previously researches typically tend to predict polarity based on the meaning of aspect and opinions. However, those approaches mainly focus on considering relations implicitly at the word level, ignore the historical impact of other positional words when the aspect appears in a certain position. Therefore, we propose a Position-based Contributive Embeddings (PosCE) to highlight the historical reference to special position aspect. Contribution of each positional words to the polarity is similar to the process of fairly distributing gains to several actors working in coalition (game theory). Therefore, we quote from the method of Shapley Value and finally gain PosCE to enhance the aspect-based representation for ABSA task. Furthermore, the PosCE can also be used for improving performances on multimodal ABSA task. Extensive experiments on both text and text-audio level using SemEval dataset show that the mainstream models advance performance in accuracy and F1 (increase 2.82% and 4.21% on average respectively) by applying our PosCE."
Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis in Document -- FOMC Meeting Minutes on Economic Projection,"The Federal Open Market Committee within the Federal Reserve System is responsible for managing inflation, maximizing employment, and stabilizing interest rates. Meeting minutes play an important role for market movements because they provide the birds eye view of how this economic complexity is constantly re-weighed. Therefore, There has been growing interest in analyzing and extracting sentiments on various aspects from large financial texts for economic projection. However, Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis is not widely used on financial data due to the lack of large labeled dataset. In this paper, I propose a model to train ABSA on financial documents under weak supervision and analyze its predictive power on various macroeconomic indicators."
Benchmarking Multi-Task Learning for Sentiment Analysis and Offensive Language Identification in Under-Resourced Dravidian Languages,"To obtain extensive annotated data for under-resourced languages is challenging, so in this research, we have investigated whether it is beneficial to train models using multi-task learning. Sentiment analysis and offensive language identification share similar discourse properties. The selection of these tasks is motivated by the lack of large labelled data for user-generated code-mixed datasets. This paper works on code-mixed YouTube comments for Tamil, Malayalam, and Kannada languages. Our framework is applicable to other sequence classification problems irrespective of the size of the datasets. Experiments show that our multi-task learning model can achieve high results compared with single-task learning while reducing the time and space constraints required to train the models on individual tasks. Analysis of fine-tuned models indicates the preference of multi-task learning over single-task learning resulting in a higher weighted F1-score on all three languages. We apply two multi-task learning approaches to three Dravidian languages: Kannada, Malayalam, and Tamil. Maximum scores on Kannada and Malayalam were achieved by mBERT subjected to cross-entropy loss and with an approach of hard parameter sharing. Best scores on Tamil was achieved by DistilBERT subjected to cross-entropy loss with soft parameter sharing as the architecture type. For the tasks of sentiment analysis and offensive language identification, the best-performing model scored a weighted F1-score of (66.8\% and 90.5\%), (59\% and 70\%), and (62.1\% and 75.3\%) for Kannada, Malayalam, and Tamil on sentiment analysis and offensive language identification, respectively. The data and approaches discussed in this paper are published in Github\footnote{\href{https://github.com/SiddhanthHegde/Dravidian-MTL-Benchmarking}{Dravidian-MTL-Benchmarking}}."
Investigating The Impacting Factors on The Public's Attitudes Towards Autonomous Vehicles Using Sentiment Analysis from Social Media Data,"The public's attitudes play a critical role in the acceptance, purchase, use, and research and development of autonomous vehicles (AVs). To date, the public's attitudes towards AVs were mostly estimated through traditional survey data with high labor costs and a low quantity of samples, which also might be one of the reasons why the influencing factors on the public's attitudes of AVs have not been studied from multiple aspects in a comprehensive way yet. To address the issue, this study aims to propose a method by using large-scale social media data to investigate key factors that affect the public's attitudes and acceptance of AVs. A total of 954,151 Twitter data related to AVs and 53 candidate independent variables from seven categories were extracted using the web scraping method. Then, sentiment analysis was used to measure the public attitudes towards AVs by calculating sentiment scores. Random forests algorithm was employed to preliminarily select candidate independent variables according to their importance, while a linear mixed model was performed to explore the impacting factors considering the unobserved heterogeneities caused by the subjectivity level of tweets. The results showed that the overall attitude of the public on AVs was slightly optimistic. Factors like ""drunk"", ""blind spot"", and ""mobility"" had the largest impacts on public attitudes. In addition, people were more likely to express positive feelings when talking about words such as ""lidar"" and ""Tesla"" that relate to high technologies. Conversely, factors such as ""COVID-19"", ""pedestrian"", ""sleepy"", and ""highway"" were found to have significantly negative effects on the public's attitudes. The findings of this study are beneficial for the development of AV technologies, the guidelines for AV-related policy formulation, and the public's understanding and acceptance of AVs."
Through the Looking Glass: Insights into Visualization Pedagogy through Sentiment Analysis of Peer Review Text,"Peer review is a widely utilized feedback mechanism for engaging students. As a pedagogical method, it has been shown to improve educational outcomes, but we have found limited empirical measurement of peer review in visualization courses. In addition to increasing engagement, peer review provides diverse feedback and reinforces recently-learned course concepts through critical evaluation of others' work. We discuss the construction and application of peer review in two visualization courses from different colleges at the University of South Florida. We then analyze student projects and peer review text via sentiment analysis to infer insights for visualization educators, including the focus of course content, engagement across student groups, student mastery of concepts, course trends over time, and expert intervention effectiveness. Finally, we provide suggestions for adapting peer review to other visualization courses to engage students and increase instructor understanding of the peer review process."
Bambara Language Dataset for Sentiment Analysis,"For easier communication, posting, or commenting on each others posts, people use their dialects. In Africa, various languages and dialects exist. However, they are still underrepresented and not fully exploited for analytical studies and research purposes. In order to perform approaches like Machine Learning and Deep Learning, datasets are required. One of the African languages is Bambara, used by citizens in different countries. However, no previous work on datasets for this language was performed for Sentiment Analysis. In this paper, we present the first common-crawl-based Bambara dialectal dataset dedicated for Sentiment Analysis, available freely for Natural Language Processing research purposes."
From Textual to Verbal Communication: Towards Applying Sentiment Analysis to a Software Project Meeting,"Sentiment analysis gets increasing attention in software engineering with new tools emerging from new insights provided by researchers. Existing use cases and tools are meant to be used for textual communication such as comments on collaborative version control systems. While this can already provide useful feedback for development teams, a lot of communication takes place in meetings and is not suited for present tool designs and concepts.  In this paper, we present a concept that is capable of processing live meeting audio and classifying transcribed statements into sentiment polarity classes. We combine the latest advances in open source speech recognition with previous research in sentiment analysis. We tested our approach on a student software project meeting to gain proof of concept, showing moderate agreement between the classifications of our tool and a human observer on the meeting audio. Despite the preliminary character of our study, we see promising results motivating future research in sentiment analysis on meetings. For example, the polarity classification can be extended to detect destructive behaviour that can endanger project success."
A Study on Herd Behavior Using Sentiment Analysis in Online Social Network,"Social media platforms are thriving nowadays, so a huge volume of data is produced. As it includes brief and clear statements, millions of people post their thoughts on microblogging sites every day. This paper represents and analyze the capacity of diverse strategies to volumetric, delicate, and social networks to predict critical opinions from online social networking sites. In the exploration of certain searching for relevant, the thoughts of people play a crucial role. Social media becomes a good outlet since the last decades to share the opinions globally. Sentiment analysis as well as opinion mining is a tool that is used to extract the opinions or thoughts of the common public. An occurrence in one place, be it economic, political, or social, may trigger large-scale chain public reaction across many other sites in an increasingly interconnected world. This study demonstrates the evaluation of sentiment analysis techniques using social media contents and creating the association between subjectivity with herd behavior and clustering coefficient as well as tries to predict the election result (2021 election in West Bengal). This is an implementation of sentiment analysis targeted at estimating the results of an upcoming election by assessing the public's opinion across social media. This paper also has a short discussion section on the usefulness of the idea in other fields."
Transformer-Encoder-GRU (T-E-GRU) for Chinese Sentiment Analysis on Chinese Comment Text,"Chinese sentiment analysis (CSA) has always been one of the challenges in natural language processing due to its complexity and uncertainty. Transformer has succeeded in capturing semantic features, but it uses position encoding to capture sequence features, which has great shortcomings compared with the recurrent model. In this paper, we propose T-E-GRU for Chinese sentiment analysis, which combine transformer encoder and GRU. We conducted experiments on three Chinese comment datasets. In view of the confusion of punctuation marks in Chinese comment texts, we selectively retain some punctuation marks with sentence segmentation ability. The experimental results show that T-E-GRU outperforms classic recurrent model and recurrent model with attention."
Bi-Bimodal Modality Fusion for Correlation-Controlled Multimodal Sentiment Analysis,"Multimodal sentiment analysis aims to extract and integrate semantic information collected from multiple modalities to recognize the expressed emotions and sentiment in multimodal data. This research area's major concern lies in developing an extraordinary fusion scheme that can extract and integrate key information from various modalities. However, one issue that may restrict previous work to achieve a higher level is the lack of proper modeling for the dynamics of the competition between the independence and relevance among modalities, which could deteriorate fusion outcomes by causing the collapse of modality-specific feature space or introducing extra noise. To mitigate this, we propose the Bi-Bimodal Fusion Network (BBFN), a novel end-to-end network that performs fusion (relevance increment) and separation (difference increment) on pairwise modality representations. The two parts are trained simultaneously such that the combat between them is simulated. The model takes two bimodal pairs as input due to the known information imbalance among modalities. In addition, we leverage a gated control mechanism in the Transformer architecture to further improve the final output. Experimental results on three datasets (CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and UR-FUNNY) verifies that our model significantly outperforms the SOTA. The implementation of this work is available at https://github.com/declare-lab/multimodal-deep-learning."
MuSe-Toolbox: The Multimodal Sentiment Analysis Continuous Annotation Fusion and Discrete Class Transformation Toolbox,"We introduce the MuSe-Toolbox - a Python-based open-source toolkit for creating a variety of continuous and discrete emotion gold standards. In a single framework, we unify a wide range of fusion methods and propose the novel Rater Aligned Annotation Weighting (RAAW), which aligns the annotations in a translation-invariant way before weighting and fusing them based on the inter-rater agreements between the annotations. Furthermore, discrete categories tend to be easier for humans to interpret than continuous signals. With this in mind, the MuSe-Toolbox provides the functionality to run exhaustive searches for meaningful class clusters in the continuous gold standards. To our knowledge, this is the first toolkit that provides a wide selection of state-of-the-art emotional gold standard methods and their transformation to discrete classes. Experimental results indicate that MuSe-Toolbox can provide promising and novel class formations which can be better predicted than hard-coded classes boundaries with minimal human intervention. The implementation (1) is out-of-the-box available with all dependencies using a Docker container (2)."
M2Lens: Visualizing and Explaining Multimodal Models for Sentiment Analysis,"Multimodal sentiment analysis aims to recognize people's attitudes from multiple communication channels such as verbal content (i.e., text), voice, and facial expressions. It has become a vibrant and important research topic in natural language processing. Much research focuses on modeling the complex intra- and inter-modal interactions between different communication channels. However, current multimodal models with strong performance are often deep-learning-based techniques and work like black boxes. It is not clear how models utilize multimodal information for sentiment predictions. Despite recent advances in techniques for enhancing the explainability of machine learning models, they often target unimodal scenarios (e.g., images, sentences), and little research has been done on explaining multimodal models. In this paper, we present an interactive visual analytics system, M2Lens, to visualize and explain multimodal models for sentiment analysis. M2Lens provides explanations on intra- and inter-modal interactions at the global, subset, and local levels. Specifically, it summarizes the influence of three typical interaction types (i.e., dominance, complement, and conflict) on the model predictions. Moreover, M2Lens identifies frequent and influential multimodal features and supports the multi-faceted exploration of model behaviors from language, acoustic, and visual modalities. Through two case studies and expert interviews, we demonstrate our system can help users gain deep insights into the multimodal models for sentiment analysis."
BERT Fine-Tuning for Sentiment Analysis on Indonesian Mobile Apps Reviews,"User reviews have an essential role in the success of the developed mobile apps. User reviews in the textual form are unstructured data, creating a very high complexity when processed for sentiment analysis. Previous approaches that have been used often ignore the context of reviews. In addition, the relatively small data makes the model overfitting. A new approach, BERT, has been introduced as a transfer learning model with a pre-trained model that has previously been trained to have a better context representation. This study examines the effectiveness of fine-tuning BERT for sentiment analysis using two different pre-trained models. Besides the multilingual pre-trained model, we use the pre-trained model that only has been trained in Indonesian. The dataset used is Indonesian user reviews of the ten best apps in 2020 in Google Play sites. We also perform hyper-parameter tuning to find the optimum trained model. Two training data labeling approaches were also tested to determine the effectiveness of the model, which is score-based and lexicon-based. The experimental results show that pre-trained models trained in Indonesian have better average accuracy on lexicon-based data. The pre-trained Indonesian model highest accuracy is 84%, with 25 epochs and a training time of 24 minutes. These results are better than all of the machine learning and multilingual pre-trained models."
Tales of a City: Sentiment Analysis of Urban Green Space in Dublin,"Social media services such as TripAdvisor and Foursquare can provide opportunities for users to exchange their opinions about urban green space (UGS). Visitors can exchange their experiences with parks, woods, and wetlands in social communities via social networks. In this work, we implement a unified topic modeling approach to reveal UGS characteristics. Leveraging Artificial Intelligence techniques for opinion mining using the mentioned platforms (e.g., TripAdvisor and Foursquare) reviews is a novel application to UGS quality assessments. We show how specific characteristics of different green spaces can be explored by using a tailor-optimized sentiment analysis model. Such an application can support local authorities and stakeholders in understanding--and justification for--future urban green space investments."
Identifying negativity factors from social media text corpus using sentiment analysis method,"Automatic sentiment analysis play vital role in decision making. Many organizations spend a lot of budget to understand their customer satisfaction by manually going over their feedback/comments or tweets. Automatic sentiment analysis can give overall picture of the comments received against any event, product, or activity. Usually, the comments/tweets are classified into two main classes that are negative or positive. However, the negative comments are too abstract to understand the basic reason or the context. organizations are interested to identify the exact reason for the negativity. In this research study, we hierarchically goes down into negative comments, and link them with more classes. Tweets are extracted from social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook. If the sentiment analysis classifies any tweet into negative class, then we further try to associates that negative comments with more possible negative classes. Based on expert opinions, the negative comments/tweets are further classified into 8 classes. Different machine learning algorithms are evaluated and their accuracy are reported."
Domain Adaptation for Sentiment Analysis Using Increased Intraclass Separation,"Sentiment analysis is a costly yet necessary task for enterprises to study the opinions of their customers to improve their products and to determine optimal marketing strategies. Due to the existence of a wide range of domains across different products and services, cross-domain sentiment analysis methods have received significant attention. These methods mitigate the domain gap between different applications by training cross-domain generalizable classifiers which help to relax the need for data annotation for each domain. Most existing methods focus on learning domain-agnostic representations that are invariant with respect to both the source and the target domains. As a result, a classifier that is trained using the source domain annotated data would generalize well in a related target domain. We introduce a new domain adaptation method which induces large margins between different classes in an embedding space. This embedding space is trained to be domain-agnostic by matching the data distributions across the domains. Large intraclass margins in the source domain help to reduce the effect of ""domain shift"" on the classifier performance in the target domain. Theoretical and empirical analysis are provided to demonstrate that the proposed method is effective."
Text mining and sentiment analysis of COVID-19 tweets,"The human severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2), causing the COVID-19 disease, has continued to spread all over the world. It menacingly affects not only public health and global economics but also mental health and mood. While the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been widely studied, relatively fewer discussions about the sentimental reaction of the population have been available. In this article, we scrape COVID-19 related tweets on the microblogging platform, Twitter, and examine the tweets from Feb~24, 2020 to Oct~14, 2020 in four Canadian cities (Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, and Calgary) and four U.S. cities (New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Seattle). Applying the Vader and NRC approaches, we evaluate the sentiment intensity scores and visualize the information over different periods of the pandemic. Sentiment scores for the tweets concerning three anti-epidemic measures, masks, vaccine, and lockdown, are computed for comparisons. The results of four Canadian cities are compared with four cities in the United States. We study the causal relationships between the infected cases, the tweet activities, and the sentiment scores of COVID-19 related tweets, by integrating the echo state network method with convergent cross-mapping. Our analysis shows that public sentiments regarding COVID-19 vary in different time periods and locations. In general, people have a positive mood about COVID-19 and masks, but negative in the topics of vaccine and lockdown. The causal inference shows that the sentiment influences people's activities on Twitter, which is also correlated to the daily number of infections."
Exploring the Efficacy of Automatically Generated Counterfactuals for Sentiment Analysis,"While state-of-the-art NLP models have been achieving the excellent performance of a wide range of tasks in recent years, important questions are being raised about their robustness and their underlying sensitivity to systematic biases that may exist in their training and test data. Such issues come to be manifest in performance problems when faced with out-of-distribution data in the field. One recent solution has been to use counterfactually augmented datasets in order to reduce any reliance on spurious patterns that may exist in the original data. Producing high-quality augmented data can be costly and time-consuming as it usually needs to involve human feedback and crowdsourcing efforts. In this work, we propose an alternative by describing and evaluating an approach to automatically generating counterfactual data for data augmentation and explanation. A comprehensive evaluation on several different datasets and using a variety of state-of-the-art benchmarks demonstrate how our approach can achieve significant improvements in model performance when compared to models training on the original data and even when compared to models trained with the benefit of human-generated augmented data."
Transfer-based adaptive tree for multimodal sentiment analysis based on user latent aspects,"Multimodal sentiment analysis benefits various applications such as human-computer interaction and recommendation systems. It aims to infer the users' bipolar ideas using visual, textual, and acoustic signals. Although researchers affirm the association between cognitive cues and emotional manifestations, most of the current multimodal approaches in sentiment analysis disregard user-specific aspects. To tackle this issue, we devise a novel method to perform multimodal sentiment prediction using cognitive cues, such as personality. Our framework constructs an adaptive tree by hierarchically dividing users and trains the LSTM-based submodels, utilizing an attention-based fusion to transfer cognitive-oriented knowledge within the tree. Subsequently, the framework consumes the conclusive agglomerative knowledge from the adaptive tree to predict final sentiments. We also devise a dynamic dropout method to facilitate data sharing between neighboring nodes, reducing data sparsity. The empirical results on real-world datasets determine that our proposed model for sentiment prediction can surpass trending rivals. Moreover, compared to other ensemble approaches, the proposed transfer-based algorithm can better utilize the latent cognitive cues and foster the prediction outcomes. Based on the given extrinsic and intrinsic analysis results, we note that compared to other theoretical-based techniques, the proposed hierarchical clustering approach can better group the users within the adaptive tree."
Deep Multi-Task Model for Sarcasm Detection and Sentiment Analysis in Arabic Language,"The prominence of figurative language devices, such as sarcasm and irony, poses serious challenges for Arabic Sentiment Analysis (SA). While previous research works tackle SA and sarcasm detection separately, this paper introduces an end-to-end deep Multi-Task Learning (MTL) model, allowing knowledge interaction between the two tasks. Our MTL model's architecture consists of a Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT) model, a multi-task attention interaction module, and two task classifiers. The overall obtained results show that our proposed model outperforms its single-task counterparts on both SA and sarcasm detection sub-tasks."
Sequential Late Fusion Technique for Multi-modal Sentiment Analysis,"Multi-modal sentiment analysis plays an important role for providing better interactive experiences to users. Each modality in multi-modal data can provide different viewpoints or reveal unique aspects of a user's emotional state. In this work, we use text, audio and visual modalities from MOSI dataset and we propose a novel fusion technique using a multi-head attention LSTM network. Finally, we perform a classification task and evaluate its performance."
Out of Context: A New Clue for Context Modeling of Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis,"Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims to predict the sentiment expressed in a review with respect to a given aspect. The core of ABSA is to model the interaction between the context and given aspect to extract the aspect-related information. In prior work, attention mechanisms and dependency graph networks are commonly adopted to capture the relations between the context and given aspect. And the weighted sum of context hidden states is used as the final representation fed to the classifier. However, the information related to the given aspect may be already discarded and adverse information may be retained in the context modeling processes of existing models. This problem cannot be solved by subsequent modules and there are two reasons: first, their operations are conducted on the encoder-generated context hidden states, whose value cannot change after the encoder; second, existing encoders only consider the context while not the given aspect. To address this problem, we argue the given aspect should be considered as a new clue out of context in the context modeling process. As for solutions, we design several aspect-aware context encoders based on different backbones: an aspect-aware LSTM and three aspect-aware BERTs. They are dedicated to generate aspect-aware hidden states which are tailored for ABSA task. In these aspect-aware context encoders, the semantics of the given aspect is used to regulate the information flow. Consequently, the aspect-related information can be retained and aspect-irrelevant information can be excluded in the generated hidden states. We conduct extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets with empirical analysis, demonstrating the efficacies and advantages of our proposed aspect-aware context encoders."
Towards Financial Sentiment Analysis in a South African Landscape,"Sentiment analysis as a sub-field of natural language processing has received increased attention in the past decade enabling organisations to more effectively manage their reputation through online media monitoring. Many drivers impact reputation, however, this thesis focuses only the aspect of financial performance and explores the gap with regards to financial sentiment analysis in a South African context. Results showed that pre-trained sentiment analysers are least effective for this task and that traditional lexicon-based and machine learning approaches are best suited to predict financial sentiment of news articles. The evaluated methods produced accuracies of 84\%-94\%. The predicted sentiments correlated quite well with share price and highlighted the potential use of sentiment as an indicator of financial performance. A main contribution of the study was updating an existing sentiment dictionary for financial sentiment analysis. Model generalisation was less acceptable due to the limited amount of training data used. Future work includes expanding the data set to improve general usability and contribute to an open-source financial sentiment analyser for South African data."
pysentimiento: A Python Toolkit for Sentiment Analysis and SocialNLP tasks,"Extracting opinions from texts has gathered a lot of interest in the last years, as we are experiencing an unprecedented volume of user-generated content in social networks and other places. A problem that social researchers find in using opinion mining tools is that they are usually behind commercial APIs and unavailable for other languages than English. To address these issues, we present pysentimiento, a multilingual Python toolkit for Sentiment Analysis and other Social NLP tasks. This open-source library brings state-of-the-art models for Spanish and English in a black-box fashion, allowing researchers to easily access these techniques."
DravidianCodeMix: Sentiment Analysis and Offensive Language Identification Dataset for Dravidian Languages in Code-Mixed Text,"This paper describes the development of a multilingual, manually annotated dataset for three under-resourced Dravidian languages generated from social media comments. The dataset was annotated for sentiment analysis and offensive language identification for a total of more than 60,000 YouTube comments. The dataset consists of around 44,000 comments in Tamil-English, around 7,000 comments in Kannada-English, and around 20,000 comments in Malayalam-English. The data was manually annotated by volunteer annotators and has a high inter-annotator agreement in Krippendorff's alpha. The dataset contains all types of code-mixing phenomena since it comprises user-generated content from a multilingual country. We also present baseline experiments to establish benchmarks on the dataset using machine learning methods. The dataset is available on Github (https://github.com/bharathichezhiyan/DravidianCodeMix-Dataset) and Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/record/4750858\#.YJtw0SYo\_0M)."
A Fair and Comprehensive Comparison of Multimodal Tweet Sentiment Analysis Methods,"Opinion and sentiment analysis is a vital task to characterize subjective information in social media posts. In this paper, we present a comprehensive experimental evaluation and comparison with six state-of-the-art methods, from which we have re-implemented one of them. In addition, we investigate different textual and visual feature embeddings that cover different aspects of the content, as well as the recently introduced multimodal CLIP embeddings. Experimental results are presented for two different publicly available benchmark datasets of tweets and corresponding images. In contrast to the evaluation methodology of previous work, we introduce a reproducible and fair evaluation scheme to make results comparable. Finally, we conduct an error analysis to outline the limitations of the methods and possibilities for the future work."
Sentiment Analysis of Covid-19 Tweets using Evolutionary Classification-Based LSTM Model,"As the Covid-19 outbreaks rapidly all over the world day by day and also affects the lives of million, a number of countries declared complete lock-down to check its intensity. During this lockdown period, social media plat-forms have played an important role to spread information about this pandemic across the world, as people used to express their feelings through the social networks. Considering this catastrophic situation, we developed an experimental approach to analyze the reactions of people on Twitter taking into ac-count the popular words either directly or indirectly based on this pandemic. This paper represents the sentiment analysis on collected large number of tweets on Coronavirus or Covid-19. At first, we analyze the trend of public sentiment on the topics related to Covid-19 epidemic using an evolutionary classification followed by the n-gram analysis. Then we calculated the sentiment ratings on collected tweet based on their class. Finally, we trained the long-short term network using two types of rated tweets to predict sentiment on Covid-19 data and obtained an overall accuracy of 84.46%."
Study of sampling methods in sentiment analysis of imbalanced data,"This work investigates the application of sampling methods for sentiment analysis on two different highly imbalanced datasets. One dataset contains online user reviews from the cooking platform Epicurious and the other contains comments given to the Planned Parenthood organization. In both these datasets, the classes of interest are rare. Word n-grams were used as features from these datasets. A feature selection technique based on information gain is first applied to reduce the number of features to a manageable space. A number of different sampling methods were then applied to mitigate the class imbalance problem which are then analyzed."
Leveraging Pre-trained Language Model for Speech Sentiment Analysis,"In this paper, we explore the use of pre-trained language models to learn sentiment information of written texts for speech sentiment analysis. First, we investigate how useful a pre-trained language model would be in a 2-step pipeline approach employing Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and transcripts-based sentiment analysis separately. Second, we propose a pseudo label-based semi-supervised training strategy using a language model on an end-to-end speech sentiment approach to take advantage of a large, but unlabeled speech dataset for training. Although spoken and written texts have different linguistic characteristics, they can complement each other in understanding sentiment. Therefore, the proposed system can not only model acoustic characteristics to bear sentiment-specific information in speech signals, but learn latent information to carry sentiments in the text representation. In these experiments, we demonstrate the proposed approaches improve F1 scores consistently compared to systems without a language model. Moreover, we also show that the proposed framework can reduce 65% of human supervision by leveraging a large amount of data without human sentiment annotation and boost performance in a low-resource condition where the human sentiment annotation is not available enough."
DravidianMultiModality: A Dataset for Multi-modal Sentiment Analysis in Tamil and Malayalam,"Human communication is inherently multimodal and asynchronous. Analyzing human emotions and sentiment is an emerging field of artificial intelligence. We are witnessing an increasing amount of multimodal content in local languages on social media about products and other topics. However, there are not many multimodal resources available for under-resourced Dravidian languages. Our study aims to create a multimodal sentiment analysis dataset for the under-resourced Tamil and Malayalam languages. First, we downloaded product or movies review videos from YouTube for Tamil and Malayalam. Next, we created captions for the videos with the help of annotators. Then we labelled the videos for sentiment, and verified the inter-annotator agreement using Fleiss's Kappa. This is the first multimodal sentiment analysis dataset for Tamil and Malayalam by volunteer annotators."
A Unified Generative Framework for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis,"Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) aims to identify the aspect terms, their corresponding sentiment polarities, and the opinion terms. There exist seven subtasks in ABSA. Most studies only focus on the subsets of these subtasks, which leads to various complicated ABSA models while hard to solve these subtasks in a unified framework. In this paper, we redefine every subtask target as a sequence mixed by pointer indexes and sentiment class indexes, which converts all ABSA subtasks into a unified generative formulation. Based on the unified formulation, we exploit the pre-training sequence-to-sequence model BART to solve all ABSA subtasks in an end-to-end framework. Extensive experiments on four ABSA datasets for seven subtasks demonstrate that our framework achieves substantial performance gain and provides a real unified end-to-end solution for the whole ABSA subtasks, which could benefit multiple tasks."
Insight from NLP Analysis: COVID-19 Vaccines Sentiments on Social Media,"Social media is an appropriate source for analyzing public attitudes towards the COVID-19 vaccine and various brands. Nevertheless, there are few relevant studies. In the research, we collected tweet posts by the UK and US residents from the Twitter API during the pandemic and designed experiments to answer three main questions concerning vaccination. To get the dominant sentiment of the civics, we performed sentiment analysis by VADER and proposed a new method that can count the individual's influence. This allows us to go a step further in sentiment analysis and explain some of the fluctuations in the data changing. The results indicated that celebrities could lead the opinion shift on social media in vaccination progress. Moreover, at the peak, nearly 40\% of the population in both countries have a negative attitude towards COVID-19 vaccines. Besides, we investigated how people's opinions toward different vaccine brands are. We found that the Pfizer vaccine enjoys the most popular among people. By applying the sentiment analysis tool, we discovered most people hold positive views toward the COVID-19 vaccine manufactured by most brands. In the end, we carried out topic modelling by using the LDA model. We found residents in the two countries are willing to share their views and feelings concerning the vaccine. Several death cases have occurred after vaccination. Due to these negative events, US residents are more worried about the side effects and safety of the vaccine."
Deep Context- and Relation-Aware Learning for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis,"Existing works for aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) have adopted a unified approach, which allows the interactive relations among subtasks. However, we observe that these methods tend to predict polarities based on the literal meaning of aspect and opinion terms and mainly consider relations implicitly among subtasks at the word level. In addition, identifying multiple aspect-opinion pairs with their polarities is much more challenging. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of contextual information w.r.t. the aspect and opinion are further required in ABSA. In this paper, we propose Deep Contextualized Relation-Aware Network (DCRAN), which allows interactive relations among subtasks with deep contextual information based on two modules (i.e., Aspect and Opinion Propagation and Explicit Self-Supervised Strategies). Especially, we design novel self-supervised strategies for ABSA, which have strengths in dealing with multiple aspects. Experimental results show that DCRAN significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by large margins on three widely used benchmarks."
BERT-Based Sentiment Analysis: A Software Engineering Perspective,"Sentiment analysis can provide a suitable lead for the tools used in software engineering along with the API recommendation systems and relevant libraries to be used. In this context, the existing tools like SentiCR, SentiStrength-SE, etc. exhibited low f1-scores that completely defeats the purpose of deployment of such strategies, thereby there is enough scope for performance improvement. Recent advancements show that transformer based pre-trained models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa, ALBERT, etc.) have displayed better results in the text classification task. Following this context, the present research explores different BERT-based models to analyze the sentences in GitHub comments, Jira comments, and Stack Overflow posts. The paper presents three different strategies to analyse BERT based model for sentiment analysis, where in the first strategy the BERT based pre-trained models are fine-tuned; in the second strategy an ensemble model is developed from BERT variants, and in the third strategy a compressed model (Distil BERT) is used. The experimental results show that the BERT based ensemble approach and the compressed BERT model attain improvements by 6-12% over prevailing tools for the F1 measure on all three datasets."
A Case Study of Spanish Text Transformations for Twitter Sentiment Analysis,"Sentiment analysis is a text mining task that determines the polarity of a given text, i.e., its positiveness or negativeness. Recently, it has received a lot of attention given the interest in opinion mining in micro-blogging platforms. These new forms of textual expressions present new challenges to analyze text given the use of slang, orthographic and grammatical errors, among others. Along with these challenges, a practical sentiment classifier should be able to handle efficiently large workloads.  The aim of this research is to identify which text transformations (lemmatization, stemming, entity removal, among others), tokenizers (e.g., words n-grams), and tokens weighting schemes impact the most the accuracy of a classifier (Support Vector Machine) trained on two Spanish corpus. The methodology used is to exhaustively analyze all the combinations of the text transformations and their respective parameters to find out which characteristics the best performing classifiers have in common. Furthermore, among the different text transformations studied, we introduce a novel approach based on the combination of word based n-grams and character based q-grams. The results show that this novel combination of words and characters produces a classifier that outperforms the traditional word based combination by 11.17\% and 5.62\% on the INEGI and TASS'15 dataset, respectively."
T-BERT -- Model for Sentiment Analysis of Micro-blogs Integrating Topic Model and BERT,"Sentiment analysis (SA) has become an extensive research area in recent years impacting diverse fields including ecommerce, consumer business, and politics, driven by increasing adoption and usage of social media platforms. It is challenging to extract topics and sentiments from unsupervised short texts emerging in such contexts, as they may contain figurative words, strident data, and co-existence of many possible meanings for a single word or phrase, all contributing to obtaining incorrect topics. Most prior research is based on a specific theme/rhetoric/focused-content on a clean dataset. In the work reported here, the effectiveness of BERT(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) in sentiment classification tasks from a raw live dataset taken from a popular microblogging platform is demonstrated. A novel T-BERT framework is proposed to show the enhanced performance obtainable by combining latent topics with contextual BERT embeddings. Numerical experiments were conducted on an ensemble with about 42000 datasets using NimbleBox.ai platform with a hardware configuration consisting of Nvidia Tesla K80(CUDA), 4 core CPU, 15GB RAM running on an isolated Google Cloud Platform instance. The empirical results show that the model improves in performance while adding topics to BERT and an accuracy rate of 90.81% on sentiment classification using BERT with the proposed approach."
When and Why does a Model Fail? A Human-in-the-loop Error Detection Framework for Sentiment Analysis,"Although deep neural networks have been widely employed and proven effective in sentiment analysis tasks, it remains challenging for model developers to assess their models for erroneous predictions that might exist prior to deployment. Once deployed, emergent errors can be hard to identify in prediction run-time and impossible to trace back to their sources. To address such gaps, in this paper we propose an error detection framework for sentiment analysis based on explainable features. We perform global-level feature validation with human-in-the-loop assessment, followed by an integration of global and local-level feature contribution analysis. Experimental results show that, given limited human-in-the-loop intervention, our method is able to identify erroneous model predictions on unseen data with high precision."
Highlight Timestamp Detection Model for Comedy Videos via Multimodal Sentiment Analysis,"Nowadays, the videos on the Internet are prevailing. The precise and in-depth understanding of the videos is a difficult but valuable problem for both platforms and researchers. The existing video understand models do well in object recognition tasks but currently still cannot understand the abstract and contextual features like highlight humor frames in comedy videos. The current industrial works are also mainly focused on the basic category classification task based on the appearances of objects. The feature detection methods for the abstract category remains blank. A data structure that includes the information of video frames, audio spectrum and texts provide a new direction to explore. The multimodal models are proposed to make this in-depth video understanding mission possible. In this paper, we analyze the difficulties in abstract understanding of videos and propose a multimodal structure to obtain state-of-the-art performance in this field. Then we select several benchmarks for multimodal video understanding and apply the most suitable model to find the best performance. At last, we evaluate the overall spotlights and drawbacks of the models and methods in this paper and point out the possible directions for further improvements."
SA2SL: From Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis to Social Listening System for Business Intelligence,"In this paper, we present a process of building a social listening system based on aspect-based sentiment analysis in Vietnamese from creating a dataset to building a real application. Firstly, we create UIT-ViSFD, a Vietnamese Smartphone Feedback Dataset as a new benchmark corpus built based on a strict annotation schemes for evaluating aspect-based sentiment analysis, consisting of 11,122 human-annotated comments for mobile e-commerce, which is freely available for research purposes. We also present a proposed approach based on the Bi-LSTM architecture with the fastText word embeddings for the Vietnamese aspect based sentiment task. Our experiments show that our approach achieves the best performances with the F1-score of 84.48% for the aspect task and 63.06% for the sentiment task, which performs several conventional machine learning and deep learning systems. Last but not least, we build SA2SL, a social listening system based on the best performance model on our dataset, which will inspire more social listening systems in future."
Structured Sentiment Analysis as Dependency Graph Parsing,"Structured sentiment analysis attempts to extract full opinion tuples from a text, but over time this task has been subdivided into smaller and smaller sub-tasks, e,g,, target extraction or targeted polarity classification. We argue that this division has become counterproductive and propose a new unified framework to remedy the situation. We cast the structured sentiment problem as dependency graph parsing, where the nodes are spans of sentiment holders, targets and expressions, and the arcs are the relations between them. We perform experiments on five datasets in four languages (English, Norwegian, Basque, and Catalan) and show that this approach leads to strong improvements over state-of-the-art baselines. Our analysis shows that refining the sentiment graphs with syntactic dependency information further improves results."
Sentiment analysis in tweets: an assessment study from classical to modern text representation models,"With the growth of social medias, such as Twitter, plenty of user-generated data emerge daily. The short texts published on Twitter -- the tweets -- have earned significant attention as a rich source of information to guide many decision-making processes. However, their inherent characteristics, such as the informal, and noisy linguistic style, remain challenging to many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including sentiment analysis. Sentiment classification is tackled mainly by machine learning-based classifiers. The literature has adopted word representations from distinct natures to transform tweets to vector-based inputs to feed sentiment classifiers. The representations come from simple count-based methods, such as bag-of-words, to more sophisticated ones, such as BERTweet, built upon the trendy BERT architecture. Nevertheless, most studies mainly focus on evaluating those models using only a small number of datasets. Despite the progress made in recent years in language modelling, there is still a gap regarding a robust evaluation of induced embeddings applied to sentiment analysis on tweets. Furthermore, while fine-tuning the model from downstream tasks is prominent nowadays, less attention has been given to adjustments based on the specific linguistic style of the data. In this context, this study fulfils an assessment of existing language models in distinguishing the sentiment expressed in tweets by using a rich collection of 22 datasets from distinct domains and five classification algorithms. The evaluation includes static and contextualized representations. Contexts are assembled from Transformer-based autoencoder models that are also fine-tuned based on the masked language model task, using a plethora of strategies."
SGPT: Semantic Graphs based Pre-training for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis,"Previous studies show effective of pre-trained language models for sentiment analysis. However, most of these studies ignore the importance of sentimental information for pre-trained models.Therefore, we fully investigate the sentimental information for pre-trained models and enhance pre-trained language models with semantic graphs for sentiment analysis.In particular, we introduce Semantic Graphs based Pre-training(SGPT) using semantic graphs to obtain synonym knowledge for aspect-sentiment pairs and similar aspect/sentiment terms.We then optimize the pre-trained language model with the semantic graphs.Empirical studies on several downstream tasks show that proposed model outperforms strong pre-trained baselines. The results also show the effectiveness of proposed semantic graphs for pre-trained model."
Unsupervised Sentiment Analysis by Transferring Multi-source Knowledge,"Sentiment analysis (SA) is an important research area in cognitive computation-thus in-depth studies of patterns of sentiment analysis are necessary. At present, rich resource data-based SA has been well developed, while the more challenging and practical multi-source unsupervised SA (i.e. a target domain SA by transferring from multiple source domains) is seldom studied. The challenges behind this problem mainly locate in the lack of supervision information, the semantic gaps among domains (i.e., domain shifts), and the loss of knowledge. However, existing methods either lack the distinguishable capacity of the semantic gaps among domains or lose private knowledge. To alleviate these problems, we propose a two-stage domain adaptation framework. In the first stage, a multi-task methodology-based shared-private architecture is employed to explicitly model the domain common features and the domain-specific features for the labeled source domains. In the second stage, two elaborate mechanisms are embedded in the shared private architecture to transfer knowledge from multiple source domains. The first mechanism is a selective domain adaptation (SDA) method, which transfers knowledge from the closest source domain. And the second mechanism is a target-oriented ensemble (TOE) method, in which knowledge is transferred through a well-designed ensemble method. Extensive experiment evaluations verify that the performance of the proposed framework outperforms unsupervised state-of-the-art competitors. What can be concluded from the experiments is that transferring from very different distributed source domains may degrade the target-domain performance, and it is crucial to choose the proper source domains to transfer from."
Identifying Biased Users in Online Social Networks to Enhance the Accuracy of Sentiment Analysis: A User Behavior-Based Approach,"The development of an automatic way to extract user opinions about products, movies, and foods from online social network (OSN) interactions is among the main interests of sentiment analysis and opinion mining studies. Existing approaches in the sentiment analysis domain mostly do not discriminate the sentences of different types of users, even though some users are always negative and some are always positive. Thus, finding a way to identify these two types of user is significant because their attitudes can change the analysis of user reviews of businesses and products. Due to the complexity of natural language processing, pure text mining methods may lead to misunderstandings about the exact nature of the sentiments expressed in review text. In this study, we propose a neural network classifier to predict the presence of biased users on the basis of users' psychological behaviors. The identification of the psychological behaviors of users allows us to find overly positive and overly negative users and to categorize these users' attitudes regardless of the content of their review texts. The experiment result indicates that the biased users can be predicted based on user behavior at an accuracy rate of 89%, 67% and 81% for three different datasets."
On the logistical difficulties and findings of Jopara Sentiment Analysis,"This paper addresses the problem of sentiment analysis for Jopara, a code-switching language between Guarani and Spanish. We first collect a corpus of Guarani-dominant tweets and discuss on the difficulties of finding quality data for even relatively easy-to-annotate tasks, such as sentiment analysis. Then, we train a set of neural models, including pre-trained language models, and explore whether they perform better than traditional machine learning ones in this low-resource setup. Transformer architectures obtain the best results, despite not considering Guarani during pre-training, but traditional machine learning models perform close due to the low-resource nature of the problem."
Development and Application of Sentiment Analysis Tools in Software Engineering: A Systematic Literature Review,"Software development is a collaborative task and, hence, involves different persons. Research has shown the relevance of social aspects in the development team for a successful and satisfying project closure. Especially the mood of a team has been proven to be of particular importance. Thus, project managers or project leaders want to be aware of situations in which negative mood is present to allow for interventions. So-called sentiment analysis tools offer a way to determine the mood based on text-based communication. In this paper, we present the results of a systematic literature review of sentiment analysis tools developed for or applied in the context of software engineering. Our results summarize insights from 80 papers with respect to (1) the application domain, (2) the purpose, (3) the used data sets, (4) the approaches for developing sentiment analysis tools and (5) the difficulties researchers face when applying sentiment analysis in the context of software projects. According to our results, sentiment analysis is frequently applied to open-source software projects, and most tools are based on support-vector machines. Despite the frequent use of sentiment analysis in software engineering, there are open issues, e.g., regarding the identification of irony or sarcasm, pointing to future research directions."
"A Survey on sentiment analysis in Persian: A Comprehensive System Perspective Covering Challenges and Advances in Resources, and Methods","Social media has been remarkably grown during the past few years. Nowadays, posting messages on social media websites has become one of the most popular Internet activities. The vast amount of user-generated content has made social media the most extensive data source of public opinion. Sentiment analysis is one of the techniques used to analyze user-generated data. The Persian language has specific features and thereby requires unique methods and models to be adopted for sentiment analysis, which are different from those in English language. Sentiment analysis in each language has specified prerequisites; hence, the direct use of methods, tools, and resources developed for English language in Persian has its limitations. The main target of this paper is to provide a comprehensive literature survey for state-of-the-art advances in Persian sentiment analysis. In this regard, the present study aims to investigate and compare the previous sentiment analysis studies on Persian texts and describe contributions presented in articles published in the last decade. First, the levels, approaches, and tasks for sentiment analysis are described. Then, a detailed survey of the sentiment analysis methods used for Persian texts is presented, and previous relevant works on Persian Language are discussed. Moreover, we present in this survey the authentic and published standard sentiment analysis resources and advances that have been done for Persian sentiment analysis. Finally, according to the state-of-the-art development of English sentiment analysis, some issues and challenges not being addressed in Persian texts are listed, and some guidelines and trends are provided for future research on Persian texts. The paper provides information to help new or established researchers in the field as well as industry developers who aim to deploy an operational complete sentiment analysis system."
Whether the Health Care Practices For the Patients With Comorbidities Have Changed After the Outbreak of COVID-19; Big Data Public Sentiment Analysis,"After the pandemic of SARS-CoV-2, it has influenced the health care practices around the world. Initial investigations indicate that patients with comorbidities are more fragile to this SARS-CoV-2 infection. They suggested postponing the routine treatment of cancer patients. However, few meta-analyses suggested evidences are not sufficient to hold the claim of the frailty of cancer patients to COVID-19, and they are not in favour of shelving the scheduled procedures. There are recent studies in which medical professionals, according to their competence, are referring to change the routine practices on how to manage the applicable therapeutic resources judiciously to combat this vital infection. This is a different study that reveals the cancer patients' viewpoint about how health care practices have been changed in their opinion during this pandemic year? Are they satisfied with their treatment or not? To serve the purpose, we gathered more than 60000 relevant tweets from Twitter to analyse the sentiment of cancer patients around the world. Our findings demonstrate that there is a surge in argument about cancer and its treatment after the outbreak of COVID-19. Most of the tweets are reasonable (52.6%) compared to the negative ones (24.3). We developed polarity and subjectivity distribution to better recognise the positivity/negativity in the sentiment. Results reveal that the polarity range of positive tweets is within the range of 0 to 0.5. Which means the tendency in the tweets is not so much positive but surely not negative. It is a piece of modest statistical evidence in support of how natural language processing (NLP) can be accepted to better understand the patient's behaviour in real-time, and it may facilitate the medical professional to make better decision to organise the routine management of cancer patients."
XLM-T: Multilingual Language Models in Twitter for Sentiment Analysis and Beyond,"Language models are ubiquitous in current NLP, and their multilingual capacity has recently attracted considerable attention. However, current analyses have almost exclusively focused on (multilingual variants of) standard benchmarks, and have relied on clean pre-training and task-specific corpora as multilingual signals. In this paper, we introduce XLM-T, a model to train and evaluate multilingual language models in Twitter. In this paper we provide: (1) a new strong multilingual baseline consisting of an XLM-R (Conneau et al. 2020) model pre-trained on millions of tweets in over thirty languages, alongside starter code to subsequently fine-tune on a target task; and (2) a set of unified sentiment analysis Twitter datasets in eight different languages and a XLM-T model fine-tuned on them."
Interventional Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis,"Recent neural-based aspect-based sentiment analysis approaches, though achieving promising improvement on benchmark datasets, have reported suffering from poor robustness when encountering confounder such as non-target aspects. In this paper, we take a causal view to addressing this issue. We propose a simple yet effective method, namely, Sentiment Adjustment (SENTA), by applying a backdoor adjustment to disentangle those confounding factors. Experimental results on the Aspect Robustness Test Set (ARTS) dataset demonstrate that our approach improves the performance while maintaining accuracy in the original test set."
COVID-19 sentiment analysis via deep learning during the rise of novel cases,"Social scientists and psychologists take interest in understanding how people express emotions and sentiments when dealing with catastrophic events such as natural disasters, political unrest, and terrorism. The COVID-19 pandemic is a catastrophic event that has raised a number of psychological issues such as depression given abrupt social changes and lack of employment. Advancements of deep learning-based language models have been promising for sentiment analysis with data from social networks such as Twitter. Given the situation with COVID-19 pandemic, different countries had different peaks where the rise and fall of new cases affected lock-downs which directly affected the economy and employment. During the rise of COVID-19 cases with stricter lock-downs, people have been expressing their sentiments in social media. This can provide a deep understanding of human psychology during catastrophic events. In this paper, we present a framework that employs deep learning-based language models via long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks for sentiment analysis during the rise of novel COVID-19 cases in India. The framework features LSTM language model with a global vector embedding and state-of-art BERT language model. We review the sentiments expressed for selective months in 2020 which covers the first major peak of novel cases in India. Our framework utilises multi-label sentiment classification where more than one sentiment can be expressed at once. Our results indicate that the majority of the tweets have been positive with high levels of optimism during the rise of the novel COVID-19 cases and the number of tweets significantly lowered towards the peak. The predictions generally indicate that although the majority have been optimistic, a significant group of population has been annoyed towards the way the pandemic was handled by the authorities."
User Behavior Discovery in the COVID-19 Era through the Sentiment Analysis of User Tweet Texts,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak was declared a pandemic in March 2020 and since then it has had a significant effect on all aspects of life. Although we live in an information era, we do not have accurate information about this disease. Online social networks (OSNs) play a vital role in society, especially people who do not have trust in the government would tend to have more confidence in the evidence that is formed by social networks. The advantages of OSNs in the COVID-19 era are clear. For instance, social media enables people to connect with each other without the need for real-world face-to-face social interaction. Social media networks also act as a collective intelligence in the absence of world leadership. Therefore, in this study, considering the phenomenon of information diffusion in OSNs, we focus on the effects of COVID-19 on user sentiment and show the user behavior trend during the early months of the pandemic through mining and analyzing OSN data. Moreover, we propose a data-driven model to demonstrate how user sentiment changes over a period of time and how OSNs help us to obtain information on user behavior that is very important for the accurate prediction of future behavior. For this purpose, this study uses tweet texts about COVID-19 and the related network structure to extract significant features, and then presents a model attempting to provide a more comprehensive real picture of current and future conditions."
Variational Weakly Supervised Sentiment Analysis with Posterior Regularization,"Sentiment analysis is an important task in natural language processing (NLP). Most of existing state-of-the-art methods are under the supervised learning paradigm. However, human annotations can be scarce. Thus, we should leverage more weak supervision for sentiment analysis. In this paper, we propose a posterior regularization framework for the variational approach to the weakly supervised sentiment analysis to better control the posterior distribution of the label assignment. The intuition behind the posterior regularization is that if extracted opinion words from two documents are semantically similar, the posterior distributions of two documents should be similar. Our experimental results show that the posterior regularization can improve the original variational approach to the weakly supervised sentiment analysis and the performance is more stable with smaller prediction variance."
"The MuSe 2021 Multimodal Sentiment Analysis Challenge: Sentiment, Emotion, Physiological-Emotion, and Stress","Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MuSe) 2021 is a challenge focusing on the tasks of sentiment and emotion, as well as physiological-emotion and emotion-based stress recognition through more comprehensively integrating the audio-visual, language, and biological signal modalities. The purpose of MuSe 2021 is to bring together communities from different disciplines; mainly, the audio-visual emotion recognition community (signal-based), the sentiment analysis community (symbol-based), and the health informatics community. We present four distinct sub-challenges: MuSe-Wilder and MuSe-Stress which focus on continuous emotion (valence and arousal) prediction; MuSe-Sent, in which participants recognise five classes each for valence and arousal; and MuSe-Physio, in which the novel aspect of `physiological-emotion' is to be predicted. For this years' challenge, we utilise the MuSe-CaR dataset focusing on user-generated reviews and introduce the Ulm-TSST dataset, which displays people in stressful depositions. This paper also provides detail on the state-of-the-art feature sets extracted from these datasets for utilisation by our baseline model, a Long Short-Term Memory-Recurrent Neural Network. For each sub-challenge, a competitive baseline for participants is set; namely, on test, we report a Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) of .4616 CCC for MuSe-Wilder; .4717 CCC for MuSe-Stress, and .4606 CCC for MuSe-Physio. For MuSe-Sent an F1 score of 32.82 % is obtained."
MeToo Tweets Sentiment Analysis Using Multi Modal frameworks,"In this paper, We present our approach for IEEEBigMM 2020, Grand Challenge (BMGC), Identifying senti-ments from tweets related to the MeToo movement. The modelis based on an ensemble of Convolutional Neural Network,Bidirectional LSTM and a DNN for final classification. Thispaper is aimed at providing a detailed analysis of the modeland the results obtained. We have ranked 5th out of 10 teamswith a score of 0.51491"
Does syntax matter? A strong baseline for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis with RoBERTa,"Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA), aiming at predicting the polarities for aspects, is a fine-grained task in the field of sentiment analysis. Previous work showed syntactic information, e.g. dependency trees, can effectively improve the ABSA performance. Recently, pre-trained models (PTMs) also have shown their effectiveness on ABSA. Therefore, the question naturally arises whether PTMs contain sufficient syntactic information for ABSA so that we can obtain a good ABSA model only based on PTMs. In this paper, we firstly compare the induced trees from PTMs and the dependency parsing trees on several popular models for the ABSA task, showing that the induced tree from fine-tuned RoBERTa (FT-RoBERTa) outperforms the parser-provided tree. The further analysis experiments reveal that the FT-RoBERTa Induced Tree is more sentiment-word-oriented and could benefit the ABSA task. The experiments also show that the pure RoBERTa-based model can outperform or approximate to the previous SOTA performances on six datasets across four languages since it implicitly incorporates the task-oriented syntactic information."
Drug Recommendation System based on Sentiment Analysis of Drug Reviews using Machine Learning,"Since coronavirus has shown up, inaccessibility of legitimate clinical resources is at its peak, like the shortage of specialists, healthcare workers, lack of proper equipment and medicines. The entire medical fraternity is in distress, which results in numerous individuals demise. Due to unavailability, people started taking medication independently without appropriate consultation, making the health condition worse than usual. As of late, machine learning has been valuable in numerous applications, and there is an increase in innovative work for automation. This paper intends to present a drug recommender system that can drastically reduce specialists heap. In this research, we build a medicine recommendation system that uses patient reviews to predict the sentiment using various vectorization processes like Bow, TFIDF, Word2Vec, and Manual Feature Analysis, which can help recommend the top drug for a given disease by different classification algorithms. The predicted sentiments were evaluated by precision, recall, f1score, accuracy, and AUC score. The results show that classifier LinearSVC using TFIDF vectorization outperforms all other models with 93% accuracy."
Data Augmentation in a Hybrid Approach for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis,"Data augmentation is a way to increase the diversity of available data by applying constrained transformations on the original data. This strategy has been widely used in image classification but has to the best of our knowledge not yet been used in aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA). ABSA is a text analysis technique that determines aspects and their associated sentiment in opinionated text. In this paper, we investigate the effect of data augmentation on a state-of-the-art hybrid approach for aspect-based sentiment analysis (HAABSA). We apply modified versions of easy data augmentation (EDA), backtranslation, and word mixup. We evaluate the proposed techniques on the SemEval 2015 and SemEval 2016 datasets. The best result is obtained with the adjusted version of EDA, which yields a 0.5 percentage point improvement on the SemEval 2016 dataset and 1 percentage point increase on the SemEval 2015 dataset compared to the original HAABSA model."
TOUR: Dynamic Topic and Sentiment Analysis of User Reviews for Assisting App Release,"App reviews deliver user opinions and emerging issues (e.g., new bugs) about the app releases. Due to the dynamic nature of app reviews, topics and sentiment of the reviews would change along with app release versions. Although several studies have focused on summarizing user opinions by analyzing user sentiment towards app features, no practical tool is released. The large quantity of reviews and noise words also necessitates an automated tool for monitoring user reviews. In this paper, we introduce TOUR for dynamic TOpic and sentiment analysis of User Reviews. TOUR is able to (i) detect and summarize emerging app issues over app versions, (ii) identify user sentiment towards app features, and (iii) prioritize important user reviews for facilitating developers' examination. The core techniques of TOUR include the online topic modeling approach and sentiment prediction strategy. TOUR provides entries for developers to customize the hyper-parameters and the results are presented in an interactive way. We evaluate TOUR by conducting a developer survey that involves 15 developers, and all of them confirm the practical usefulness of the recommended feature changes by TOUR."
LSTM Based Sentiment Analysis for Cryptocurrency Prediction,"Recent studies in big data analytics and natural language processing develop automatic techniques in analyzing sentiment in the social media information. In addition, the growing user base of social media and the high volume of posts also provide valuable sentiment information to predict the price fluctuation of the cryptocurrency. This research is directed to predicting the volatile price movement of cryptocurrency by analyzing the sentiment in social media and finding the correlation between them. While previous work has been developed to analyze sentiment in English social media posts, we propose a method to identify the sentiment of the Chinese social media posts from the most popular Chinese social media platform Sina-Weibo. We develop the pipeline to capture Weibo posts, describe the creation of the crypto-specific sentiment dictionary, and propose a long short-term memory (LSTM) based recurrent neural network along with the historical cryptocurrency price movement to predict the price trend for future time frames. The conducted experiments demonstrate the proposed approach outperforms the state of the art auto regressive based model by 18.5% in precision and 15.4% in recall."
Unsupervised Self-Training for Sentiment Analysis of Code-Switched Data,"Sentiment analysis is an important task in understanding social media content like customer reviews, Twitter and Facebook feeds etc. In multilingual communities around the world, a large amount of social media text is characterized by the presence of Code-Switching. Thus, it has become important to build models that can handle code-switched data. However, annotated code-switched data is scarce and there is a need for unsupervised models and algorithms. We propose a general framework called Unsupervised Self-Training and show its applications for the specific use case of sentiment analysis of code-switched data. We use the power of pre-trained BERT models for initialization and fine-tune them in an unsupervised manner, only using pseudo labels produced by zero-shot transfer. We test our algorithm on multiple code-switched languages and provide a detailed analysis of the learning dynamics of the algorithm with the aim of answering the question - `Does our unsupervised model understand the Code-Switched languages or does it just learn its representations?'. Our unsupervised models compete well with their supervised counterparts, with their performance reaching within 1-7\% (weighted F1 scores) when compared to supervised models trained for a two class problem."
Impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on Italy's country reputation and stock market performance: a sentiment analysis approach,"During the recent Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, the microblogging service Twitter has been widely used to share opinions and reactions to events. Italy was one of the first European countries to be severely affected by the outbreak and to establish lockdown and stay-at-home orders, potentially leading to country reputation damage. We resort to sentiment analysis to investigate changes in opinions about Italy reported on Twitter before and after the COVID-19 outbreak. Using different lexicons-based methods, we find a breakpoint corresponding to the date of the first established case of COVID-19 in Italy that causes a relevant change in sentiment scores used as proxy of the country reputation. Next, we demonstrate that sentiment scores about Italy are strongly associated with the levels of the FTSE-MIB index, the Italian Stock Exchange main index, as they serve as early detection signals of changes in the values of FTSE-MIB. Finally, we make a content-based classification of tweets into positive and negative and use two machine learning classifiers to validate the assigned polarity of tweets posted before and after the outbreak."
Exploiting the Unique Expression for Improved Sentiment Analysis in Software Engineering Text,"Sentiment analysis on software engineering (SE) texts has been widely used in the SE research, such as evaluating app reviews or analyzing developers sentiments in commit messages. To better support the use of automated sentiment analysis for SE tasks, researchers built an SE-domain-specified sentiment dictionary to further improve the accuracy of the results. Unfortunately, recent work reported that current mainstream tools for sentiment analysis still cannot provide reliable results when analyzing the sentiments in SE texts. We suggest that the reason for this situation is because the way of expressing sentiments in SE texts is largely different from the way in social network or movie comments. In this paper, we propose to improve sentiment analysis in SE texts by using sentence structures, a different perspective from building a domain dictionary. Specifically, we use sentence structures to first identify whether the author is expressing her sentiment in a given clause of an SE text, and to further adjust the calculation of sentiments which are confirmed in the clause. An empirical evaluation based on four different datasets shows that our approach can outperform two dictionary-based baseline approaches, and is more generalizable compared to a learning-based baseline approach."
A New Approach To Text Rating Classification Using Sentiment Analysis,"Typical use cases of sentiment analysis usually revolve around assessing the probability of a text belonging to a certain sentiment and deriving insight concerning it; little work has been done to explore further use cases derived using those probabilities in the context of rating. In this paper, we redefine the sentiment proportion values as building blocks for a triangle structure, allowing us to derive variables for a new formula for classifying text given in the form of product reviews into a group of higher and a group of lower ratings and prove a dependence exists between the sentiments and the ratings."
L3CubeMahaSent: A Marathi Tweet-based Sentiment Analysis Dataset,"Sentiment analysis is one of the most fundamental tasks in Natural Language Processing. Popular languages like English, Arabic, Russian, Mandarin, and also Indian languages such as Hindi, Bengali, Tamil have seen a significant amount of work in this area. However, the Marathi language which is the third most popular language in India still lags behind due to the absence of proper datasets. In this paper, we present the first major publicly available Marathi Sentiment Analysis Dataset - L3CubeMahaSent. It is curated using tweets extracted from various Maharashtrian personalities' Twitter accounts. Our dataset consists of ~16,000 distinct tweets classified in three broad classes viz. positive, negative, and neutral. We also present the guidelines using which we annotated the tweets. Finally, we present the statistics of our dataset and baseline classification results using CNN, LSTM, ULMFiT, and BERT-based deep learning models."
Quantum-inspired Multimodal Fusion for Video Sentiment Analysis,"We tackle the crucial challenge of fusing different modalities of features for multimodal sentiment analysis. Mainly based on neural networks, existing approaches largely model multimodal interactions in an implicit and hard-to-understand manner. We address this limitation with inspirations from quantum theory, which contains principled methods for modeling complicated interactions and correlations. In our quantum-inspired framework, the word interaction within a single modality and the interaction across modalities are formulated with superposition and entanglement respectively at different stages. The complex-valued neural network implementation of the framework achieves comparable results to state-of-the-art systems on two benchmarking video sentiment analysis datasets. In the meantime, we produce the unimodal and bimodal sentiment directly from the model to interpret the entangled decision."
Sentiment Analysis for Troll Detection on Weibo,"The impact of social media on the modern world is difficult to overstate. Virtually all companies and public figures have social media accounts on popular platforms such as Twitter and Facebook. In China, the micro-blogging service provider, Sina Weibo, is the most popular such service. To influence public opinion, Weibo trolls -- the so called Water Army -- can be hired to post deceptive comments. In this paper, we focus on troll detection via sentiment analysis and other user activity data on the Sina Weibo platform. We implement techniques for Chinese sentence segmentation, word embedding, and sentiment score calculation. In recent years, troll detection and sentiment analysis have been studied, but we are not aware of previous research that considers troll detection based on sentiment analysis. We employ the resulting techniques to develop and test a sentiment analysis approach for troll detection, based on a variety of machine learning strategies. Experimental results are generated and analyzed. A Chrome extension is presented that implements our proposed technique, which enables real-time troll detection when a user browses Sina Weibo."
ASAP: A Chinese Review Dataset Towards Aspect Category Sentiment Analysis and Rating Prediction,"Sentiment analysis has attracted increasing attention in e-commerce. The sentiment polarities underlying user reviews are of great value for business intelligence. Aspect category sentiment analysis (ACSA) and review rating prediction (RP) are two essential tasks to detect the fine-to-coarse sentiment polarities. %Considering the sentiment of the aspects(ACSA) and the overall review rating(RP) simultaneously has the potential to improve the overall performance. ACSA and RP are highly correlated and usually employed jointly in real-world e-commerce scenarios. While most public datasets are constructed for ACSA and RP separately, which may limit the further exploitation of both tasks. To address the problem and advance related researches, we present a large-scale Chinese restaurant review dataset \textbf{ASAP} including 46,730 genuine reviews from a leading online-to-offline (O2O) e-commerce platform in China. Besides a 5-star scale rating, each review is manually annotated according to its sentiment polarities towards 18 pre-defined aspect categories. We hope the release of the dataset could shed some light on the fields of sentiment analysis. Moreover, we propose an intuitive yet effective joint model for ACSA and RP. Experimental results demonstrate that the joint model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both tasks."
Fine-tuning Pretrained Multilingual BERT Model for Indonesian Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis,"Although previous research on Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) for Indonesian reviews in hotel domain has been conducted using CNN and XGBoost, its model did not generalize well in test data and high number of OOV words contributed to misclassification cases. Nowadays, most state-of-the-art results for wide array of NLP tasks are achieved by utilizing pretrained language representation. In this paper, we intend to incorporate one of the foremost language representation model, BERT, to perform ABSA in Indonesian reviews dataset. By combining multilingual BERT (m-BERT) with task transformation method, we manage to achieve significant improvement by 8% on the F1-score compared to the result from our previous study."
Enhanced Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis Models with Progressive Self-supervised Attention Learning,"In aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), many neural models are equipped with an attention mechanism to quantify the contribution of each context word to sentiment prediction. However, such a mechanism suffers from one drawback: only a few frequent words with sentiment polarities are tended to be taken into consideration for final sentiment decision while abundant infrequent sentiment words are ignored by models. To deal with this issue, we propose a progressive self-supervised attention learning approach for attentional ABSA models. In this approach, we iteratively perform sentiment prediction on all training instances, and continually learn useful attention supervision information in the meantime. During training, at each iteration, context words with the highest impact on sentiment prediction, identified based on their attention weights or gradients, are extracted as words with active/misleading influence on the correct/incorrect prediction for each instance. Words extracted in this way are masked for subsequent iterations. To exploit these extracted words for refining ABSA models, we augment the conventional training objective with a regularization term that encourages ABSA models to not only take full advantage of the extracted active context words but also decrease the weights of those misleading words. We integrate the proposed approach into three state-of-the-art neural ABSA models. Experiment results and in-depth analyses show that our approach yields better attention results and significantly enhances the performance of all three models. We release the source code and trained models at https://github.com/DeepLearnXMU/PSSAttention."
A Novel Context-Aware Multimodal Framework for Persian Sentiment Analysis,"Most recent works on sentiment analysis have exploited the text modality. However, millions of hours of video recordings posted on social media platforms everyday hold vital unstructured information that can be exploited to more effectively gauge public perception. Multimodal sentiment analysis offers an innovative solution to computationally understand and harvest sentiments from videos by contextually exploiting audio, visual and textual cues. In this paper, we, firstly, present a first of its kind Persian multimodal dataset comprising more than 800 utterances, as a benchmark resource for researchers to evaluate multimodal sentiment analysis approaches in Persian language. Secondly, we present a novel context-aware multimodal sentiment analysis framework, that simultaneously exploits acoustic, visual and textual cues to more accurately determine the expressed sentiment. We employ both decision-level (late) and feature-level (early) fusion methods to integrate affective cross-modal information. Experimental results demonstrate that the contextual integration of multimodal features such as textual, acoustic and visual features deliver better performance (91.39%) compared to unimodal features (89.24%)."
Video Sentiment Analysis with Bimodal Information-augmented Multi-Head Attention,"Humans express feelings or emotions via different channels. Take language as an example, it entails different sentiments under different visual-acoustic contexts. To precisely understand human intentions as well as reduce the misunderstandings caused by ambiguity and sarcasm, we should consider multimodal signals including textual, visual and acoustic signals. The crucial challenge is to fuse different modalities of features for sentiment analysis. To effectively fuse the information carried by different modalities and better predict the sentiments, we design a novel multi-head attention based fusion network, which is inspired by the observations that the interactions between any two pair-wise modalities are different and they do not equally contribute to the final sentiment prediction. By assigning the acoustic-visual, acoustic-textual and visual-textual features with reasonable attention and exploiting a residual structure, we attend to attain the significant features. We conduct extensive experiments on four public multimodal datasets including one in Chinese and three in English. The results show that our approach outperforms the existing methods and can explain the contributions of bimodal interaction in multiple modalities."
EmoWrite: A Sentiment Analysis-Based Thought to Text Conversion,"Brain Computer Interface (BCI) helps in processing and extraction of useful information from the acquired brain signals having applications in diverse fields such as military, medicine, neuroscience, and rehabilitation. BCI has been used to support paralytic patients having speech impediments with severe disabilities. To help paralytic patients communicate with ease, BCI based systems convert silent speech (thoughts) to text. However, these systems have an inconvenient graphical user interface, high latency, limited typing speed, and low accuracy rate. Apart from these limitations, the existing systems do not incorporate the inevitable factor of a patient's emotional states and sentiment analysis. The proposed system EmoWrite implements a dynamic keyboard with contextualized appearance of characters reducing the traversal time and improving the utilization of the screen space. The proposed system has been evaluated and compared with the existing systems for accuracy, convenience, sentimental analysis, and typing speed. This system results in 6.58 Words Per Minute (WPM) and 31.92 Characters Per Minute (CPM) with an accuracy of 90.36 percent. EmoWrite also gives remarkable results when it comes to the integration of emotional states. Its Information Transfer Rate (ITR) is also high as compared to other systems i.e., 87.55 bits per min with commands and 72.52 bits per min for letters. Furthermore, it provides easy to use interface with a latency of 2.685 sec."
Sentiment Analysis of Users' Reviews on COVID-19 Contact Tracing Apps with a Benchmark Dataset,"Contact tracing has been globally adopted in the fight to control the infection rate of COVID-19. Thanks to digital technologies, such as smartphones and wearable devices, contacts of COVID-19 patients can be easily traced and informed about their potential exposure to the virus. To this aim, several interesting mobile applications have been developed. However, there are ever-growing concerns over the working mechanism and performance of these applications. The literature already provides some interesting exploratory studies on the community's response to the applications by analyzing information from different sources, such as news and users' reviews of the applications. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no existing solution that automatically analyzes users' reviews and extracts the evoked sentiments. In this work, we propose a pipeline starting from manual annotation via a crowd-sourcing study and concluding on the development and training of AI models for automatic sentiment analysis of users' reviews. In total, we employ eight different methods achieving up to an average F1-Scores 94.8% indicating the feasibility of automatic sentiment analysis of users' reviews on the COVID-19 contact tracing applications. We also highlight the key advantages, drawbacks, and users' concerns over the applications. Moreover, we also collect and annotate a large-scale dataset composed of 34,534 reviews manually annotated from the contract tracing applications of 46 distinct countries. The presented analysis and the dataset are expected to provide a baseline/benchmark for future research in the domain."
Sentiment Analysis of Persian-English Code-mixed Texts,"The rapid production of data on the internet and the need to understand how users are feeling from a business and research perspective has prompted the creation of numerous automatic monolingual sentiment detection systems. More recently however, due to the unstructured nature of data on social media, we are observing more instances of multilingual and code-mixed texts. This development in content type has created a new demand for code-mixed sentiment analysis systems. In this study we collect, label and thus create a dataset of Persian-English code-mixed tweets. We then proceed to introduce a model which uses BERT pretrained embeddings as well as translation models to automatically learn the polarity scores of these Tweets. Our model outperforms the baseline models that use Naïve Bayes and Random Forest methods."
Sentiment Analysis of Code-Mixed Social Media Text (Hinglish),"This paper discusses the results obtained for different techniques applied for performing the sentiment analysis of social media (Twitter) code-mixed text written in Hinglish. The various stages involved in performing the sentiment analysis were data consolidation, data cleaning, data transformation and modelling. Various data cleaning techniques were applied, data was cleaned in five iterations and the results of experiments conducted were noted after each iteration. Data was transformed using count vectorizer, one hot vectorizer, tf-idf vectorizer, doc2vec, word2vec and fasttext embeddings. The models were created using various machine learning algorithms such as SVM, KNN, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and ensemble voting classifiers. The data was obtained from a task on Codalab competition website which was listed as Task:9 on the Semeval-2020 competition website. The models created were evaluated using the F1-score (macro). The best F1-score of 69.07 was achieved using ensemble voting classifier."
A Novel Deep Learning Method for Textual Sentiment Analysis,"Sentiment analysis is known as one of the most crucial tasks in the field of natural language processing and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is one of those prominent models that is commonly used for this aim. Although convolutional neural networks have obtained remarkable results in recent years, they are still confronted with some limitations. Firstly, they consider that all words in a sentence have equal contributions in the sentence meaning representation and are not able to extract informative words. Secondly, they require a large number of training data to obtain considerable results while they have many parameters that must be accurately adjusted. To this end, a convolutional neural network integrated with a hierarchical attention layer is proposed which is able to extract informative words and assign them higher weight. Moreover, the effect of transfer learning that transfers knowledge learned in the source domain to the target domain with the aim of improving the performance is also explored. Based on the empirical results, the proposed model not only has higher classification accuracy and can extract informative words but also applying incremental transfer learning can significantly enhance the classification performance."
IFoodCloud: A Platform for Real-time Sentiment Analysis of Public Opinion about Food Safety in China,"The Internet contains a wealth of public opinion on food safety, including views on food adulteration, food-borne diseases, agricultural pollution, irregular food distribution, and food production issues. In order to systematically collect and analyse public opinion on food safety, we developed IFoodCloud, a platform for the real-time sentiment analysis of public opinion on food safety in China. It collects data from more than 3,100 public sources that can be used to explore public opinion trends, public sentiment, and regional attention differences of food safety incidents. At the same time, we constructed a sentiment classification model using multiple lexicon-based and deep learning-based algorithms integrated with IFoodCloud that provide an unprecedented rapid means of understanding the public sentiment toward specific food safety incidents. Our best model's F1-score achieved 0.9737. Further, three real-world cases are presented to demonstrate the application and robustness. IFoodCloud could be considered a valuable tool for promote scientisation of food safety supervision and risk communication."
Sentiment Analysis for YouTube Comments in Roman Urdu,"Sentiment analysis is a vast area in the Machine learning domain. A lot of work is done on datasets and their analysis of the English Language. In Pakistan, a huge amount of data is in roman Urdu language, it is scattered all over the social sites including Twitter, YouTube, Facebook and similar applications. In this study the focus domain of dataset gathering is YouTube comments. The Dataset contains the comments of people over different Pakistani dramas and TV shows. The Dataset contains multi-class classification that is grouped The comments into positive, negative and neutral sentiment. In this Study comparative analysis is done for five supervised learning Algorithms including linear regression, SVM, KNN, Multi layer Perceptron and Naïve Bayes classifier. Accuracy, recall, precision and F-measure are used for measuring performance. Results show that accuracy of SVM is 64 percent, which is better than the rest of the list."
"Analyzing Curriculum Learning for Sentiment Analysis along Task Difficulty, Pacing and Visualization Axes","While Curriculum Learning (CL) has recently gained traction in Natural language Processing Tasks, it is still not adequately analyzed. Previous works only show their effectiveness but fail short to explain and interpret the internal workings fully. In this paper, we analyze curriculum learning in sentiment analysis along multiple axes. Some of these axes have been proposed by earlier works that need more in-depth study. Such analysis requires understanding where curriculum learning works and where it does not. Our axes of analysis include Task difficulty on CL, comparing CL pacing techniques, and qualitative analysis by visualizing the movement of attention scores in the model as curriculum phases progress. We find that curriculum learning works best for difficult tasks and may even lead to a decrement in performance for tasks with higher performance without curriculum learning. We see that One-Pass curriculum strategies suffer from catastrophic forgetting and attention movement visualization within curriculum pacing. This shows that curriculum learning breaks down the challenging main task into easier sub-tasks solved sequentially."
An AutoML-based Approach to Multimodal Image Sentiment Analysis,"Sentiment analysis is a research topic focused on analysing data to extract information related to the sentiment that it causes. Applications of sentiment analysis are wide, ranging from recommendation systems, and marketing to customer satisfaction. Recent approaches evaluate textual content using Machine Learning techniques that are trained over large corpora. However, as social media grown, other data types emerged in large quantities, such as images. Sentiment analysis in images has shown to be a valuable complement to textual data since it enables the inference of the underlying message polarity by creating context and connections. Multimodal sentiment analysis approaches intend to leverage information of both textual and image content to perform an evaluation. Despite recent advances, current solutions still flounder in combining both image and textual information to classify social media data, mainly due to subjectivity, inter-class homogeneity and fusion data differences. In this paper, we propose a method that combines both textual and image individual sentiment analysis into a final fused classification based on AutoML, that performs a random search to find the best model. Our method achieved state-of-the-art performance in the B-T4SA dataset, with 95.19% accuracy."
Student sentiment Analysis Using Classification With Feature Extraction Techniques,"Technical growths have empowered, numerous revolutions in the educational system by acquainting with technology into the classroom and by elevating the learning experience. Nowadays Web-based learning is getting much popularity. This paper describes the web-based learning and their effectiveness towards students. One of the prime factors in education or learning system is feedback; it is beneficial to learning if it must be used effectively. In this paper, we worked on how machine learning techniques like Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT) can be applied over Web-based learning, emphasis given on sentiment present in the feedback students. We also work on two types of Feature Extraction Technique (FETs) namely Count Vector (CVr) or Bag of Words) (BoW) and Term Frequency and Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) Vector. In the research study, it is our goal for our proposed LR, SVM, NB, and DT models to classify the presence of Student Feedback Dataset (SFB) with improved accuracy with cleaned dataset and feature extraction techniques. The SFB is one of the significant concerns among the student sentimental analysis."
Learning Modality-Specific Representations with Self-Supervised Multi-Task Learning for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis,"Representation Learning is a significant and challenging task in multimodal learning. Effective modality representations should contain two parts of characteristics: the consistency and the difference. Due to the unified multimodal annotation, existing methods are restricted in capturing differentiated information. However, additional uni-modal annotations are high time- and labor-cost. In this paper, we design a label generation module based on the self-supervised learning strategy to acquire independent unimodal supervisions. Then, joint training the multi-modal and uni-modal tasks to learn the consistency and difference, respectively. Moreover, during the training stage, we design a weight-adjustment strategy to balance the learning progress among different subtasks. That is to guide the subtasks to focus on samples with a larger difference between modality supervisions. Last, we conduct extensive experiments on three public multimodal baseline datasets. The experimental results validate the reliability and stability of auto-generated unimodal supervisions. On MOSI and MOSEI datasets, our method surpasses the current state-of-the-art methods. On the SIMS dataset, our method achieves comparable performance than human-annotated unimodal labels. The full codes are available at https://github.com/thuiar/Self-MM."
BiasFinder: Metamorphic Test Generation to Uncover Bias for Sentiment Analysis Systems,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) software systems, such as Sentiment Analysis (SA) systems, typically learn from large amounts of data that may reflect human biases. Consequently, the machine learning model in such software systems may exhibit unintended demographic bias based on specific characteristics (e.g., gender, occupation, country-of-origin, etc.). Such biases manifest in an SA system when it predicts a different sentiment for similar texts that differ only in the characteristic of individuals described. Existing studies on revealing bias in SA systems rely on the production of sentences from a small set of short, predefined templates.  To address this limitation, we present BisaFinder, an approach to discover biased predictions in SA systems via metamorphic testing. A key feature of BisaFinder is the automatic curation of suitable templates based on the pieces of text from a large corpus, using various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to identify words that describe demographic characteristics. Next, BisaFinder instantiates new text from these templates by filling in placeholders with words associated with a class of a characteristic (e.g., gender-specific words such as female names, ""she"", ""her""). These texts are used to tease out bias in an SA system. BisaFinder identifies a bias-uncovering test case when it detects that the SA system exhibits demographic bias for a pair of texts, i.e., it predicts a different sentiment for texts that differ only in words associated with a different class (e.g., male vs. female) of a target characteristic (e.g., gender). Our empirical evaluation showed that BiasFinder can effectively create a larger number of fluent and diverse test cases that uncover various biases in an SA system."
"Machine Translation, Sentiment Analysis, Text Similarity, Topic Modelling, and Tweets: Understanding Social Media Usage Among Police and Gendarmerie Organizations","It is well known that social media has revolutionized communication. Nowadays, citizens, companies, and public institutions actively use social media in order to express themselves better to the population they address. This active use is also carried out by the gendarmerie and police organizations to communicate with the public with the purpose of improving social relations. However, it has been seen that the posts by the gendarmerie and police organizations did not attract much attention from their target audience from time to time, and it has been discovered that there was not enough research in the literature on this issue. In this study, it was aimed to investigate the use of social media by the gendarmerie and police organizations operating in Turkey (Jandarma - Polis), Italy (Carabinieri - Polizia), France (Gendarmerie - Police) and Spain (Guardia Civil - Policía), and the extent to which they can be effective on the followers, by comparatively examining their activity on twitter. According to the obtained results, it was found that Jandarma (Turkey) has the highest power of influence in the twitter sample, and the findings were comparatively presented in the study."
Arabic aspect based sentiment analysis using bidirectional GRU based models,"Aspect-based Sentiment analysis (ABSA) accomplishes a fine-grained analysis that defines the aspects of a given document or sentence and the sentiments conveyed regarding each aspect. This level of analysis is the most detailed version that is capable of exploring the nuanced viewpoints of the reviews. The bulk of study in ABSA focuses on English with very little work available in Arabic. Most previous work in Arabic has been based on regular methods of machine learning that mainly depends on a group of rare resources and tools for analyzing and processing Arabic content such as lexicons, but the lack of those resources presents another challenge. In order to address these challenges, Deep Learning (DL)-based methods are proposed using two models based on Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) neural networks for ABSA. The first is a DL model that takes advantage of word and character representations by combining bidirectional GRU, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Conditional Random Field (CRF) making up the (BGRU-CNN-CRF) model to extract the main opinionated aspects (OTE). The second is an interactive attention network based on bidirectional GRU (IAN-BGRU) to identify sentiment polarity toward extracted aspects. We evaluated our models using the benchmarked Arabic hotel reviews dataset. The results indicate that the proposed methods are better than baseline research on both tasks having 39.7% enhancement in F1-score for opinion target extraction (T2) and 7.58% in accuracy for aspect-based sentiment polarity classification (T3). Achieving F1 score of 70.67% for T2, and accuracy of 83.98% for T3."
"Reproducibility, Replicability and Beyond: Assessing Production Readiness of Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis in the Wild","With the exponential growth of online marketplaces and user-generated content therein, aspect-based sentiment analysis has become more important than ever. In this work, we critically review a representative sample of the models published during the past six years through the lens of a practitioner, with an eye towards deployment in production. First, our rigorous empirical evaluation reveals poor reproducibility: an average 4-5% drop in test accuracy across the sample. Second, to further bolster our confidence in empirical evaluation, we report experiments on two challenging data slices, and observe a consistent 12-55% drop in accuracy. Third, we study the possibility of transfer across domains and observe that as little as 10-25% of the domain-specific training dataset, when used in conjunction with datasets from other domains within the same locale, largely closes the gap between complete cross-domain and complete in-domain predictive performance. Lastly, we open-source two large-scale annotated review corpora from a large e-commerce portal in India in order to aid the study of replicability and transfer, with the hope that it will fuel further growth of the field."
CMSAOne@Dravidian-CodeMix-FIRE2020: A Meta Embedding and Transformer model for Code-Mixed Sentiment Analysis on Social Media Text,"Code-mixing(CM) is a frequently observed phenomenon that uses multiple languages in an utterance or sentence. CM is mostly practiced on various social media platforms and in informal conversations. Sentiment analysis (SA) is a fundamental step in NLP and is well studied in the monolingual text. Code-mixing adds a challenge to sentiment analysis due to its non-standard representations. This paper proposes a meta embedding with a transformer method for sentiment analysis on the Dravidian code-mixed dataset. In our method, we used meta embeddings to capture rich text representations. We used the proposed method for the Task: ""Sentiment Analysis for Dravidian Languages in Code-Mixed Text"", and it achieved an F1 score of 0.58 and 0.66 for the given Dravidian code mixed data sets. The code is provided in the Github https://github.com/suman101112/fire-2020-Dravidian-CodeMix."
Comparison of Machine Learning for Sentiment Analysis in Detecting Anxiety Based on Social Media Data,"All groups of people felt the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This situation triggers anxiety, which is bad for everyone. The government's role is very influential in solving these problems with its work program. It also has many pros and cons that cause public anxiety. For that, it is necessary to detect anxiety to improve government programs that can increase public expectations. This study applies machine learning to detecting anxiety based on social media comments regarding government programs to deal with this pandemic. This concept will adopt a sentiment analysis in detecting anxiety based on positive and negative comments from netizens. The machine learning methods implemented include K-NN, Bernoulli, Decision Tree Classifier, Support Vector Classifier, Random Forest, and XG-boost. The data sample used is the result of crawling YouTube comments. The data used amounted to 4862 comments consisting of negative and positive data with 3211 and 1651. Negative data identify anxiety, while positive data identifies hope (not anxious). Machine learning is processed based on feature extraction of count-vectorization and TF-IDF. The results showed that the sentiment data amounted to 3889 and 973 in testing, and training with the greatest accuracy was the random forest with feature extraction of vectorization count and TF-IDF of 84.99% and 82.63%, respectively. The best precision test is K-NN, while the best recall is XG-Boost. Thus, Random Forest is the best accurate to detect someone's anxiety based-on data from social media."
"The Multimodal Sentiment Analysis in Car Reviews (MuSe-CaR) Dataset: Collection, Insights and Improvements","Truly real-life data presents a strong, but exciting challenge for sentiment and emotion research. The high variety of possible `in-the-wild' properties makes large datasets such as these indispensable with respect to building robust machine learning models. A sufficient quantity of data covering a deep variety in the challenges of each modality to force the exploratory analysis of the interplay of all modalities has not yet been made available in this context. In this contribution, we present MuSe-CaR, a first of its kind multimodal dataset. The data is publicly available as it recently served as the testing bed for the 1st Multimodal Sentiment Analysis Challenge, and focused on the tasks of emotion, emotion-target engagement, and trustworthiness recognition by means of comprehensively integrating the audio-visual and language modalities. Furthermore, we give a thorough overview of the dataset in terms of collection and annotation, including annotation tiers not used in this year's MuSe 2020. In addition, for one of the sub-challenges - predicting the level of trustworthiness - no participant outperformed the baseline model, and so we propose a simple, but highly efficient Multi-Head-Attention network that exceeds using multimodal fusion the baseline by around 0.2 CCC (almost 50 % improvement)."
Quantum Cognitively Motivated Decision Fusion for Video Sentiment Analysis,"Video sentiment analysis as a decision-making process is inherently complex, involving the fusion of decisions from multiple modalities and the so-caused cognitive biases. Inspired by recent advances in quantum cognition, we show that the sentiment judgment from one modality could be incompatible with the judgment from another, i.e., the order matters and they cannot be jointly measured to produce a final decision. Thus the cognitive process exhibits ""quantum-like"" biases that cannot be captured by classical probability theories. Accordingly, we propose a fundamentally new, quantum cognitively motivated fusion strategy for predicting sentiment judgments. In particular, we formulate utterances as quantum superposition states of positive and negative sentiment judgments, and uni-modal classifiers as mutually incompatible observables, on a complex-valued Hilbert space with positive-operator valued measures. Experiments on two benchmarking datasets illustrate that our model significantly outperforms various existing decision level and a range of state-of-the-art content-level fusion approaches. The results also show that the concept of incompatibility allows effective handling of all combination patterns, including those extreme cases that are wrongly predicted by all uni-modal classifiers."
MeisterMorxrc at SemEval-2020 Task 9: Fine-Tune Bert and Multitask Learning for Sentiment Analysis of Code-Mixed Tweets,"Natural language processing (NLP) has been applied to various fields including text classification and sentiment analysis. In the shared task of sentiment analysis of code-mixed tweets, which is a part of the SemEval-2020 competition~\cite{patwa2020sentimix}, we preprocess datasets by replacing emoji and deleting uncommon characters and so on, and then fine-tune the Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers(BERT) to perform the best. After exhausting top3 submissions, Our team MeisterMorxrc achieves an averaged F1 score of 0.730 in this task, and and our codalab username is MeisterMorxrc."
Effect of Word Embedding Variable Parameters on Arabic Sentiment Analysis Performance,"Social media such as Twitter, Facebook, etc. has led to a generated growing number of comments that contains users opinions. Sentiment analysis research deals with these comments to extract opinions which are positive or negative. Arabic language is a rich morphological language; thus, classical techniques of English sentiment analysis cannot be used for Arabic. Word embedding technique can be considered as one of successful methods to gaping the morphological problem of Arabic. Many works have been done for Arabic sentiment analysis based on word embedding, but there is no study focused on variable parameters. This study will discuss three parameters (Window size, Dimension of vector and Negative Sample) for Arabic sentiment analysis using DBOW and DMPV architectures. A large corpus of previous works generated to learn word representations and extract features. Four binary classifiers (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine and Naive Bayes) are used to detect sentiment. The performance of classifiers evaluated based on; Precision, Recall and F1-score."
A Joint Training Dual-MRC Framework for Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis,"Aspect based sentiment analysis (ABSA) involves three fundamental subtasks: aspect term extraction, opinion term extraction, and aspect-level sentiment classification. Early works only focused on solving one of these subtasks individually. Some recent work focused on solving a combination of two subtasks, e.g., extracting aspect terms along with sentiment polarities or extracting the aspect and opinion terms pair-wisely. More recently, the triple extraction task has been proposed, i.e., extracting the (aspect term, opinion term, sentiment polarity) triples from a sentence. However, previous approaches fail to solve all subtasks in a unified end-to-end framework. In this paper, we propose a complete solution for ABSA. We construct two machine reading comprehension (MRC) problems and solve all subtasks by joint training two BERT-MRC models with parameters sharing. We conduct experiments on these subtasks, and results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, which significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods."
Sentiment Analysis for Open Domain Conversational Agent,"The applicability of common sentiment analysis models to open domain human robot interaction is investigated within this paper. The models are used on a dataset specific to user interaction with the Alana system (a Alexa prize system) in order to determine which would be more appropriate for the task of identifying sentiment when a user interacts with a non-human driven socialbot. With the identification of a model, various improvements are attempted and detailed prior to integration into the Alana system. The study showed that a Random Forest Model with 25 trees trained on the dataset specific to user interaction with the Alana system combined with the dataset present in NLTK Vader outperforms other models. The new system (called 'Rob') matches it's output utterance sentiment with the user's utterance sentiment. This method is expected to improve user experience because it builds upon the overall sentiment detection which makes it seem that new system sympathises with user feelings. Furthermore, the results obtained from the user feedback confirms our expectation."
DynaSent: A Dynamic Benchmark for Sentiment Analysis,"We introduce DynaSent ('Dynamic Sentiment'), a new English-language benchmark task for ternary (positive/negative/neutral) sentiment analysis. DynaSent combines naturally occurring sentences with sentences created using the open-source Dynabench Platform, which facilities human-and-model-in-the-loop dataset creation. DynaSent has a total of 121,634 sentences, each validated by five crowdworkers, and its development and test splits are designed to produce chance performance for even the best models we have been able to develop; when future models solve this task, we will use them to create DynaSent version 2, continuing the dynamic evolution of this benchmark. Here, we report on the dataset creation effort, focusing on the steps we took to increase quality and reduce artifacts. We also present evidence that DynaSent's Neutral category is more coherent than the comparable category in other benchmarks, and we motivate training models from scratch for each round over successive fine-tuning."
YASO: A Targeted Sentiment Analysis Evaluation Dataset for Open-Domain Reviews,"Current TSA evaluation in a cross-domain setup is restricted to the small set of review domains available in existing datasets. Such an evaluation is limited, and may not reflect true performance on sites like Amazon or Yelp that host diverse reviews from many domains. To address this gap, we present YASO - a new TSA evaluation dataset of open-domain user reviews. YASO contains 2,215 English sentences from dozens of review domains, annotated with target terms and their sentiment. Our analysis verifies the reliability of these annotations, and explores the characteristics of the collected data. Benchmark results using five contemporary TSA systems show there is ample room for improvement on this challenging new dataset. YASO is available at https://github.com/IBM/yaso-tsa."
Multi-Aspect Sentiment Analysis with Latent Sentiment-Aspect Attribution,"In this paper, we introduce a new framework called the sentiment-aspect attribution module (SAAM). SAAM works on top of traditional neural networks and is designed to address the problem of multi-aspect sentiment classification and sentiment regression. The framework works by exploiting the correlations between sentence-level embedding features and variations of document-level aspect rating scores. We demonstrate several variations of our framework on top of CNN and RNN based models. Experiments on a hotel review dataset and a beer review dataset have shown SAAM can improve sentiment analysis performance over corresponding base models. Moreover, because of the way our framework intuitively combines sentence-level scores into document-level scores, it is able to provide a deeper insight into data (e.g., semi-supervised sentence aspect labeling). Hence, we end the paper with a detailed analysis that shows the potential of our models for other applications such as sentiment snippet extraction."
A Deep Multi-Level Attentive network for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis,"Multimodal sentiment analysis has attracted increasing attention with broad application prospects. The existing methods focuses on single modality, which fails to capture the social media content for multiple modalities. Moreover, in multi-modal learning, most of the works have focused on simply combining the two modalities, without exploring the complicated correlations between them. This resulted in dissatisfying performance for multimodal sentiment classification. Motivated by the status quo, we propose a Deep Multi-Level Attentive network, which exploits the correlation between image and text modalities to improve multimodal learning. Specifically, we generate the bi-attentive visual map along the spatial and channel dimensions to magnify CNNs representation power. Then we model the correlation between the image regions and semantics of the word by extracting the textual features related to the bi-attentive visual features by applying semantic attention. Finally, self-attention is employed to automatically fetch the sentiment-rich multimodal features for the classification. We conduct extensive evaluations on four real-world datasets, namely, MVSA-Single, MVSA-Multiple, Flickr, and Getty Images, which verifies the superiority of our method."
Sentiment analysis in Bengali via transfer learning using multi-lingual BERT,"Sentiment analysis (SA) in Bengali is challenging due to this Indo-Aryan language's highly inflected properties with more than 160 different inflected forms for verbs and 36 different forms for noun and 24 different forms for pronouns. The lack of standard labeled datasets in the Bengali domain makes the task of SA even harder. In this paper, we present manually tagged 2-class and 3-class SA datasets in Bengali. We also demonstrate that the multi-lingual BERT model with relevant extensions can be trained via the approach of transfer learning over those novel datasets to improve the state-of-the-art performance in sentiment classification tasks. This deep learning model achieves an accuracy of 71\% for 2-class sentiment classification compared to the current state-of-the-art accuracy of 68\%. We also present the very first Bengali SA classifier for the 3-class manually tagged dataset, and our proposed model achieves an accuracy of 60\%. We further use this model to analyze the sentiment of public comments in the online daily newspaper. Our analysis shows that people post negative comments for political or sports news more often, while the religious article comments represent positive sentiment. The dataset and code is publicly available at https://github.com/KhondokerIslam/Bengali\_Sentiment."
Exploiting BERT to improve aspect-based sentiment analysis performance on Persian language,"Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a more detailed task in sentiment analysis, by identifying opinion polarity toward a certain aspect in a text. This method is attracting more attention from the community, due to the fact that it provides more thorough and useful information. However, there are few language-specific researches on Persian language. The present research aims to improve the ABSA on the Persian Pars-ABSA dataset. This research shows the potential of using pre-trained BERT model and taking advantage of using sentence-pair input on an ABSA task. The results indicate that employing Pars-BERT pre-trained model along with natural language inference auxiliary sentence (NLI-M) could boost the ABSA task accuracy up to 91% which is 5.5% (absolute) higher than state-of-the-art studies on Pars-ABSA dataset."
A Sentiment Analysis Approach to the Prediction of Market Volatility,"Prediction and quantification of future volatility and returns play an important role in financial modelling, both in portfolio optimization and risk management. Natural language processing today allows to process news and social media comments to detect signals of investors' confidence. We have explored the relationship between sentiment extracted from financial news and tweets and FTSE100 movements. We investigated the strength of the correlation between sentiment measures on a given day and market volatility and returns observed the next day. The findings suggest that there is evidence of correlation between sentiment and stock market movements: the sentiment captured from news headlines could be used as a signal to predict market returns; the same does not apply for volatility. Also, in a surprising finding, for the sentiment found in Twitter comments we obtained a correlation coefficient of -0.7, and p-value below 0.05, which indicates a strong negative correlation between positive sentiment captured from the tweets on a given day and the volatility observed the next day. We developed an accurate classifier for the prediction of market volatility in response to the arrival of new information by deploying topic modelling, based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation, to extract feature vectors from a collection of tweets and financial news. The obtained features were used as additional input to the classifier. Thanks to the combination of sentiment and topic modelling our classifier achieved a directional prediction accuracy for volatility of 63%."
BAN-ABSA: An Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis dataset for Bengali and it's baseline evaluation,"Due to the breathtaking growth of social media or newspaper user comments, online product reviews comments, sentiment analysis (SA) has captured substantial interest from the researchers. With the fast increase of domain, SA work aims not only to predict the sentiment of a sentence or document but also to give the necessary detail on different aspects of the sentence or document (i.e. aspect-based sentiment analysis). A considerable number of datasets for SA and aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) have been made available for English and other well-known European languages. In this paper, we present a manually annotated Bengali dataset of high quality, BAN-ABSA, which is annotated with aspect and its associated sentiment by 3 native Bengali speakers. The dataset consists of 2,619 positive, 4,721 negative and 1,669 neutral data samples from 9,009 unique comments gathered from some famous Bengali news portals. In addition, we conducted a baseline evaluation with a focus on deep learning model, achieved an accuracy of 78.75% for aspect term extraction and accuracy of 71.08% for sentiment classification. Experiments on the BAN-ABSA dataset show that the CNN model is better in terms of accuracy though Bi-LSTM significantly outperforms CNN model in terms of average F1-score."
A Novel Sentiment Analysis Engine for Preliminary Depression Status Estimation on Social Media,"Text sentiment analysis for preliminary depression status estimation of users on social media is a widely exercised and feasible method, However, the immense variety of users accessing the social media websites and their ample mix of vocabularies makes it difficult for commonly applied deep learning-based classifiers to perform. To add to the situation, the lack of adaptability of traditional supervised machine learning could hurt at many levels. We propose a cloud-based smartphone application, with a deep learning-based backend to primarily perform depression detection on Twitter social media. The backend model consists of a RoBERTa based siamese sentence classifier that compares a given tweet (Query) with a labeled set of tweets with known sentiment ( Standard Corpus ). The standard corpus is varied over time with expert opinion so as to improve the model's reliability. A psychologist ( with the patient's permission ) could leverage the application to assess the patient's depression status prior to counseling, which provides better insight into the mental health status of a patient. In addition, to the same, the psychologist could be referred to cases of similar characteristics, which could in turn help in more effective treatment. We evaluate our backend model after fine-tuning it on a publicly available dataset. The find tuned model is made to predict depression on a large set of tweet samples with random noise factors. The model achieved pinnacle results, with a testing accuracy of 87.23% and an AUC of 0.8621."
Advancing Humor-Focused Sentiment Analysis through Improved Contextualized Embeddings and Model Architecture,"Humor is a natural and fundamental component of human interactions. When correctly applied, humor allows us to express thoughts and feelings conveniently and effectively, increasing interpersonal affection, likeability, and trust. However, understanding the use of humor is a computationally challenging task from the perspective of humor-aware language processing models. As language models become ubiquitous through virtual-assistants and IOT devices, the need to develop humor-aware models rises exponentially. To further improve the state-of-the-art capacity to perform this particular sentiment-analysis task we must explore models that incorporate contextualized and nonverbal elements in their design. Ideally, we seek architectures accepting non-verbal elements as additional embedded inputs to the model, alongside the original sentence-embedded input. This survey thus analyses the current state of research in techniques for improved contextualized embedding incorporating nonverbal information, as well as newly proposed deep architectures to improve context retention on top of popular word-embeddings methods."
Fine-Tuning BERT for Sentiment Analysis of Vietnamese Reviews,"Sentiment analysis is an important task in the field ofNature Language Processing (NLP), in which users' feedbackdata on a specific issue are evaluated and analyzed. Manydeep learning models have been proposed to tackle this task, including the recently-introduced Bidirectional Encoder Rep-resentations from Transformers (BERT) model. In this paper,we experiment with two BERT fine-tuning methods for thesentiment analysis task on datasets of Vietnamese reviews: 1) a method that uses only the [CLS] token as the input for anattached feed-forward neural network, and 2) another methodin which all BERT output vectors are used as the input forclassification. Experimental results on two datasets show thatmodels using BERT slightly outperform other models usingGloVe and FastText. Also, regarding the datasets employed inthis study, our proposed BERT fine-tuning method produces amodel with better performance than the original BERT fine-tuning method."
A Deep Language-independent Network to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on the World via Sentiment Analysis,"Towards the end of 2019, Wuhan experienced an outbreak of novel coronavirus, which soon spread all over the world, resulting in a deadly pandemic that infected millions of people around the globe. The government and public health agencies followed many strategies to counter the fatal virus. However, the virus severely affected the social and economic lives of the people. In this paper, we extract and study the opinion of people from the top five worst affected countries by the virus, namely USA, Brazil, India, Russia, and South Africa. We propose a deep language-independent Multilevel Attention-based Conv-BiGRU network (MACBiG-Net), which includes embedding layer, word-level encoded attention, and sentence-level encoded attention mechanism to extract the positive, negative, and neutral sentiments. The embedding layer encodes the sentence sequence into a real-valued vector. The word-level and sentence-level encoding is performed by a 1D Conv-BiGRU based mechanism, followed by word-level and sentence-level attention, respectively. We further develop a COVID-19 Sentiment Dataset by crawling the tweets from Twitter. Extensive experiments on our proposed dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MACBiG-Net. Also, attention-weights visualization and in-depth results analysis shows that the proposed network has effectively captured the sentiments of the people."
SentiLSTM: A Deep Learning Approach for Sentiment Analysis of Restaurant Reviews,"The amount of textual data generation has increased enormously due to the effortless access of the Internet and the evolution of various web 2.0 applications. These textual data productions resulted because of the people express their opinion, emotion or sentiment about any product or service in the form of tweets, Facebook post or status, blog write up, and reviews. Sentiment analysis deals with the process of computationally identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in a piece of text, especially in order to determine whether the writer's attitude toward a particular topic is positive, negative, or neutral. The impact of customer review is significant to perceive the customer attitude towards a restaurant. Thus, the automatic detection of sentiment from reviews is advantageous for the restaurant owners, or service providers and customers to make their decisions or services more satisfactory. This paper proposes, a deep learning-based technique (i.e., BiLSTM) to classify the reviews provided by the clients of the restaurant into positive and negative polarities. A corpus consists of 8435 reviews is constructed to evaluate the proposed technique. In addition, a comparative analysis of the proposed technique with other machine learning algorithms presented. The results of the evaluation on test dataset show that BiLSTM technique produced in the highest accuracy of 91.35%."
Improving Document-Level Sentiment Analysis with User and Product Context,"Past work that improves document-level sentiment analysis by encoding user and product information has been limited to considering only the text of the current review. We investigate incorporating additional review text available at the time of sentiment prediction that may prove meaningful for guiding prediction. Firstly, we incorporate all available historical review text belonging to the author of the review in question. Secondly, we investigate the inclusion of historical reviews associated with the current product (written by other users). We achieve this by explicitly storing representations of reviews written by the same user and about the same product and force the model to memorize all reviews for one particular user and product. Additionally, we drop the hierarchical architecture used in previous work to enable words in the text to directly attend to each other. Experiment results on IMDB, Yelp 2013 and Yelp 2014 datasets show improvement to state-of-the-art of more than 2 percentage points in the best case."
Sentiment Analysis for Sinhala Language using Deep Learning Techniques,"Due to the high impact of the fast-evolving fields of machine learning and deep learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks have further obtained comprehensive performances for highly resourced languages such as English and Chinese. However Sinhala, which is an under-resourced language with a rich morphology, has not experienced these advancements. For sentiment analysis, there exists only two previous research with deep learning approaches, which focused only on document-level sentiment analysis for the binary case. They experimented with only three types of deep learning models. In contrast, this paper presents a much comprehensive study on the use of standard sequence models such as RNN, LSTM, Bi-LSTM, as well as more recent state-of-the-art models such as hierarchical attention hybrid neural networks, and capsule networks. Classification is done at document-level but with more granularity by considering POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL, and CONFLICT classes. A data set of 15059 Sinhala news comments, annotated with these four classes and a corpus consists of 9.48 million tokens are publicly released. This is the largest sentiment annotated data set for Sinhala so far."
SigmaLaw-ABSA: Dataset for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis in Legal Opinion Texts,"Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) has been prominent and ongoing research over many different domains, but it is not widely discussed in the legal domain. A number of publicly available datasets for a wide range of domains usually fulfill the needs of researchers to perform their studies in the field of ABSA. To the best of our knowledge, there is no publicly available dataset for the Aspect (Party) Based Sentiment Analysis for legal opinion texts. Therefore, creating a publicly available dataset for the research of ABSA for the legal domain can be considered as a task with significant importance. In this study, we introduce a manually annotated legal opinion text dataset (SigmaLaw-ABSA) intended towards facilitating researchers for ABSA tasks in the legal domain. SigmaLaw-ABSA consists of legal opinion texts in the English language which have been annotated by human judges. This study discusses the sub-tasks of ABSA relevant to the legal domain and how to use the dataset to perform them. This paper also describes the statistics of the dataset and as a baseline, we present some results on the performance of some existing deep learning based systems on the SigmaLaw-ABSA dataset."
Rule-Based Approach for Party-Based Sentiment Analysis in Legal Opinion Texts,"A document which elaborates opinions and arguments related to the previous court cases is known as a legal opinion text. Lawyers and legal officials have to spend considerable effort and time to obtain the required information manually from those documents when dealing with new legal cases. Hence, it provides much convenience to those individuals if there is a way to automate the process of extracting information from legal opinion texts. Party-based sentiment analysis will play a key role in the automation system by identifying opinion values with respect to each legal parties in legal texts."
XED: A Multilingual Dataset for Sentiment Analysis and Emotion Detection,"We introduce XED, a multilingual fine-grained emotion dataset. The dataset consists of human-annotated Finnish (25k) and English sentences (30k), as well as projected annotations for 30 additional languages, providing new resources for many low-resource languages. We use Plutchik's core emotions to annotate the dataset with the addition of neutral to create a multilabel multiclass dataset. The dataset is carefully evaluated using language-specific BERT models and SVMs to show that XED performs on par with other similar datasets and is therefore a useful tool for sentiment analysis and emotion detection."
ASAD: A Twitter-based Benchmark Arabic Sentiment Analysis Dataset,"This paper provides a detailed description of a new Twitter-based benchmark dataset for Arabic Sentiment Analysis (ASAD), which is launched in a competition3, sponsored by KAUST for awarding 10000 USD, 5000 USD and 2000 USD to the first, second and third place winners, respectively. Compared to other publicly released Arabic datasets, ASAD is a large, high-quality annotated dataset(including 95K tweets), with three-class sentiment labels (positive, negative and neutral). We presents the details of the data collection process and annotation process. In addition, we implement several baseline models for the competition task and report the results as a reference for the participants to the competition."
Transformer-based Multi-Aspect Modeling for Multi-Aspect Multi-Sentiment Analysis,"Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims at analyzing the sentiment of a given aspect in a sentence. Recently, neural network-based methods have achieved promising results in existing ABSA datasets. However, these datasets tend to degenerate to sentence-level sentiment analysis because most sentences contain only one aspect or multiple aspects with the same sentiment polarity. To facilitate the research of ABSA, NLPCC 2020 Shared Task 2 releases a new large-scale Multi-Aspect Multi-Sentiment (MAMS) dataset. In the MAMS dataset, each sentence contains at least two different aspects with different sentiment polarities, which makes ABSA more complex and challenging. To address the challenging dataset, we re-formalize ABSA as a problem of multi-aspect sentiment analysis, and propose a novel Transformer-based Multi-aspect Modeling scheme (TMM), which can capture potential relations between multiple aspects and simultaneously detect the sentiment of all aspects in a sentence. Experiment results on the MAMS dataset show that our method achieves noticeable improvements compared with strong baselines such as BERT and RoBERTa, and finally ranks the 2nd in NLPCC 2020 Shared Task 2 Evaluation."
Understanding Pre-trained BERT for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis,"This paper analyzes the pre-trained hidden representations learned from reviews on BERT for tasks in aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA). Our work is motivated by the recent progress in BERT-based language models for ABSA. However, it is not clear how the general proxy task of (masked) language model trained on unlabeled corpus without annotations of aspects or opinions can provide important features for downstream tasks in ABSA. By leveraging the annotated datasets in ABSA, we investigate both the attentions and the learned representations of BERT pre-trained on reviews. We found that BERT uses very few self-attention heads to encode context words (such as prepositions or pronouns that indicating an aspect) and opinion words for an aspect. Most features in the representation of an aspect are dedicated to the fine-grained semantics of the domain (or product category) and the aspect itself, instead of carrying summarized opinions from its context. We hope this investigation can help future research in improving self-supervised learning, unsupervised learning and fine-tuning for ABSA. The pre-trained model and code can be found at https://github.com/howardhsu/BERT-for-RRC-ABSA."
"Sentiment Analysis for Roman Urdu Text over Social Media, a Comparative Study","In present century, data volume is increasing enormously. The data could be in form for image, text, voice, and video. One factor in this huge growth of data is usage of social media where everyone is posting data on daily basis during chatting, exchanging information, and uploading their personal and official credential. Research of sentiments seeks to uncover abstract knowledge in Published texts in which users communicate their emotions and thoughts about shared content, including blogs, news and social networks. Roman Urdu is the one of most dominant language on social networks in Pakistan and India. Roman Urdu is among the varieties of the world's third largest Urdu language but yet not sufficient work has been done in this language. In this article we addressed the prior concepts and strategies used to examine the sentiment of the roman Urdu text and reported their results as well."
Global Sentiment Analysis Of COVID-19 Tweets Over Time,"The Coronavirus pandemic has affected the normal course of life. People around the world have taken to social media to express their opinions and general emotions regarding this phenomenon that has taken over the world by storm. The social networking site, Twitter showed an unprecedented increase in tweets related to the novel Coronavirus in a very short span of time. This paper presents the global sentiment analysis of tweets related to Coronavirus and how the sentiment of people in different countries has changed over time. Furthermore, to determine the impact of Coronavirus on daily aspects of life, tweets related to Work From Home (WFH) and Online Learning were scraped and the change in sentiment over time was observed. In addition, various Machine Learning models such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) were implemented for sentiment classification and their accuracies were determined. Exploratory data analysis was also performed for a dataset providing information about the number of confirmed cases on a per-day basis in a few of the worst-hit countries to provide a comparison between the change in sentiment with the change in cases since the start of this pandemic till June 2020."
How angry are your customers? Sentiment analysis of support tickets that escalate,"Software support ticket escalations can be an extremely costly burden for software organizations all over the world. Consequently, there exists an interest in researching how to better enable support analysts to handle such escalations. In order to do so, we need to develop tools to reliably predict if, and when, a support ticket becomes a candidate for escalation. This paper explores the use of sentiment analysis tools on customer-support analyst conversations to find indicators of when a particular support ticket may be escalated. The results of this research indicate a considerable difference in the sentiment between escalated support tickets and non-escalated support tickets. Thus, this preliminary research provides us with the necessary information to further investigate how we can reliably predict support ticket escalations, and subsequently to provide insight to support analysts to better enable them to handle support tickets that may be escalated."
Improving Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis with Gated Graph Convolutional Networks and Syntax-based Regulation,"Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) seeks to predict the sentiment polarity of a sentence toward a specific aspect. Recently, it has been shown that dependency trees can be integrated into deep learning models to produce the state-of-the-art performance for ABSA. However, these models tend to compute the hidden/representation vectors without considering the aspect terms and fail to benefit from the overall contextual importance scores of the words that can be obtained from the dependency tree for ABSA. In this work, we propose a novel graph-based deep learning model to overcome these two issues of the prior work on ABSA. In our model, gate vectors are generated from the representation vectors of the aspect terms to customize the hidden vectors of the graph-based models toward the aspect terms. In addition, we propose a mechanism to obtain the importance scores for each word in the sentences based on the dependency trees that are then injected into the model to improve the representation vectors for ABSA. The proposed model achieves the state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets."
Transgender Community Sentiment Analysis from Social Media Data: A Natural Language Processing Approach,"Transgender community is experiencing a huge disparity in mental health conditions compared with the general population. Interpreting the social medial data posted by transgender people may help us understand the sentiments of these sexual minority groups better and apply early interventions. In this study, we manually categorize 300 social media comments posted by transgender people to the sentiment of negative, positive, and neutral. 5 machine learning algorithms and 2 deep neural networks are adopted to build sentiment analysis classifiers based on the annotated data. Results show that our annotations are reliable with a high Cohen's Kappa score over 0.8 across all three classes. LSTM model yields an optimal performance of accuracy over 0.85 and AUC of 0.876. Our next step will focus on using advanced natural language processing algorithms on a larger annotated dataset."
Pretraining and Fine-Tuning Strategies for Sentiment Analysis of Latvian Tweets,"In this paper, we present various pre-training strategies that aid in im-proving the accuracy of the sentiment classification task. We, at first, pre-trainlanguage representation models using these strategies and then fine-tune them onthe downstream task. Experimental results on a time-balanced tweet evaluation setshow the improvement over the previous technique. We achieve 76% accuracy forsentiment analysis on Latvian tweets, which is a substantial improvement over pre-vious work"
Improving BERT Performance for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis,"Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) studies the consumer opinion on the market products. It involves examining the type of sentiments as well as sentiment targets expressed in product reviews. Analyzing the language used in a review is a difficult task that requires a deep understanding of the language. In recent years, deep language models, such as BERT \cite{devlin2019bert}, have shown great progress in this regard. In this work, we propose two simple modules called Parallel Aggregation and Hierarchical Aggregation to be utilized on top of BERT for two main ABSA tasks namely Aspect Extraction (AE) and Aspect Sentiment Classification (ASC) in order to improve the model's performance. We show that applying the proposed models eliminates the need for further training of the BERT model. The source code is available on the Web for further research and reproduction of the results."
LT3 at SemEval-2020 Task 9: Cross-lingual Embeddings for Sentiment Analysis of Hinglish Social Media Text,"This paper describes our contribution to the SemEval-2020 Task 9 on Sentiment Analysis for Code-mixed Social Media Text. We investigated two approaches to solve the task of Hinglish sentiment analysis. The first approach uses cross-lingual embeddings resulting from projecting Hinglish and pre-trained English FastText word embeddings in the same space. The second approach incorporates pre-trained English embeddings that are incrementally retrained with a set of Hinglish tweets. The results show that the second approach performs best, with an F1-score of 70.52% on the held-out test data."
Assessment of Off-the-Shelf SE-specific Sentiment Analysis Tools: An Extended Replication Study,"Sentiment analysis methods have become popular for investigating human communication, including discussions related to software projects. Since general-purpose sentiment analysis tools do not fit well with the information exchanged by software developers, new tools, specific for software engineering (SE), have been developed. We investigate to what extent SE-specific tools for sentiment analysis mitigate the threats to conclusion validity of empirical studies in software engineering, highlighted by previous research. First, we replicate two studies addressing the role of sentiment in security discussions on GitHub and in question-writing on Stack Overflow. Then, we extend the previous studies by assessing to what extent the tools agree with each other and with the manual annotation on a gold standard of 600 documents. We find that different SE-specific sentiment analysis tools might lead to contradictory results at a fine-grain level, when used 'off-the-shelf'. Conversely, platform-specific tuning or retraining might be needed to take into account differences in platform conventions, jargon, or document lengths."
Deep-HOSeq: Deep Higher Order Sequence Fusion for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis,"Multimodal sentiment analysis utilizes multiple heterogeneous modalities for sentiment classification. The recent multimodal fusion schemes customize LSTMs to discover intra-modal dynamics and design sophisticated attention mechanisms to discover the inter-modal dynamics from multimodal sequences. Although powerful, these schemes completely rely on attention mechanisms which is problematic due to two major drawbacks 1) deceptive attention masks, and 2) training dynamics. Nevertheless, strenuous efforts are required to optimize hyperparameters of these consolidate architectures, in particular their custom-designed LSTMs constrained by attention schemes. In this research, we first propose a common network to discover both intra-modal and inter-modal dynamics by utilizing basic LSTMs and tensor based convolution networks. We then propose unique networks to encapsulate temporal-granularity among the modalities which is essential while extracting information within asynchronous sequences. We then integrate these two kinds of information via a fusion layer and call our novel multimodal fusion scheme as Deep-HOSeq (Deep network with higher order Common and Unique Sequence information). The proposed Deep-HOSeq efficiently discovers all-important information from multimodal sequences and the effectiveness of utilizing both types of information is empirically demonstrated on CMU-MOSEI and CMU-MOSI benchmark datasets. The source code of our proposed Deep-HOSeq is and available at https://github.com/sverma88/Deep-HOSeq--ICDM-2020."
NUIG-Shubhanker@Dravidian-CodeMix-FIRE2020: Sentiment Analysis of Code-Mixed Dravidian text using XLNet,"Social media has penetrated into multilingual societies, however most of them use English to be a preferred language for communication. So it looks natural for them to mix their cultural language with English during conversations resulting in abundance of multilingual data, call this code-mixed data, available in todays' world.Downstream NLP tasks using such data is challenging due to the semantic nature of it being spread across multiple languages.One such Natural Language Processing task is sentiment analysis, for this we use an auto-regressive XLNet model to perform sentiment analysis on code-mixed Tamil-English and Malayalam-English datasets."
Context-Guided BERT for Targeted Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis,"Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) and Targeted ASBA (TABSA) allow finer-grained inferences about sentiment to be drawn from the same text, depending on context. For example, a given text can have different targets (e.g., neighborhoods) and different aspects (e.g., price or safety), with different sentiment associated with each target-aspect pair. In this paper, we investigate whether adding context to self-attention models improves performance on (T)ABSA. We propose two variants of Context-Guided BERT (CG-BERT) that learn to distribute attention under different contexts. We first adapt a context-aware Transformer to produce a CG-BERT that uses context-guided softmax-attention. Next, we propose an improved Quasi-Attention CG-BERT model that learns a compositional attention that supports subtractive attention. We train both models with pretrained BERT on two (T)ABSA datasets: SentiHood and SemEval-2014 (Task 4). Both models achieve new state-of-the-art results with our QACG-BERT model having the best performance. Furthermore, we provide analyses of the impact of context in the our proposed models. Our work provides more evidence for the utility of adding context-dependencies to pretrained self-attention-based language models for context-based natural language tasks."
Learning Word Representations for Tunisian Sentiment Analysis,"Tunisians on social media tend to express themselves in their local dialect using Latin script (TUNIZI). This raises an additional challenge to the process of exploring and recognizing online opinions. To date, very little work has addressed TUNIZI sentiment analysis due to scarce resources for training an automated system. In this paper, we focus on the Tunisian dialect sentiment analysis used on social media. Most of the previous work used machine learning techniques combined with handcrafted features. More recently, Deep Neural Networks were widely used for this task, especially for the English language. In this paper, we explore the importance of various unsupervised word representations (word2vec, BERT) and we investigate the use of Convolutional Neural Networks and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory. Without using any kind of handcrafted features, our experimental results on two publicly available datasets showed comparable performances to other languages."
Weakly-Supervised Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis via Joint Aspect-Sentiment Topic Embedding,"Aspect-based sentiment analysis of review texts is of great value for understanding user feedback in a fine-grained manner. It has in general two sub-tasks: (i) extracting aspects from each review, and (ii) classifying aspect-based reviews by sentiment polarity. In this paper, we propose a weakly-supervised approach for aspect-based sentiment analysis, which uses only a few keywords describing each aspect/sentiment without using any labeled examples. Existing methods are either designed only for one of the sub-tasks, neglecting the benefit of coupling both, or are based on topic models that may contain overlapping concepts. We propose to first learn <sentiment, aspect> joint topic embeddings in the word embedding space by imposing regularizations to encourage topic distinctiveness, and then use neural models to generalize the word-level discriminative information by pre-training the classifiers with embedding-based predictions and self-training them on unlabeled data. Our comprehensive performance analysis shows that our method generates quality joint topics and outperforms the baselines significantly (7.4% and 5.1% F1-score gain on average for aspect and sentiment classification respectively) on benchmark datasets. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/teapot123/JASen."
HPCC-YNU at SemEval-2020 Task 9: A Bilingual Vector Gating Mechanism for Sentiment Analysis of Code-Mixed Text,"It is fairly common to use code-mixing on a social media platform to express opinions and emotions in multilingual societies. The purpose of this task is to detect the sentiment of code-mixed social media text. Code-mixed text poses a great challenge for the traditional NLP system, which currently uses monolingual resources to deal with the problem of multilingual mixing. This task has been solved in the past using lexicon lookup in respective sentiment dictionaries and using a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network for monolingual resources. In this paper, we (my codalab username is kongjun) present a system that uses a bilingual vector gating mechanism for bilingual resources to complete the task. The model consists of two main parts: the vector gating mechanism, which combines the character and word levels, and the attention mechanism, which extracts the important emotional parts of the text. The results show that the proposed system outperforms the baseline algorithm. We achieved fifth place in Spanglish and 19th place in Hinglish.The code of this paper is availabled at : https://github.com/JunKong5/Semveal2020-task9"
Structured Self-Attention Weights Encode Semantics in Sentiment Analysis,"Neural attention, especially the self-attention made popular by the Transformer, has become the workhorse of state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) models. Very recent work suggests that the self-attention in the Transformer encodes syntactic information; Here, we show that self-attention scores encode semantics by considering sentiment analysis tasks. In contrast to gradient-based feature attribution methods, we propose a simple and effective Layer-wise Attention Tracing (LAT) method to analyze structured attention weights. We apply our method to Transformer models trained on two tasks that have surface dissimilarities, but share common semantics---sentiment analysis of movie reviews and time-series valence prediction in life story narratives. Across both tasks, words with high aggregated attention weights were rich in emotional semantics, as quantitatively validated by an emotion lexicon labeled by human annotators. Our results show that structured attention weights encode rich semantics in sentiment analysis, and match human interpretations of semantics."
gundapusunil at SemEval-2020 Task 9: Syntactic Semantic LSTM Architecture for SENTIment Analysis of Code-MIXed Data,"The phenomenon of mixing the vocabulary and syntax of multiple languages within the same utterance is called Code-Mixing. This is more evident in multilingual societies. In this paper, we have developed a system for SemEval 2020: Task 9 on Sentiment Analysis for Code-Mixed Social Media Text. Our system first generates two types of embeddings for the social media text. In those, the first one is character level embeddings to encode the character level information and to handle the out-of-vocabulary entries and the second one is FastText word embeddings for capturing morphology and semantics. These two embeddings were passed to the LSTM network and the system outperformed the baseline model."
Improving Sentiment Analysis over non-English Tweets using Multilingual Transformers and Automatic Translation for Data-Augmentation,"Tweets are specific text data when compared to general text. Although sentiment analysis over tweets has become very popular in the last decade for English, it is still difficult to find huge annotated corpora for non-English languages. The recent rise of the transformer models in Natural Language Processing allows to achieve unparalleled performances in many tasks, but these models need a consequent quantity of text to adapt to the tweet domain. We propose the use of a multilingual transformer model, that we pre-train over English tweets and apply data-augmentation using automatic translation to adapt the model to non-English languages. Our experiments in French, Spanish, German and Italian suggest that the proposed technique is an efficient way to improve the results of the transformers over small corpora of tweets in a non-English language."
A Multi-Task Incremental Learning Framework with Category Name Embedding for Aspect-Category Sentiment Analysis,"(T)ACSA tasks, including aspect-category sentiment analysis (ACSA) and targeted aspect-category sentiment analysis (TACSA), aims at identifying sentiment polarity on predefined categories. Incremental learning on new categories is necessary for (T)ACSA real applications. Though current multi-task learning models achieve good performance in (T)ACSA tasks, they suffer from catastrophic forgetting problems in (T)ACSA incremental learning tasks. In this paper, to make multi-task learning feasible for incremental learning, we proposed Category Name Embedding network (CNE-net). We set both encoder and decoder shared among all categories to weaken the catastrophic forgetting problem. Besides the origin input sentence, we applied another input feature, i.e., category name, for task discrimination. Our model achieved state-of-the-art on two (T)ACSA benchmark datasets. Furthermore, we proposed a dataset for (T)ACSA incremental learning and achieved the best performance compared with other strong baselines."
Legal Sentiment Analysis and Opinion Mining (LSAOM): Assimilating Advances in Autonomous AI Legal Reasoning,"An expanding field of substantive interest for the theory of the law and the practice-of-law entails Legal Sentiment Analysis and Opinion Mining (LSAOM), consisting of two often intertwined phenomena and actions underlying legal discussions and narratives: (1) Sentiment Analysis (SA) for the detection of expressed or implied sentiment about a legal matter within the context of a legal milieu, and (2) Opinion Mining (OM) for the identification and illumination of explicit or implicit opinion accompaniments immersed within legal discourse. Efforts to undertake LSAOM have historically been performed by human hand and cognition, and only thinly aided in more recent times by the use of computer-based approaches. Advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) involving especially Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) are increasingly bolstering how automation can systematically perform either or both of Sentiment Analysis and Opinion Mining, all of which is being inexorably carried over into engagement within a legal context for improving LSAOM capabilities. This research paper examines the evolving infusion of AI into Legal Sentiment Analysis and Opinion Mining and proposes an alignment with the Levels of Autonomy (LoA) of AI Legal Reasoning (AILR), plus provides additional insights regarding AI LSAOM in its mechanizations and potential impact to the study of law and the practicing of law."
Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis with Aspect-Specific Opinion Spans,"Aspect based sentiment analysis, predicting sentiment polarity of given aspects, has drawn extensive attention. Previous attention-based models emphasize using aspect semantics to help extract opinion features for classification. However, these works are either not able to capture opinion spans as a whole, or not able to capture variable-length opinion spans. In this paper, we present a neat and effective structured attention model by aggregating multiple linear-chain CRFs. Such a design allows the model to extract aspect-specific opinion spans and then evaluate sentiment polarity by exploiting the extracted opinion features. The experimental results on four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, and our analysis demonstrates that our model can capture aspect-specific opinion spans."
Multi-Instance Multi-Label Learning Networks for Aspect-Category Sentiment Analysis,"Aspect-category sentiment analysis (ACSA) aims to predict sentiment polarities of sentences with respect to given aspect categories. To detect the sentiment toward a particular aspect category in a sentence, most previous methods first generate an aspect category-specific sentence representation for the aspect category, then predict the sentiment polarity based on the representation. These methods ignore the fact that the sentiment of an aspect category mentioned in a sentence is an aggregation of the sentiments of the words indicating the aspect category in the sentence, which leads to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Instance Multi-Label Learning Network for Aspect-Category sentiment analysis (AC-MIMLLN), which treats sentences as bags, words as instances, and the words indicating an aspect category as the key instances of the aspect category. Given a sentence and the aspect categories mentioned in the sentence, AC-MIMLLN first predicts the sentiments of the instances, then finds the key instances for the aspect categories, finally obtains the sentiments of the sentence toward the aspect categories by aggregating the key instance sentiments. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of AC-MIMLLN."
Sentiment Analysis for Reinforcement Learning,"While reinforcement learning (RL) has been successful in natural language processing (NLP) domains such as dialogue generation and text-based games, it typically faces the problem of sparse rewards that leads to slow or no convergence. Traditional methods that use text descriptions to extract only a state representation ignore the feedback inherently present in them. In text-based games, for example, descriptions like ""Good Job! You ate the food}"" indicate progress, and descriptions like ""You entered a new room"" indicate exploration. Positive and negative cues like these can be converted to rewards through sentiment analysis. This technique converts the sparse reward problem into a dense one, which is easier to solve. Furthermore, this can enable reinforcement learning without rewards, in which the agent learns entirely from these intrinsic sentiment rewards. This framework is similar to intrinsic motivation, where the environment does not necessarily provide the rewards, but the agent analyzes and realizes them by itself. We find that providing dense rewards in text-based games using sentiment analysis improves performance under some conditions."
Sentence Constituent-Aware Aspect-Category Sentiment Analysis with Graph Attention Networks,"Aspect category sentiment analysis (ACSA) aims to predict the sentiment polarities of the aspect categories discussed in sentences. Since a sentence usually discusses one or more aspect categories and expresses different sentiments toward them, various attention-based methods have been developed to allocate the appropriate sentiment words for the given aspect category and obtain promising results. However, most of these methods directly use the given aspect category to find the aspect category-related sentiment words, which may cause mismatching between the sentiment words and the aspect categories when an unrelated sentiment word is semantically meaningful for the given aspect category. To mitigate this problem, we propose a Sentence Constituent-Aware Network (SCAN) for aspect-category sentiment analysis. SCAN contains two graph attention modules and an interactive loss function. The graph attention modules generate representations of the nodes in sentence constituency parse trees for the aspect category detection (ACD) task and the ACSA task, respectively. ACD aims to detect aspect categories discussed in sentences and is a auxiliary task. For a given aspect category, the interactive loss function helps the ACD task to find the nodes which can predict the aspect category but can't predict other aspect categories. The sentiment words in the nodes then are used to predict the sentiment polarity of the aspect category by the ACSA task. The experimental results on five public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SCAN."
Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis in Education Domain,"Analysis of a large amount of data has always brought value to institutions and organizations. Lately, people's opinions expressed through text have become a very important aspect of this analysis. In response to this challenge, a natural language processing technique known as Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) has emerged. Having the ability to extract the polarity for each aspect of opinions separately, ABSA has found itself useful in a wide range of domains. Education is one of the domains in which ABSA can be successfully utilized. Being able to understand and find out what students like and don't like most about a course, professor, or teaching methodology can be of great importance for the respective institutions. While this task represents a unique NLP challenge, many studies have proposed different approaches to tackle the problem. In this work, we present a comprehensive review of the existing work in ABSA with a focus in the education domain. A wide range of methodologies are discussed and conclusions are drawn."
Citation Sentiment Changes Analysis,"Metrics for measuring the citation sentiment changes were introduced. Citation sentiment changes can be observed from global citation sentiment sequences (GCSSs). With respect to a cited paper, the citation sentiment sequences were analysed across a collection of citing papers ordered by the published time. For analysing GCSSs, Eddy Dissipation Rate (EDR) was adopted, with the hypothesis that the GCSSs pattern differences can be spotted by EDR based method. Preliminary evidence showed that EDR based method holds the potential for analysing a publication's impact in a time series fashion."
Sentifiers: Interpreting Vague Intent Modifiers in Visual Analysis using Word Co-occurrence and Sentiment Analysis,"Natural language interaction with data visualization tools often involves the use of vague subjective modifiers in utterances such as ""show me the sectors that are performing"" and ""where is a good neighborhood to buy a house?."" Interpreting these modifiers is often difficult for these tools because their meanings lack clear semantics and are in part defined by context and personal user preferences. This paper presents a system called \system that makes a first step in better understanding these vague predicates. The algorithm employs word co-occurrence and sentiment analysis to determine which data attributes and filters ranges to associate with the vague predicates. The provenance results from the algorithm are exposed to the user as interactive text that can be repaired and refined. We conduct a qualitative evaluation of the Sentifiers system that indicates the usefulness of the interface as well as opportunities for better supporting subjective utterances in visual analysis tasks through natural language."
GRACE: Gradient Harmonized and Cascaded Labeling for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis,"In this paper, we focus on the imbalance issue, which is rarely studied in aspect term extraction and aspect sentiment classification when regarding them as sequence labeling tasks. Besides, previous works usually ignore the interaction between aspect terms when labeling polarities. We propose a GRadient hArmonized and CascadEd labeling model (GRACE) to solve these problems. Specifically, a cascaded labeling module is developed to enhance the interchange between aspect terms and improve the attention of sentiment tokens when labeling sentiment polarities. The polarities sequence is designed to depend on the generated aspect terms labels. To alleviate the imbalance issue, we extend the gradient harmonized mechanism used in object detection to the aspect-based sentiment analysis by adjusting the weight of each label dynamically. The proposed GRACE adopts a post-pretraining BERT as its backbone. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves consistency improvement on multiple benchmark datasets and generates state-of-the-art results."
WESSA at SemEval-2020 Task 9: Code-Mixed Sentiment Analysis using Transformers,"In this paper, we describe our system submitted for SemEval 2020 Task 9, Sentiment Analysis for Code-Mixed Social Media Text alongside other experiments. Our best performing system is a Transfer Learning-based model that fine-tunes ""XLM-RoBERTa"", a transformer-based multilingual masked language model, on monolingual English and Spanish data and Spanish-English code-mixed data. Our system outperforms the official task baseline by achieving a 70.1% average F1-Score on the official leaderboard using the test set. For later submissions, our system manages to achieve a 75.9% average F1-Score on the test set using CodaLab username ""ahmed0sultan""."
Towards Computational Linguistics in Minangkabau Language: Studies on Sentiment Analysis and Machine Translation,"Although some linguists (Rusmali et al., 1985; Crouch, 2009) have fairly attempted to define the morphology and syntax of Minangkabau, information processing in this language is still absent due to the scarcity of the annotated resource. In this work, we release two Minangkabau corpora: sentiment analysis and machine translation that are harvested and constructed from Twitter and Wikipedia. We conduct the first computational linguistics in Minangkabau language employing classic machine learning and sequence-to-sequence models such as LSTM and Transformer. Our first experiments show that the classification performance over Minangkabau text significantly drops when tested with the model trained in Indonesian. Whereas, in the machine translation experiment, a simple word-to-word translation using a bilingual dictionary outperforms LSTM and Transformer model in terms of BLEU score."
An Interpretable and Uncertainty Aware Multi-Task Framework for Multi-Aspect Sentiment Analysis,"In recent years, several online platforms have seen a rapid increase in the number of review systems that request users to provide aspect-level feedback. Document-level Multi-aspect Sentiment Classification (DMSC), where the goal is to predict the ratings/sentiment from a review at an individual aspect level, has become a challenging and imminent problem. To tackle this challenge, we propose a deliberate self-attention-based deep neural network model, namely FEDAR, for the DMSC problem, which can achieve competitive performance while also being able to interpret the predictions made. FEDAR is equipped with a highway word embedding layer to transfer knowledge from pre-trained word embeddings, an RNN encoder layer with output features enriched by pooling and factorization techniques, and a deliberate self-attention layer. In addition, we also propose an Attention-driven Keywords Ranking (AKR) method, which can automatically discover aspect keywords and aspect-level opinion keywords from the review corpus based on the attention weights. These keywords are significant for rating predictions by FEDAR. Since crowdsourcing annotation can be an alternate way to recover missing ratings of reviews, we propose a LEcture-AuDience (LEAD) strategy to estimate model uncertainty in the context of multi-task learning, so that valuable human resources can focus on the most uncertain predictions. Our extensive set of experiments on five different open-domain DMSC datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed FEDAR and LEAD models. We further introduce two new DMSC datasets in the healthcare domain and benchmark different baseline models and our models on them. Attention weights visualization results and visualization of aspect and opinion keywords demonstrate the interpretability of our model and the effectiveness of our AKR method."
"Tasty Burgers, Soggy Fries: Probing Aspect Robustness in Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis","Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims to predict the sentiment towards a specific aspect in the text. However, existing ABSA test sets cannot be used to probe whether a model can distinguish the sentiment of the target aspect from the non-target aspects. To solve this problem, we develop a simple but effective approach to enrich ABSA test sets. Specifically, we generate new examples to disentangle the confounding sentiments of the non-target aspects from the target aspect's sentiment. Based on the SemEval 2014 dataset, we construct the Aspect Robustness Test Set (ARTS) as a comprehensive probe of the aspect robustness of ABSA models. Over 92% data of ARTS show high fluency and desired sentiment on all aspects by human evaluation. Using ARTS, we analyze the robustness of nine ABSA models, and observe, surprisingly, that their accuracy drops by up to 69.73%. We explore several ways to improve aspect robustness, and find that adversarial training can improve models' performance on ARTS by up to 32.85%. Our code and new test set are available at https://github.com/zhijing-jin/ARTS_TestSet"
Improving Bi-LSTM Performance for Indonesian Sentiment Analysis Using Paragraph Vector,"Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Network (Bi-LSTM) has shown promising performance in sentiment classification task. It processes inputs as sequence of information. Due to this behavior, sentiment predictions by Bi-LSTM were influenced by words sequence and the first or last phrases of the texts tend to have stronger features than other phrases. Meanwhile, in the problem scope of Indonesian sentiment analysis, phrases that express the sentiment of a document might not appear in the first or last part of the document that can lead to incorrect sentiment classification. To this end, we propose the using of an existing document representation method called paragraph vector as additional input features for Bi-LSTM. This vector provides information context of the document for each sequence processing. The paragraph vector is simply concatenated to each word vector of the document. This representation also helps to differentiate ambiguous Indonesian words. Bi-LSTM and paragraph vector were previously used as separate methods. Combining the two methods has shown a significant performance improvement of Indonesian sentiment analysis model. Several case studies on testing data showed that the proposed method can handle the sentiment phrases position problem encountered by Bi-LSTM."
Visual Sentiment Analysis from Disaster Images in Social Media,"The increasing popularity of social networks and users' tendency towards sharing their feelings, expressions, and opinions in text, visual, and audio content, have opened new opportunities and challenges in sentiment analysis. While sentiment analysis of text streams has been widely explored in literature, sentiment analysis from images and videos is relatively new. This article focuses on visual sentiment analysis in a societal important domain, namely disaster analysis in social media. To this aim, we propose a deep visual sentiment analyzer for disaster related images, covering different aspects of visual sentiment analysis starting from data collection, annotation, model selection, implementation, and evaluations. For data annotation, and analyzing peoples' sentiments towards natural disasters and associated images in social media, a crowd-sourcing study has been conducted with a large number of participants worldwide. The crowd-sourcing study resulted in a large-scale benchmark dataset with four different sets of annotations, each aiming a separate task. The presented analysis and the associated dataset will provide a baseline/benchmark for future research in the domain. We believe the proposed system can contribute toward more livable communities by helping different stakeholders, such as news broadcasters, humanitarian organizations, as well as the general public."
TransModality: An End2End Fusion Method with Transformer for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis,"Multimodal sentiment analysis is an important research area that predicts speaker's sentiment tendency through features extracted from textual, visual and acoustic modalities. The central challenge is the fusion method of the multimodal information. A variety of fusion methods have been proposed, but few of them adopt end-to-end translation models to mine the subtle correlation between modalities. Enlightened by recent success of Transformer in the area of machine translation, we propose a new fusion method, TransModality, to address the task of multimodal sentiment analysis. We assume that translation between modalities contributes to a better joint representation of speaker's utterance. With Transformer, the learned features embody the information both from the source modality and the target modality. We validate our model on multiple multimodal datasets: CMU-MOSI, MELD, IEMOCAP. The experiments show that our proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance."
Semantic Sentiment Analysis Based on Probabilistic Graphical Models and Recurrent Neural Network,"Sentiment Analysis is the task of classifying documents based on the sentiments expressed in textual form, this can be achieved by using lexical and semantic methods. The purpose of this study is to investigate the use of semantics to perform sentiment analysis based on probabilistic graphical models and recurrent neural networks. In the empirical evaluation, the classification performance of the graphical models was compared with some traditional machine learning classifiers and a recurrent neural network. The datasets used for the experiments were IMDB movie reviews, Amazon Consumer Product reviews, and Twitter Review datasets. After this empirical study, we conclude that the inclusion of semantics for sentiment analysis tasks can greatly improve the performance of a classifier, as the semantic feature extraction methods reduce uncertainties in classification resulting in more accurate predictions."
C1 at SemEval-2020 Task 9: SentiMix: Sentiment Analysis for Code-Mixed Social Media Text using Feature Engineering,"In today's interconnected and multilingual world, code-mixing of languages on social media is a common occurrence. While many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks like sentiment analysis are mature and well designed for monolingual text, techniques to apply these tasks to code-mixed text still warrant exploration. This paper describes our feature engineering approach to sentiment analysis in code-mixed social media text for SemEval-2020 Task 9: SentiMix. We tackle this problem by leveraging a set of hand-engineered lexical, sentiment, and metadata features to design a classifier that can disambiguate between ""positive"", ""negative"" and ""neutral"" sentiment. With this model, we are able to obtain a weighted F1 score of 0.65 for the ""Hinglish"" task and 0.63 for the ""Spanglish"" tasks"
LIMSI_UPV at SemEval-2020 Task 9: Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network for Code-mixed Sentiment Analysis,"This paper describes the participation of LIMSI UPV team in SemEval-2020 Task 9: Sentiment Analysis for Code-Mixed Social Media Text. The proposed approach competed in SentiMix Hindi-English subtask, that addresses the problem of predicting the sentiment of a given Hindi-English code-mixed tweet. We propose Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network that combines both the recurrent neural network and the convolutional network to better capture the semantics of the text, for code-mixed sentiment analysis. The proposed system obtained 0.69 (best run) in terms of F1 score on the given test data and achieved the 9th place (Codalab username: somban) in the SentiMix Hindi-English subtask."
"Topic, Sentiment and Impact Analysis: COVID19 Information Seeking on Social Media","When people notice something unusual, they discuss it on social media. They leave traces of their emotions via text expressions. A systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of social media data across time and space can give insights on local outbreaks, mental health, and social issues. Such timely insights can help in developing strategies and resources with an appropriate and efficient response. This study analysed a large Spatio-temporal tweet dataset of the Australian sphere related to COVID19. The methodology included a volume analysis, dynamic topic modelling, sentiment detection, and semantic brand score to obtain an insight on the COVID19 pandemic outbreak and public discussion in different states and cities of Australia over time. The obtained insights are compared with independently observed phenomena such as government reported instances."
Cross-language sentiment analysis of European Twitter messages duringthe COVID-19 pandemic,"Social media data can be a very salient source of information during crises. User-generated messages provide a window into people's minds during such times, allowing us insights about their moods and opinions. Due to the vast amounts of such messages, a large-scale analysis of population-wide developments becomes possible. In this paper, we analyze Twitter messages (tweets) collected during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe with regard to their sentiment. This is implemented with a neural network for sentiment analysis using multilingual sentence embeddings. We separate the results by country of origin, and correlate their temporal development with events in those countries. This allows us to study the effect of the situation on people's moods. We see, for example, that lockdown announcements correlate with a deterioration of mood in almost all surveyed countries, which recovers within a short time span."
Multi-Label Sentiment Analysis on 100 Languages with Dynamic Weighting for Label Imbalance,"We investigate cross-lingual sentiment analysis, which has attracted significant attention due to its applications in various areas including market research, politics and social sciences. In particular, we introduce a sentiment analysis framework in multi-label setting as it obeys Plutchik wheel of emotions. We introduce a novel dynamic weighting method that balances the contribution from each class during training, unlike previous static weighting methods that assign non-changing weights based on their class frequency. Moreover, we adapt the focal loss that favors harder instances from single-label object recognition literature to our multi-label setting. Furthermore, we derive a method to choose optimal class-specific thresholds that maximize the macro-f1 score in linear time complexity. Through an extensive set of experiments, we show that our method obtains the state-of-the-art performance in 7 of 9 metrics in 3 different languages using a single model compared to the common baselines and the best-performing methods in the SemEval competition. We publicly share our code for our model, which can perform sentiment analysis in 100 languages, to facilitate further research."
Decision Tree J48 at SemEval-2020 Task 9: Sentiment Analysis for Code-Mixed Social Media Text (Hinglish),This paper discusses the design of the system used for providing a solution for the problem given at SemEval-2020 Task 9 where sentiment analysis of code-mixed language Hindi and English needed to be performed. This system uses Weka as a tool for providing the classifier for the classification of tweets and python is used for loading the data from the files provided and cleaning it. Only part of the training data was provided to the system for classifying the tweets in the test data set on which evaluation of the system was done. The system performance was assessed using the official competition evaluation metric F1-score. Classifier was trained on two sets of training data which resulted in F1 scores of 0.4972 and 0.5316.
A systematic literature review on machine learning applications for consumer sentiment analysis using online reviews,"Consumer sentiment analysis is a recent fad for social media related applications such as healthcare, crime, finance, travel, and academics. Disentangling consumer perception to gain insight into the desired objective and reviews is significant. With the advancement of technology, a massive amount of social web-data increasing in terms of volume, subjectivity, and heterogeneity, becomes challenging to process it manually. Machine learning techniques have been utilized to handle this difficulty in real-life applications. This paper presents the study to find out the usefulness, scope, and applicability of this alliance of Machine Learning techniques for consumer sentiment analysis on online reviews in the domain of hospitality and tourism. We have shown a systematic literature review to compare, analyze, explore, and understand the attempts and direction in a proper way to find research gaps to illustrating the future scope of this pairing. This work is contributing to the extant literature in two ways; firstly, the primary objective is to read and analyze the use of machine learning techniques for consumer sentiment analysis on online reviews in the domain of hospitality and tourism. Secondly, in this work, we presented a systematic approach to identify, collect observational evidence, results from the analysis, and assimilate observations of all related high-quality research to address particular research queries referring to the described research area."
Cross-Cultural Polarity and Emotion Detection Using Sentiment Analysis and Deep Learning -- a Case Study on COVID-19,"How different cultures react and respond given a crisis is predominant in a society's norms and political will to combat the situation. Often the decisions made are necessitated by events, social pressure, or the need of the hour, which may not represent the will of the nation. While some are pleased with it, others might show resentment. Coronavirus (COVID-19) brought a mix of similar emotions from the nations towards the decisions taken by their respective governments. Social media was bombarded with posts containing both positive and negative sentiments on the COVID-19, pandemic, lockdown, hashtags past couple of months. Despite geographically close, many neighboring countries reacted differently to one another. For instance, Denmark and Sweden, which share many similarities, stood poles apart on the decision taken by their respective governments. Yet, their nation's support was mostly unanimous, unlike the South Asian neighboring countries where people showed a lot of anxiety and resentment. This study tends to detect and analyze sentiment polarity and emotions demonstrated during the initial phase of the pandemic and the lockdown period employing natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning techniques on Twitter posts. Deep long short-term memory (LSTM) models used for estimating the sentiment polarity and emotions from extracted tweets have been trained to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on the sentiment140 dataset. The use of emoticons showed a unique and novel way of validating the supervised deep learning models on tweets extracted from Twitter."
A Variational Approach to Unsupervised Sentiment Analysis,"In this paper, we propose a variational approach to unsupervised sentiment analysis. Instead of using ground truth provided by domain experts, we use target-opinion word pairs as a supervision signal. For example, in a document snippet ""the room is big,"" (room, big) is a target-opinion word pair. These word pairs can be extracted by using dependency parsers and simple rules. Our objective function is to predict an opinion word given a target word while our ultimate goal is to learn a sentiment classifier. By introducing a latent variable, i.e., the sentiment polarity, to the objective function, we can inject the sentiment classifier to the objective function via the evidence lower bound. We can learn a sentiment classifier by optimizing the lower bound. We also impose sophisticated constraints on opinion words as regularization which encourages that if two documents have similar (dissimilar) opinion words, the sentiment classifiers should produce similar (different) probability distribution. We apply our method to sentiment analysis on customer reviews and clinical narratives. The experiment results show our method can outperform unsupervised baselines in sentiment analysis task on both domains, and our method obtains comparable results to the supervised method with hundreds of labels per aspect in customer reviews domain, and obtains comparable results to supervised methods in clinical narratives domain."
SentiQ: A Probabilistic Logic Approach to Enhance Sentiment Analysis Tool Quality,"The opinion expressed in various Web sites and social-media is an essential contributor to the decision making process of several organizations. Existing sentiment analysis tools aim to extract the polarity (i.e., positive, negative, neutral) from these opinionated contents. Despite the advance of the research in the field, sentiment analysis tools give \textit{inconsistent} polarities, which is harmful to business decisions. In this paper, we propose SentiQ, an unsupervised Markov logic Network-based approach that injects the semantic dimension in the tools through rules. It allows to detect and solve inconsistencies and then improves the overall accuracy of the tools. Preliminary experimental results demonstrate the usefulness of SentiQ."
Modeling Inter-Aspect Dependencies with a Non-temporal Mechanism for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis,"For multiple aspects scenario of aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), existing approaches typically ignore inter-aspect relations or rely on temporal dependencies to process aspect-aware representations of all aspects in a sentence. Although multiple aspects of a sentence appear in a non-adjacent sequential order, they are not in a strict temporal relationship as natural language sequence, thus the aspect-aware sentence representations should not be treated as temporal dependency processing. In this paper, we propose a novel non-temporal mechanism to enhance the ABSA task through modeling inter-aspect dependencies. Furthermore, we focus on the well-known class imbalance issue on the ABSA task and address it by down-weighting the loss assigned to well-classified instances. Experiments on two distinct domains of SemEval 2014 task 4 demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach."
SemEval-2020 Task 9: Overview of Sentiment Analysis of Code-Mixed Tweets,"In this paper, we present the results of the SemEval-2020 Task 9 on Sentiment Analysis of Code-Mixed Tweets (SentiMix 2020). We also release and describe our Hinglish (Hindi-English) and Spanglish (Spanish-English) corpora annotated with word-level language identification and sentence-level sentiment labels. These corpora are comprised of 20K and 19K examples, respectively. The sentiment labels are - Positive, Negative, and Neutral. SentiMix attracted 89 submissions in total including 61 teams that participated in the Hinglish contest and 28 submitted systems to the Spanglish competition. The best performance achieved was 75.0% F1 score for Hinglish and 80.6% F1 for Spanglish. We observe that BERT-like models and ensemble methods are the most common and successful approaches among the participants."
ULD@NUIG at SemEval-2020 Task 9: Generative Morphemes with an Attention Model for Sentiment Analysis in Code-Mixed Text,"Code mixing is a common phenomena in multilingual societies where people switch from one language to another for various reasons. Recent advances in public communication over different social media sites have led to an increase in the frequency of code-mixed usage in written language. In this paper, we present the Generative Morphemes with Attention (GenMA) Model sentiment analysis system contributed to SemEval 2020 Task 9 SentiMix. The system aims to predict the sentiments of the given English-Hindi code-mixed tweets without using word-level language tags instead inferring this automatically using a morphological model. The system is based on a novel deep neural network (DNN) architecture, which has outperformed the baseline F1-score on the test data-set as well as the validation data-set. Our results can be found under the user name ""koustava"" on the ""Sentimix Hindi English"" page"
Deep Learning Brasil -- NLP at SemEval-2020 Task 9: Overview of Sentiment Analysis of Code-Mixed Tweets,"In this paper, we describe a methodology to predict sentiment in code-mixed tweets (hindi-english). Our team called verissimo.manoel in CodaLab developed an approach based on an ensemble of four models (MultiFiT, BERT, ALBERT, and XLNET). The final classification algorithm was an ensemble of some predictions of all softmax values from these four models. This architecture was used and evaluated in the context of the SemEval 2020 challenge (task 9), and our system got 72.7% on the F1 score."
Sentiment Analysis based Multi-person Multi-criteria Decision Making Methodology using Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning for Smarter Decision Aid. Case study of restaurant choice using TripAdvisor reviews,"Decision making models are constrained by taking the expert evaluations with pre-defined numerical or linguistic terms. We claim that the use of sentiment analysis will allow decision making models to consider expert evaluations in natural language. Accordingly, we propose the Sentiment Analysis based Multi-person Multi-criteria Decision Making (SA-MpMcDM) methodology for smarter decision aid, which builds the expert evaluations from their natural language reviews, and even from their numerical ratings if they are available. The SA-MpMcDM methodology incorporates an end-to-end multi-task deep learning model for aspect based sentiment analysis, named DOC-ABSADeepL model, able to identify the aspect categories mentioned in an expert review, and to distill their opinions and criteria. The individual evaluations are aggregated via the procedure named criteria weighting through the attention of the experts. We evaluate the methodology in a case study of restaurant choice using TripAdvisor reviews, hence we build, manually annotate, and release the TripR-2020 dataset of restaurant reviews. We analyze the SA-MpMcDM methodology in different scenarios using and not using natural language and numerical evaluations. The analysis shows that the combination of both sources of information results in a higher quality preference vector."
Reed at SemEval-2020 Task 9: Fine-Tuning and Bag-of-Words Approaches to Code-Mixed Sentiment Analysis,"We explore the task of sentiment analysis on Hinglish (code-mixed Hindi-English) tweets as participants of Task 9 of the SemEval-2020 competition, known as the SentiMix task. We had two main approaches: 1) applying transfer learning by fine-tuning pre-trained BERT models and 2) training feedforward neural networks on bag-of-words representations. During the evaluation phase of the competition, we obtained an F-score of 71.3% with our best model, which placed 4^{th} out of 62 entries in the official system rankings."
IUST at SemEval-2020 Task 9: Sentiment Analysis for Code-Mixed Social Media Text using Deep Neural Networks and Linear Baselines,"Sentiment Analysis is a well-studied field of Natural Language Processing. However, the rapid growth of social media and noisy content within them poses significant challenges in addressing this problem with well-established methods and tools. One of these challenges is code-mixing, which means using different languages to convey thoughts in social media texts. Our group, with the name of IUST(username: TAHA), participated at the SemEval-2020 shared task 9 on Sentiment Analysis for Code-Mixed Social Media Text, and we have attempted to develop a system to predict the sentiment of a given code-mixed tweet. We used different preprocessing techniques and proposed to use different methods that vary from NBSVM to more complicated deep neural network models. Our best performing method obtains an F1 score of 0.751 for the Spanish-English sub-task and 0.706 over the Hindi-English sub-task."
JUNLP@SemEval-2020 Task 9:Sentiment Analysis of Hindi-English code mixed data using Grid Search Cross Validation,"Code-mixing is a phenomenon which arises mainly in multilingual societies. Multilingual people, who are well versed in their native languages and also English speakers, tend to code-mix using English-based phonetic typing and the insertion of anglicisms in their main language. This linguistic phenomenon poses a great challenge to conventional NLP domains such as Sentiment Analysis, Machine Translation, and Text Summarization, to name a few. In this work, we focus on working out a plausible solution to the domain of Code-Mixed Sentiment Analysis. This work was done as participation in the SemEval-2020 Sentimix Task, where we focused on the sentiment analysis of English-Hindi code-mixed sentences. our username for the submission was ""sainik.mahata"" and team name was ""JUNLP"". We used feature extraction algorithms in conjunction with traditional machine learning algorithms such as SVR and Grid Search in an attempt to solve the task. Our approach garnered an f1-score of 66.2\% when tested using metrics prepared by the organizers of the task."
NITS-Hinglish-SentiMix at SemEval-2020 Task 9: Sentiment Analysis For Code-Mixed Social Media Text Using an Ensemble Model,"Sentiment Analysis is the process of deciphering what a sentence emotes and classifying them as either positive, negative, or neutral. In recent times, India has seen a huge influx in the number of active social media users and this has led to a plethora of unstructured text data. Since the Indian population is generally fluent in both Hindi and English, they end up generating code-mixed Hinglish social media text i.e. the expressions of Hindi language, written in the Roman script alongside other English words. The ability to adequately comprehend the notions in these texts is truly necessary. Our team, rns2020 participated in Task 9 at SemEval2020 intending to design a system to carry out the sentiment analysis of code-mixed social media text. This work proposes a system named NITS-Hinglish-SentiMix to viably complete the sentiment analysis of such code-mixed Hinglish text. The proposed framework has recorded an F-Score of 0.617 on the test data."
HCMS at SemEval-2020 Task 9: A Neural Approach to Sentiment Analysis for Code-Mixed Texts,"Problems involving code-mixed language are often plagued by a lack of resources and an absence of materials to perform sophisticated transfer learning with. In this paper we describe our submission to the Sentimix Hindi-English task involving sentiment classification of code-mixed texts, and with an F1 score of 67.1%, we demonstrate that simple convolution and attention may well produce reasonable results."
IITK at SemEval-2020 Task 8: Unimodal and Bimodal Sentiment Analysis of Internet Memes,"Social media is abundant in visual and textual information presented together or in isolation. Memes are the most popular form, belonging to the former class. In this paper, we present our approaches for the Memotion Analysis problem as posed in SemEval-2020 Task 8. The goal of this task is to classify memes based on their emotional content and sentiment. We leverage techniques from Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV) towards the sentiment classification of internet memes (Subtask A). We consider Bimodal (text and image) as well as Unimodal (text-only) techniques in our study ranging from the Naïve Bayes classifier to Transformer-based approaches. Our results show that a text-only approach, a simple Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN) with Word2vec embeddings as input, performs superior to all the others. We stand first in the Sentiment analysis task with a relative improvement of 63% over the baseline macro-F1 score. Our work is relevant to any task concerned with the combination of different modalities."
BAKSA at SemEval-2020 Task 9: Bolstering CNN with Self-Attention for Sentiment Analysis of Code Mixed Text,"Sentiment Analysis of code-mixed text has diversified applications in opinion mining ranging from tagging user reviews to identifying social or political sentiments of a sub-population. In this paper, we present an ensemble architecture of convolutional neural net (CNN) and self-attention based LSTM for sentiment analysis of code-mixed tweets. While the CNN component helps in the classification of positive and negative tweets, the self-attention based LSTM, helps in the classification of neutral tweets, because of its ability to identify correct sentiment among multiple sentiment bearing units. We achieved F1 scores of 0.707 (ranked 5th) and 0.725 (ranked 13th) on Hindi-English (Hinglish) and Spanish-English (Spanglish) datasets, respectively. The submissions for Hinglish and Spanglish tasks were made under the usernames ayushk and harsh_6 respectively."
A novel approach to sentiment analysis in Persian using discourse and external semantic information,"Sentiment analysis attempts to identify, extract and quantify affective states and subjective information from various types of data such as text, audio, and video. Many approaches have been proposed to extract the sentiment of individuals from documents written in natural languages in recent years. The majority of these approaches have focused on English, while resource-lean languages such as Persian suffer from the lack of research work and language resources. Due to this gap in Persian, the current work is accomplished to introduce new methods for sentiment analysis which have been applied on Persian. The proposed approach in this paper is two-fold: The first one is based on classifier combination, and the second one is based on deep neural networks which benefits from word embedding vectors. Both approaches takes advantage of local discourse information and external knowledge bases, and also cover several language issues such as negation and intensification, andaddresses different granularity levels, namely word, aspect, sentence, phrase and document-levels. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, a Persian dataset is collected from Persian hotel reviews referred as hotel reviews. The proposed approach has been compared to counterpart methods based on the benchmark dataset. The experimental results approve the effectiveness of the proposed approach when compared to related works."
Hierarchical Interaction Networks with Rethinking Mechanism for Document-level Sentiment Analysis,"Document-level Sentiment Analysis (DSA) is more challenging due to vague semantic links and complicate sentiment information. Recent works have been devoted to leveraging text summarization and have achieved promising results. However, these summarization-based methods did not take full advantage of the summary including ignoring the inherent interactions between the summary and document. As a result, they limited the representation to express major points in the document, which is highly indicative of the key sentiment. In this paper, we study how to effectively generate a discriminative representation with explicit subject patterns and sentiment contexts for DSA. A Hierarchical Interaction Networks (HIN) is proposed to explore bidirectional interactions between the summary and document at multiple granularities and learn subject-oriented document representations for sentiment classification. Furthermore, we design a Sentiment-based Rethinking mechanism (SR) by refining the HIN with sentiment label information to learn a more sentiment-aware document representation. We extensively evaluate our proposed models on three public datasets. The experimental results consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed models and show that HIN-SR outperforms various state-of-the-art methods."
Tweets Sentiment Analysis via Word Embeddings and Machine Learning Techniques,"Sentiment analysis of social media data consists of attitudes, assessments, and emotions which can be considered a way human think. Understanding and classifying the large collection of documents into positive and negative aspects are a very difficult task. Social networks such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram provide a platform in order to gather information about peoples sentiments and opinions. Considering the fact that people spend hours daily on social media and share their opinion on various different topics helps us analyze sentiments better. More and more companies are using social media tools to provide various services and interact with customers. Sentiment Analysis (SA) classifies the polarity of given tweets to positive and negative tweets in order to understand the sentiments of the public. This paper aims to perform sentiment analysis of real-time 2019 election twitter data using the feature selection model word2vec and the machine learning algorithm random forest for sentiment classification. Word2vec with Random Forest improves the accuracy of sentiment analysis significantly compared to traditional methods such as BOW and TF-IDF. Word2vec improves the quality of features by considering contextual semantics of words in a text hence improving the accuracy of machine learning and sentiment analysis."
The impact of political party/candidate on the election results from a sentiment analysis perspective using #AnambraDecides2017 tweets,"This work investigates empirically the impact of political party control over its candidates or vice versa on winning an election using a natural language processing technique called sentiment analysis (SA). To do this, a set of 7430 tweets bearing or related to #AnambraDecides2017 was streamed during the November 18, 2017, Anambra State gubernatorial election. These are Twitter discussions on the top five political parties and their candidates termed political actors in this paper. We conduct polarity and subjectivity sentiment analyses on all the tweets considering time as a useful dimension of SA. Furthermore, we use the word frequency to find words most associated with the political actors in a given time. We find most talked about topics using a topic modeling algorithm and how the computed sentiments and most frequent words are related to the topics per political actor. Among other things, we deduced from the experimental results that even though a political party serves as a platform that sales the personality of a candidate, the acceptance of the candidate/party adds to the winning of an election. For example, we found the winner of the election Willie Obiano benefiting from the values his party share among the people of the State. Associating his name with his party, All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA) displays more positive sentiments and the subjective sentiment analysis indicates that Twitter users mentioning APGA are less emotionally subjective in their tweets than the other parties."
News Sentiment Analysis,"Modern technological era has reshaped traditional lifestyle in several domains. The medium of publishing news and events has become faster with the advancement of Information Technology. IT has also been flooded with immense amounts of data, which is being published every minute of every day, by millions of users, in the shape of comments, blogs, news sharing through blogs, social media micro-blogging websites and many more. Manual traversal of such huge data is a challenging job, thus, sophisticated methods are acquired to perform this task automatically and efficiently. News reports events that comprise of emotions - good, bad, neutral. Sentiment analysis is utilized to investigate human emotions present in textual information. This paper presents a lexicon-based approach for sentiment analysis of news articles. The experiments have been performed on BBC news data set, which expresses the applicability and validation of the adopted approach."
Sentiment Analysis on Customer Responses,"Sentiment analysis is one of the fastest spreading research areas in computer science, making it challenging to keep track of all the activities in the area. We present a customer feedback reviews on product, where we utilize opinion mining, text mining and sentiments, which has affected the surrounded world by changing their opinion on a specific product. Data used in this study are online product reviews collected from Amazon.com. We performed a comparative sentiment analysis of retrieved reviews. This research paper provides you with sentimental analysis of various smart phone opinions on smart phones dividing them Positive, Negative and Neutral Behaviour."
Sentiment Analysis on Social Media Content,"Nowadays, people from all around the world use social media sites to share information. Twitter for example is a platform in which users send, read posts known as tweets and interact with different communities. Users share their daily lives, post their opinions on everything such as brands and places. Companies can benefit from this massive platform by collecting data related to opinions on them. The aim of this paper is to present a model that can perform sentiment analysis of real data collected from Twitter. Data in Twitter is highly unstructured which makes it difficult to analyze. However, our proposed model is different from prior work in this field because it combined the use of supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms. The process of performing sentiment analysis as follows: Tweet extracted directly from Twitter API, then cleaning and discovery of data performed. After that the data were fed into several models for the purpose of training. Each tweet extracted classified based on its sentiment whether it is a positive, negative or neutral. Data were collected on two subjects McDonalds and KFC to show which restaurant has more popularity. Different machine learning algorithms were used. The result from these models were tested using various testing metrics like cross validation and f-score. Moreover, our model demonstrates strong performance on mining texts extracted directly from Twitter."
Sequential Domain Adaptation through Elastic Weight Consolidation for Sentiment Analysis,"Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) is a technique used in overcoming catastrophic forgetting between successive tasks trained on a neural network. We use this phenomenon of information sharing between tasks for domain adaptation. Training data for tasks such as sentiment analysis (SA) may not be fairly represented across multiple domains. Domain Adaptation (DA) aims to build algorithms that leverage information from source domains to facilitate performance on an unseen target domain. We propose a model-independent framework - Sequential Domain Adaptation (SDA). SDA draws on EWC for training on successive source domains to move towards a general domain solution, thereby solving the problem of domain adaptation. We test SDA on convolutional, recurrent, and attention-based architectures. Our experiments show that the proposed framework enables simple architectures such as CNNs to outperform complex state-of-the-art models in domain adaptation of SA. In addition, we observe that the effectiveness of a harder first Anti-Curriculum ordering of source domains leads to maximum performance."
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT): A sentiment analysis odyssey,"The purpose of the study is to investigate the relative effectiveness of four different sentiment analysis techniques: (1) unsupervised lexicon-based model using Sent WordNet; (2) traditional supervised machine learning model using logistic regression; (3) supervised deep learning model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM); and, (4) advanced supervised deep learning models using Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). We use publicly available labeled corpora of 50,000 movie reviews originally posted on internet movie database (IMDB) for analysis using Sent WordNet lexicon, logistic regression, LSTM, and BERT. The first three models were run on CPU based system whereas BERT was run on GPU based system. The sentiment classification performance was evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The study puts forth two key insights: (1) relative efficacy of four highly advanced and widely used sentiment analysis techniques; (2) undisputed superiority of pre-trained advanced supervised deep learning BERT model in sentiment analysis from text data. This study provides professionals in analytics industry and academicians working on text analysis key insight regarding comparative classification performance evaluation of key sentiment analysis techniques, including the recently developed BERT. This is the first research endeavor to compare the advanced pre-trained supervised deep learning model of BERT vis-à-vis other sentiment analysis models of LSTM, logistic regression, and Sent WordNet."
A Data-driven Neural Network Architecture for Sentiment Analysis,"The fabulous results of convolution neural networks in image-related tasks, attracted attention of text mining, sentiment analysis and other text analysis researchers. It is however difficult to find enough data for feeding such networks, optimize their parameters, and make the right design choices when constructing network architectures. In this paper we present the creation steps of two big datasets of song emotions. We also explore usage of convolution and max-pooling neural layers on song lyrics, product and movie review text datasets. Three variants of a simple and flexible neural network architecture are also compared. Our intention was to spot any important patterns that can serve as guidelines for parameter optimization of similar models. We also wanted to identify architecture design choices which lead to high performing sentiment analysis models. To this end, we conducted a series of experiments with neural architectures of various configurations. Our results indicate that parallel convolutions of filter lengths up to three are usually enough for capturing relevant text features. Also, max-pooling region size should be adapted to the length of text documents for producing the best feature maps. Top results we got are obtained with feature maps of lengths 6 to 18. An improvement on future neural network models for sentiment analysis, could be generating sentiment polarity prediction of documents using aggregation of predictions on smaller excerpt of the entire text."
A Transformer-based joint-encoding for Emotion Recognition and Sentiment Analysis,"Understanding expressed sentiment and emotions are two crucial factors in human multimodal language. This paper describes a Transformer-based joint-encoding (TBJE) for the task of Emotion Recognition and Sentiment Analysis. In addition to use the Transformer architecture, our approach relies on a modular co-attention and a glimpse layer to jointly encode one or more modalities. The proposed solution has also been submitted to the ACL20: Second Grand-Challenge on Multimodal Language to be evaluated on the CMU-MOSEI dataset. The code to replicate the presented experiments is open-source: https://github.com/jbdel/MOSEI_UMONS."
Real-Time Prediction of BITCOIN Price using Machine Learning Techniques and Public Sentiment Analysis,"Bitcoin is the first digital decentralized cryptocurrency that has shown a significant increase in market capitalization in recent years. The objective of this paper is to determine the predictable price direction of Bitcoin in USD by machine learning techniques and sentiment analysis. Twitter and Reddit have attracted a great deal of attention from researchers to study public sentiment. We have applied sentiment analysis and supervised machine learning principles to the extracted tweets from Twitter and Reddit posts, and we analyze the correlation between bitcoin price movements and sentiments in tweets. We explored several algorithms of machine learning using supervised learning to develop a prediction model and provide informative analysis of future market prices. Due to the difficulty of evaluating the exact nature of a Time Series(ARIMA) model, it is often very difficult to produce appropriate forecasts. Then we continue to implement Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with long short-term memory cells (LSTM). Thus, we analyzed the time series model prediction of bitcoin prices with greater efficiency using long short-term memory (LSTM) techniques and compared the predictability of bitcoin price and sentiment analysis of bitcoin tweets to the standard method (ARIMA). The RMSE (Root-mean-square error) of LSTM are 198.448 (single feature) and 197.515 (multi-feature) whereas the ARIMA model RMSE is 209.263 which shows that LSTM with multi feature shows the more accurate result."
Can you tell? SSNet -- a Sagittal Stratum-inspired Neural Network Framework for Sentiment Analysis,"When people try to understand nuanced language they typically process multiple input sensor modalities to complete this cognitive task. It turns out the human brain has even a specialized neuron formation, called sagittal stratum, to help us understand sarcasm. We use this biological formation as the inspiration for designing a neural network architecture that combines predictions of different models on the same text to construct robust, accurate and computationally efficient classifiers for sentiment analysis and study several different realizations. Among them, we propose a systematic new approach to combining multiple predictions based on a dedicated neural network and develop mathematical analysis of it along with state-of-the-art experimental results. We also propose a heuristic-hybrid technique for combining models and back it up with experimental results on a representative benchmark dataset and comparisons to other methods to show the advantages of the new approaches."
Systematic Attack Surface Reduction For Deployed Sentiment Analysis Models,"This work proposes a structured approach to baselining a model, identifying attack vectors, and securing the machine learning models after deployment. This method for securing each model post deployment is called the BAD (Build, Attack, and Defend) Architecture. Two implementations of the BAD architecture are evaluated to quantify the adversarial life cycle for a black box Sentiment Analysis system. As a challenging diagnostic, the Jigsaw Toxic Bias dataset is selected as the baseline in our performance tool. Each implementation of the architecture will build a baseline performance report, attack a common weakness, and defend the incoming attack. As an important note: each attack surface demonstrated in this work is detectable and preventable. The goal is to demonstrate a viable methodology for securing a machine learning model in a production setting."
Comparative Sentiment Analysis of App Reviews,"Google app market captures the school of thought of users via ratings and text reviews. The critique's viewpoint regarding an app is proportional to their satisfaction level. Consequently, this helps other users to gain insights before downloading or purchasing the apps. The potential information from the reviews can't be extracted manually, due to its exponential growth. Sentiment analysis, by machine learning algorithms employing NLP, is used to explicitly uncover and interpret the emotions. This study aims to perform the sentiment classification of the app reviews and identify the university students' behavior towards the app market. We applied machine learning algorithms using the TF-IDF text representation scheme and the performance was evaluated on the ensemble learning method. Our model was trained on Google reviews and tested on students' reviews. SVM recorded the maximum accuracy(93.37\%), F-score(0.88) on tri-gram + TF-IDF scheme. Bagging enhanced the performance of LR and NB with accuracy of 87.80\% and 85.5\% respectively."
Adversarial Training Based Multi-Source Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Sentiment Analysis,"Multi-source unsupervised domain adaptation (MS-UDA) for sentiment analysis (SA) aims to leverage useful information in multiple source domains to help do SA in an unlabeled target domain that has no supervised information. Existing algorithms of MS-UDA either only exploit the shared features, i.e., the domain-invariant information, or based on some weak assumption in NLP, e.g., smoothness assumption. To avoid these problems, we propose two transfer learning frameworks based on the multi-source domain adaptation methodology for SA by combining the source hypotheses to derive a good target hypothesis. The key feature of the first framework is a novel Weighting Scheme based Unsupervised Domain Adaptation framework (WS-UDA), which combine the source classifiers to acquire pseudo labels for target instances directly. While the second framework is a Two-Stage Training based Unsupervised Domain Adaptation framework (2ST-UDA), which further exploits these pseudo labels to train a target private extractor. Importantly, the weights assigned to each source classifier are based on the relations between target instances and source domains, which measured by a discriminator through the adversarial training. Furthermore, through the same discriminator, we also fulfill the separation of shared features and private features. Experimental results on two SA datasets demonstrate the promising performance of our frameworks, which outperforms unsupervised state-of-the-art competitors."
A Comprehensive Survey on Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis,"Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is the sub-field of Natural Language Processing that deals with essentially splitting our data into aspects ad finally extracting the sentiment information. ABSA is known to provide more information about the context than general sentiment analysis. In this study, our aim is to explore the various methodologies practiced while performing ABSA, and providing a comparative study. This survey paper discusses various solutions in-depth and gives a comparison between them. And is conveniently divided into sections to get a holistic view on the process."
CS-Embed at SemEval-2020 Task 9: The effectiveness of code-switched word embeddings for sentiment analysis,"The growing popularity and applications of sentiment analysis of social media posts has naturally led to sentiment analysis of posts written in multiple languages, a practice known as code-switching. While recent research into code-switched posts has focused on the use of multilingual word embeddings, these embeddings were not trained on code-switched data. In this work, we present word-embeddings trained on code-switched tweets, specifically those that make use of Spanish and English, known as Spanglish. We explore the embedding space to discover how they capture the meanings of words in both languages. We test the effectiveness of these embeddings by participating in SemEval 2020 Task 9: ~\emph{Sentiment Analysis on Code-Mixed Social Media Text}. We utilised them to train a sentiment classifier that achieves an F-1 score of 0.722. This is higher than the baseline for the competition of 0.656, with our team (codalab username \emph{francesita}) ranking 14 out of 29 participating teams, beating the baseline."
Sentiment Analysis Based on Deep Learning: A Comparative Study,"The study of public opinion can provide us with valuable information. The analysis of sentiment on social networks, such as Twitter or Facebook, has become a powerful means of learning about the users' opinions and has a wide range of applications. However, the efficiency and accuracy of sentiment analysis is being hindered by the challenges encountered in natural language processing (NLP). In recent years, it has been demonstrated that deep learning models are a promising solution to the challenges of NLP. This paper reviews the latest studies that have employed deep learning to solve sentiment analysis problems, such as sentiment polarity. Models using term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) and word embedding have been applied to a series of datasets. Finally, a comparative study has been conducted on the experimental results obtained for the different models and input features"
Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis of Scientific Reviews,"Scientific papers are complex and understanding the usefulness of these papers requires prior knowledge. Peer reviews are comments on a paper provided by designated experts on that field and hold a substantial amount of information, not only for the editors and chairs to make the final decision, but also to judge the potential impact of the paper. In this paper, we propose to use aspect-based sentiment analysis of scientific reviews to be able to extract useful information, which correlates well with the accept/reject decision.  While working on a dataset of close to 8k reviews from ICLR, one of the top conferences in the field of machine learning, we use an active learning framework to build a training dataset for aspect prediction, which is further used to obtain the aspects and sentiments for the entire dataset. We show that the distribution of aspect-based sentiments obtained from a review is significantly different for accepted and rejected papers. We use the aspect sentiments from these reviews to make an intriguing observation, certain aspects present in a paper and discussed in the review strongly determine the final recommendation. As a second objective, we quantify the extent of disagreement among the reviewers refereeing a paper. We also investigate the extent of disagreement between the reviewers and the chair and find that the inter-reviewer disagreement may have a link to the disagreement with the chair. One of the most interesting observations from this study is that reviews, where the reviewer score and the aspect sentiments extracted from the review text written by the reviewer are consistent, are also more likely to be concurrent with the chair's decision."
COVID-19: Social Media Sentiment Analysis on Reopening,"The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is the most talked topic in social media platforms in 2020. People are using social media such as Twitter to express their opinion and share information on a number of issues related to the COVID-19 in this stay at home order. In this paper, we investigate the sentiment and emotion of peoples in the United States on the subject of reopening. We choose the social media platform Twitter for our analysis and study the Tweets to discover the sentimental perspective, emotional perspective, and triggering words towards the reopening. During this COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have made some analysis on various social media dataset regarding lockdown and stay at home. However, in our analysis, we are particularly interested to analyse public sentiment on reopening. Our major finding is that when all states resorted to lockdown in March, people showed dominant emotion of fear, but as reopening starts people have less fear. While this may be true, due to this reopening phase daily positive cases are rising compared to the lockdown situation. Overall, people have a less negative sentiment towards the situation of reopening."
BiERU: Bidirectional Emotional Recurrent Unit for Conversational Sentiment Analysis,"Sentiment analysis in conversations has gained increasing attention in recent years for the growing amount of applications it can serve, e.g., sentiment analysis, recommender systems, and human-robot interaction. The main difference between conversational sentiment analysis and single sentence sentiment analysis is the existence of context information which may influence the sentiment of an utterance in a dialogue. How to effectively encode contextual information in dialogues, however, remains a challenge. Existing approaches employ complicated deep learning structures to distinguish different parties in a conversation and then model the context information. In this paper, we propose a fast, compact and parameter-efficient party-ignorant framework named bidirectional emotional recurrent unit for conversational sentiment analysis. In our system, a generalized neural tensor block followed by a two-channel classifier is designed to perform context compositionality and sentiment classification, respectively. Extensive experiments on three standard datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the state of the art in most cases."
Detecting Group Beliefs Related to 2018's Brazilian Elections in Tweets A Combined Study on Modeling Topics and Sentiment Analysis,"2018's Brazilian presidential elections highlighted the influence of alternative media and social networks, such as Twitter. In this work, we perform an analysis covering politically motivated discourses related to the second round in Brazilian elections. In order to verify whether similar discourses reinforce group engagement to personal beliefs, we collected a set of tweets related to political hashtags at that moment. To this end, we have used a combination of topic modeling approach with opinion mining techniques to analyze the motivated political discourses. Using SentiLex-PT, a Portuguese sentiment lexicon, we extracted from the dataset the top 5 most frequent group of words related to opinions. Applying a bag-of-words model, the cosine similarity calculation was performed between each opinion and the observed groups. This study allowed us to observe an exacerbated use of passionate discourses in the digital political scenario as a form of appreciation and engagement to the groups which convey similar beliefs."
SANA : Sentiment Analysis on Newspapers comments in Algeria,"It is very current in today life to seek for tracking the people opinion from their interaction with occurring events. A very common way to do that is comments in articles published in newspapers web sites dealing with contemporary events. Sentiment analysis or opinion mining is an emergent field who is the purpose is finding the behind phenomenon masked in opinionated texts. We are interested in our work by comments in Algerian newspaper websites. For this end, two corpora were used SANA and OCA. SANA corpus is created by collection of comments from three Algerian newspapers, and annotated by two Algerian Arabic native speakers, while OCA is a freely available corpus for sentiment analysis. For the classification we adopt Supports vector machines, naive Bayes and knearest neighbors. Obtained results are very promising and show the different effects of stemming in such domain, also knearest neighbors give important improvement comparing to other classifiers unlike similar works where SVM is the most dominant. From this study we observe the importance of dedicated resources and methods the newspaper comments sentiment analysis which we look forward in future works."
A Sentiment Analysis Dataset for Code-Mixed Malayalam-English,"There is an increasing demand for sentiment analysis of text from social media which are mostly code-mixed. Systems trained on monolingual data fail for code-mixed data due to the complexity of mixing at different levels of the text. However, very few resources are available for code-mixed data to create models specific for this data. Although much research in multilingual and cross-lingual sentiment analysis has used semi-supervised or unsupervised methods, supervised methods still performs better. Only a few datasets for popular languages such as English-Spanish, English-Hindi, and English-Chinese are available. There are no resources available for Malayalam-English code-mixed data. This paper presents a new gold standard corpus for sentiment analysis of code-mixed text in Malayalam-English annotated by voluntary annotators. This gold standard corpus obtained a Krippendorff's alpha above 0.8 for the dataset. We use this new corpus to provide the benchmark for sentiment analysis in Malayalam-English code-mixed texts."
Corpus Creation for Sentiment Analysis in Code-Mixed Tamil-English Text,"Understanding the sentiment of a comment from a video or an image is an essential task in many applications. Sentiment analysis of a text can be useful for various decision-making processes. One such application is to analyse the popular sentiments of videos on social media based on viewer comments. However, comments from social media do not follow strict rules of grammar, and they contain mixing of more than one language, often written in non-native scripts. Non-availability of annotated code-mixed data for a low-resourced language like Tamil also adds difficulty to this problem. To overcome this, we created a gold standard Tamil-English code-switched, sentiment-annotated corpus containing 15,744 comment posts from YouTube. In this paper, we describe the process of creating the corpus and assigning polarities. We present inter-annotator agreement and show the results of sentiment analysis trained on this corpus as a benchmark."
"Sentiment Analysis for Education with R: packages, methods and practical applications","Sentiment Analysis (SA) refers to a family of techniques at the crossroads of statistics, natural language processing, and computational linguistics. The primary goal is to detect the semantic orientation of individual opinions and comments expressed in written texts. There are several practical applications of SA in several domains. In an educational context, the use of this approach allows processing students' feedback, aiming at monitoring the teaching effectiveness of instructors and enhancing the learning experience. This paper wants to review the different R packages that can be used to carry on SA, comparing the implemented methods, discussing their characteristics, and showing how they perform by considering a simple example."
A review of sentiment analysis research in Arabic language,"Sentiment analysis is a task of natural language processing which has recently attracted increasing attention. However, sentiment analysis research has mainly been carried out for the English language. Although Arabic is ramping up as one of the most used languages on the Internet, only a few studies have focused on Arabic sentiment analysis so far. In this paper, we carry out an in-depth qualitative study of the most important research works in this context by presenting limits and strengths of existing approaches. In particular, we survey both approaches that leverage machine translation or transfer learning to adapt English resources to Arabic and approaches that stem directly from the Arabic language."
"Sentiment Analysis: Automatically Detecting Valence, Emotions, and Other Affectual States from Text","Recent advances in machine learning have led to computer systems that are human-like in behaviour. Sentiment analysis, the automatic determination of emotions in text, is allowing us to capitalize on substantial previously unattainable opportunities in commerce, public health, government policy, social sciences, and art. Further, analysis of emotions in text, from news to social media posts, is improving our understanding of not just how people convey emotions through language but also how emotions shape our behaviour. This article presents a sweeping overview of sentiment analysis research that includes: the origins of the field, the rich landscape of tasks, challenges, a survey of the methods and resources used, and applications. We also discuss discuss how, without careful fore-thought, sentiment analysis has the potential for harmful outcomes. We outline the latest lines of research in pursuit of fairness in sentiment analysis."
Improving Aspect-Level Sentiment Analysis with Aspect Extraction,"Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), a popular research area in NLP has two distinct parts -- aspect extraction (AE) and labeling the aspects with sentiment polarity (ALSA). Although distinct, these two tasks are highly correlated. The work primarily hypothesize that transferring knowledge from a pre-trained AE model can benefit the performance of ALSA models. Based on this hypothesis, word embeddings are obtained during AE and subsequently, feed that to the ALSA model. Empirically, this work show that the added information significantly improves the performance of three different baseline ALSA models on two distinct domains. This improvement also translates well across domains between AE and ALSA tasks."
"Neutrality May Matter: Sentiment Analysis in Reviews of Airbnb, Booking, and Couchsurfing in Brazil and USA","Information and communications technologies have enabled the rise of the phenomenon named sharing economy, which represents activities between people, coordinated by online platforms, to obtain, provide, or share access to goods and services. In hosting services of the sharing economy, it is common to have a personal contact between the host and guest, and this may affect users' decision to do negative reviews, as negative reviews can damage the offered services. To evaluate this issue, we collected reviews from two sharing economy platforms, Airbnb and Couchsurfing, and from one platform that works mostly with hotels (traditional economy), Booking.com, for some cities in Brazil and the USA. Trough a sentiment analysis, we found that reviews in the sharing economy tend to be considerably more positive than those in the traditional economy. This can represent a problem in those systems, as an experiment with volunteers performed in this study suggests. In addition, we discuss how to exploit the results obtained to help improve users' decision making."
SKEP: Sentiment Knowledge Enhanced Pre-training for Sentiment Analysis,"Recently, sentiment analysis has seen remarkable advance with the help of pre-training approaches. However, sentiment knowledge, such as sentiment words and aspect-sentiment pairs, is ignored in the process of pre-training, despite the fact that they are widely used in traditional sentiment analysis approaches. In this paper, we introduce Sentiment Knowledge Enhanced Pre-training (SKEP) in order to learn a unified sentiment representation for multiple sentiment analysis tasks. With the help of automatically-mined knowledge, SKEP conducts sentiment masking and constructs three sentiment knowledge prediction objectives, so as to embed sentiment information at the word, polarity and aspect level into pre-trained sentiment representation. In particular, the prediction of aspect-sentiment pairs is converted into multi-label classification, aiming to capture the dependency between words in a pair. Experiments on three kinds of sentiment tasks show that SKEP significantly outperforms strong pre-training baseline, and achieves new state-of-the-art results on most of the test datasets. We release our code at https://github.com/baidu/Senta."
A SentiWordNet Strategy for Curriculum Learning in Sentiment Analysis,"Curriculum Learning (CL) is the idea that learning on a training set sequenced or ordered in a manner where samples range from easy to difficult, results in an increment in performance over otherwise random ordering. The idea parallels cognitive science's theory of how human brains learn, and that learning a difficult task can be made easier by phrasing it as a sequence of easy to difficult tasks. This idea has gained a lot of traction in machine learning and image processing for a while and recently in Natural Language Processing (NLP). In this paper, we apply the ideas of curriculum learning, driven by SentiWordNet in a sentiment analysis setting. In this setting, given a text segment, our aim is to extract its sentiment or polarity. SentiWordNet is a lexical resource with sentiment polarity annotations. By comparing performance with other curriculum strategies and with no curriculum, the effectiveness of the proposed strategy is presented. Convolutional, Recurrence, and Attention-based architectures are employed to assess this improvement. The models are evaluated on a standard sentiment dataset, Stanford Sentiment Treebank."
Sentiment Analysis Using Simplified Long Short-term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks,"LSTM or Long Short Term Memory Networks is a specific type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that is very effective in dealing with long sequence data and learning long term dependencies. In this work, we perform sentiment analysis on a GOP Debate Twitter dataset. To speed up training and reduce the computational cost and time, six different parameter reduced slim versions of the LSTM model (slim LSTM) are proposed. We evaluate two of these models on the dataset. The performance of these two LSTM models along with the standard LSTM model is compared. The effect of Bidirectional LSTM Layers is also studied. The work also consists of a study to choose the best architecture, apart from establishing the best set of hyper parameters for different LSTM Models."
MISA: Modality-Invariant and -Specific Representations for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis,"Multimodal Sentiment Analysis is an active area of research that leverages multimodal signals for affective understanding of user-generated videos. The predominant approach, addressing this task, has been to develop sophisticated fusion techniques. However, the heterogeneous nature of the signals creates distributional modality gaps that pose significant challenges. In this paper, we aim to learn effective modality representations to aid the process of fusion. We propose a novel framework, MISA, which projects each modality to two distinct subspaces. The first subspace is modality-invariant, where the representations across modalities learn their commonalities and reduce the modality gap. The second subspace is modality-specific, which is private to each modality and captures their characteristic features. These representations provide a holistic view of the multimodal data, which is used for fusion that leads to task predictions. Our experiments on popular sentiment analysis benchmarks, MOSI and MOSEI, demonstrate significant gains over state-of-the-art models. We also consider the task of Multimodal Humor Detection and experiment on the recently proposed UR_FUNNY dataset. Here too, our model fares better than strong baselines, establishing MISA as a useful multimodal framework."
A Position Aware Decay Weighted Network for Aspect based Sentiment Analysis,"Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is the task of identifying sentiment polarity of a text given another text segment or aspect. In ABSA, a text can have multiple sentiments depending upon each aspect. Aspect Term Sentiment Analysis (ATSA) is a subtask of ABSA, in which aspect terms are contained within the given sentence. Most of the existing approaches proposed for ATSA, incorporate aspect information through a different subnetwork thereby overlooking the advantage of aspect terms' presence within the sentence. In this paper, we propose a model that leverages the positional information of the aspect. The proposed model introduces a decay mechanism based on position. This decay function mandates the contribution of input words for ABSA. The contribution of a word declines as farther it is positioned from the aspect terms in the sentence. The performance is measured on two standard datasets from SemEval 2014 Task 4. In comparison with recent architectures, the effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated."
KinGDOM: Knowledge-Guided DOMain adaptation for sentiment analysis,"Cross-domain sentiment analysis has received significant attention in recent years, prompted by the need to combat the domain gap between different applications that make use of sentiment analysis. In this paper, we take a novel perspective on this task by exploring the role of external commonsense knowledge. We introduce a new framework, KinGDOM, which utilizes the ConceptNet knowledge graph to enrich the semantics of a document by providing both domain-specific and domain-general background concepts. These concepts are learned by training a graph convolutional autoencoder that leverages inter-domain concepts in a domain-invariant manner. Conditioning a popular domain-adversarial baseline method with these learned concepts helps improve its performance over state-of-the-art approaches, demonstrating the efficacy of our proposed framework."
Beneath the Tip of the Iceberg: Current Challenges and New Directions in Sentiment Analysis Research,"Sentiment analysis as a field has come a long way since it was first introduced as a task nearly 20 years ago. It has widespread commercial applications in various domains like marketing, risk management, market research, and politics, to name a few. Given its saturation in specific subtasks -- such as sentiment polarity classification -- and datasets, there is an underlying perception that this field has reached its maturity. In this article, we discuss this perception by pointing out the shortcomings and under-explored, yet key aspects of this field that are necessary to attain true sentiment understanding. We analyze the significant leaps responsible for its current relevance. Further, we attempt to chart a possible course for this field that covers many overlooked and unanswered questions."
MuSe 2020 -- The First International Multimodal Sentiment Analysis in Real-life Media Challenge and Workshop,"Multimodal Sentiment Analysis in Real-life Media (MuSe) 2020 is a Challenge-based Workshop focusing on the tasks of sentiment recognition, as well as emotion-target engagement and trustworthiness detection by means of more comprehensively integrating the audio-visual and language modalities. The purpose of MuSe 2020 is to bring together communities from different disciplines; mainly, the audio-visual emotion recognition community (signal-based), and the sentiment analysis community (symbol-based). We present three distinct sub-challenges: MuSe-Wild, which focuses on continuous emotion (arousal and valence) prediction; MuSe-Topic, in which participants recognise domain-specific topics as the target of 3-class (low, medium, high) emotions; and MuSe-Trust, in which the novel aspect of trustworthiness is to be predicted. In this paper, we provide detailed information on MuSe-CaR, the first of its kind in-the-wild database, which is utilised for the challenge, as well as the state-of-the-art features and modelling approaches applied. For each sub-challenge, a competitive baseline for participants is set; namely, on test we report for MuSe-Wild a combined (valence and arousal) CCC of .2568, for MuSe-Topic a score (computed as 0.34\cdot UAR + 0.66\cdotF1) of 76.78 % on the 10-class topic and 40.64 % on the 3-class emotion prediction, and for MuSe-Trust a CCC of .4359."
TUNIZI: a Tunisian Arabizi sentiment analysis Dataset,"On social media, Arabic people tend to express themselves in their own local dialects. More particularly, Tunisians use the informal way called ""Tunisian Arabizi"". Analytical studies seek to explore and recognize online opinions aiming to exploit them for planning and prediction purposes such as measuring the customer satisfaction and establishing sales and marketing strategies. However, analytical studies based on Deep Learning are data hungry. On the other hand, African languages and dialects are considered low resource languages. For instance, to the best of our knowledge, no annotated Tunisian Arabizi dataset exists. In this paper, we introduce TUNIZI a sentiment analysis Tunisian Arabizi Dataset, collected from social networks, preprocessed for analytical studies and annotated manually by Tunisian native speakers."
Sentiment Analysis of Yelp Reviews: A Comparison of Techniques and Models,"We use over 350,000 Yelp reviews on 5,000 restaurants to perform an ablation study on text preprocessing techniques. We also compare the effectiveness of several machine learning and deep learning models on predicting user sentiment (negative, neutral, or positive). For machine learning models, we find that using binary bag-of-word representation, adding bi-grams, imposing minimum frequency constraints and normalizing texts have positive effects on model performance. For deep learning models, we find that using pre-trained word embeddings and capping maximum length often boost model performance. Finally, using macro F1 score as our comparison metric, we find simpler models such as Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine to be more effective at predicting sentiments than more complex models such as Gradient Boosting, LSTM and BERT."
DomBERT: Domain-oriented Language Model for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis,"This paper focuses on learning domain-oriented language models driven by end tasks, which aims to combine the worlds of both general-purpose language models (such as ELMo and BERT) and domain-specific language understanding. We propose DomBERT, an extension of BERT to learn from both in-domain corpus and relevant domain corpora. This helps in learning domain language models with low-resources. Experiments are conducted on an assortment of tasks in aspect-based sentiment analysis, demonstrating promising results."
Octa: Omissions and Conflicts in Target-Aspect Sentiment Analysis,"Sentiments in opinionated text are often determined by both aspects and target words (or targets). We observe that targets and aspects interrelate in subtle ways, often yielding conflicting sentiments. Thus, a naive aggregation of sentiments from aspects and targets treated separately, as in existing sentiment analysis models, impairs performance.  We propose Octa, an approach that jointly considers aspects and targets when inferring sentiments. To capture and quantify relationships between targets and context words, Octa uses a selective self-attention mechanism that handles implicit or missing targets. Specifically, Octa involves two layers of attention mechanisms for, respectively, selective attention between targets and context words and attention over words based on aspects. On benchmark datasets, Octa outperforms leading models by a large margin, yielding (absolute) gains in accuracy of 1.6% to 4.3%."
Relational Graph Attention Network for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis,"Aspect-based sentiment analysis aims to determine the sentiment polarity towards a specific aspect in online reviews. Most recent efforts adopt attention-based neural network models to implicitly connect aspects with opinion words. However, due to the complexity of language and the existence of multiple aspects in a single sentence, these models often confuse the connections. In this paper, we address this problem by means of effective encoding of syntax information. Firstly, we define a unified aspect-oriented dependency tree structure rooted at a target aspect by reshaping and pruning an ordinary dependency parse tree. Then, we propose a relational graph attention network (R-GAT) to encode the new tree structure for sentiment prediction. Extensive experiments are conducted on the SemEval 2014 and Twitter datasets, and the experimental results confirm that the connections between aspects and opinion words can be better established with our approach, and the performance of the graph attention network (GAT) is significantly improved as a consequence."
Survey on Visual Sentiment Analysis,"Visual Sentiment Analysis aims to understand how images affect people, in terms of evoked emotions. Although this field is rather new, a broad range of techniques have been developed for various data sources and problems, resulting in a large body of research. This paper reviews pertinent publications and tries to present an exhaustive overview of the field. After a description of the task and the related applications, the subject is tackled under different main headings. The paper also describes principles of design of general Visual Sentiment Analysis systems from three main points of view: emotional models, dataset definition, feature design. A formalization of the problem is discussed, considering different levels of granularity, as well as the components that can affect the sentiment toward an image in different ways. To this aim, this paper considers a structured formalization of the problem which is usually used for the analysis of text, and discusses it's suitability in the context of Visual Sentiment Analysis. The paper also includes a description of new challenges, the evaluation from the viewpoint of progress toward more sophisticated systems and related practical applications, as well as a summary of the insights resulting from this study."
A Deep Learning System for Sentiment Analysis of Service Calls,"Sentiment analysis is crucial for the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI). Sentiment understanding can help AI to replicate human language and discourse. Studying the formation and response of sentiment state from well-trained Customer Service Representatives (CSRs) can help make the interaction between humans and AI more intelligent. In this paper, a sentiment analysis pipeline is first carried out with respect to real-world multi-party conversations - that is, service calls. Based on the acoustic and linguistic features extracted from the source information, a novel aggregated method for voice sentiment recognition framework is built. Each party's sentiment pattern during the communication is investigated along with the interaction sentiment pattern between all parties."
That Message Went Viral?! Exploratory Analytics and Sentiment Analysis into the Propagation of Tweets,"Information exchange and message diffusion have moved from traditional media to social media platforms. Messages on platforms such as Twitter have become the default mode of company communications replacing lengthier public announcements and updates. Businesses and organizations have increased their use of Twitter to connect with stakeholders. As a result, it is important to understand the key drivers of successful information exchange and message diffusion via Twitter. We conducted an exploratory analysis on a dataset of over a million Tweets, comprising of over 40,000 lead Tweets, further filtered to over 18,000 Tweets. We identified the most popular messages, and analyzed the tweets on multiple endogenous dimensions including content, sentiment, motive and richness, and exogenous dimensions such as fundamental events, social learning, and activism. We found some interesting patterns and uncovered new insights to help researchers and practitioners better understand the behavior of popular viral tweets. We also performed sentiment analysis and present an early stage model to explain tweet performance."
A Hybrid Approach for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis Using Deep Contextual Word Embeddings and Hierarchical Attention,"The Web has become the main platform where people express their opinions about entities of interest and their associated aspects. Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) aims to automatically compute the sentiment towards these aspects from opinionated text. In this paper we extend the state-of-the-art Hybrid Approach for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (HAABSA) method in two directions. First we replace the non-contextual word embeddings with deep contextual word embeddings in order to better cope with the word semantics in a given text. Second, we use hierarchical attention by adding an extra attention layer to the HAABSA high-level representations in order to increase the method flexibility in modeling the input data. Using two standard datasets (SemEval 2015 and SemEval 2016) we show that the proposed extensions improve the accuracy of the built model for ABSA."
How recurrent networks implement contextual processing in sentiment analysis,"Neural networks have a remarkable capacity for contextual processing--using recent or nearby inputs to modify processing of current input. For example, in natural language, contextual processing is necessary to correctly interpret negation (e.g. phrases such as ""not bad""). However, our ability to understand how networks process context is limited. Here, we propose general methods for reverse engineering recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to identify and elucidate contextual processing. We apply these methods to understand RNNs trained on sentiment classification. This analysis reveals inputs that induce contextual effects, quantifies the strength and timescale of these effects, and identifies sets of these inputs with similar properties. Additionally, we analyze contextual effects related to differential processing of the beginning and end of documents. Using the insights learned from the RNNs we improve baseline Bag-of-Words models with simple extensions that incorporate contextual modification, recovering greater than 90% of the RNN's performance increase over the baseline. This work yields a new understanding of how RNNs process contextual information, and provides tools that should provide similar insight more broadly."
Keywords Extraction and Sentiment Analysis using Automatic Speech Recognition,"Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is the interdisciplinary subfield of computational linguistics that develops methodologies and technologies that enables the recognition and translation of spoken language into text by computers. It incorporates knowledge and research in linguistics, computer science, and electrical engineering fields. Sentiment analysis is contextual mining of text which identifies and extracts subjective information in the source material and helping a business to understand the social sentiment of their brand, product or service while monitoring online conversations. According to the speech structure, three models are used in speech recognition to do the match: Acoustic Model, Phonetic Dictionary and Language Model. Any speech recognition program is evaluated using two factors: Accuracy (percentage error in converting spoken words to digital data) and Speed (the extent to which the program can keep up with a human speaker). For the purpose of converting speech to text (STT), we will be studying the following open source toolkits: CMU Sphinx and Kaldi. The toolkits use Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and I-vector for feature extraction. CMU Sphinx has been used with pre-trained Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), while Kaldi is used with pre-trained Neural Networks (NNET) as acoustic models. The n-gram language models contain the phonemes or pdf-ids for generating the most probable hypothesis (transcription) in the form of a lattice. The speech dataset is stored in the form of .raw or .wav file and is transcribed in .txt file. The system then tries to identify opinions within the text, and extract the following attributes: Polarity (if the speaker expresses a positive or negative opinion) and Keywords (the thing that is being talked about)."
Word frequency and sentiment analysis of twitter messages during Coronavirus pandemic,"The Coronavirus pandemic has taken the world by storm as also the social media. As the awareness about the ailment increased, so did messages, videos and posts acknowledging its presence. The social networking site, Twitter, demonstrated similar effect with the number of posts related to coronavirus showing an unprecedented growth in a very short span of time. This paper presents a statistical analysis of the twitter messages related to this disease posted since January 2020. Two types of empirical studies have been performed. The first is on word frequency and the second on sentiments of the individual tweet messages. Inspection of the word frequency is useful in characterizing the patterns or trends in the words used on the site. This would also reflect on the psychology of the twitter users at this critical juncture. Unigram, bigram and trigram frequencies have been modeled by power law distribution. The results have been validated by Sum of Square Error (SSE), R2 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). High values of R2 and low values of SSE and RMSE lay the grounds for the goodness of fit of this model. Sentiment analysis has been conducted to understand the general attitudes of the twitter users at this time. Both tweets by general public and WHO were part of the corpus. The results showed that the majority of the tweets had a positive polarity and only about 15% were negative."
A Dependency Syntactic Knowledge Augmented Interactive Architecture for End-to-End Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis,"The aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) task remains to be a long-standing challenge, which aims to extract the aspect term and then identify its sentiment orientation.In previous approaches, the explicit syntactic structure of a sentence, which reflects the syntax properties of natural language and hence is intuitively crucial for aspect term extraction and sentiment recognition, is typically neglected or insufficiently modeled. In this paper, we thus propose a novel dependency syntactic knowledge augmented interactive architecture with multi-task learning for end-to-end ABSA. This model is capable of fully exploiting the syntactic knowledge (dependency relations and types) by leveraging a well-designed Dependency Relation Embedded Graph Convolutional Network (DreGcn). Additionally, we design a simple yet effective message-passing mechanism to ensure that our model learns from multiple related tasks in a multi-task learning framework. Extensive experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Besides, we achieve further improvements by using BERT as an additional feature extractor."
An Iterative Multi-Knowledge Transfer Network for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis,"Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) mainly involves three subtasks: aspect term extraction, opinion term extraction, and aspect-level sentiment classification, which are typically handled in a separate or joint manner. However, previous approaches do not well exploit the interactive relations among three subtasks and do not pertinently leverage the easily available document-level labeled domain/sentiment knowledge, which restricts their performances. To address these issues, we propose a novel Iterative Multi-Knowledge Transfer Network (IMKTN) for end-to-end ABSA. For one thing, through the interactive correlations between the ABSA subtasks, our IMKTN transfers the task-specific knowledge from any two of the three subtasks to another one at the token level by utilizing a well-designed routing algorithm, that is, any two of the three subtasks will help the third one. For another, our IMKTN pertinently transfers the document-level knowledge, i.e., domain-specific and sentiment-related knowledge, to the aspect-level subtasks to further enhance the corresponding performance. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach."
Can We Use SE-specific Sentiment Analysis Tools in a Cross-Platform Setting?,"In this paper, we address the problem of using sentiment analysis tools 'off-the-shelf,' that is when a gold standard is not available for retraining. We evaluate the performance of four SE-specific tools in a cross-platform setting, i.e., on a test set collected from data sources different from the one used for training. We find that (i) the lexicon-based tools outperform the supervised approaches retrained in a cross-platform setting and (ii) retraining can be beneficial in within-platform settings in the presence of robust gold standard datasets, even using a minimal training set. Based on our empirical findings, we derive guidelines for reliable use of sentiment analysis tools in software engineering."
Sentiment Analysis in Drug Reviews using Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms,"Sentiment Analysis is an important algorithm in Natural Language Processing which is used to detect sentiment within some text. In our project, we had chosen to work on analyzing reviews of various drugs which have been reviewed in form of texts and have also been given a rating on a scale from 1-10. We had obtained this data set from the UCI machine learning repository which had 2 data sets: train and test (split as 75-25\%). We had split the number rating for the drug into three classes in general: positive (7-10), negative (1-4) or neutral(4-7). There are multiple reviews for the drugs that belong to a similar condition and we decided to investigate how the reviews for different conditions use different words impact the ratings of the drugs. Our intention was mainly to implement supervised machine learning classification algorithms that predict the class of the rating using the textual review. We had primarily implemented different embeddings such as Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF) and the Count Vectors (CV). We had trained models on the most popular conditions such as ""Birth Control"", ""Depression"" and ""Pain"" within the data set and obtained good results while predicting the test data sets."
Toward Tag-free Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis: A Multiple Attention Network Approach,"Existing aspect based sentiment analysis (ABSA) approaches leverage various neural network models to extract the aspect sentiments via learning aspect-specific feature representations. However, these approaches heavily rely on manual tagging of user reviews according to the predefined aspects as the input, a laborious and time-consuming process. Moreover, the underlying methods do not explain how and why the opposing aspect level polarities in a user review lead to the overall polarity. In this paper, we tackle these two problems by designing and implementing a new Multiple-Attention Network (MAN) approach for more powerful ABSA without the need for aspect tags using two new tag-free data sets crawled directly from TripAdvisor ({https://www.tripadvisor.com}). With the Self- and Position-Aware attention mechanism, MAN is capable of extracting both aspect level and overall sentiments from the text reviews using the aspect level and overall customer ratings, and it can also detect the vital aspect(s) leading to the overall sentiment polarity among different aspects via a new aspect ranking scheme. We carry out extensive experiments to demonstrate the strong performance of MAN compared to other state-of-the-art ABSA approaches and the explainability of our approach by visualizing and interpreting attention weights in case studies."
A Novel Twitter Sentiment Analysis Model with Baseline Correlation for Financial Market Prediction with Improved Efficiency,"A novel social networks sentiment analysis model is proposed based on Twitter sentiment score (TSS) for real-time prediction of the future stock market price FTSE 100, as compared with conventional econometric models of investor sentiment based on closed-end fund discount (CEFD). The proposed TSS model features a new baseline correlation approach, which not only exhibits a decent prediction accuracy, but also reduces the computation burden and enables a fast decision making without the knowledge of historical data. Polynomial regression, classification modelling and lexicon-based sentiment analysis are performed using R. The obtained TSS predicts the future stock market trend in advance by 15 time samples (30 working hours) with an accuracy of 67.22% using the proposed baseline criterion without referring to historical TSS or market data. Specifically, TSS's prediction performance of an upward market is found far better than that of a downward market. Under the logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis, the accuracy of TSS in predicting the upward trend of the future market achieves 97.87%."
Sentiment Analysis with Contextual Embeddings and Self-Attention,"In natural language the intended meaning of a word or phrase is often implicit and depends on the context. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective method for sentiment analysis using contextual embeddings and a self-attention mechanism. The experimental results for three languages, including morphologically rich Polish and German, show that our model is comparable to or even outperforms state-of-the-art models. In all cases the superiority of models leveraging contextual embeddings is demonstrated. Finally, this work is intended as a step towards introducing a universal, multilingual sentiment classifier."
A Precisely Xtreme-Multi Channel Hybrid Approach For Roman Urdu Sentiment Analysis,"In order to accelerate the performance of various Natural Language Processing tasks for Roman Urdu, this paper for the very first time provides 3 neural word embeddings prepared using most widely used approaches namely Word2vec, FastText, and Glove. The integrity of generated neural word embeddings is evaluated using intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation approaches. Considering the lack of publicly available benchmark datasets, it provides a first-ever Roman Urdu dataset which consists of 3241 sentiments annotated against positive, negative and neutral classes. To provide benchmark baseline performance over the presented dataset, we adapt diverse machine learning (Support Vector Machine Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes), deep learning (convolutional neural network, recurrent neural network), and hybrid approaches. Effectiveness of generated neural word embeddings is evaluated by comparing the performance of machine and deep learning based methodologies using 7, and 5 distinct feature representation approaches respectively. Finally, it proposes a novel precisely extreme multi-channel hybrid methodology which outperforms state-of-the-art adapted machine and deep learning approaches by the figure of 9%, and 4% in terms of F1-score. Roman Urdu Sentiment Analysis, Pretrain word embeddings for Roman Urdu, Word2Vec, Glove, Fast-Text"
Quality of Word Embeddings on Sentiment Analysis Tasks,"Word embeddings or distributed representations of words are being used in various applications like machine translation, sentiment analysis, topic identification etc. Quality of word embeddings and performance of their applications depends on several factors like training method, corpus size and relevance etc. In this study we compare performance of a dozen of pretrained word embedding models on lyrics sentiment analysis and movie review polarity tasks. According to our results, Twitter Tweets is the best on lyrics sentiment analysis, whereas Google News and Common Crawl are the top performers on movie polarity analysis. Glove trained models slightly outrun those trained with Skipgram. Also, factors like topic relevance and size of corpus significantly impact the quality of the models. When medium or large-sized text sets are available, obtaining word embeddings from same training dataset is usually the best choice."
Gated Mechanism for Attention Based Multimodal Sentiment Analysis,"Multimodal sentiment analysis has recently gained popularity because of its relevance to social media posts, customer service calls and video blogs. In this paper, we address three aspects of multimodal sentiment analysis; 1. Cross modal interaction learning, i.e. how multiple modalities contribute to the sentiment, 2. Learning long-term dependencies in multimodal interactions and 3. Fusion of unimodal and cross modal cues. Out of these three, we find that learning cross modal interactions is beneficial for this problem. We perform experiments on two benchmark datasets, CMU Multimodal Opinion level Sentiment Intensity (CMU-MOSI) and CMU Multimodal Opinion Sentiment and Emotion Intensity (CMU-MOSEI) corpus. Our approach on both these tasks yields accuracies of 83.9% and 81.1% respectively, which is 1.6% and 1.34% absolute improvement over current state-of-the-art."
What Emotions Make One or Five Stars? Understanding Ratings of Online Product Reviews by Sentiment Analysis and XAI,"When people buy products online, they primarily base their decisions on the recommendations of others given in online reviews. The current work analyzed these online reviews by sentiment analysis and used the extracted sentiments as features to predict the product ratings by several machine learning algorithms. These predictions were disentangled by various meth-ods of explainable AI (XAI) to understand whether the model showed any bias during prediction. Study 1 benchmarked these algorithms (knn, support vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting machines, XGBoost) and identified random forests and XGBoost as best algorithms for predicting the product ratings. In Study 2, the analysis of global feature importance identified the sentiment joy and the emotional valence negative as most predictive features. Two XAI visualization methods, local feature attributions and partial dependency plots, revealed several incorrect prediction mechanisms on the instance-level. Performing the benchmarking as classification, Study 3 identified a high no-information rate of 64.4% that indicated high class imbalance as underlying reason for the identified problems. In conclusion, good performance by machine learning algorithms must be taken with caution because the dataset, as encountered in this work, could be biased towards certain predictions. This work demonstrates how XAI methods reveal such prediction bias."
Multilogue-Net: A Context Aware RNN for Multi-modal Emotion Detection and Sentiment Analysis in Conversation,"Sentiment Analysis and Emotion Detection in conversation is key in several real-world applications, with an increase in modalities available aiding a better understanding of the underlying emotions. Multi-modal Emotion Detection and Sentiment Analysis can be particularly useful, as applications will be able to use specific subsets of available modalities, as per the available data. Current systems dealing with Multi-modal functionality fail to leverage and capture - the context of the conversation through all modalities, the dependency between the listener(s) and speaker emotional states, and the relevance and relationship between the available modalities. In this paper, we propose an end to end RNN architecture that attempts to take into account all the mentioned drawbacks. Our proposed model, at the time of writing, out-performs the state of the art on a benchmark dataset on a variety of accuracy and regression metrics."
Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentiment Analysis in Persian Social Media,"With the social media engagement on the rise, the resulting data can be used as a rich resource for analyzing and understanding different phenomena around us. A sentiment analysis system employs these data to find the attitude of social media users towards certain entities in a given document. In this paper we propose a sentiment analysis method for Persian text using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a feedforward Artificial Neural Network, that categorize sentences into two and five classes (considering their intensity) by applying a layer of convolution over input data through different filters. We evaluated the method on three different datasets of Persian social media texts using Area under Curve metric. The final results show the advantage of using CNN over earlier attempts at developing traditional machine learning methods for Persian texts sentiment classification especially for short texts."
Sentiment Analysis Using Averaged Weighted Word Vector Features,"People use the world wide web heavily to share their experience with entities such as products, services, or travel destinations. Texts that provide online feedback in the form of reviews and comments are essential to make consumer decisions. These comments create a valuable source that may be used to measure satisfaction related to products or services. Sentiment analysis is the task of identifying opinions expressed in such text fragments. In this work, we develop two methods that combine different types of word vectors to learn and estimate polarity of reviews. We develop average review vectors from word vectors and add weights to this review vectors using word frequencies in positive and negative sensitivity-tagged reviews. We applied the methods to several datasets from different domains that are used as standard benchmarks for sentiment analysis. We ensemble the techniques with each other and existing methods, and we make a comparison with the approaches in the literature. The results show that the performances of our approaches outperform the state-of-the-art success rates."
Utilizing BERT Intermediate Layers for Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis and Natural Language Inference,"Aspect based sentiment analysis aims to identify the sentimental tendency towards a given aspect in text. Fine-tuning of pretrained BERT performs excellent on this task and achieves state-of-the-art performances. Existing BERT-based works only utilize the last output layer of BERT and ignore the semantic knowledge in the intermediate layers. This paper explores the potential of utilizing BERT intermediate layers to enhance the performance of fine-tuning of BERT. To the best of our knowledge, no existing work has been done on this research. To show the generality, we also apply this approach to a natural language inference task. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed approach."
Performance Comparison of Crowdworkers and NLP Tools on Named-Entity Recognition and Sentiment Analysis of Political Tweets,"We report results of a comparison of the accuracy of crowdworkers and seven Natural Language Processing (NLP) toolkits in solving two important NLP tasks, named-entity recognition (NER) and entity-level sentiment (ELS) analysis. We here focus on a challenging dataset, 1,000 political tweets that were collected during the U.S. presidential primary election in February 2016. Each tweet refers to at least one of four presidential candidates, i.e., four named entities. The groundtruth, established by experts in political communication, has entity-level sentiment information for each candidate mentioned in the tweet. We tested several commercial and open-source tools. Our experiments show that, for our dataset of political tweets, the most accurate NER system, Google Cloud NL, performed almost on par with crowdworkers, but the most accurate ELS analysis system, TensiStrength, did not match the accuracy of crowdworkers by a large margin of more than 30 percent points."
Deriving Emotions and Sentiments from Visual Content: A Disaster Analysis Use Case,"Sentiment analysis aims to extract and express a person's perception, opinions and emotions towards an entity, object, product and a service, enabling businesses to obtain feedback from the consumers. The increasing popularity of the social networks and users' tendency towards sharing their feelings, expressions and opinions in text, visual and audio content has opened new opportunities and challenges in sentiment analysis. While sentiment analysis of text streams has been widely explored in the literature, sentiment analysis of images and videos is relatively new. This article introduces visual sentiment analysis and contrasts it with textual sentiment analysis with emphasis on the opportunities and challenges in this nascent research area. We also propose a deep visual sentiment analyzer for disaster-related images as a use-case, covering different aspects of visual sentiment analysis starting from data collection, annotation, model selection, implementation and evaluations. We believe such rigorous analysis will provide a baseline for future research in the domain."
Unsupervised Sentiment Analysis for Code-mixed Data,"Code-mixing is the practice of alternating between two or more languages. Mostly observed in multilingual societies, its occurrence is increasing and therefore its importance. A major part of sentiment analysis research has been monolingual, and most of them perform poorly on code-mixed text. In this work, we introduce methods that use different kinds of multilingual and cross-lingual embeddings to efficiently transfer knowledge from monolingual text to code-mixed text for sentiment analysis of code-mixed text. Our methods can handle code-mixed text through a zero-shot learning. Our methods beat state-of-the-art on English-Spanish code-mixed sentiment analysis by absolute 3\% F1-score. We are able to achieve 0.58 F1-score (without parallel corpus) and 0.62 F1-score (with parallel corpus) on the same benchmark in a zero-shot way as compared to 0.68 F1-score in supervised settings. Our code is publicly available."
Adversarial Training for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis with BERT,"Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) deals with the extraction of sentiments and their targets. Collecting labeled data for this task in order to help neural networks generalize better can be laborious and time-consuming. As an alternative, similar data to the real-world examples can be produced artificially through an adversarial process which is carried out in the embedding space. Although these examples are not real sentences, they have been shown to act as a regularization method which can make neural networks more robust. In this work, we apply adversarial training, which was put forward by Goodfellow et al. (2014), to the post-trained BERT (BERT-PT) language model proposed by Xu et al. (2019) on the two major tasks of Aspect Extraction and Aspect Sentiment Classification in sentiment analysis. After improving the results of post-trained BERT by an ablation study, we propose a novel architecture called BERT Adversarial Training (BAT) to utilize adversarial training in ABSA. The proposed model outperforms post-trained BERT in both tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on the application of adversarial training in ABSA."
Predictive analysis of Bitcoin price considering social sentiments,"We report on the use of sentiment analysis on news and social media to analyze and predict the price of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is the leading cryptocurrency and has the highest market capitalization among digital currencies. Predicting Bitcoin values may help understand and predict potential market movement and future growth of the technology. Unlike (mostly) repeating phenomena like weather, cryptocurrency values do not follow a repeating pattern and mere past value of Bitcoin does not reveal any secret of future Bitcoin value. Humans follow general sentiments and technical analysis to invest in the market. Hence considering people's sentiment can give a good degree of prediction. We focus on using social sentiment as a feature to predict future Bitcoin value, and in particular, consider Google News and Reddit posts. We find that social sentiment gives a good estimate of how future Bitcoin values may move. We achieve the lowest test RMSE of 434.87 using an LSTM that takes as inputs the historical price of various cryptocurrencies, the sentiment of news articles and the sentiment of Reddit posts."
Multi-modal Sentiment Analysis using Super Characters Method on Low-power CNN Accelerator Device,"Recent years NLP research has witnessed the record-breaking accuracy improvement by DNN models. However, power consumption is one of the practical concerns for deploying NLP systems. Most of the current state-of-the-art algorithms are implemented on GPUs, which is not power-efficient and the deployment cost is also very high. On the other hand, CNN Domain Specific Accelerator (CNN-DSA) has been in mass production providing low-power and low cost computation power. In this paper, we will implement the Super Characters method on the CNN-DSA. In addition, we modify the Super Characters method to utilize the multi-modal data, i.e. text plus tabular data in the CL-Aff sharedtask."
Emotion and Sentiment Lexicon Impact on Sentiment Analysis Applied to Book Reviews,"Consumers are used to consulting posted reviews on the Internet before buying a product. But it's difficult to know the global opinion considering the important number of those reviews. Sentiment analysis afford detecting polarity (positive, negative, neutral) in a expressed opinion and therefore classifying those reviews. Our purpose is to determine the influence of emotions on the polarity of books reviews. We define ""bag-of-words"" representation models of reviews which use a lexicon containing emotional (anticipation, sadness, fear, anger, joy, surprise, trust, disgust) and sentimental (positive, negative) words. This lexicon afford measuring felt emotions types by readers. The implemented supervised learning used is a Random Forest type. The application concerns Amazon platform's reviews. Mots-cl{é}s : Analyse de sentiments, Analyse d'{é}motions (texte), Classification de polarit{é} de sentiments"
Knowledge Discovery from Social Media using Big Data provided Sentiment Analysis (SoMABiT),"In todays competitive business world, being aware of customer needs and market-oriented production is a key success factor for industries. To this aim, the use of efficient analytic algorithms ensures a better understanding of customer feedback and improves the next generation of products. Accordingly, the dramatic increase in using social media in daily life provides beneficial sources for market analytics. But how traditional analytic algorithms and methods can scale up for such disparate and multi-structured data sources is the main challenge in this regard. This paper presents and discusses the technological and scientific focus of the SoMABiT as a social media analysis platform using big data technology. Sentiment analysis has been employed in order to discover knowledge from social media. The use of MapReduce and developing a distributed algorithm towards an integrated platform that can scale for any data volume and provide a social media-driven knowledge is the main novelty of the proposed concept in comparison to the state-of-the-art technologies."
A BERT based Sentiment Analysis and Key Entity Detection Approach for Online Financial Texts,"The emergence and rapid progress of the Internet have brought ever-increasing impact on financial domain. How to rapidly and accurately mine the key information from the massive negative financial texts has become one of the key issues for investors and decision makers. Aiming at the issue, we propose a sentiment analysis and key entity detection approach based on BERT, which is applied in online financial text mining and public opinion analysis in social media. By using pre-train model, we first study sentiment analysis, and then we consider key entity detection as a sentence matching or Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) task in different granularity. Among them, we mainly focus on negative sentimental information. We detect the specific entity by using our approach, which is different from traditional Named Entity Recognition (NER). In addition, we also use ensemble learning to improve the performance of proposed approach. Experimental results show that the performance of our approach is generally higher than SVM, LR, NBM, and BERT for two financial sentiment analysis and key entity detection datasets."
Generating Word and Document Embeddings for Sentiment Analysis,"Sentiments of words differ from one corpus to another. Inducing general sentiment lexicons for languages and using them cannot, in general, produce meaningful results for different domains. In this paper, we combine contextual and supervised information with the general semantic representations of words occurring in the dictionary. Contexts of words help us capture the domain-specific information and supervised scores of words are indicative of the polarities of those words. When we combine supervised features of words with the features extracted from their dictionary definitions, we observe an increase in the success rates. We try out the combinations of contextual, supervised, and dictionary-based approaches, and generate original vectors. We also combine the word2vec approach with hand-crafted features. We induce domain-specific sentimental vectors for two corpora, which are the movie domain and the Twitter datasets in Turkish. When we thereafter generate document vectors and employ the support vector machines method utilising those vectors, our approaches perform better than the baseline studies for Turkish with a significant margin. We evaluated our models on two English corpora as well and these also outperformed the word2vec approach. It shows that our approaches are cross-domain and portable to other languages."
Language Independent Sentiment Analysis,"Social media platforms and online forums generate rapid and increasing amount of textual data. Businesses, government agencies, and media organizations seek to perform sentiment analysis on this rich text data. The results of these analytics are used for adapting marketing strategies, customizing products, security and various other decision makings. Sentiment analysis has been extensively studied and various methods have been developed for it with great success. These methods, however apply to texts written in a specific language. This limits applicability to a limited demographic and a specific geographic region. In this paper we propose a general approach for sentiment analysis on data containing texts from multiple languages. This enables all the applications to utilize the results of sentiment analysis in a language oblivious or language-independent fashion."
SemEval-2013 Task 2: Sentiment Analysis in Twitter,"In recent years, sentiment analysis in social media has attracted a lot of research interest and has been used for a number of applications. Unfortunately, research has been hindered by the lack of suitable datasets, complicating the comparison between approaches. To address this issue, we have proposed SemEval-2013 Task 2: Sentiment Analysis in Twitter, which included two subtasks: A, an expression-level subtask, and B, a message-level subtask. We used crowdsourcing on Amazon Mechanical Turk to label a large Twitter training dataset along with additional test sets of Twitter and SMS messages for both subtasks. All datasets used in the evaluation are released to the research community. The task attracted significant interest and a total of 149 submissions from 44 teams. The best-performing team achieved an F1 of 88.9% and 69% for subtasks A and B, respectively."
Event Outcome Prediction using Sentiment Analysis and Crowd Wisdom in Microblog Feeds,"Sentiment Analysis of microblog feeds has attracted considerable interest in recent times. Most of the current work focuses on tweet sentiment classification. But not much work has been done to explore how reliable the opinions of the mass (crowd wisdom) in social network microblogs such as twitter are in predicting outcomes of certain events such as election debates. In this work, we investigate whether crowd wisdom is useful in predicting such outcomes and whether their opinions are influenced by the experts in the field. We work in the domain of multi-label classification to perform sentiment classification of tweets and obtain the opinion of the crowd. This learnt sentiment is then used to predict outcomes of events such as: US Presidential Debate winners, Grammy Award winners, Super Bowl Winners. We find that in most of the cases, the wisdom of the crowd does indeed match with that of the experts, and in cases where they don't (particularly in the case of debates), we see that the crowd's opinion is actually influenced by that of the experts."
SemEval-2014 Task 9: Sentiment Analysis in Twitter,"We describe the Sentiment Analysis in Twitter task, ran as part of SemEval-2014. It is a continuation of the last year's task that ran successfully as part of SemEval-2013. As in 2013, this was the most popular SemEval task; a total of 46 teams contributed 27 submissions for subtask A (21 teams) and 50 submissions for subtask B (44 teams). This year, we introduced three new test sets: (i) regular tweets, (ii) sarcastic tweets, and (iii) LiveJournal sentences. We further tested on (iv) 2013 tweets, and (v) 2013 SMS messages. The highest F1-score on (i) was achieved by NRC-Canada at 86.63 for subtask A and by TeamX at 70.96 for subtask B."
SemEval-2015 Task 10: Sentiment Analysis in Twitter,"In this paper, we describe the 2015 iteration of the SemEval shared task on Sentiment Analysis in Twitter. This was the most popular sentiment analysis shared task to date with more than 40 teams participating in each of the last three years. This year's shared task competition consisted of five sentiment prediction subtasks. Two were reruns from previous years: (A) sentiment expressed by a phrase in the context of a tweet, and (B) overall sentiment of a tweet. We further included three new subtasks asking to predict (C) the sentiment towards a topic in a single tweet, (D) the overall sentiment towards a topic in a set of tweets, and (E) the degree of prior polarity of a phrase."
SemEval-2016 Task 4: Sentiment Analysis in Twitter,"This paper discusses the fourth year of the ``Sentiment Analysis in Twitter Task''. SemEval-2016 Task 4 comprises five subtasks, three of which represent a significant departure from previous editions. The first two subtasks are reruns from prior years and ask to predict the overall sentiment, and the sentiment towards a topic in a tweet. The three new subtasks focus on two variants of the basic ``sentiment classification in Twitter'' task. The first variant adopts a five-point scale, which confers an ordinal character to the classification task. The second variant focuses on the correct estimation of the prevalence of each class of interest, a task which has been called quantification in the supervised learning literature. The task continues to be very popular, attracting a total of 43 teams."
SemEval-2017 Task 4: Sentiment Analysis in Twitter,"This paper describes the fifth year of the Sentiment Analysis in Twitter task. SemEval-2017 Task 4 continues with a rerun of the subtasks of SemEval-2016 Task 4, which include identifying the overall sentiment of the tweet, sentiment towards a topic with classification on a two-point and on a five-point ordinal scale, and quantification of the distribution of sentiment towards a topic across a number of tweets: again on a two-point and on a five-point ordinal scale. Compared to 2016, we made two changes: (i) we introduced a new language, Arabic, for all subtasks, and (ii)~we made available information from the profiles of the Twitter users who posted the target tweets. The task continues to be very popular, with a total of 48 teams participating this year."
Sentiment Analysis of German Twitter,"This thesis explores the ways by how people express their opinions on German Twitter, examines current approaches to automatic mining of these feelings, and proposes novel methods, which outperform state-of-the-art techniques. For this purpose, I introduce a new corpus of German tweets that have been manually annotated with sentiments, their targets and holders, as well as polar terms and their contextual modifiers. Using these data, I explore four major areas of sentiment research: (i) generation of sentiment lexicons, (ii) fine-grained opinion mining, (iii) message-level polarity classification, and (iv) discourse-aware sentiment analysis. In the first task, I compare three popular groups of lexicon generation methods: dictionary-, corpus-, and word-embedding-based ones, finding that dictionary-based systems generally yield better lexicons than the last two groups. Apart from this, I propose a linear projection algorithm, whose results surpass many existing automatic lexicons. Afterwords, in the second task, I examine two common approaches to automatic prediction of sentiments, sources, and targets: conditional random fields and recurrent neural networks, obtaining higher scores with the former model and improving these results even further by redefining the structure of CRF graphs. When dealing with message-level polarity classification, I juxtapose three major sentiment paradigms: lexicon-, machine-learning-, and deep-learning-based systems, and try to unite the first and last of these groups by introducing a bidirectional neural network with lexicon-based attention. Finally, in order to make the new classifier aware of discourse structure, I let it separately analyze the elementary discourse units of each microblog and infer the overall polarity of a message from the scores of its EDUs with the help of two new approaches: latent-marginalized CRFs and Recursive Dirichlet Process."
Sentiment Analysis On Indian Indigenous Languages: A Review On Multilingual Opinion Mining,"An increase in the use of smartphones has laid to the use of the internet and social media platforms. The most commonly used social media platforms are Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram. People are sharing their personal experiences, reviews, feedbacks on the web. The information which is available on the web is unstructured and enormous. Hence, there is a huge scope of research on understanding the sentiment of the data available on the web. Sentiment Analysis (SA) can be carried out on the reviews, feedbacks, discussions available on the web. There has been extensive research carried out on SA in the English language, but data on the web also contains different other languages which should be analyzed. This paper aims to analyze, review and discuss the approaches, algorithms, challenges faced by the researchers while carrying out the SA on Indigenous languages."
Emotion helps Sentiment: A Multi-task Model for Sentiment and Emotion Analysis,"In this paper, we propose a two-layered multi-task attention based neural network that performs sentiment analysis through emotion analysis. The proposed approach is based on Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory and uses Distributional Thesaurus as a source of external knowledge to improve the sentiment and emotion prediction. The proposed system has two levels of attention to hierarchically build a meaningful representation. We evaluate our system on the benchmark dataset of SemEval 2016 Task 6 and also compare it with the state-of-the-art systems on Stance Sentiment Emotion Corpus. Experimental results show that the proposed system improves the performance of sentiment analysis by 3.2 F-score points on SemEval 2016 Task 6 dataset. Our network also boosts the performance of emotion analysis by 5 F-score points on Stance Sentiment Emotion Corpus."
Language-Independent Sentiment Analysis Using Subjectivity and Positional Information,"We describe a novel language-independent approach to the task of determining the polarity, positive or negative, of the author's opinion on a specific topic in natural language text. In particular, weights are assigned to attributes, individual words or word bi-grams, based on their position and on their likelihood of being subjective. The subjectivity of each attribute is estimated in a two-step process, where first the probability of being subjective is calculated for each sentence containing the attribute, and then these probabilities are used to alter the attribute's weights for polarity classification. The evaluation results on a standard dataset of movie reviews shows 89.85% classification accuracy, which rivals the best previously published results for this dataset for systems that use no additional linguistic information nor external resources."
Speech Sentiment Analysis via Pre-trained Features from End-to-end ASR Models,"In this paper, we propose to use pre-trained features from end-to-end ASR models to solve speech sentiment analysis as a down-stream task. We show that end-to-end ASR features, which integrate both acoustic and text information from speech, achieve promising results. We use RNN with self-attention as the sentiment classifier, which also provides an easy visualization through attention weights to help interpret model predictions. We use well benchmarked IEMOCAP dataset and a new large-scale speech sentiment dataset SWBD-sentiment for evaluation. Our approach improves the-state-of-the-art accuracy on IEMOCAP from 66.6% to 71.7%, and achieves an accuracy of 70.10% on SWBD-sentiment with more than 49,500 utterances."
Sentiment Analysis for Arabic in Social Media Network: A Systematic Mapping Study,"With the expansion in tenders on the Internet and social media, Arabic Sentiment Analysis (ASA) has assumed a significant position in the field of text mining study and has since remained used to explore the sentiments of users about services, various products or topics conversed over the Internet. This mapping paper designs to comprehensively investigate the papers demographics, fertility, and directions of the ASA research domain. Furthermore, plans to analyze current ASA techniques and find movements in the research. This paper describes a systematic mapping study (SMS) of 51 primary selected studies (PSS) is handled with the approval of an evidence-based systematic method to ensure handling of all related papers. The analyzed results showed the increase of both the ASA research area and numbers of publications per year since 2015. Three main research facets were found, i.e. validation, solution, and evaluation research, with solution research becoming more treatment than another research type. Therefore numerous contribution facets were singled out. In totality, the general demographics of the ASA research field were highlighted and discussed"
Subjective Sentiment Analysis for Arabic Newswire Comments,"This paper presents an approach based on supervised machine learning methods to discriminate between positive, negative and neutral Arabic reviews in online newswire. The corpus is labeled for subjectivity and sentiment analysis (SSA) at the sentence-level. The model uses both count and TF-IDF representations and apply six machine learning algorithms; Multinomial Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Multi-layer perceptron and k-nearest neighbors using uni-grams, bi-grams features. With the goal of extracting users sentiment from written text. Experimental results showed that n-gram features could substantially improve performance; and showed that the Multinomial Naive Bayes approach is the most accurate in predicting topic polarity. Best results were achieved using count vectors trained by combination of word-based uni-grams and bi-grams with an overall accuracy of 85.57% over two classes and 65.64% over three classes."
Making the Best Use of Review Summary for Sentiment Analysis,"Sentiment analysis provides a useful overview of customer review contents. Many review websites allow a user to enter a summary in addition to a full review. Intuitively, summary information may give additional benefit for review sentiment analysis. In this paper, we conduct a study to exploit methods for better use of summary information. We start by finding out that the sentimental signal distribution of a review and that of its corresponding summary are in fact complementary to each other. We thus explore various architectures to better guide the interactions between the two and propose a hierarchically-refined review-centric attention model. Empirical results show that our review-centric model can make better use of user-written summaries for review sentiment analysis, and is also more effective compared to existing methods when the user summary is replaced with summary generated by an automatic summarization system."
"Knowing What, How and Why: A Near Complete Solution for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis","Target-based sentiment analysis or aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) refers to addressing various sentiment analysis tasks at a fine-grained level, which includes but is not limited to aspect extraction, aspect sentiment classification, and opinion extraction. There exist many solvers of the above individual subtasks or a combination of two subtasks, and they can work together to tell a complete story, i.e. the discussed aspect, the sentiment on it, and the cause of the sentiment. However, no previous ABSA research tried to provide a complete solution in one shot. In this paper, we introduce a new subtask under ABSA, named aspect sentiment triplet extraction (ASTE). Particularly, a solver of this task needs to extract triplets (What, How, Why) from the inputs, which show WHAT the targeted aspects are, HOW their sentiment polarities are and WHY they have such polarities (i.e. opinion reasons). For instance, one triplet from ""Waiters are very friendly and the pasta is simply average"" could be ('Waiters', positive, 'friendly'). We propose a two-stage framework to address this task. The first stage predicts what, how and why in a unified model, and then the second stage pairs up the predicted what (how) and why from the first stage to output triplets. In the experiments, our framework has set a benchmark performance in this novel triplet extraction task. Meanwhile, it outperforms a few strong baselines adapted from state-of-the-art related methods."
Examining UK drill music through sentiment trajectory analysis,"This paper presents how techniques from natural language processing can be used to examine the sentiment trajectories of gang-related drill music in the United Kingdom (UK). This work is important because key public figures are loosely making controversial linkages between drill music and recent escalations in youth violence in London. Thus, this paper examines the dynamic use of sentiment in gang-related drill music lyrics. The findings suggest two distinct sentiment use patterns and statistical analyses revealed that lyrics with a markedly positive tone attract more views and engagement on YouTube than negative ones. Our work provides the first empirical insights into the language use of London drill music, and it can, therefore, be used in future studies and by policymakers to help understand the alleged drill-gang nexus."
Sentiment analysis model for Twitter data in Polish language,"Text mining analysis of tweets gathered during Polish presidential election on May 10th, 2015. The project included implementation of engine to retrieve information from Twitter, building document corpora, corpora cleaning, and creating Term-Document Matrix. Each tweet from the text corpora was assigned a category based on its sentiment score. The score was calculated using the number of positive and/or negative emoticons and Polish words in each document. The result data set was used to train and test four machine learning classifiers, to select these providing most accurate automatic tweet classification results. The Naive Bayes and Maximum Entropy algorithms achieved the best accuracy of respectively 71.76% and 77.32%. All implementation tasks were completed using R programming language."
Efficient Feature Selection techniques for Sentiment Analysis,"Sentiment analysis is a domain of study that focuses on identifying and classifying the ideas expressed in the form of text into positive, negative and neutral polarities. Feature selection is a crucial process in machine learning. In this paper, we aim to study the performance of different feature selection techniques for sentiment analysis. Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) is used as the feature extraction technique for creating feature vocabulary. Various Feature Selection (FS) techniques are experimented to select the best set of features from feature vocabulary. The selected features are trained using different machine learning classifiers Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Tree (DT) and Naive Bayes (NB). Ensemble techniques Bagging and Random Subspace are applied on classifiers to enhance the performance on sentiment analysis. We show that, when the best FS techniques are trained using ensemble methods achieve remarkable results on sentiment analysis. We also compare the performance of FS methods trained using Bagging, Random Subspace with varied neural network architectures. We show that FS techniques trained using ensemble classifiers outperform neural networks requiring significantly less training time and parameters thereby eliminating the need for extensive hyper-parameter tuning."
Transferable End-to-End Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis with Selective Adversarial Learning,"Joint extraction of aspects and sentiments can be effectively formulated as a sequence labeling problem. However, such formulation hinders the effectiveness of supervised methods due to the lack of annotated sequence data in many domains. To address this issue, we firstly explore an unsupervised domain adaptation setting for this task. Prior work can only use common syntactic relations between aspect and opinion words to bridge the domain gaps, which highly relies on external linguistic resources. To resolve it, we propose a novel Selective Adversarial Learning (SAL) method to align the inferred correlation vectors that automatically capture their latent relations. The SAL method can dynamically learn an alignment weight for each word such that more important words can possess higher alignment weights to achieve fine-grained (word-level) adaptation. Empirically, extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SAL method."
An Efficient Model for Sentiment Analysis of Electronic Product Reviews in Vietnamese,"In the past few years, the growth of e-commerce and digital marketing in Vietnam has generated a huge volume of opinionated data. Analyzing those data would provide enterprises with insight for better business decisions. In this work, as part of the Advosights project, we study sentiment analysis of product reviews in Vietnamese. The final solution is based on Self-attention neural networks, a flexible architecture for text classification task with about 90.16% of accuracy in 0.0124 second, a very fast inference time."
Sentiment Analysis from Images of Natural Disasters,"Social media have been widely exploited to detect and gather relevant information about opinions and events. However, the relevance of the information is very subjective and rather depends on the application and the end-users. In this article, we tackle a specific facet of social media data processing, namely the sentiment analysis of disaster-related images by considering people's opinions, attitudes, feelings and emotions. We analyze how visual sentiment analysis can improve the results for the end-users/beneficiaries in terms of mining information from social media. We also identify the challenges and related applications, which could help defining a benchmark for future research efforts in visual sentiment analysis."
Assessing the Efficacy of Clinical Sentiment Analysis and Topic Extraction in Psychiatric Readmission Risk Prediction,"Predicting which patients are more likely to be readmitted to a hospital within 30 days after discharge is a valuable piece of information in clinical decision-making. Building a successful readmission risk classifier based on the content of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) has proved, however, to be a challenging task. Previously explored features include mainly structured information, such as sociodemographic data, comorbidity codes and physiological variables. In this paper we assess incorporating additional clinically interpretable NLP-based features such as topic extraction and clinical sentiment analysis to predict early readmission risk in psychiatry patients."
SentiCite: An Approach for Publication Sentiment Analysis,"With the rapid growth in the number of scientific publications, year after year, it is becoming increasingly difficult to identify quality authoritative work on a single topic. Though there is an availability of scientometric measures which promise to offer a solution to this problem, these measures are mostly quantitative and rely, for instance, only on the number of times an article is cited. With this approach, it becomes irrelevant if an article is cited 10 times in a positive, negative or neutral way. In this context, it is quite important to study the qualitative aspect of a citation to understand its significance. This paper presents a novel system for sentiment analysis of citations in scientific documents (SentiCite) and is also capable of detecting nature of citations by targeting the motivation behind a citation, e.g., reference to a dataset, reading reference. Furthermore, the paper also presents two datasets (SentiCiteDB and IntentCiteDB) containing about 2,600 citations with their ground truth for sentiment and nature of citation. SentiCite along with other state-of-the-art methods for sentiment analysis are evaluated on the presented datasets. Evaluation results reveal that SentiCite outperforms state-of-the-art methods for sentiment analysis in scientific publications by achieving a F1-measure of 0.71."
Can Sentiment Analysis Reveal Structure in a Plotless Novel?,"Modernist novels are thought to break with traditional plot structure. In this paper, we test this theory by applying Sentiment Analysis to one of the most famous modernist novels, To the Lighthouse by Virginia Woolf. We first assess Sentiment Analysis in light of the critique that it cannot adequately account for literary language: we use a unique statistical comparison to demonstrate that even simple lexical approaches to Sentiment Analysis are surprisingly effective. We then use the Syuzhet.R package to explore similarities and differences across modeling methods. This comparative approach, when paired with literary close reading, can offer interpretive clues. To our knowledge, we are the first to undertake a hybrid model that fully leverages the strengths of both computational analysis and close reading. This hybrid model raises new questions for the literary critic, such as how to interpret relative versus absolute emotional valence and how to take into account subjective identification. Our finding is that while To the Lighthouse does not replicate a plot centered around a traditional hero, it does reveal an underlying emotional structure distributed between characters - what we term a distributed heroine model. This finding is innovative in the field of modernist and narrative studies and demonstrates that a hybrid method can yield significant discoveries."
Exploiting BERT for End-to-End Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis,"In this paper, we investigate the modeling power of contextualized embeddings from pre-trained language models, e.g. BERT, on the E2E-ABSA task. Specifically, we build a series of simple yet insightful neural baselines to deal with E2E-ABSA. The experimental results show that even with a simple linear classification layer, our BERT-based architecture can outperform state-of-the-art works. Besides, we also standardize the comparative study by consistently utilizing a hold-out validation dataset for model selection, which is largely ignored by previous works. Therefore, our work can serve as a BERT-based benchmark for E2E-ABSA."
A Hybrid Persian Sentiment Analysis Framework: Integrating Dependency Grammar Based Rules and Deep Neural Networks,"Social media hold valuable, vast and unstructured information on public opinion that can be utilized to improve products and services. The automatic analysis of such data, however, requires a deep understanding of natural language. Current sentiment analysis approaches are mainly based on word co-occurrence frequencies, which are inadequate in most practical cases. In this work, we propose a novel hybrid framework for concept-level sentiment analysis in Persian language, that integrates linguistic rules and deep learning to optimize polarity detection. When a pattern is triggered, the framework allows sentiments to flow from words to concepts based on symbolic dependency relations. When no pattern is triggered, the framework switches to its subsymbolic counterpart and leverages deep neural networks (DNN) to perform the classification. The proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art approaches (including support vector machine, and logistic regression) and DNN classifiers (long short-term memory, and Convolutional Neural Networks) with a margin of 10-15% and 3-4% respectively, using benchmark Persian product and hotel reviews corpora."
Learning to Detect Opinion Snippet for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis,"Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is to predict the sentiment polarity towards a particular aspect in a sentence. Recently, this task has been widely addressed by the neural attention mechanism, which computes attention weights to softly select words for generating aspect-specific sentence representations. The attention is expected to concentrate on opinion words for accurate sentiment prediction. However, attention is prone to be distracted by noisy or misleading words, or opinion words from other aspects. In this paper, we propose an alternative hard-selection approach, which determines the start and end positions of the opinion snippet, and selects the words between these two positions for sentiment prediction. Specifically, we learn deep associations between the sentence and aspect, and the long-term dependencies within the sentence by leveraging the pre-trained BERT model. We further detect the opinion snippet by self-critical reinforcement learning. Especially, experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and prove that our hard-selection approach outperforms soft-selection approaches when handling multi-aspect sentences."
Atalaya at TASS 2019: Data Augmentation and Robust Embeddings for Sentiment Analysis,"In this article we describe our participation in TASS 2019, a shared task aimed at the detection of sentiment polarity of Spanish tweets. We combined different representations such as bag-of-words, bag-of-characters, and tweet embeddings. In particular, we trained robust subword-aware word embeddings and computed tweet representations using a weighted-averaging strategy. We also used two data augmentation techniques to deal with data scarcity: two-way translation augmentation, and instance crossover augmentation, a novel technique that generates new instances by combining halves of tweets. In experiments, we trained linear classifiers and ensemble models, obtaining highly competitive results despite the simplicity of our approaches."
Weighed Domain-Invariant Representation Learning for Cross-domain Sentiment Analysis,"Cross-domain sentiment analysis is currently a hot topic in the research and engineering areas. One of the most popular frameworks in this field is the domain-invariant representation learning (DIRL) paradigm, which aims to learn a distribution-invariant feature representation across domains. However, in this work, we find out that applying DIRL may harm domain adaptation when the label distribution \rm{P}(\rm{Y}) changes across domains. To address this problem, we propose a modification to DIRL, obtaining a novel weighted domain-invariant representation learning (WDIRL) framework. We show that it is easy to transfer existing SOTA DIRL models to WDIRL. Empirical studies on extensive cross-domain sentiment analysis tasks verified our statements and showed the effectiveness of our proposed solution."
Learning Explicit and Implicit Structures for Targeted Sentiment Analysis,"Targeted sentiment analysis is the task of jointly predicting target entities and their associated sentiment information. Existing research efforts mostly regard this joint task as a sequence labeling problem, building models that can capture explicit structures in the output space. However, the importance of capturing implicit global structural information that resides in the input space is largely unexplored. In this work, we argue that both types of information (implicit and explicit structural information) are crucial for building a successful targeted sentiment analysis model. Our experimental results show that properly capturing both information is able to lead to better performance than competitive existing approaches. We also conduct extensive experiments to investigate our model's effectiveness and robustness."
Tehran Stock Exchange Prediction Using Sentiment Analysis of Online Textual Opinions,"In this paper, we investigate the impact of the social media data in predicting the Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE) variables for the first time. We consider the closing price and daily return of three different stocks for this investigation. We collected our social media data from Sahamyab.com/stocktwits for about three months. To extract information from online comments, we propose a hybrid sentiment analysis approach that combines lexicon-based and learning-based methods. Since lexicons that are available for the Persian language are not practical for sentiment analysis in the stock market domain, we built a particular sentiment lexicon for this domain. After designing and calculating daily sentiment indices using the sentiment of the comments, we examine their impact on the baseline models that only use historical market data and propose new predictor models using multi regression analysis. In addition to the sentiments, we also examine the comments volume and the users' reliabilities. We conclude that the predictability of various stocks in TSE is different depending on their attributes. Moreover, we indicate that for predicting the closing price only comments volume and for predicting the daily return both the volume and the sentiment of the comments could be useful. We demonstrate that Users' Trust coefficients have different behaviors toward the three stocks."
A Novel Aspect-Guided Deep Transition Model for Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis,"Aspect based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims to identify the sentiment polarity towards the given aspect in a sentence, while previous models typically exploit an aspect-independent (weakly associative) encoder for sentence representation generation. In this paper, we propose a novel Aspect-Guided Deep Transition model, named AGDT, which utilizes the given aspect to guide the sentence encoding from scratch with the specially-designed deep transition architecture. Furthermore, an aspect-oriented objective is designed to enforce AGDT to reconstruct the given aspect with the generated sentence representation. In doing so, our AGDT can accurately generate aspect-specific sentence representation, and thus conduct more accurate sentiment predictions. Experimental results on multiple SemEval datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, which significantly outperforms the best reported results with the same setting."
A Joint Model for Aspect-Category Sentiment Analysis with Shared Sentiment Prediction Layer,"Aspect-category sentiment analysis (ACSA) aims to predict the aspect categories mentioned in texts and their corresponding sentiment polarities. Some joint models have been proposed to address this task. Given a text, these joint models detect all the aspect categories mentioned in the text and predict the sentiment polarities toward them at once. Although these joint models obtain promising performances, they train separate parameters for each aspect category and therefore suffer from data deficiency of some aspect categories. To solve this problem, we propose a novel joint model which contains a shared sentiment prediction layer. The shared sentiment prediction layer transfers sentiment knowledge between aspect categories and alleviates the problem caused by data deficiency. Experiments conducted on SemEval-2016 Datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model."
FinBERT: Financial Sentiment Analysis with Pre-trained Language Models,"Financial sentiment analysis is a challenging task due to the specialized language and lack of labeled data in that domain. General-purpose models are not effective enough because of the specialized language used in a financial context. We hypothesize that pre-trained language models can help with this problem because they require fewer labeled examples and they can be further trained on domain-specific corpora. We introduce FinBERT, a language model based on BERT, to tackle NLP tasks in the financial domain. Our results show improvement in every measured metric on current state-of-the-art results for two financial sentiment analysis datasets. We find that even with a smaller training set and fine-tuning only a part of the model, FinBERT outperforms state-of-the-art machine learning methods."
Fine-grained Sentiment Analysis with Faithful Attention,"While the general task of textual sentiment classification has been widely studied, much less research looks specifically at sentiment between a specified source and target. To tackle this problem, we experimented with a state-of-the-art relation extraction model. Surprisingly, we found that despite reasonable performance, the model's attention was often systematically misaligned with the words that contribute to sentiment. Thus, we directly trained the model's attention with human rationales and improved our model performance by a robust 4~8 points on all tasks we defined on our data sets. We also present a rigorous analysis of the model's attention, both trained and untrained, using novel and intuitive metrics. Our results show that untrained attention does not provide faithful explanations; however, trained attention with concisely annotated human rationales not only increases performance, but also brings faithful explanations. Encouragingly, a small amount of annotated human rationales suffice to correct the attention in our task."
TDAM: a Topic-Dependent Attention Model for Sentiment Analysis,"We propose a topic-dependent attention model for sentiment classification and topic extraction. Our model assumes that a global topic embedding is shared across documents and employs an attention mechanism to derive local topic embedding for words and sentences. These are subsequently incorporated in a modified Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) for sentiment classification and extraction of topics bearing different sentiment polarities. Those topics emerge from the words' local topic embeddings learned by the internal attention of the GRU cells in the context of a multi-task learning framework. In this paper, we present the hierarchical architecture, the new GRU unit and the experiments conducted on users' reviews which demonstrate classification performance on a par with the state-of-the-art methodologies for sentiment classification and topic coherence outperforming the current approaches for supervised topic extraction. In addition, our model is able to extract coherent aspect-sentiment clusters despite using no aspect-level annotations for training."
Shallow Domain Adaptive Embeddings for Sentiment Analysis,"This paper proposes a way to improve the performance of existing algorithms for text classification in domains with strong language semantics. We propose a domain adaptation layer learns weights to combine a generic and a domain specific (DS) word embedding into a domain adapted (DA) embedding. The DA word embeddings are then used as inputs to a generic encoder + classifier framework to perform a downstream task such as classification. This adaptation layer is particularly suited to datasets that are modest in size, and which are, therefore, not ideal candidates for (re)training a deep neural network architecture. Results on binary and multi-class classification tasks using popular encoder architectures, including current state-of-the-art methods (with and without the shallow adaptation layer) show the effectiveness of the proposed approach."
Variational Fusion for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis,"Multimodal fusion is considered a key step in multimodal tasks such as sentiment analysis, emotion detection, question answering, and others. Most of the recent work on multimodal fusion does not guarantee the fidelity of the multimodal representation with respect to the unimodal representations. In this paper, we propose a variational autoencoder-based approach for modality fusion that minimizes information loss between unimodal and multimodal representations. We empirically show that this method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin on several popular datasets."
Pars-ABSA: an Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis dataset for Persian,"Due to the increased availability of online reviews, sentiment analysis had been witnessed a booming interest from the researchers. Sentiment analysis is a computational treatment of sentiment used to extract and understand the opinions of authors. While many systems were built to predict the sentiment of a document or a sentence, many others provide the necessary detail on various aspects of the entity (i.e. aspect-based sentiment analysis). Most of the available data resources were tailored to English and the other popular European languages. Although Persian is a language with more than 110 million speakers, to the best of our knowledge, there is a lack of public dataset on aspect-based sentiment analysis for Persian. This paper provides a manually annotated Persian dataset, Pars-ABSA, which is verified by 3 native Persian speakers. The dataset consists of 5,114 positive, 3,061 negative and 1,827 neutral data samples from 5,602 unique reviews. Moreover, as a baseline, this paper reports the performance of some state-of-the-art aspect-based sentiment analysis methods with a focus on deep learning, on Pars-ABSA. The obtained results are impressive compared to similar English state-of-the-art."
Sentiment Analysis of Typhoon Related Tweets using Standard and Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks,"The Philippines is a common ground to natural calamities like typhoons, floods, volcanic eruptions and earthquakes. With Twitter as one of the most used social media platform in the Philippines, a total of 39,867 preprocessed tweets were obtained given a time frame starting from November 1, 2013 to January 31, 2014. Sentiment analysis determines the underlying emotion given a series of words. The main purpose of this study is to identify the sentiments expressed in the tweets sent by the Filipino people before, during, and after Typhoon Yolanda using two variations of Recurrent Neural Networks; standard and bidirectional. The best generated models after training with various hyperparameters achieved a high accuracy of 81.79% for fine-grained classification using standard RNN and 87.69% for binary classification using bidirectional RNN. Findings revealed that 51.1% of the tweets sent were positive expressing support, love, and words of courage to the victims; 19.8% were negative stating sadness and despair for the loss of lives and hate for corrupt officials; while the other 29% were neutral tweets from local news stations, announcements of relief operations, donation drives, and observations by citizens."
Sentiment Analysis at SEPLN (TASS)-2019: Sentiment Analysis at Tweet level using Deep Learning,"This paper describes the system submitted to ""Sentiment Analysis at SEPLN (TASS)-2019"" shared task. The task includes sentiment analysis of Spanish tweets, where the tweets are in different dialects spoken in Spain, Peru, Costa Rica, Uruguay and Mexico. The tweets are short (up to 240 characters) and the language is informal, i.e., it contains misspellings, emojis, onomatopeias etc. Sentiment analysis includes classification of the tweets into 4 classes, viz., Positive, Negative, Neutral and None. For preparing the proposed system, we use Deep Learning networks like LSTMs."
Airbnb Price Prediction Using Machine Learning and Sentiment Analysis,"Pricing a rental property on Airbnb is a challenging task for the owner as it determines the number of customers for the place. On the other hand, customers have to evaluate an offered price with minimal knowledge of an optimal value for the property. This paper aims to develop a reliable price prediction model using machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing techniques to aid both the property owners and the customers with price evaluation given minimal available information about the property. Features of the rentals, owner characteristics, and the customer reviews will comprise the predictors, and a range of methods from linear regression to tree-based models, support-vector regression (SVR), K-means Clustering (KMC), and neural networks (NNs) will be used for creating the prediction model."
Learning Invariant Representations for Sentiment Analysis: The Missing Material is Datasets,"Learning representations which remain invariant to a nuisance factor has a great interest in Domain Adaptation, Transfer Learning, and Fair Machine Learning. Finding such representations becomes highly challenging in NLP tasks since the nuisance factor is entangled in a raw text. To our knowledge, a major issue is also that only few NLP datasets allow assessing the impact of such factor. In this paper, we introduce two generalization metrics to assess model robustness to a nuisance factor: \textit{generalization under target bias} and \textit{generalization onto unknown}. We combine those metrics with a simple data filtering approach to control the impact of the nuisance factor on the data and thus to build experimental biased datasets. We apply our method to standard datasets of the literature (\textit{Amazon} and \textit{Yelp}). Our work shows that a simple text classification baseline (i.e., sentiment analysis on reviews) may be badly affected by the \textit{product ID} (considered as a nuisance factor) when learning the polarity of a review. The method proposed is generic and applicable as soon as the nuisance variable is annotated in the dataset."
Multi-modal Sentiment Analysis using Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis,"This paper learns multi-modal embeddings from text, audio, and video views/modes of data in order to improve upon down-stream sentiment classification. The experimental framework also allows investigation of the relative contributions of the individual views in the final multi-modal embedding. Individual features derived from the three views are combined into a multi-modal embedding using Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis (DCCA) in two ways i) One-Step DCCA and ii) Two-Step DCCA. This paper learns text embeddings using BERT, the current state-of-the-art in text encoders. We posit that this highly optimized algorithm dominates over the contribution of other views, though each view does contribute to the final result. Classification tasks are carried out on two benchmark datasets and on a new Debate Emotion data set, and together these demonstrate that the one-Step DCCA outperforms the current state-of-the-art in learning multi-modal embeddings."
"Smile, Be Happy :) Emoji Embedding for Visual Sentiment Analysis","Due to the lack of large-scale datasets, the prevailing approach in visual sentiment analysis is to leverage models trained for object classification in large datasets like ImageNet. However, objects are sentiment neutral which hinders the expected gain of transfer learning for such tasks. In this work, we propose to overcome this problem by learning a novel sentiment-aligned image embedding that is better suited for subsequent visual sentiment analysis. Our embedding leverages the intricate relation between emojis and images in large-scale and readily available data from social media. Emojis are language-agnostic, consistent, and carry a clear sentiment signal which make them an excellent proxy to learn a sentiment aligned embedding. Hence, we construct a novel dataset of 4 million images collected from Twitter with their associated emojis. We train a deep neural model for image embedding using emoji prediction task as a proxy. Our evaluation demonstrates that the proposed embedding outperforms the popular object-based counterpart consistently across several sentiment analysis benchmarks. Furthermore, without bell and whistles, our compact, effective and simple embedding outperforms the more elaborate and customized state-of-the-art deep models on these public benchmarks. Additionally, we introduce a novel emoji representation based on their visual emotional response which supports a deeper understanding of the emoji modality and their usage on social media."
ScenarioSA: A Large Scale Conversational Database for Interactive Sentiment Analysis,"Interactive sentiment analysis is an emerging, yet challenging, subtask of the sentiment analysis problem. It aims to discover the affective state and sentimental change of each person in a conversation. Existing sentiment analysis approaches are insufficient in modelling the interactions among people. However, the development of new approaches are critically limited by the lack of labelled interactive sentiment datasets. In this paper, we present a new conversational emotion database that we have created and made publically available, namely ScenarioSA. We manually label 2,214 multi-turn English conversations collected from natural contexts. In comparison with existing sentiment datasets, ScenarioSA (1) covers a wide range of scenarios; (2) describes the interactions between two speakers; and (3) reflects the sentimental evolution of each speaker over the course of a conversation. Finally, we evaluate various state-of-the-art algorithms on ScenarioSA, demonstrating the need of novel interactive sentiment analysis models and the potential of ScenarioSA to facilitate the development of such models."
Sentiment Analysis Challenges in Persian Language,"The rapid growth in data on the internet requires a data mining process to reach a decision to support insight. The Persian language has strong potential for deep research in any aspect of natural language processing, especially sentimental analysis approach. Thousands of websites and blogs updates and modifies by Persian users around the world that contains millions of Persian context. This range of application requires a comprehensive structured framework to extract beneficial information for helping enterprises to enhance their business and initiate a customer-centric management process by producing effective recommender systems. Sentimental analysis is an intelligent approach for extracting useful information from huge amounts of data to help an enterprise for smart management process. In this road, machine learning and deep learning techniques will become very helpful but there is the number of challenges which are face to them. This paper tried to present and assert the most important challenges of sentimental analysis in the Persian language. This language is an Indo-European language which spoken by over 110 million people around the world and is an official language in Iran, Tajikistan, and Afghanistan. Its also widely used in Uzbekistan, Pakistan and Turkish by order."
Sentiment and position-taking analysis of parliamentary debates: A systematic literature review,"Parliamentary and legislative debate transcripts provide access to information concerning the opinions, positions and policy preferences of elected politicians. They attract attention from researchers from a wide variety of backgrounds, from political and social sciences to computer science. As a result, the problem of automatic sentiment and position-taking analysis has been tackled from different perspectives, using varying approaches and methods, and with relatively little collaboration or cross-pollination of ideas. The existing research is scattered across publications from various fields and venues. In this article we present the results of a systematic literature review of 61 studies, all of which address the automatic analysis of the sentiment and opinions expressed and positions taken by speakers in parliamentary (and other legislative) debates. In this review, we discuss the available research with regard to the aims and objectives of the researchers who work on these problems, the automatic analysis tasks they undertake, and the approaches and methods they use. We conclude by summarizing their findings, discussing the challenges of applying computational analysis to parliamentary debates, and suggesting possible avenues for further research."
A Study of the Effect of Resolving Negation and Sentiment Analysis in Recognizing Text Entailment for Arabic,"Recognizing the entailment relation showed that its influence to extract the semantic inferences in wide-ranging natural language processing domains (text summarization, question answering, etc.) and enhanced the results of their output. For Arabic language, few attempts concerns with Arabic entailment problem. This paper aims to increase the entailment accuracy for Arabic texts by resolving negation of the text-hypothesis pair and determining the polarity of the text-hypothesis pair whether it is Positive, Negative or Neutral. It is noticed that the absence of negation detection feature gives inaccurate results when detecting the entailment relation since the negation revers the truth. The negation words are considered stop words and removed from the text-hypothesis pair which may lead wrong entailment decision. Another case not solved previously, it is impossible that the positive text entails negative text and vice versa. In this paper, in order to classify the text-hypothesis pair polarity, a sentiment analysis tool is used. We show that analyzing the polarity of the text-hypothesis pair increases the entailment accuracy. to evaluate our approach we used a dataset for Arabic textual entailment (ArbTEDS) consisted of 618 text-hypothesis pairs and showed that the Arabic entailment accuracy is increased by resolving negation for entailment relation and analyzing the polarity of the text-hypothesis pair."
SEntiMoji: An Emoji-Powered Learning Approach for Sentiment Analysis in Software Engineering,"Sentiment analysis has various application scenarios in software engineering (SE), such as detecting developers' emotions in commit messages and identifying their opinions on Q&A forums. However, commonly used out-of-the-box sentiment analysis tools cannot obtain reliable results on SE tasks and the misunderstanding of technical jargon is demonstrated to be the main reason. Then, researchers have to utilize labeled SE-related texts to customize sentiment analysis for SE tasks via a variety of algorithms. However, the scarce labeled data can cover only very limited expressions and thus cannot guarantee the analysis quality. To address such a problem, we turn to the easily available emoji usage data for help. More specifically, we employ emotional emojis as noisy labels of sentiments and propose a representation learning approach that uses both Tweets and GitHub posts containing emojis to learn sentiment-aware representations for SE-related texts. These emoji-labeled posts can not only supply the technical jargon, but also incorporate more general sentiment patterns shared across domains. They as well as labeled data are used to learn the final sentiment classifier. Compared to the existing sentiment analysis methods used in SE, the proposed approach can achieve significant improvement on representative benchmark datasets. By further contrast experiments, we find that the Tweets make a key contribution to the power of our approach. This finding informs future research not to unilaterally pursue the domain-specific resource, but try to transform knowledge from the open domain through ubiquitous signals such as emojis."
Deep neural network-based classification model for Sentiment Analysis,"The growing prosperity of social networks has brought great challenges to the sentimental tendency mining of users. As more and more researchers pay attention to the sentimental tendency of online users, rich research results have been obtained based on the sentiment classification of explicit texts. However, research on the implicit sentiment of users is still in its infancy. Aiming at the difficulty of implicit sentiment classification, a research on implicit sentiment classification model based on deep neural network is carried out. Classification models based on DNN, LSTM, Bi-LSTM and CNN were established to judge the tendency of the user's implicit sentiment text. Based on the Bi-LSTM model, the classification model of word-level attention mechanism is studied. The experimental results on the public dataset show that the established LSTM series classification model and CNN classification model can achieve good sentiment classification effect, and the classification effect is significantly better than the DNN model. The Bi-LSTM based attention mechanism classification model obtained the optimal R value in the positive category identification."
"Good Secretaries, Bad Truck Drivers? Occupational Gender Stereotypes in Sentiment Analysis","In this work, we investigate the presence of occupational gender stereotypes in sentiment analysis models. Such a task has implications for reducing implicit biases in these models, which are being applied to an increasingly wide variety of downstream tasks. We release a new gender-balanced dataset of 800 sentences pertaining to specific professions and propose a methodology for using it as a test bench to evaluate sentiment analysis models. We evaluate the presence of occupational gender stereotypes in 3 different models using our approach, and explore their relationship with societal perceptions of occupations."
A New Statistical Approach for Comparing Algorithms for Lexicon Based Sentiment Analysis,"Lexicon based sentiment analysis usually relies on the identification of various words to which a numerical value corresponding to sentiment can be assigned. In principle, classifiers can be obtained from these algorithms by comparison with human annotation, which is considered the gold standard. In practise this is difficult in languages such as Portuguese where there is a paucity of human annotated texts. Thus in order to compare algorithms, a next best step is to directly compare different algorithms with each other without referring to human annotation. In this paper we develop methods for a statistical comparison of algorithms which does not rely on human annotation or on known class labels. We will motivate the use of marginal homogeneity tests, as well as log linear models within the framework of maximum likelihood estimation We will also show how some uncertainties present in lexicon based sentiment analysis may be similar to those which occur in human annotated tweets. We will also show how the variability in the output of different algorithms is lexicon dependent, and quantify this variability in the output within the framework of log linear models."
Improving Sentiment Analysis with Multi-task Learning of Negation,"Sentiment analysis is directly affected by compositional phenomena in language that act on the prior polarity of the words and phrases found in the text. Negation is the most prevalent of these phenomena and in order to correctly predict sentiment, a classifier must be able to identify negation and disentangle the effect that its scope has on the final polarity of a text. This paper proposes a multi-task approach to explicitly incorporate information about negation in sentiment analysis, which we show outperforms learning negation implicitly in a data-driven manner. We describe our approach, a cascading neural architecture with selective sharing of LSTM layers, and show that explicitly training the model with negation as an auxiliary task helps improve the main task of sentiment analysis. The effect is demonstrated across several different standard English-language data sets for both tasks and we analyze several aspects of our system related to its performance, varying types and amounts of input data and different multi-task setups."
Curriculum Learning Strategies for Hindi-English Codemixed Sentiment Analysis,"Sentiment Analysis and other semantic tasks are commonly used for social media textual analysis to gauge public opinion and make sense from the noise on social media. The language used on social media not only commonly diverges from the formal language, but is compounded by codemixing between languages, especially in large multilingual societies like India.  Traditional methods for learning semantic NLP tasks have long relied on end to end task specific training, requiring expensive data creation process, even more so for deep learning methods. This challenge is even more severe for resource scarce texts like codemixed language pairs, with lack of well learnt representations as model priors, and task specific datasets can be few and small in quantities to efficiently exploit recent deep learning approaches. To address above challenges, we introduce curriculum learning strategies for semantic tasks in code-mixed Hindi-English (Hi-En) texts, and investigate various training strategies for enhancing model performance. Our method outperforms the state of the art methods for Hi-En codemixed sentiment analysis by 3.31% accuracy, and also shows better model robustness in terms of convergence, and variance in test performance."
Context-aware Embedding for Targeted Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis,"Attention-based neural models were employed to detect the different aspects and sentiment polarities of the same target in targeted aspect-based sentiment analysis (TABSA). However, existing methods do not specifically pre-train reasonable embeddings for targets and aspects in TABSA. This may result in targets or aspects having the same vector representations in different contexts and losing the context-dependent information. To address this problem, we propose a novel method to refine the embeddings of targets and aspects. Such pivotal embedding refinement utilizes a sparse coefficient vector to adjust the embeddings of target and aspect from the context. Hence the embeddings of targets and aspects can be refined from the highly correlative words instead of using context-independent or randomly initialized vectors. Experiment results on two benchmark datasets show that our approach yields the state-of-the-art performance in TABSA task."
An Interactive Multi-Task Learning Network for End-to-End Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis,"Aspect-based sentiment analysis produces a list of aspect terms and their corresponding sentiments for a natural language sentence. This task is usually done in a pipeline manner, with aspect term extraction performed first, followed by sentiment predictions toward the extracted aspect terms. While easier to develop, such an approach does not fully exploit joint information from the two subtasks and does not use all available sources of training information that might be helpful, such as document-level labeled sentiment corpus. In this paper, we propose an interactive multi-task learning network (IMN) which is able to jointly learn multiple related tasks simultaneously at both the token level as well as the document level. Unlike conventional multi-task learning methods that rely on learning common features for the different tasks, IMN introduces a message passing architecture where information is iteratively passed to different tasks through a shared set of latent variables. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance of the proposed method against multiple baselines on three benchmark datasets."
On the Effect of Word Order on Cross-lingual Sentiment Analysis,"Current state-of-the-art models for sentiment analysis make use of word order either explicitly by pre-training on a language modeling objective or implicitly by using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or convolutional networks (CNNs). This is a problem for cross-lingual models that use bilingual embeddings as features, as the difference in word order between source and target languages is not resolved. In this work, we explore reordering as a pre-processing step for sentence-level cross-lingual sentiment classification with two language combinations (English-Spanish, English-Catalan). We find that while reordering helps both models, CNNS are more sensitive to local reorderings, while global reordering benefits RNNs."
Sentiment analysis is not solved! Assessing and probing sentiment classification,"Neural methods for SA have led to quantitative improvements over previous approaches, but these advances are not always accompanied with a thorough analysis of the qualitative differences. Therefore, it is not clear what outstanding conceptual challenges for sentiment analysis remain. In this work, we attempt to discover what challenges still prove a problem for sentiment classifiers for English and to provide a challenging dataset. We collect the subset of sentences that an (oracle) ensemble of state-of-the-art sentiment classifiers misclassify and then annotate them for 18 linguistic and paralinguistic phenomena, such as negation, sarcasm, modality, etc. The dataset is available at https://github.com/ltgoslo/assessing_and_probing_sentiment. Finally, we provide a case study that demonstrates the usefulness of the dataset to probe the performance of a given sentiment classifier with respect to linguistic phenomena."
Open-Domain Targeted Sentiment Analysis via Span-Based Extraction and Classification,"Open-domain targeted sentiment analysis aims to detect opinion targets along with their sentiment polarities from a sentence. Prior work typically formulates this task as a sequence tagging problem. However, such formulation suffers from problems such as huge search space and sentiment inconsistency. To address these problems, we propose a span-based extract-then-classify framework, where multiple opinion targets are directly extracted from the sentence under the supervision of target span boundaries, and corresponding polarities are then classified using their span representations. We further investigate three approaches under this framework, namely the pipeline, joint, and collapsed models. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that our approach consistently outperforms the sequence tagging baseline. Moreover, we find that the pipeline model achieves the best performance compared with the other two models."
Detection and Prediction of Users Attitude Based on Real-Time and Batch Sentiment Analysis of Facebook Comments,"The most of the people have their account on social networks (e.g. Facebook, Vkontakte) where they express their attitude to different situations and events. Facebook provides only the positive mark as a like button and share. However, it is important to know the position of a certain user on posts even though the opinion is negative. Positive, negative and neutral attitude can be extracted from the comments of users. Overall information about positive, negative and neutral opinion can bring the understanding of how people react in a position. Moreover, it is important to know how attitude is changing during the time period. The contribution of the paper is a new method based on sentiment text analysis for detection and prediction negative and positive patterns for Facebook comments which combines (i) real-time sentiment text analysis for pattern discovery and (ii) batch data processing for creating opinion forecasting algorithm. To perform forecast we propose two-steps algorithm where: (i) patterns are clustered using unsupervised clustering techniques and (ii) trend prediction is performed based on finding the nearest pattern from the certain cluster. Case studies show the efficiency and accuracy (Avg. MAE = 0.008) of the proposed method and its practical applicability. Also, we discovered three types of users attitude patterns and described them."
Gradual Machine Learning for Aspect-level Sentiment Analysis,"The state-of-the-art solutions for Aspect-Level Sentiment Analysis (ALSA) were built on a variety of deep neural networks (DNN), whose efficacy depends on large amounts of accurately labeled training data. Unfortunately, high-quality labeled training data usually require expensive manual work, and may thus not be readily available in real scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel solution for ALSA based on the recently proposed paradigm of gradual machine learning, which can enable effective machine labeling without the requirement for manual labeling effort. It begins with some easy instances in an ALSA task, which can be automatically labeled by the machine with high accuracy, and then gradually labels the more challenging instances by iterative factor graph inference. In the process of gradual machine learning, the hard instances are gradually labeled in small stages based on the estimated evidential certainty provided by the labeled easier instances. Our extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets have shown that the performance of the proposed solution is considerably better than its unsupervised alternatives, and also highly competitive compared to the state-of-the-art supervised DNN techniques."
OutdoorSent: Sentiment Analysis of Urban Outdoor Images by Using Semantic and Deep Features,"Opinion mining in outdoor images posted by users during different activities can provide valuable information to better understand urban areas. In this regard, we propose a framework to classify the sentiment of outdoor images shared by users on social networks. We compare the performance of state-of-the-art ConvNet architectures, and one specifically designed for sentiment analysis. We also evaluate how the merging of deep features and semantic information derived from the scene attributes can improve classification and cross-dataset generalization performance. The evaluation explores a novel dataset, namely OutdoorSent, and other datasets publicly available. We observe that the incorporation of knowledge about semantic attributes improves the accuracy of all ConvNet architectures studied. Besides, we found that exploring only images related to the context of the study, outdoor in our case, is recommended, i.e., indoor images were not significantly helpful. Furthermore, we demonstrated the applicability of our results in the city of Chicago, USA, showing that they can help to improve the knowledge of subjective characteristics of different areas of the city. For instance, particular areas of the city tend to concentrate more images of a specific class of sentiment, which are also correlated with median income, opening up opportunities in different fields."
ArSentD-LEV: A Multi-Topic Corpus for Target-based Sentiment Analysis in Arabic Levantine Tweets,"Sentiment analysis is a highly subjective and challenging task. Its complexity further increases when applied to the Arabic language, mainly because of the large variety of dialects that are unstandardized and widely used in the Web, especially in social media. While many datasets have been released to train sentiment classifiers in Arabic, most of these datasets contain shallow annotation, only marking the sentiment of the text unit, as a word, a sentence or a document. In this paper, we present the Arabic Sentiment Twitter Dataset for the Levantine dialect (ArSenTD-LEV). Based on findings from analyzing tweets from the Levant region, we created a dataset of 4,000 tweets with the following annotations: the overall sentiment of the tweet, the target to which the sentiment was expressed, how the sentiment was expressed, and the topic of the tweet. Results confirm the importance of these annotations at improving the performance of a baseline sentiment classifier. They also confirm the gap of training in a certain domain, and testing in another domain."
A Study of Feature Extraction techniques for Sentiment Analysis,"Sentiment Analysis refers to the study of systematically extracting the meaning of subjective text . When analysing sentiments from the subjective text using Machine Learning techniques,feature extraction becomes a significant part. We perform a study on the performance of feature extraction techniques TF-IDF(Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and Doc2vec (Document to Vector) using Cornell movie review datasets, UCI sentiment labeled datasets, stanford movie review datasets,effectively classifying the text into positive and negative polarities by using various pre-processing methods like eliminating StopWords and Tokenization which increases the performance of sentiment analysis in terms of accuracy and time taken by the classifier.The features obtained after applying feature extraction techniques on the text sentences are trained and tested using the classifiers Logistic Regression,Support Vector Machines,K-Nearest Neighbours , Decision Tree and Bernoulli Nave Bayes"
Progressive Self-Supervised Attention Learning for Aspect-Level Sentiment Analysis,"In aspect-level sentiment classification (ASC), it is prevalent to equip dominant neural models with attention mechanisms, for the sake of acquiring the importance of each context word on the given aspect. However, such a mechanism tends to excessively focus on a few frequent words with sentiment polarities, while ignoring infrequent ones. In this paper, we propose a progressive self-supervised attention learning approach for neural ASC models, which automatically mines useful attention supervision information from a training corpus to refine attention mechanisms. Specifically, we iteratively conduct sentiment predictions on all training instances. Particularly, at each iteration, the context word with the maximum attention weight is extracted as the one with active/misleading influence on the correct/incorrect prediction of every instance, and then the word itself is masked for subsequent iterations. Finally, we augment the conventional training objective with a regularization term, which enables ASC models to continue equally focusing on the extracted active context words while decreasing weights of those misleading ones. Experimental results on multiple datasets show that our proposed approach yields better attention mechanisms, leading to substantial improvements over the two state-of-the-art neural ASC models. Source code and trained models are available at https://github.com/DeepLearnXMU/PSSAttention."
Algorithmic Detection and Analysis of Vaccine-Denialist Sentiment Clusters in Social Networks,"Vaccination rates are decreasing in many areas of the world, and outbreaks of preventable diseases tend to follow in areas with particular low rates. Much research has been devoted to improving our understanding of the motivations behind vaccination decisions and the effects of various types of information offered to skeptics, no large-scale study of the structure of online vaccination discourse have been conducted.  Here, we offer an approach to quantitatively study the vaccine discourse in an online system, exemplified by Twitter. We use train a deep neural network to predict tweet vaccine sentiments, surpassing state-of-the-art performance, attaining two-class accuracy of 90.4\%, and a three-class F1 of 0.762. We identify profiles which consistently produce strongly anti- and pro-vaccine content. We find that strongly anti-vaccine profiles primarily post links to Youtube, and commercial sites that make money on selling alternative health products, representing a conflict of interest. We also visualize the network of repeated mutual interactions of actors in the vaccine discourse and find that it is highly stratified, with an assortativity coefficient of r = .813."
An Investigation of Transfer Learning-Based Sentiment Analysis in Japanese,"Text classification approaches have usually required task-specific model architectures and huge labeled datasets. Recently, thanks to the rise of text-based transfer learning techniques, it is possible to pre-train a language model in an unsupervised manner and leverage them to perform effective on downstream tasks. In this work we focus on Japanese and show the potential use of transfer learning techniques in text classification. Specifically, we perform binary and multi-class sentiment classification on the Rakuten product review and Yahoo movie review datasets. We show that transfer learning-based approaches perform better than task-specific models trained on 3 times as much data. Furthermore, these approaches perform just as well for language modeling pre-trained on only 1/30 of the data. We release our pre-trained models and code as open source."
CUDA-Self-Organizing feature map based visual sentiment analysis of bank customer complaints for Analytical CRM,"With the widespread use of social media, companies now have access to a wealth of customer feedback data which has valuable applications to Customer Relationship Management (CRM). Analyzing customer grievances data, is paramount as their speedy non-redressal would lead to customer churn resulting in lower profitability. In this paper, we propose a descriptive analytics framework using Self-organizing feature map (SOM), for Visual Sentiment Analysis of customer complaints. The network learns the inherent grouping of the complaints automatically which can then be visualized too using various techniques. Analytical Customer Relationship Management (ACRM) executives can draw useful business insights from the maps and take timely remedial action. We also propose a high-performance version of the algorithm CUDASOM (CUDA based Self Organizing feature Map) implemented using NVIDIA parallel computing platform, CUDA, which speeds up the processing of high-dimensional text data and generates fast results. The efficacy of the proposed model has been demonstrated on the customer complaints data regarding the products and services of four leading Indian banks. CUDASOM achieved an average speed up of 44 times. Our approach can expand research into intelligent grievance redressal system to provide rapid solutions to the complaining customers."
Can a Humanoid Robot be part of the Organizational Workforce? A User Study Leveraging Sentiment Analysis,"Hiring robots for the workplaces is a challenging task as robots have to cater to customer demands, follow organizational protocols and behave with social etiquette. In this study, we propose to have a humanoid social robot, Nadine, as a customer service agent in an open social work environment. The objective of this study is to analyze the effects of humanoid robots on customers at work environment, and see if it can handle social scenarios. We propose to evaluate these objectives through two modes, namely, survey questionnaire and customer feedback. We also propose a novel approach to analyze customer feedback data (text) using sentic computing methods. Specifically, we employ aspect extraction and sentiment analysis to analyze the data. From our framework, we detect sentiment associated to the aspects that mainly concerned the customers during their interaction. This allows us to understand customers expectations and current limitations of robots as employees."
Human Vocal Sentiment Analysis,"In this paper, we use several techniques with conventional vocal feature extraction (MFCC, STFT), along with deep-learning approaches such as CNN, and also context-level analysis, by providing the textual data, and combining different approaches for improved emotion-level classification. We explore models that have not been tested to gauge the difference in performance and accuracy. We apply hyperparameter sweeps and data augmentation to improve performance. Finally, we see if a real-time approach is feasible, and can be readily integrated into existing systems."
Earlier Attention? Aspect-Aware LSTM for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis,"Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims to predict fine-grained sentiments of comments with respect to given aspect terms or categories. In previous ABSA methods, the importance of aspect has been realized and verified. Most existing LSTM-based models take aspect into account via the attention mechanism, where the attention weights are calculated after the context is modeled in the form of contextual vectors. However, aspect-related information may be already discarded and aspect-irrelevant information may be retained in classic LSTM cells in the context modeling process, which can be improved to generate more effective context representations. This paper proposes a novel variant of LSTM, termed as aspect-aware LSTM (AA-LSTM), which incorporates aspect information into LSTM cells in the context modeling stage before the attention mechanism. Therefore, our AA-LSTM can dynamically produce aspect-aware contextual representations. We experiment with several representative LSTM-based models by replacing the classic LSTM cells with the AA-LSTM cells. Experimental results on SemEval-2014 Datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of AA-LSTM."
Machine Learning based English Sentiment Analysis,"Sentiment analysis or opinion mining aims to determine attitudes, judgments and opinions of customers for a product or a service. This is a great system to help manufacturers or servicers know the satisfaction level of customers about their products or services. From that, they can have appropriate adjustments. We use a popular machine learning method, being Support Vector Machine, combine with the library in Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) to build Java web program which analyzes the sentiment of English comments belongs one in four types of woman products. That are dresses, handbags, shoes and rings. We have developed and test our system with a training set having 300 comments and a test set having 400 comments. The experimental results of the system about precision, recall and F measures for positive comments are 89.3%, 95.0% and 92,.1%; for negative comments are 97.1%, 78.5% and 86.8%; and for neutral comments are 76.7%, 86.2% and 81.2%."
Multi-task Learning for Multi-modal Emotion Recognition and Sentiment Analysis,"Related tasks often have inter-dependence on each other and perform better when solved in a joint framework. In this paper, we present a deep multi-task learning framework that jointly performs sentiment and emotion analysis both. The multi-modal inputs (i.e., text, acoustic and visual frames) of a video convey diverse and distinctive information, and usually do not have equal contribution in the decision making. We propose a context-level inter-modal attention framework for simultaneously predicting the sentiment and expressed emotions of an utterance. We evaluate our proposed approach on CMU-MOSEI dataset for multi-modal sentiment and emotion analysis. Evaluation results suggest that multi-task learning framework offers improvement over the single-task framework. The proposed approach reports new state-of-the-art performance for both sentiment analysis and emotion analysis."
Targeted Sentiment Analysis: A Data-Driven Categorization,"Targeted sentiment analysis (TSA), also known as aspect based sentiment analysis (ABSA), aims at detecting fine-grained sentiment polarity towards targets in a given opinion document. Due to the lack of labeled datasets and effective technology, TSA had been intractable for many years. The newly released datasets and the rapid development of deep learning technologies are key enablers for the recent significant progress made in this area. However, the TSA tasks have been defined in various ways with different understandings towards basic concepts like `target' and `aspect'. In this paper, we categorize the different tasks and highlight the differences in the available datasets and their specific tasks. We then further discuss the challenges related to data collection and data annotation which are overlooked in many previous studies."
PhonSenticNet: A Cognitive Approach to Microtext Normalization for Concept-Level Sentiment Analysis,"With the current upsurge in the usage of social media platforms, the trend of using short text (microtext) in place of standard words has seen a significant rise. The usage of microtext poses a considerable performance issue in concept-level sentiment analysis, since models are trained on standard words. This paper discusses the impact of coupling sub-symbolic (phonetics) with symbolic (machine learning) Artificial Intelligence to transform the out-of-vocabulary concepts into their standard in-vocabulary form. The phonetic distance is calculated using the Sorensen similarity algorithm. The phonetically similar invocabulary concepts thus obtained are then used to compute the correct polarity value, which was previously being miscalculated because of the presence of microtext. Our proposed framework increases the accuracy of polarity detection by 6% as compared to the earlier model. This also validates the fact that microtext normalization is a necessary pre-requisite for the sentiment analysis task."
BowTie - A deep learning feedforward neural network for sentiment analysis,"How to model and encode the semantics of human-written text and select the type of neural network to process it are not settled issues in sentiment analysis. Accuracy and transferability are critical issues in machine learning in general. These properties are closely related to the loss estimates for the trained model. I present a computationally-efficient and accurate feedforward neural network for sentiment prediction capable of maintaining low losses. When coupled with an effective semantics model of the text, it provides highly accurate models with low losses. Experimental results on representative benchmark datasets and comparisons to other methods show the advantages of the new approach."
Twitter Sentiment Analysis using Distributed Word and Sentence Representation,"An important part of the information gathering and data analysis is to find out what people think about, either a product or an entity. Twitter is an opinion rich social networking site. The posts or tweets from this data can be used for mining people's opinions. The recent surge of activity in this area can be attributed to the computational treatment of data, which made opinion extraction and sentiment analysis easier. This paper classifies tweets into positive and negative sentiments, but instead of using traditional methods or preprocessing text data here we use the distributed representations of words and sentences to classify the tweets. We use Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Artificial Neural Networks. The first two are used on Distributed Representation of words while the latter is used on the distributed representation of sentences. This paper achieves accuracies as high as 81%. It also suggests the best and optimal ways for creating distributed representations of words for sentiment analysis, out of the available methods."
Empirical Evaluation of Leveraging Named Entities for Arabic Sentiment Analysis,"Social media reflects the public attitudes towards specific events. Events are often related to persons, locations or organizations, the so-called Named Entities. This can define Named Entities as sentiment-bearing components. In this paper, we dive beyond Named Entities recognition to the exploitation of sentiment-annotated Named Entities in Arabic sentiment analysis. Therefore, we develop an algorithm to detect the sentiment of Named Entities based on the majority of attitudes towards them. This enabled tagging Named Entities with proper tags and, thus, including them in a sentiment analysis framework of two models: supervised and lexicon-based. Both models were applied on datasets of multi-dialectal content. The results revealed that Named Entities have no considerable impact on the supervised model, while employing them in the lexicon-based model improved the classification performance and outperformed most of the baseline systems."
Complementary Fusion of Multi-Features and Multi-Modalities in Sentiment Analysis,"Sentiment analysis, mostly based on text, has been rapidly developing in the last decade and has attracted widespread attention in both academia and industry. However, the information in the real world usually comes from multiple modalities, such as audio and text. Therefore, in this paper, based on audio and text, we consider the task of multimodal sentiment analysis and propose a novel fusion strategy including both multi-feature fusion and multi-modality fusion to improve the accuracy of audio-text sentiment analysis. We call it the DFF-ATMF (Deep Feature Fusion - Audio and Text Modality Fusion) model, which consists of two parallel branches, the audio modality based branch and the text modality based branch. Its core mechanisms are the fusion of multiple feature vectors and multiple modality attention. Experiments on the CMU-MOSI dataset and the recently released CMU-MOSEI dataset, both collected from YouTube for sentiment analysis, show the very competitive results of our DFF-ATMF model. Furthermore, by virtue of attention weight distribution heatmaps, we also demonstrate the deep features learned by using DFF-ATMF are complementary to each other and robust. Surprisingly, DFF-ATMF also achieves new state-of-the-art results on the IEMOCAP dataset, indicating that the proposed fusion strategy also has a good generalization ability for multimodal emotion recognition."
Deep-Sentiment: Sentiment Analysis Using Ensemble of CNN and Bi-LSTM Models,"With the popularity of social networks, and e-commerce websites, sentiment analysis has become a more active area of research in the past few years. On a high level, sentiment analysis tries to understand the public opinion about a specific product or topic, or trends from reviews or tweets. Sentiment analysis plays an important role in better understanding customer/user opinion, and also extracting social/political trends. There has been a lot of previous works for sentiment analysis, some based on hand-engineering relevant textual features, and others based on different neural network architectures. In this work, we present a model based on an ensemble of long-short-term-memory (LSTM), and convolutional neural network (CNN), one to capture the temporal information of the data, and the other one to extract the local structure thereof. Through experimental results, we show that using this ensemble model we can outperform both individual models. We are also able to achieve a very high accuracy rate compared to the previous works."
Deep Learning Sentiment Analysis of Amazon.com Reviews and Ratings,"Our study employs sentiment analysis to evaluate the compatibility of Amazon.com reviews with their corresponding ratings. Sentiment analysis is the task of identifying and classifying the sentiment expressed in a piece of text as being positive or negative. On e-commerce websites such as Amazon.com, consumers can submit their reviews along with a specific polarity rating. In some instances, there is a mismatch between the review and the rating. To identify the reviews with mismatched ratings we performed sentiment analysis using deep learning on Amazon.com product review data. Product reviews were converted to vectors using paragraph vector, which then was used to train a recurrent neural network with gated recurrent unit. Our model incorporated both semantic relationship of review text and product information. We also developed a web service application that predicts the rating score for a submitted review using the trained model and if there is a mismatch between predicted rating score and submitted rating score, it provides feedback to the reviewer."
BERT Post-Training for Review Reading Comprehension and Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis,"Question-answering plays an important role in e-commerce as it allows potential customers to actively seek crucial information about products or services to help their purchase decision making. Inspired by the recent success of machine reading comprehension (MRC) on formal documents, this paper explores the potential of turning customer reviews into a large source of knowledge that can be exploited to answer user questions.~We call this problem Review Reading Comprehension (RRC). To the best of our knowledge, no existing work has been done on RRC. In this work, we first build an RRC dataset called ReviewRC based on a popular benchmark for aspect-based sentiment analysis. Since ReviewRC has limited training examples for RRC (and also for aspect-based sentiment analysis), we then explore a novel post-training approach on the popular language model BERT to enhance the performance of fine-tuning of BERT for RRC. To show the generality of the approach, the proposed post-training is also applied to some other review-based tasks such as aspect extraction and aspect sentiment classification in aspect-based sentiment analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed post-training is highly effective. The datasets and code are available at https://www.cs.uic.edu/~hxu/."
Sentiment analysis with genetically evolved Gaussian kernels,"Sentiment analysis consists of evaluating opinions or statements from the analysis of text. Among the methods used to estimate the degree in which a text expresses a given sentiment, are those based on Gaussian Processes. However, traditional Gaussian Processes methods use a predefined kernel with hyperparameters that can be tuned but whose structure can not be adapted. In this paper, we propose the application of Genetic Programming for evolving Gaussian Process kernels that are more precise for sentiment analysis. We use use a very flexible representation of kernels combined with a multi-objective approach that simultaneously considers two quality metrics and the computational time spent by the kernels. Our results show that the algorithm can outperform Gaussian Processes with traditional kernels for some of the sentiment analysis tasks considered."
Sentiment Analysis on IMDB Movie Comments and Twitter Data by Machine Learning and Vector Space Techniques,"This study's goal is to create a model of sentiment analysis on a 2000 rows IMDB movie comments and 3200 Twitter data by using machine learning and vector space techniques; positive or negative preliminary information about the text is to provide. In the study, a vector space was created in the KNIME Analytics platform, and a classification study was performed on this vector space by Decision Trees, Naïve Bayes and Support Vector Machines classification algorithms. The conclusions obtained were compared in terms of each algorithms. The classification results for IMDB movie comments are obtained as 94,00%, 73,20%, and 85,50% by Decision Tree, Naive Bayes and SVM algorithms. The classification results for Twitter data set are presented as 82,76%, 75,44% and 72,50% by Decision Tree, Naive Bayes SVM algorithms as well. It is seen that the best classification results presented in both data sets are which calculated by SVM algorithm."
Utilizing BERT for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis via Constructing Auxiliary Sentence,"Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), which aims to identify fine-grained opinion polarity towards a specific aspect, is a challenging subtask of sentiment analysis (SA). In this paper, we construct an auxiliary sentence from the aspect and convert ABSA to a sentence-pair classification task, such as question answering (QA) and natural language inference (NLI). We fine-tune the pre-trained model from BERT and achieve new state-of-the-art results on SentiHood and SemEval-2014 Task 4 datasets."
Market Trend Prediction using Sentiment Analysis: Lessons Learned and Paths Forward,"Financial market forecasting is one of the most attractive practical applications of sentiment analysis. In this paper, we investigate the potential of using sentiment \emph{attitudes} (positive vs negative) and also sentiment \emph{emotions} (joy, sadness, etc.) extracted from financial news or tweets to help predict stock price movements. Our extensive experiments using the \emph{Granger-causality} test have revealed that (i) in general sentiment attitudes do not seem to Granger-cause stock price changes; and (ii) while on some specific occasions sentiment emotions do seem to Granger-cause stock price changes, the exhibited pattern is not universal and must be looked at on a case by case basis. Furthermore, it has been observed that at least for certain stocks, integrating sentiment emotions as additional features into the machine learning based market trend prediction model could improve its accuracy."
Incorporating End-to-End Speech Recognition Models for Sentiment Analysis,"Previous work on emotion recognition demonstrated a synergistic effect of combining several modalities such as auditory, visual, and transcribed text to estimate the affective state of a speaker. Among these, the linguistic modality is crucial for the evaluation of an expressed emotion. However, manually transcribed spoken text cannot be given as input to a system practically. We argue that using ground-truth transcriptions during training and evaluation phases leads to a significant discrepancy in performance compared to real-world conditions, as the spoken text has to be recognized on the fly and can contain speech recognition mistakes. In this paper, we propose a method of integrating an automatic speech recognition (ASR) output with a character-level recurrent neural network for sentiment recognition. In addition, we conduct several experiments investigating sentiment recognition for human-robot interaction in a noise-realistic scenario which is challenging for the ASR systems. We quantify the improvement compared to using only the acoustic modality in sentiment recognition. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on the Multimodal Corpus of Sentiment Intensity (MOSI) by achieving 73,6% accuracy in a binary sentiment classification task, exceeding previously reported results that use only acoustic input. In addition, we set a new state-of-the-art performance on the MOSI dataset (80.4% accuracy, 2% absolute improvement)."
Data augmentation for low resource sentiment analysis using generative adversarial networks,"Sentiment analysis is a task that may suffer from a lack of data in certain cases, as the datasets are often generated and annotated by humans. In cases where data is inadequate for training discriminative models, generate models may aid training via data augmentation. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are one such model that has advanced the state of the art in several tasks, including as image and text generation. In this paper, I train GAN models on low resource datasets, then use them for the purpose of data augmentation towards improving sentiment classifier generalization. Given the constraints of limited data, I explore various techniques to train the GAN models. I also present an analysis of the quality of generated GAN data as more training data for the GAN is made available. In this analysis, the generated data is evaluated as a test set (against a model trained on real data points) as well as a training set to train classification models. Finally, I also conduct a visual analysis by projecting the generated and the real data into a two-dimensional space using the t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) method."
Investigating the Effect of Segmentation Methods on Neural Model based Sentiment Analysis on Informal Short Texts in Turkish,"This work investigates segmentation approaches for sentiment analysis on informal short texts in Turkish. The two building blocks of the proposed work are segmentation and deep neural network model. Segmentation focuses on preprocessing of text with different methods. These methods are grouped in four: morphological, sub-word, tokenization, and hybrid approaches. We analyzed several variants for each of these four methods. The second stage focuses on evaluation of the neural model for sentiment analysis. The performance of each segmentation method is evaluated under Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model proposed in the literature for sentiment classification."
Combination of Domain Knowledge and Deep Learning for Sentiment Analysis of Short and Informal Messages on Social Media,"Sentiment analysis has been emerging recently as one of the major natural language processing (NLP) tasks in many applications. Especially, as social media channels (e.g. social networks or forums) have become significant sources for brands to observe user opinions about their products, this task is thus increasingly crucial. However, when applied with real data obtained from social media, we notice that there is a high volume of short and informal messages posted by users on those channels. This kind of data makes the existing works suffer from many difficulties to handle, especially ones using deep learning approaches. In this paper, we propose an approach to handle this problem. This work is extended from our previous work, in which we proposed to combine the typical deep learning technique of Convolutional Neural Networks with domain knowledge. The combination is used for acquiring additional training data augmentation and a more reasonable loss function. In this work, we further improve our architecture by various substantial enhancements, including negation-based data augmentation, transfer learning for word embeddings, the combination of word-level embeddings and character-level embeddings, and using multitask learning technique for attaching domain knowledge rules in the learning process. Those enhancements, specifically aiming to handle short and informal messages, help us to enjoy significant improvement in performance once experimenting on real datasets."
Squared English Word: A Method of Generating Glyph to Use Super Characters for Sentiment Analysis,"The Super Characters method addresses sentiment analysis problems by first converting the input text into images and then applying 2D-CNN models to classify the sentiment. It achieves state of the art performance on many benchmark datasets. However, it is not as straightforward to apply in Latin languages as in Asian languages. Because the 2D-CNN model is designed to recognize two-dimensional images, it is better if the inputs are in the form of glyphs. In this paper, we propose SEW (Squared English Word) method generating a squared glyph for each English word by drawing Super Characters images of each English word at the alphabet level, combining the squared glyph together into a whole Super Characters image at the sentence level, and then applying the CNN model to classify the sentiment within the sentence. We applied the SEW method to Wikipedia dataset and obtained a 2.1% accuracy gain compared to the original Super Characters method. For multi-modal data with both structured tabular data and unstructured natural language text, the modified SEW method integrates the data into a single image and classifies sentiment with one unified CNN model."
Word Embeddings for Sentiment Analysis: A Comprehensive Empirical Survey,"This work investigates the role of factors like training method, training corpus size and thematic relevance of texts in the performance of word embedding features on sentiment analysis of tweets, song lyrics, movie reviews and item reviews. We also explore specific training or post-processing methods that can be used to enhance the performance of word embeddings in certain tasks or domains. Our empirical observations indicate that models trained with multithematic texts that are large and rich in vocabulary are the best in answering syntactic and semantic word analogy questions. We further observe that influence of thematic relevance is stronger on movie and phone reviews, but weaker on tweets and lyrics. These two later domains are more sensitive to corpus size and training method, with Glove outperforming Word2vec. ""Injecting"" extra intelligence from lexicons or generating sentiment specific word embeddings are two prominent alternatives for increasing performance of word embedding features."
"Natural Language Processing, Sentiment Analysis and Clinical Analytics","Recent advances in Big Data has prompted health care practitioners to utilize the data available on social media to discern sentiment and emotions expression. Health Informatics and Clinical Analytics depend heavily on information gathered from diverse sources. Traditionally, a healthcare practitioner will ask a patient to fill out a questionnaire that will form the basis of diagnosing the medical condition. However, medical practitioners have access to many sources of data including the patients writings on various media. Natural Language Processing (NLP) allows researchers to gather such data and analyze it to glean the underlying meaning of such writings. The field of sentiment analysis (applied to many other domains) depend heavily on techniques utilized by NLP. This work will look into various prevalent theories underlying the NLP field and how they can be leveraged to gather users sentiments on social media. Such sentiments can be culled over a period of time thus minimizing the errors introduced by data input and other stressors. Furthermore, we look at some applications of sentiment analysis and application of NLP to mental health. The reader will also learn about the NLTK toolkit that implements various NLP theories and how they can make the data scavenging process a lot easier."
Phonetic-enriched Text Representation for Chinese Sentiment Analysis with Reinforcement Learning,"The Chinese pronunciation system offers two characteristics that distinguish it from other languages: deep phonemic orthography and intonation variations. We are the first to argue that these two important properties can play a major role in Chinese sentiment analysis. Particularly, we propose two effective features to encode phonetic information. Next, we develop a Disambiguate Intonation for Sentiment Analysis (DISA) network using a reinforcement network. It functions as disambiguating intonations for each Chinese character (pinyin). Thus, a precise phonetic representation of Chinese is learned. Furthermore, we also fuse phonetic features with textual and visual features in order to mimic the way humans read and understand Chinese text. Experimental results on five different Chinese sentiment analysis datasets show that the inclusion of phonetic features significantly and consistently improves the performance of textual and visual representations and outshines the state-of-the-art Chinese character level representations."
"Large-Scale Joint Topic, Sentiment & User Preference Analysis for Online Reviews","This paper presents a non-trivial reconstruction of a previous joint topic-sentiment-preference review model TSPRA with stick-breaking representation under the framework of variational inference (VI) and stochastic variational inference (SVI). TSPRA is a Gibbs Sampling based model that solves topics, word sentiments and user preferences altogether and has been shown to achieve good performance, but for large data set it can only learn from a relatively small sample. We develop the variational models vTSPRA and svTSPRA to improve the time use, and our new approach is capable of processing millions of reviews. We rebuild the generative process, improve the rating regression, solve and present the coordinate-ascent updates of variational parameters, and show the time complexity of each iteration is theoretically linear to the corpus size, and the experiments on Amazon data sets show it converges faster than TSPRA and attains better results given the same amount of time. In addition, we tune svTSPRA into an online algorithm ovTSPRA that can monitor oscillations of sentiment and preference overtime. Some interesting fluctuations are captured and possible explanations are provided. The results give strong visual evidence that user preference is better treated as an independent factor from sentiment."
Sentiment Analysis of Czech Texts: An Algorithmic Survey,"In the area of online communication, commerce and transactions, analyzing sentiment polarity of texts written in various natural languages has become crucial. While there have been a lot of contributions in resources and studies for the English language, ""smaller"" languages like Czech have not received much attention. In this survey, we explore the effectiveness of many existing machine learning algorithms for sentiment analysis of Czech Facebook posts and product reviews. We report the sets of optimal parameter values for each algorithm and the scores in both datasets. We finally observe that support vector machines are the best classifier and efforts to increase performance even more with bagging, boosting or voting ensemble schemes fail to do so."
Sentence-Level Sentiment Analysis of Financial News Using Distributed Text Representations and Multi-Instance Learning,"Researchers and financial professionals require robust computerized tools that allow users to rapidly operationalize and assess the semantic textual content in financial news. However, existing methods commonly work at the document-level while deeper insights into the actual structure and the sentiment of individual sentences remain blurred. As a result, investors are required to apply the utmost attention and detailed, domain-specific knowledge in order to assess the information on a fine-grained basis. To facilitate this manual process, this paper proposes the use of distributed text representations and multi-instance learning to transfer information from the document-level to the sentence-level. Compared to alternative approaches, this method features superior predictive performance while preserving context and interpretability. Our analysis of a manually-labeled dataset yields a predictive accuracy of up to 69.90%, exceeding the performance of alternative approaches by at least 3.80 percentage points. Accordingly, this study not only benefits investors with regard to their financial decision-making, but also helps companies to communicate their messages as intended."
CAN: Constrained Attention Networks for Multi-Aspect Sentiment Analysis,"Aspect level sentiment classification is a fine-grained sentiment analysis task. To detect the sentiment towards a particular aspect in a sentence, previous studies have developed various attention-based methods for generating aspect-specific sentence representations. However, the attention may inherently introduce noise and downgrade the performance. In this paper, we propose constrained attention networks (CAN), a simple yet effective solution, to regularize the attention for multi-aspect sentiment analysis, which alleviates the drawback of the attention mechanism. Specifically, we introduce orthogonal regularization on multiple aspects and sparse regularization on each single aspect. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. We further extend our approach to multi-task settings and outperform the state-of-the-art methods."
Self-Attention: A Better Building Block for Sentiment Analysis Neural Network Classifiers,"Sentiment Analysis has seen much progress in the past two decades. For the past few years, neural network approaches, primarily RNNs and CNNs, have been the most successful for this task. Recently, a new category of neural networks, self-attention networks (SANs), have been created which utilizes the attention mechanism as the basic building block. Self-attention networks have been shown to be effective for sequence modeling tasks, while having no recurrence or convolutions. In this work we explore the effectiveness of the SANs for sentiment analysis. We demonstrate that SANs are superior in performance to their RNN and CNN counterparts by comparing their classification accuracy on six datasets as well as their model characteristics such as training speed and memory consumption. Finally, we explore the effects of various SAN modifications such as multi-head attention as well as two methods of incorporating sequence position information into SANs."
EvoMSA: A Multilingual Evolutionary Approach for Sentiment Analysis,"Sentiment analysis (SA) is a task related to understanding people's feelings in written text; the starting point would be to identify the polarity level (positive, neutral or negative) of a given text, moving on to identify emotions or whether a text is humorous or not. This task has been the subject of several research competitions in a number of languages, e.g., English, Spanish, and Arabic, among others. In this contribution, we propose an SA system, namely EvoMSA, that unifies our participating systems in various SA competitions, making it domain independent and multilingual by processing text using only language-independent techniques. EvoMSA is a classifier, based on Genetic Programming, that works by combining the output of different text classifiers and text models to produce the final prediction. We analyze EvoMSA on different SA competitions to provide a global overview of its performance, and as the results show, EvoMSA is competitive obtaining top rankings in several SA competitions. Furthermore, we performed an analysis of EvoMSA's components to measure their contribution to the performance; the idea is to facilitate a practitioner or newcomer to implement a competitive SA classifier. Finally, it is worth to mention that EvoMSA is available as open-source software."
Sentiment Analysis of Financial News Articles using Performance Indicators,"Mining financial text documents and understanding the sentiments of individual investors, institutions and markets is an important and challenging problem in the literature. Current approaches to mine sentiments from financial texts largely rely on domain specific dictionaries. However, dictionary based methods often fail to accurately predict the polarity of financial texts. This paper aims to improve the state-of-the-art and introduces a novel sentiment analysis approach that employs the concept of financial and non-financial performance indicators. It presents an association rule mining based hierarchical sentiment classifier model to predict the polarity of financial texts as positive, neutral or negative. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated on a benchmark financial dataset. The model is also compared against other state-of-the-art dictionary and machine learning based approaches and the results are found to be quite promising. The novel use of performance indicators for financial sentiment analysis offers interesting and useful insights."
Movie Recommendation System using Sentiment Analysis from Microblogging Data,"Recommendation systems are important intelligent systems that play a vital role in providing selective information to users. Traditional approaches in recommendation systems include collaborative filtering and content-based filtering. However, these approaches have certain limitations like the necessity of prior user history and habits for performing the task of recommendation. In order to reduce the effect of such dependencies, this paper proposes a hybrid recommendation system which combines the collaborative filtering, content-based filtering with sentiment analysis of movie tweets. The movie tweets have been collected from microblogging websites to understand the current trends and user response of the movie. Experiments conducted on public database produce promising results."
Learning Robust Heterogeneous Signal Features from Parallel Neural Network for Audio Sentiment Analysis,"Audio Sentiment Analysis is a popular research area which extends the conventional text-based sentiment analysis to depend on the effectiveness of acoustic features extracted from speech. However, current progress on audio sentiment analysis mainly focuses on extracting homogeneous acoustic features or doesn't fuse heterogeneous features effectively. In this paper, we propose an utterance-based deep neural network model, which has a parallel combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based network, to obtain representative features termed Audio Sentiment Vector (ASV), that can maximally reflect sentiment information in an audio. Specifically, our model is trained by utterance-level labels and ASV can be extracted and fused creatively from two branches. In the CNN model branch, spectrum graphs produced by signals are fed as inputs while in the LSTM model branch, inputs include spectral features and cepstrum coefficient extracted from dependent utterances in audio. Besides, Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) with attention mechanism is used for feature fusion. Extensive experiments have been conducted to show our model can recognize audio sentiment precisely and quickly, and demonstrate our ASV is better than traditional acoustic features or vectors extracted from other deep learning models. Furthermore, experimental results indicate that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art approach by 9.33\% on Multimodal Opinion-level Sentiment Intensity dataset (MOSI) dataset."
Fake Comment Detection Based on Sentiment Analysis,"With the development of the E-commerce and reviews website, the comment information is influencing people's life. More and more users share their consumption experience and evaluate the quality of commodity by comment. When people make a decision, they will refer these comments. The dependency of the comments make the fake comment appear. The fake comment is that for profit and other bad motivation, business fabricate untrue consumption experience and they preach or slander some products. The fake comment is easy to mislead users' opinion and decision. The accuracy of humans identifying fake comment is low. It's meaningful to detect fake comment using natural language processing technology for people getting true comment information. This paper uses the sentimental analysis to detect fake comment."
Using Stock Prices as Ground Truth in Sentiment Analysis to Generate Profitable Trading Signals,"The increasing availability of ""big"" (large volume) social media data has motivated a great deal of research in applying sentiment analysis to predict the movement of prices within financial markets. Previous work in this field investigates how the true sentiment of text (i.e. positive or negative opinions) can be used for financial predictions, based on the assumption that sentiments expressed online are representative of the true market sentiment. Here we consider the converse idea, that using the stock price as the ground-truth in the system may be a better indication of sentiment. Tweets are labelled as Buy or Sell dependent on whether the stock price discussed rose or fell over the following hour, and from this, stock-specific dictionaries are built for individual companies. A Bayesian classifier is used to generate stock predictions, which are input to an automated trading algorithm. Placing 468 trades over a 1 month period yields a return rate of 5.18%, which annualises to approximately 83% per annum. This approach performs significantly better than random chance and outperforms two baseline sentiment analysis methods tested."
Topic-Specific Sentiment Analysis Can Help Identify Political Ideology,"Ideological leanings of an individual can often be gauged by the sentiment one expresses about different issues. We propose a simple framework that represents a political ideology as a distribution of sentiment polarities towards a set of topics. This representation can then be used to detect ideological leanings of documents (speeches, news articles, etc.) based on the sentiments expressed towards different topics. Experiments performed using a widely used dataset show the promise of our proposed approach that achieves comparable performance to other methods despite being much simpler and more interpretable."
Variational Semi-supervised Aspect-term Sentiment Analysis via Transformer,"Aspect-term sentiment analysis (ATSA) is a longstanding challenge in natural language understanding. It requires fine-grained semantical reasoning about a target entity appeared in the text. As manual annotation over the aspects is laborious and time-consuming, the amount of labeled data is limited for supervised learning. This paper proposes a semi-supervised method for the ATSA problem by using the Variational Autoencoder based on Transformer (VAET), which models the latent distribution via variational inference. By disentangling the latent representation into the aspect-specific sentiment and the lexical context, our method induces the underlying sentiment prediction for the unlabeled data, which then benefits the ATSA classifier. Our method is classifier agnostic, i.e., the classifier is an independent module and various advanced supervised models can be integrated. Experimental results are obtained on the SemEval 2014 task 4 and show that our method is effective with four classical classifiers. The proposed method outperforms two general semisupervised methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance."
Text-based Sentiment Analysis and Music Emotion Recognition,"Sentiment polarity of tweets, blog posts or product reviews has become highly attractive and is utilized in recommender systems, market predictions, business intelligence and more. Deep learning techniques are becoming top performers on analyzing such texts. There are however several problems that need to be solved for efficient use of deep neural networks on text mining and text polarity analysis. First, deep neural networks need to be fed with data sets that are big in size as well as properly labeled. Second, there are various uncertainties regarding the use of word embedding vectors: should they be generated from the same data set that is used to train the model or it is better to source them from big and popular collections? Third, to simplify model creation it is convenient to have generic neural network architectures that are effective and can adapt to various texts, encapsulating much of design complexity. This thesis addresses the above problems to provide methodological and practical insights for utilizing neural networks on sentiment analysis of texts and achieving state of the art results. Regarding the first problem, the effectiveness of various crowdsourcing alternatives is explored and two medium-sized and emotion-labeled song data sets are created utilizing social tags. To address the second problem, a series of experiments with large text collections of various contents and domains were conducted, trying word embeddings of various parameters. Regarding the third problem, a series of experiments involving convolution and max-pooling neural layers were conducted. Combining convolutions of words, bigrams, and trigrams with regional max-pooling layers in a couple of stacks produced the best results. The derived architecture achieves competitive performance on sentiment polarity analysis of movie, business and product reviews."
Adversarial Training in Affective Computing and Sentiment Analysis: Recent Advances and Perspectives,"Over the past few years, adversarial training has become an extremely active research topic and has been successfully applied to various Artificial Intelligence (AI) domains. As a potentially crucial technique for the development of the next generation of emotional AI systems, we herein provide a comprehensive overview of the application of adversarial training to affective computing and sentiment analysis. Various representative adversarial training algorithms are explained and discussed accordingly, aimed at tackling diverse challenges associated with emotional AI systems. Further, we highlight a range of potential future research directions. We expect that this overview will help facilitate the development of adversarial training for affective computing and sentiment analysis in both the academic and industrial communities."
Sentiment analysis for Arabic language: A brief survey of approaches and techniques,"With the emergence of Web 2.0 technology and the expansion of on-line social networks, current Internet users have the ability to add their reviews, ratings and opinions on social media and on commercial and news web sites. Sentiment analysis aims to classify these reviews reviews in an automatic way. In the literature, there are numerous approaches proposed for automatic sentiment analysis for different language contexts. Each language has its own properties that makes the sentiment analysis more challenging. In this regard, this work presents a comprehensive survey of existing Arabic sentiment analysis studies, and covers the various approaches and techniques proposed in the literature. Moreover, we highlight the main difficulties and challenges of Arabic sentiment analysis, and the proposed techniques in literature to overcome these barriers."
Joint Aspect and Polarity Classification for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis with End-to-End Neural Networks,"In this work, we propose a new model for aspect-based sentiment analysis. In contrast to previous approaches, we jointly model the detection of aspects and the classification of their polarity in an end-to-end trainable neural network. We conduct experiments with different neural architectures and word representations on the recent GermEval 2017 dataset. We were able to show considerable performance gains by using the joint modeling approach in all settings compared to pipeline approaches. The combination of a convolutional neural network and fasttext embeddings outperformed the best submission of the shared task in 2017, establishing a new state of the art."
Improving the results of string kernels in sentiment analysis and Arabic dialect identification by adapting them to your test set,"Recently, string kernels have obtained state-of-the-art results in various text classification tasks such as Arabic dialect identification or native language identification. In this paper, we apply two simple yet effective transductive learning approaches to further improve the results of string kernels. The first approach is based on interpreting the pairwise string kernel similarities between samples in the training set and samples in the test set as features. Our second approach is a simple self-training method based on two learning iterations. In the first iteration, a classifier is trained on the training set and tested on the test set, as usual. In the second iteration, a number of test samples (to which the classifier associated higher confidence scores) are added to the training set for another round of training. However, the ground-truth labels of the added test samples are not necessary. Instead, we use the labels predicted by the classifier in the first training iteration. By adapting string kernels to the test set, we report significantly better accuracy rates in English polarity classification and Arabic dialect identification."
Financial Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis using Deep Representations,"The topic of aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) has been explored for a variety of industries, but it still remains much unexplored in finance. The recent release of data for an open challenge (FiQA) from the companion proceedings of WWW '18 has provided valuable finance-specific annotations. FiQA contains high quality labels, but it still lacks data quantity to apply traditional ABSA deep learning architecture. In this paper, we employ high-level semantic representations and methods of inductive transfer learning for NLP. We experiment with extensions of recently developed domain adaptation methods and target task fine-tuning that significantly improve performance on a small dataset. Our results show an 8.7% improvement in the F1 score for classification and an 11% improvement over the MSE for regression on current state-of-the-art results."
SentiALG: Automated Corpus Annotation for Algerian Sentiment Analysis,"Data annotation is an important but time-consuming and costly procedure. To sort a text into two classes, the very first thing we need is a good annotation guideline, establishing what is required to qualify for each class. In the literature, the difficulties associated with an appropriate data annotation has been underestimated. In this paper, we present a novel approach to automatically construct an annotated sentiment corpus for Algerian dialect (a Maghrebi Arabic dialect). The construction of this corpus is based on an Algerian sentiment lexicon that is also constructed automatically. The presented work deals with the two widely used scripts on Arabic social media: Arabic and Arabizi. The proposed approach automatically constructs a sentiment corpus containing 8000 messages (where 4000 are dedicated to Arabic and 4000 to Arabizi). The achieved F1-score is up to 72% and 78% for an Arabic and Arabizi test sets, respectively. Ongoing work is aimed at integrating transliteration process for Arabizi messages to further improve the obtained results."
Exploiting Deep Learning for Persian Sentiment Analysis,"The rise of social media is enabling people to freely express their opinions about products and services. The aim of sentiment analysis is to automatically determine subject's sentiment (e.g., positive, negative, or neutral) towards a particular aspect such as topic, product, movie, news etc. Deep learning has recently emerged as a powerful machine learning technique to tackle a growing demand of accurate sentiment analysis. However, limited work has been conducted to apply deep learning algorithms to languages other than English, such as Persian. In this work, two deep learning models (deep autoencoders and deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs)) are developed and applied to a novel Persian movie reviews dataset. The proposed deep learning models are analyzed and compared with the state-of-the-art shallow multilayer perceptron (MLP) based machine learning model. Simulation results demonstrate the enhanced performance of deep learning over state-of-the-art MLP."
Code-Mixed Sentiment Analysis Using Machine Learning and Neural Network Approaches,"Sentiment Analysis for Indian Languages (SAIL)-Code Mixed tools contest aimed at identifying the sentence level sentiment polarity of the code-mixed dataset of Indian languages pairs (Hi-En, Ben-Hi-En). Hi-En dataset is henceforth referred to as HI-EN and Ben-Hi-En dataset as BN-EN respectively. For this, we submitted four models for sentiment analysis of code-mixed HI-EN and BN-EN datasets. The first model was an ensemble voting classifier consisting of three classifiers - linear SVM, logistic regression and random forests while the second one was a linear SVM. Both the models used TF-IDF feature vectors of character n-grams where n ranged from 2 to 6. We used scikit-learn (sklearn) machine learning library for implementing both the approaches. Run1 was obtained from the voting classifier and Run2 used the linear SVM model for producing the results. Out of the four submitted outputs Run2 outperformed Run1 in both the datasets. We finished first in the contest for both HI-EN with an F-score of 0.569 and BN-EN with an F-score of 0.526."
A Survey on Sentiment and Emotion Analysis for Computational Literary Studies,"Emotions are a crucial part of compelling narratives: literature tells us about people with goals, desires, passions, and intentions. Emotion analysis is part of the broader and larger field of sentiment analysis, and receives increasing attention in literary studies. In the past, the affective dimension of literature was mainly studied in the context of literary hermeneutics. However, with the emergence of the research field known as Digital Humanities (DH), some studies of emotions in a literary context have taken a computational turn. Given the fact that DH is still being formed as a field, this direction of research can be rendered relatively new. In this survey, we offer an overview of the existing body of research on emotion analysis as applied to literature. The research under review deals with a variety of topics including tracking dramatic changes of a plot development, network analysis of a literary text, and understanding the emotionality of texts, among other topics."
Sentimental Content Analysis and Knowledge Extraction from News Articles,"In web era, since technology has revolutionized mankind life, plenty of data and information are published on the Internet each day. For instance, news agencies publish news on their websites all over the world. These raw data could be an important resource for knowledge extraction. These shared data contain emotions (i.e., positive, neutral or negative) toward various topics; therefore, sentimental content extraction could be a beneficial task in many aspects. Extracting the sentiment of news illustrates highly valuable information about the events over a period of time, the viewpoint of a media or news agency to these events. In this paper an attempt is made to propose an approach for news analysis and extracting useful knowledge from them. Firstly, we attempt to extract a noise robust sentiment of news documents; therefore, the news associated to six countries: United State, United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, France and Australia in 5 different news categories: Politics, Sports, Business, Entertainment and Technology are downloaded. In this paper we compare the condition of different countries in each 5 news topics based on the extracted sentiments and emotional contents in news documents. Moreover, we propose an approach to reduce the bulky news data to extract the hottest topics and news titles as a knowledge. Eventually, we generate a word model to map each word to a fixed-size vector by Word2Vec in order to understand the relations between words in our collected news database."
Exploiting Effective Representations for Chinese Sentiment Analysis Using a Multi-Channel Convolutional Neural Network,"Effective representation of a text is critical for various natural language processing tasks. For the particular task of Chinese sentiment analysis, it is important to understand and choose an effective representation of a text from different forms of Chinese representations such as word, character and pinyin. This paper presents a systematic study of the effect of these representations for Chinese sentiment analysis by proposing a multi-channel convolutional neural network (MCCNN), where each channel corresponds to a representation. Experimental results show that: (1) Word wins on the dataset of low OOV rate while character wins otherwise; (2) Using these representations in combination generally improves the performance; (3) The representations based on MCCNN outperform conventional ngram features using SVM; (4) The proposed MCCNN model achieves the competitive performance against the state-of-the-art model fastText for Chinese sentiment analysis."
Twitter Sentiment Analysis via Bi-sense Emoji Embedding and Attention-based LSTM,"Sentiment analysis on large-scale social media data is important to bridge the gaps between social media contents and real world activities including political election prediction, individual and public emotional status monitoring and analysis, and so on. Although textual sentiment analysis has been well studied based on platforms such as Twitter and Instagram, analysis of the role of extensive emoji uses in sentiment analysis remains light. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme for Twitter sentiment analysis with extra attention on emojis. We first learn bi-sense emoji embeddings under positive and negative sentimental tweets individually, and then train a sentiment classifier by attending on these bi-sense emoji embeddings with an attention-based long short-term memory network (LSTM). Our experiments show that the bi-sense embedding is effective for extracting sentiment-aware embeddings of emojis and outperforms the state-of-the-art models. We also visualize the attentions to show that the bi-sense emoji embedding provides better guidance on the attention mechanism to obtain a more robust understanding of the semantics and sentiments."
Twitter Sentiment Analysis System,"Social media is increasingly used by humans to express their feelings and opinions in the form of short text messages. Detecting sentiments in the text has a wide range of applications including identifying anxiety or depression of individuals and measuring well-being or mood of a community. Sentiments can be expressed in many ways that can be seen such as facial expression and gestures, speech and by written text. Sentiment Analysis in text documents is essentially a content-based classification problem involving concepts from the domains of Natural Language Processing as well as Machine Learning. In this paper, sentiment recognition based on textual data and the techniques used in sentiment analysis are discussed."
Seq2Seq2Sentiment: Multimodal Sequence to Sequence Models for Sentiment Analysis,"Multimodal machine learning is a core research area spanning the language, visual and acoustic modalities. The central challenge in multimodal learning involves learning representations that can process and relate information from multiple modalities. In this paper, we propose two methods for unsupervised learning of joint multimodal representations using sequence to sequence (Seq2Seq) methods: a \textit{Seq2Seq Modality Translation Model} and a \textit{Hierarchical Seq2Seq Modality Translation Model}. We also explore multiple different variations on the multimodal inputs and outputs of these seq2seq models. Our experiments on multimodal sentiment analysis using the CMU-MOSI dataset indicate that our methods learn informative multimodal representations that outperform the baselines and achieve improved performance on multimodal sentiment analysis, specifically in the Bimodal case where our model is able to improve F1 Score by twelve points. We also discuss future directions for multimodal Seq2Seq methods."
Towards Enhancing Lexical Resource and Using Sense-annotations of OntoSenseNet for Sentiment Analysis,"This paper illustrates the interface of the tool we developed for crowd sourcing and we explain the annotation procedure in detail. Our tool is named as 'Parupalli Padajaalam' which means web of words by Parupalli. The aim of this tool is to populate the OntoSenseNet, sentiment polarity annotated Telugu resource. Recent works have shown the importance of word-level annotations on sentiment analysis. With this as basis, we aim to analyze the importance of sense-annotations obtained from OntoSenseNet in performing the task of sentiment analysis. We explain the fea- tures extracted from OntoSenseNet (Telugu). Furthermore we compute and explain the adverbial class distribution of verbs in OntoSenseNet. This task is known to aid in disambiguating word-senses which helps in enhancing the performance of word-sense disambiguation (WSD) task(s)."
A Combined CNN and LSTM Model for Arabic Sentiment Analysis,"Deep neural networks have shown good data modelling capabilities when dealing with challenging and large datasets from a wide range of application areas. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) offer advantages in selecting good features and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks have proven good abilities of learning sequential data. Both approaches have been reported to provide improved results in areas such image processing, voice recognition, language translation and other Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Sentiment classification for short text messages from Twitter is a challenging task, and the complexity increases for Arabic language sentiment classification tasks because Arabic is a rich language in morphology. In addition, the availability of accurate pre-processing tools for Arabic is another current limitation, along with limited research available in this area. In this paper, we investigate the benefits of integrating CNNs and LSTMs and report obtained improved accuracy for Arabic sentiment analysis on different datasets. Additionally, we seek to consider the morphological diversity of particular Arabic words by using different sentiment classification levels."
BCSAT : A Benchmark Corpus for Sentiment Analysis in Telugu Using Word-level Annotations,"The presented work aims at generating a systematically annotated corpus that can support the enhancement of sentiment analysis tasks in Telugu using word-level sentiment annotations. From OntoSenseNet, we extracted 11,000 adjectives, 253 adverbs, 8483 verbs and sentiment annotation is being done by language experts. We discuss the methodology followed for the polarity annotations and validate the developed resource. This work aims at developing a benchmark corpus, as an extension to SentiWordNet, and baseline accuracy for a model where lexeme annotations are applied for sentiment predictions. The fundamental aim of this paper is to validate and study the possibility of utilizing machine learning algorithms, word-level sentiment annotations in the task of automated sentiment identification. Furthermore, accuracy is improved by annotating the bi-grams extracted from the target corpus."
Polarity and Intensity: the Two Aspects of Sentiment Analysis,"Current multimodal sentiment analysis frames sentiment score prediction as a general Machine Learning task. However, what the sentiment score actually represents has often been overlooked. As a measurement of opinions and affective states, a sentiment score generally consists of two aspects: polarity and intensity. We decompose sentiment scores into these two aspects and study how they are conveyed through individual modalities and combined multimodal models in a naturalistic monologue setting. In particular, we build unimodal and multimodal multi-task learning models with sentiment score prediction as the main task and polarity and/or intensity classification as the auxiliary tasks. Our experiments show that sentiment analysis benefits from multi-task learning, and individual modalities differ when conveying the polarity and intensity aspects of sentiment."
Combination of Domain Knowledge and Deep Learning for Sentiment Analysis,"The emerging technique of deep learning has been widely applied in many different areas. However, when adopted in a certain specific domain, this technique should be combined with domain knowledge to improve efficiency and accuracy. In particular, when analyzing the applications of deep learning in sentiment analysis, we found that the current approaches are suffering from the following drawbacks: (i) the existing works have not paid much attention to the importance of different types of sentiment terms, which is an important concept in this area; and (ii) the loss function currently employed does not well reflect the degree of error of sentiment misclassification. To overcome such problem, we propose to combine domain knowledge with deep learning. Our proposal includes using sentiment scores, learnt by quadratic programming, to augment training data; and introducing the penalty matrix for enhancing the loss function of cross entropy. When experimented, we achieved a significant improvement in classification results."
Multimodal Sentiment Analysis using Hierarchical Fusion with Context Modeling,"Multimodal sentiment analysis is a very actively growing field of research. A promising area of opportunity in this field is to improve the multimodal fusion mechanism. We present a novel feature fusion strategy that proceeds in a hierarchical fashion, first fusing the modalities two in two and only then fusing all three modalities. On multimodal sentiment analysis of individual utterances, our strategy outperforms conventional concatenation of features by 1%, which amounts to 5% reduction in error rate. On utterance-level multimodal sentiment analysis of multi-utterance video clips, for which current state-of-the-art techniques incorporate contextual information from other utterances of the same clip, our hierarchical fusion gives up to 2.4% (almost 10% error rate reduction) over currently used concatenation. The implementation of our method is publicly available in the form of open-source code."
Bringing replication and reproduction together with generalisability in NLP: Three reproduction studies for Target Dependent Sentiment Analysis,"Lack of repeatability and generalisability are two significant threats to continuing scientific development in Natural Language Processing. Language models and learning methods are so complex that scientific conference papers no longer contain enough space for the technical depth required for replication or reproduction. Taking Target Dependent Sentiment Analysis as a case study, we show how recent work in the field has not consistently released code, or described settings for learning methods in enough detail, and lacks comparability and generalisability in train, test or validation data. To investigate generalisability and to enable state of the art comparative evaluations, we carry out the first reproduction studies of three groups of complementary methods and perform the first large-scale mass evaluation on six different English datasets. Reflecting on our experiences, we recommend that future replication or reproduction experiments should always consider a variety of datasets alongside documenting and releasing their methods and published code in order to minimise the barriers to both repeatability and generalisability. We have released our code with a model zoo on GitHub with Jupyter Notebooks to aid understanding and full documentation, and we recommend that others do the same with their papers at submission time through an anonymised GitHub account."
Multilingual Sentiment Analysis: An RNN-Based Framework for Limited Data,"Sentiment analysis is a widely studied NLP task where the goal is to determine opinions, emotions, and evaluations of users towards a product, an entity or a service that they are reviewing. One of the biggest challenges for sentiment analysis is that it is highly language dependent. Word embeddings, sentiment lexicons, and even annotated data are language specific. Further, optimizing models for each language is very time consuming and labor intensive especially for recurrent neural network models. From a resource perspective, it is very challenging to collect data for different languages.  In this paper, we look for an answer to the following research question: can a sentiment analysis model trained on a language be reused for sentiment analysis in other languages, Russian, Spanish, Turkish, and Dutch, where the data is more limited? Our goal is to build a single model in the language with the largest dataset available for the task, and reuse it for languages that have limited resources. For this purpose, we train a sentiment analysis model using recurrent neural networks with reviews in English. We then translate reviews in other languages and reuse this model to evaluate the sentiments. Experimental results show that our robust approach of single model trained on English reviews statistically significantly outperforms the baselines in several different languages."
An Ensemble Model for Sentiment Analysis of Hindi-English Code-Mixed Data,"In multilingual societies like India, code-mixed social media texts comprise the majority of the Internet. Detecting the sentiment of the code-mixed user opinions plays a crucial role in understanding social, economic and political trends. In this paper, we propose an ensemble of character-trigrams based LSTM model and word-ngrams based Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) model to identify the sentiments of Hindi-English (Hi-En) code-mixed data. The ensemble model combines the strengths of rich sequential patterns from the LSTM model and polarity of keywords from the probabilistic ngram model to identify sentiments in sparse and inconsistent code-mixed data. Experiments on reallife user code-mixed data reveals that our approach yields state-of-the-art results as compared to several baselines and other deep learning based proposed methods."
Projecting Embeddings for Domain Adaptation: Joint Modeling of Sentiment Analysis in Diverse Domains,"Domain adaptation for sentiment analysis is challenging due to the fact that supervised classifiers are very sensitive to changes in domain. The two most prominent approaches to this problem are structural correspondence learning and autoencoders. However, they either require long training times or suffer greatly on highly divergent domains. Inspired by recent advances in cross-lingual sentiment analysis, we provide a novel perspective and cast the domain adaptation problem as an embedding projection task. Our model takes as input two mono-domain embedding spaces and learns to project them to a bi-domain space, which is jointly optimized to (1) project across domains and to (2) predict sentiment. We perform domain adaptation experiments on 20 source-target domain pairs for sentiment classification and report novel state-of-the-art results on 11 domain pairs, including the Amazon domain adaptation datasets and SemEval 2013 and 2016 datasets. Our analysis shows that our model performs comparably to state-of-the-art approaches on domains that are similar, while performing significantly better on highly divergent domains. Our code is available at https://github.com/jbarnesspain/domain_blse"
Psychological State in Text: A Limitation of Sentiment Analysis,"Starting with the idea that sentiment analysis models should be able to predict not only positive or negative but also other psychological states of a person, we implement a sentiment analysis model to investigate the relationship between the model and emotional state. We first examine psychological measurements of 64 participants and ask them to write a book report about a story. After that, we train our sentiment analysis model using crawled movie review data. We finally evaluate participants' writings, using the pretrained model as a concept of transfer learning. The result shows that sentiment analysis model performs good at predicting a score, but the score does not have any correlation with human's self-checked sentiment."
Multimodal Sentiment Analysis To Explore the Structure of Emotions,"We propose a novel approach to multimodal sentiment analysis using deep neural networks combining visual analysis and natural language processing. Our goal is different than the standard sentiment analysis goal of predicting whether a sentence expresses positive or negative sentiment; instead, we aim to infer the latent emotional state of the user. Thus, we focus on predicting the emotion word tags attached by users to their Tumblr posts, treating these as ""self-reported emotions."" We demonstrate that our multimodal model combining both text and image features outperforms separate models based solely on either images or text. Our model's results are interpretable, automatically yielding sensible word lists associated with emotions. We explore the structure of emotions implied by our model and compare it to what has been posited in the psychology literature, and validate our model on a set of images that have been used in psychology studies. Finally, our work also provides a useful tool for the growing academic study of images - both photographs and memes - on social networks."
A Sentiment Analysis of Breast Cancer Treatment Experiences and Healthcare Perceptions Across Twitter,"Background: Social media has the capacity to afford the healthcare industry with valuable feedback from patients who reveal and express their medical decision-making process, as well as self-reported quality of life indicators both during and post treatment. In prior work, [Crannell et. al.], we have studied an active cancer patient population on Twitter and compiled a set of tweets describing their experience with this disease. We refer to these online public testimonies as ""Invisible Patient Reported Outcomes"" (iPROs), because they carry relevant indicators, yet are difficult to capture by conventional means of self-report. Methods: Our present study aims to identify tweets related to the patient experience as an additional informative tool for monitoring public health. Using Twitter's public streaming API, we compiled over 5.3 million ""breast cancer"" related tweets spanning September 2016 until mid December 2017. We combined supervised machine learning methods with natural language processing to sift tweets relevant to breast cancer patient experiences. We analyzed a sample of 845 breast cancer patient and survivor accounts, responsible for over 48,000 posts. We investigated tweet content with a hedonometric sentiment analysis to quantitatively extract emotionally charged topics. Results: We found that positive experiences were shared regarding patient treatment, raising support, and spreading awareness. Further discussions related to healthcare were prevalent and largely negative focusing on fear of political legislation that could result in loss of coverage. Conclusions: Social media can provide a positive outlet for patients to discuss their needs and concerns regarding their healthcare coverage and treatment needs. Capturing iPROs from online communication can help inform healthcare professionals and lead to more connected and personalized treatment regimens."
Sentiment Analysis of Arabic Tweets: Feature Engineering and A Hybrid Approach,"Sentiment Analysis in Arabic is a challenging task due to the rich morphology of the language. Moreover, the task is further complicated when applied to Twitter data that is known to be highly informal and noisy. In this paper, we develop a hybrid method for sentiment analysis for Arabic tweets for a specific Arabic dialect which is the Saudi Dialect. Several features were engineered and evaluated using a feature backward selection method. Then a hybrid method that combines a corpus-based and lexicon-based method was developed for several classification models (two-way, three-way, four-way). The best F1-score for each of these models was (69.9,61.63,55.07) respectively."
Knowledge-enriched Two-layered Attention Network for Sentiment Analysis,We propose a novel two-layered attention network based on Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory for sentiment analysis. The novel two-layered attention network takes advantage of the external knowledge bases to improve the sentiment prediction. It uses the Knowledge Graph Embedding generated using the WordNet. We build our model by combining the two-layered attention network with the supervised model based on Support Vector Regression using a Multilayer Perceptron network for sentiment analysis. We evaluate our model on the benchmark dataset of SemEval 2017 Task 5. Experimental results show that the proposed model surpasses the top system of SemEval 2017 Task 5. The model performs significantly better by improving the state-of-the-art system at SemEval 2017 Task 5 by 1.7 and 3.7 points for sub-tracks 1 and 2 respectively.
Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis with Gated Convolutional Networks,"Aspect based sentiment analysis (ABSA) can provide more detailed information than general sentiment analysis, because it aims to predict the sentiment polarities of the given aspects or entities in text. We summarize previous approaches into two subtasks: aspect-category sentiment analysis (ACSA) and aspect-term sentiment analysis (ATSA). Most previous approaches employ long short-term memory and attention mechanisms to predict the sentiment polarity of the concerned targets, which are often complicated and need more training time. We propose a model based on convolutional neural networks and gating mechanisms, which is more accurate and efficient. First, the novel Gated Tanh-ReLU Units can selectively output the sentiment features according to the given aspect or entity. The architecture is much simpler than attention layer used in the existing models. Second, the computations of our model could be easily parallelized during training, because convolutional layers do not have time dependency as in LSTM layers, and gating units also work independently. The experiments on SemEval datasets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our models."
Examining Gender and Race Bias in Two Hundred Sentiment Analysis Systems,"Automatic machine learning systems can inadvertently accentuate and perpetuate inappropriate human biases. Past work on examining inappropriate biases has largely focused on just individual systems. Further, there is no benchmark dataset for examining inappropriate biases in systems. Here for the first time, we present the Equity Evaluation Corpus (EEC), which consists of 8,640 English sentences carefully chosen to tease out biases towards certain races and genders. We use the dataset to examine 219 automatic sentiment analysis systems that took part in a recent shared task, SemEval-2018 Task 1 'Affect in Tweets'. We find that several of the systems show statistically significant bias; that is, they consistently provide slightly higher sentiment intensity predictions for one race or one gender. We make the EEC freely available."
"Statistical Analysis on E-Commerce Reviews, with Sentiment Classification using Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)","Understanding customer sentiments is of paramount importance in marketing strategies today. Not only will it give companies an insight as to how customers perceive their products and/or services, but it will also give them an idea on how to improve their offers. This paper attempts to understand the correlation of different variables in customer reviews on a women clothing e-commerce, and to classify each review whether it recommends the reviewed product or not and whether it consists of positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. To achieve these goals, we employed univariate and multivariate analyses on dataset features except for review titles and review texts, and we implemented a bidirectional recurrent neural network (RNN) with long-short term memory unit (LSTM) for recommendation and sentiment classification. Results have shown that a recommendation is a strong indicator of a positive sentiment score, and vice-versa. On the other hand, ratings in product reviews are fuzzy indicators of sentiment scores. We also found out that the bidirectional LSTM was able to reach an F1-score of 0.88 for recommendation classification, and 0.93 for sentiment classification."
Various Approaches to Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis,"The problem of aspect-based sentiment analysis deals with classifying sentiments (negative, neutral, positive) for a given aspect in a sentence. A traditional sentiment classification task involves treating the entire sentence as a text document and classifying sentiments based on all the words. Let us assume, we have a sentence such as ""the acceleration of this car is fast, but the reliability is horrible"". This can be a difficult sentence because it has two aspects with conflicting sentiments about the same entity. Considering machine learning techniques (or deep learning), how do we encode the information that we are interested in one aspect and its sentiment but not the other? Let us explore various pre-processing steps, features, and methods used to facilitate in solving this task."
Word2Vec and Doc2Vec in Unsupervised Sentiment Analysis of Clinical Discharge Summaries,"In this study, we explored application of Word2Vec and Doc2Vec for sentiment analysis of clinical discharge summaries. We applied unsupervised learning since the data sets did not have sentiment annotations. Note that unsupervised learning is a more realistic scenario than supervised learning which requires an access to a training set of sentiment-annotated data. We aim to detect if there exists any underlying bias towards or against a certain disease. We used SentiWordNet to establish a gold sentiment standard for the data sets and evaluate performance of Word2Vec and Doc2Vec methods. We have shown that the Word2vec and Doc2Vec methods complement each other results in sentiment analysis of the data sets."
Recurrent Entity Networks with Delayed Memory Update for Targeted Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis,"While neural networks have been shown to achieve impressive results for sentence-level sentiment analysis, targeted aspect-based sentiment analysis (TABSA) --- extraction of fine-grained opinion polarity w.r.t. a pre-defined set of aspects --- remains a difficult task. Motivated by recent advances in memory-augmented models for machine reading, we propose a novel architecture, utilising external ""memory chains"" with a delayed memory update mechanism to track entities. On a TABSA task, the proposed model demonstrates substantial improvements over state-of-the-art approaches, including those using external knowledge bases."
Deep Learning for Digital Text Analytics: Sentiment Analysis,"In today's scenario, imagining a world without negativity is something very unrealistic, as bad NEWS spreads more virally than good ones. Though it seems impractical in real life, this could be implemented by building a system using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing techniques in identifying the news datum with negative shade and filter them by taking only the news with positive shade (good news) to the end user. In this work, around two lakhs datum have been trained and tested using a combination of rule-based and data driven approaches. VADER along with a filtration method has been used as an annotating tool followed by statistical Machine Learning approach that have used Document Term Matrix (representation) and Support Vector Machine (classification). Deep Learning algorithms then came into picture to make this system reliable (Doc2Vec) which finally ended up with Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) that yielded better results than the other experimented modules. It showed up a training accuracy of 96%, while a test accuracy of (internal and external news datum) above 85% was obtained."
Scalable Sentiment for Sequence-to-sequence Chatbot Response with Performance Analysis,"Conventional seq2seq chatbot models only try to find the sentences with the highest probabilities conditioned on the input sequences, without considering the sentiment of the output sentences. Some research works trying to modify the sentiment of the output sequences were reported. In this paper, we propose five models to scale or adjust the sentiment of the chatbot response: persona-based model, reinforcement learning, plug and play model, sentiment transformation network and cycleGAN, all based on the conventional seq2seq model. We also develop two evaluation metrics to estimate if the responses are reasonable given the input. These metrics together with other two popularly used metrics were used to analyze the performance of the five proposed models on different aspects, and reinforcement learning and cycleGAN were shown to be very attractive. The evaluation metrics were also found to be well correlated with human evaluation."
Sentiment Analysis of Code-Mixed Languages leveraging Resource Rich Languages,"Code-mixed data is an important challenge of natural language processing because its characteristics completely vary from the traditional structures of standard languages.  In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Sentiment Analysis of Code-Mixed Text (SACMT) to classify sentences into their corresponding sentiment - positive, negative or neutral, using contrastive learning. We utilize the shared parameters of siamese networks to map the sentences of code-mixed and standard languages to a common sentiment space. Also, we introduce a basic clustering based preprocessing method to capture variations of code-mixed transliterated words. Our experiments reveal that SACMT outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in sentiment analysis for code-mixed text by 7.6% in accuracy and 10.1% in F-score."
Sentiment Analysis of Comments on Rohingya Movement with Support Vector Machine,"The Rohingya Movement and Crisis caused a huge uproar in the political and economic state of Bangladesh. Refugee movement is a recurring event and a large amount of data in the form of opinions remains on social media such as Facebook, with very little analysis done on them.To analyse the comments based on all Rohingya related posts, we had to create and modify a classifier based on the Support Vector Machine algorithm. The code is implemented in python and uses scikit-learn library. A dataset on Rohingya analysis is not currently available so we had to use our own data set of 2500 positive and 2500 negative comments. We specifically used a support vector machine with linear kernel. A previous experiment was performed by us on the same dataset using the naive bayes algorithm, but that did not yield impressive results."
-hot Lexicon Embedding-based Two-level LSTM for Sentiment Analysis,"Sentiment analysis is a key component in various text mining applications. Numerous sentiment classification techniques, including conventional and deep learning-based methods, have been proposed in the literature. In most existing methods, a high-quality training set is assumed to be given. Nevertheless, constructing a high-quality training set that consists of highly accurate labels is challenging in real applications. This difficulty stems from the fact that text samples usually contain complex sentiment representations, and their annotation is subjective. We address this challenge in this study by leveraging a new labeling strategy and utilizing a two-level long short-term memory network to construct a sentiment classifier. Lexical cues are useful for sentiment analysis, and they have been utilized in conventional studies. For example, polar and privative words play important roles in sentiment analysis. A new encoding strategy, that is, ρ-hot encoding, is proposed to alleviate the drawbacks of one-hot encoding and thus effectively incorporate useful lexical cues. We compile three Chinese data sets on the basis of our label strategy and proposed methodology. Experiments on the three data sets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms."
Multimodal Sentiment Analysis: Addressing Key Issues and Setting up the Baselines,"We compile baselines, along with dataset split, for multimodal sentiment analysis. In this paper, we explore three different deep-learning based architectures for multimodal sentiment classification, each improving upon the previous. Further, we evaluate these architectures with multiple datasets with fixed train/test partition. We also discuss some major issues, frequently ignored in multimodal sentiment analysis research, e.g., role of speaker-exclusive models, importance of different modalities, and generalizability. This framework illustrates the different facets of analysis to be considered while performing multimodal sentiment analysis and, hence, serves as a new benchmark for future research in this emerging field."
Sentiment Analysis of Code-Mixed Indian Languages: An Overview of SAIL_Code-Mixed Shared Task @ICON-2017,"Sentiment analysis is essential in many real-world applications such as stance detection, review analysis, recommendation system, and so on. Sentiment analysis becomes more difficult when the data is noisy and collected from social media. India is a multilingual country; people use more than one languages to communicate within themselves. The switching in between the languages is called code-switching or code-mixing, depending upon the type of mixing. This paper presents overview of the shared task on sentiment analysis of code-mixed data pairs of Hindi-English and Bengali-English collected from the different social media platform. The paper describes the task, dataset, evaluation, baseline and participant's systems."
A Benchmark Study on Sentiment Analysis for Software Engineering Research,"A recent research trend has emerged to identify developers' emotions, by applying sentiment analysis to the content of communication traces left in collaborative development environments. Trying to overcome the limitations posed by using off-the-shelf sentiment analysis tools, researchers recently started to develop their own tools for the software engineering domain. In this paper, we report a benchmark study to assess the performance and reliability of three sentiment analysis tools specifically customized for software engineering. Furthermore, we offer a reflection on the open challenges, as they emerge from a qualitative analysis of misclassified texts."
Preparing Bengali-English Code-Mixed Corpus for Sentiment Analysis of Indian Languages,"Analysis of informative contents and sentiments of social users has been attempted quite intensively in the recent past. Most of the systems are usable only for monolingual data and fails or gives poor results when used on data with code-mixing property. To gather attention and encourage researchers to work on this crisis, we prepared gold standard Bengali-English code-mixed data with language and polarity tag for sentiment analysis purposes. In this paper, we discuss the systems we prepared to collect and filter raw Twitter data. In order to reduce manual work while annotation, hybrid systems combining rule based and supervised models were developed for both language and sentiment tagging. The final corpus was annotated by a group of annotators following a few guidelines. The gold standard corpus thus obtained has impressive inter-annotator agreement obtained in terms of Kappa values. Various metrics like Code-Mixed Index (CMI), Code-Mixed Factor (CF) along with various aspects (language and emotion) also qualitatively polled the code-mixed and sentiment properties of the corpus."
Improving Sentiment Analysis in Arabic Using Word Representation,"The complexities of Arabic language in morphology, orthography and dialects makes sentiment analysis for Arabic more challenging. Also, text feature extraction from short messages like tweets, in order to gauge the sentiment, makes this task even more difficult. In recent years, deep neural networks were often employed and showed very good results in sentiment classification and natural language processing applications. Word embedding, or word distributing approach, is a current and powerful tool to capture together the closest words from a contextual text. In this paper, we describe how we construct Word2Vec models from a large Arabic corpus obtained from ten newspapers in different Arab countries. By applying different machine learning algorithms and convolutional neural networks with different text feature selections, we report improved accuracy of sentiment classification (91%-95%) on our publicly available Arabic language health sentiment dataset [1]"
Sentiment Analysis on Speaker Specific Speech Data,"Sentiment analysis has evolved over past few decades, most of the work in it revolved around textual sentiment analysis with text mining techniques. But audio sentiment analysis is still in a nascent stage in the research community. In this proposed research, we perform sentiment analysis on speaker discriminated speech transcripts to detect the emotions of the individual speakers involved in the conversation. We analyzed different techniques to perform speaker discrimination and sentiment analysis to find efficient algorithms to perform this task."
Disentangling Aspect and Opinion Words in Target-based Sentiment Analysis using Lifelong Learning,"Given a target name, which can be a product aspect or entity, identifying its aspect words and opinion words in a given corpus is a fine-grained task in target-based sentiment analysis (TSA). This task is challenging, especially when we have no labeled data and we want to perform it for any given domain. To address it, we propose a general two-stage approach. Stage one extracts/groups the target-related words (call t-words) for a given target. This is relatively easy as we can apply an existing semantics-based learning technique. Stage two separates the aspect and opinion words from the grouped t-words, which is challenging because we often do not have enough word-level aspect and opinion labels. In this work, we formulate this problem in a PU learning setting and incorporate the idea of lifelong learning to solve it. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach."
JU_KS@SAIL_CodeMixed-2017: Sentiment Analysis for Indian Code Mixed Social Media Texts,"This paper reports about our work in the NLP Tool Contest @ICON-2017, shared task on Sentiment Analysis for Indian Languages (SAIL) (code mixed). To implement our system, we have used a machine learning algo-rithm called Multinomial Naïve Bayes trained using n-gram and SentiWordnet features. We have also used a small SentiWordnet for English and a small SentiWordnet for Bengali. But we have not used any SentiWordnet for Hindi language. We have tested our system on Hindi-English and Bengali-English code mixed social media data sets released for the contest. The performance of our system is very close to the best system participated in the contest. For both Bengali-English and Hindi-English runs, our system was ranked at the 3rd position out of all submitted runs and awarded the 3rd prize in the contest."
Multimodal Sentiment Analysis with Word-Level Fusion and Reinforcement Learning,"With the increasing popularity of video sharing websites such as YouTube and Facebook, multimodal sentiment analysis has received increasing attention from the scientific community. Contrary to previous works in multimodal sentiment analysis which focus on holistic information in speech segments such as bag of words representations and average facial expression intensity, we develop a novel deep architecture for multimodal sentiment analysis that performs modality fusion at the word level. In this paper, we propose the Gated Multimodal Embedding LSTM with Temporal Attention (GME-LSTM(A)) model that is composed of 2 modules. The Gated Multimodal Embedding alleviates the difficulties of fusion when there are noisy modalities. The LSTM with Temporal Attention performs word level fusion at a finer fusion resolution between input modalities and attends to the most important time steps. As a result, the GME-LSTM(A) is able to better model the multimodal structure of speech through time and perform better sentiment comprehension. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on the publicly-available Multimodal Corpus of Sentiment Intensity and Subjectivity Analysis (CMU-MOSI) dataset by achieving state-of-the-art sentiment classification and regression results. Qualitative analysis on our model emphasizes the importance of the Temporal Attention Layer in sentiment prediction because the additional acoustic and visual modalities are noisy. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the Gated Multimodal Embedding in selectively filtering these noisy modalities out. Our results and analysis open new areas in the study of sentiment analysis in human communication and provide new models for multimodal fusion."
Left-Center-Right Separated Neural Network for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis with Rotatory Attention,"Deep learning techniques have achieved success in aspect-based sentiment analysis in recent years. However, there are two important issues that still remain to be further studied, i.e., 1) how to efficiently represent the target especially when the target contains multiple words; 2) how to utilize the interaction between target and left/right contexts to capture the most important words in them. In this paper, we propose an approach, called left-center-right separated neural network with rotatory attention (LCR-Rot), to better address the two problems. Our approach has two characteristics: 1) it has three separated LSTMs, i.e., left, center and right LSTMs, corresponding to three parts of a review (left context, target phrase and right context); 2) it has a rotatory attention mechanism which models the relation between target and left/right contexts. The target2context attention is used to capture the most indicative sentiment words in left/right contexts. Subsequently, the context2target attention is used to capture the most important word in the target. This leads to a two-side representation of the target: left-aware target and right-aware target. We compare our approach on three benchmark datasets with ten related methods proposed recently. The results show that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques."
Preparation of Improved Turkish DataSet for Sentiment Analysis in Social Media,"A public dataset, with a variety of properties suitable for sentiment analysis [1], event prediction, trend detection and other text mining applications, is needed in order to be able to successfully perform analysis studies. The vast majority of data on social media is text-based and it is not possible to directly apply machine learning processes into these raw data, since several different processes are required to prepare the data before the implementation of the algorithms. For example, different misspellings of same word enlarge the word vector space unnecessarily, thereby it leads to reduce the success of the algorithm and increase the computational power requirement. This paper presents an improved Turkish dataset with an effective spelling correction algorithm based on Hadoop [2]. The collected data is recorded on the Hadoop Distributed File System and the text based data is processed by MapReduce programming model. This method is suitable for the storage and processing of large sized text based social media data. In this study, movie reviews have been automatically recorded with Apache ManifoldCF (MCF) [3] and data clusters have been created. Various methods compared such as Levenshtein and Fuzzy String Matching have been proposed to create a public dataset from collected data. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm, which can be used as an open source dataset in sentiment analysis studies, have been performed successfully to the detection and correction of spelling errors."
Combining Convolution and Recursive Neural Networks for Sentiment Analysis,"This paper addresses the problem of sentence-level sentiment analysis. In recent years, Convolution and Recursive Neural Networks have been proven to be effective network architecture for sentence-level sentiment analysis. Nevertheless, each of them has their own potential drawbacks. For alleviating their weaknesses, we combined Convolution and Recursive Neural Networks into a new network architecture. In addition, we employed transfer learning from a large document-level labeled sentiment dataset to improve the word embedding in our models. The resulting models outperform all recent Convolution and Recursive Neural Networks. Beyond that, our models achieve comparable performance with state-of-the-art systems on Stanford Sentiment Treebank."
Deep Learning for Sentiment Analysis : A Survey,"Deep learning has emerged as a powerful machine learning technique that learns multiple layers of representations or features of the data and produces state-of-the-art prediction results. Along with the success of deep learning in many other application domains, deep learning is also popularly used in sentiment analysis in recent years. This paper first gives an overview of deep learning and then provides a comprehensive survey of its current applications in sentiment analysis."
SentiPers: A Sentiment Analysis Corpus for Persian,"Sentiment Analysis (SA) is a major field of study in natural language processing, computational linguistics and information retrieval. Interest in SA has been constantly growing in both academia and industry over the recent years. Moreover, there is an increasing need for generating appropriate resources and datasets in particular for low resource languages including Persian. These datasets play an important role in designing and developing appropriate opinion mining platforms using supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised methods. In this paper, we outline the entire process of developing a manually annotated sentiment corpus, SentiPers, which covers formal and informal written contemporary Persian. To the best of our knowledge, SentiPers is a unique sentiment corpus with such a rich annotation in three different levels including document-level, sentence-level, and entity/aspect-level for Persian. The corpus contains more than 26000 sentences of users opinions from digital product domain and benefits from special characteristics such as quantifying the positiveness or negativity of an opinion through assigning a number within a specific range to any given sentence. Furthermore, we present statistics on various components of our corpus as well as studying the inter-annotator agreement among the annotators. Finally, some of the challenges that we faced during the annotation process will be discussed as well."
Public Sentiment and Demand for Used Cars after A Large-Scale Disaster: Social Media Sentiment Analysis with Facebook Pages,"There have been various studies analyzing public sentiment after a large-scale disaster. However, few studies have focused on the relationship between public sentiment on social media and its results on people's activities in the real world. In this paper, we conduct a long-term sentiment analysis after the Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami of 2011 using Facebook Pages with the aim of investigating the correlation between public sentiment and people's actual needs in areas damaged by water disasters. In addition, we try to analyze whether different types of disaster-related communication created different kinds of relationships on people's activities in the physical world. Our analysis reveals that sentiment of geo-info-related communication, which might be affected by sentiment inside a damaged area, had a positive correlation with the prices of used cars in the damaged area. On the other hand, the sentiment of disaster-interest-based-communication, which might be affected more by people who were interested in the disaster, but were outside the damaged area, had a negative correlation with the prices of used cars. The result could be interpreted to mean that when people begin to recover, used-car prices rise because they become more positive in their sentiment. This study suggests that, for long-term disaster-recovery analysis, we need to consider the different characteristics of online communication posted by locals directly affected by the disaster and non-locals not directly affected by the disaster."
Polypus: a Big Data Self-Deployable Architecture for Microblogging Text Extraction and Real-Time Sentiment Analysis,"In this paper we propose a new parallel architecture based on Big Data technologies for real-time sentiment analysis on microblogging posts. Polypus is a modular framework that provides the following functionalities: (1) massive text extraction from Twitter, (2) distributed non-relational storage optimized for time range queries, (3) memory-based intermodule buffering, (4) real-time sentiment classification, (5) near real-time keyword sentiment aggregation in time series, (6) a HTTP API to interact with the Polypus cluster and (7) a web interface to analyze results visually. The whole architecture is self-deployable and based on Docker containers."
Any-gram Kernels for Sentence Classification: A Sentiment Analysis Case Study,"Any-gram kernels are a flexible and efficient way to employ bag-of-n-gram features when learning from textual data. They are also compatible with the use of word embeddings so that word similarities can be accounted for. While the original any-gram kernels are implemented on top of tree kernels, we propose a new approach which is independent of tree kernels and is more efficient. We also propose a more effective way to make use of word embeddings than the original any-gram formulation. When applied to the task of sentiment classification, our new formulation achieves significantly better performance."
Towards a science of human stories: using sentiment analysis and emotional arcs to understand the building blocks of complex social systems,"Given the growing assortment of sentiment measuring instruments, it is imperative to understand which aspects of sentiment dictionaries contribute to both their classification accuracy and their ability to provide richer understanding of texts. Here, we perform detailed, quantitative tests and qualitative assessments of 6 dictionary-based methods applied, and briefly examine a further 20 methods. We show that while inappropriate for sentences, dictionary-based methods are generally robust in their classification accuracy for longer texts.  Stories often following distinct emotional trajectories, forming patterns that are meaningful to us. By classifying the emotional arcs for a filtered subset of 4,803 stories from Project Gutenberg's fiction collection, we find a set of six core trajectories which form the building blocks of complex narratives. Of profound scientific interest will be the degree to which we can eventually understand the full landscape of human stories, and data driven approaches will play a crucial role.  Finally, we utilize web-scale data from Twitter to study the limits of what social data can tell us about public health, mental illness, discourse around the protest movement of #BlackLivesMatter, discourse around climate change, and hidden networks. We conclude with a review of published works in complex systems that separately analyze charitable donations, the happiness of words in 10 languages, 100 years of daily temperature data across the United States, and Australian Rules Football games."
Learning to Attend via Word-Aspect Associative Fusion for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis,"Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) tries to predict the polarity of a given document with respect to a given aspect entity. While neural network architectures have been successful in predicting the overall polarity of sentences, aspect-specific sentiment analysis still remains as an open problem. In this paper, we propose a novel method for integrating aspect information into the neural model. More specifically, we incorporate aspect information into the neural model by modeling word-aspect relationships. Our novel model, \textit{Aspect Fusion LSTM} (AF-LSTM) learns to attend based on associative relationships between sentence words and aspect which allows our model to adaptively focus on the correct words given an aspect term. This ameliorates the flaws of other state-of-the-art models that utilize naive concatenations to model word-aspect similarity. Instead, our model adopts circular convolution and circular correlation to model the similarity between aspect and words and elegantly incorporates this within a differentiable neural attention framework. Finally, our model is end-to-end differentiable and highly related to convolution-correlation (holographic like) memories. Our proposed neural model achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, outperforming ATAE-LSTM by 4\%-5\% on average across multiple datasets."
Audio-Visual Sentiment Analysis for Learning Emotional Arcs in Movies,"Stories can have tremendous power -- not only useful for entertainment, they can activate our interests and mobilize our actions. The degree to which a story resonates with its audience may be in part reflected in the emotional journey it takes the audience upon. In this paper, we use machine learning methods to construct emotional arcs in movies, calculate families of arcs, and demonstrate the ability for certain arcs to predict audience engagement. The system is applied to Hollywood films and high quality shorts found on the web. We begin by using deep convolutional neural networks for audio and visual sentiment analysis. These models are trained on both new and existing large-scale datasets, after which they can be used to compute separate audio and visual emotional arcs. We then crowdsource annotations for 30-second video clips extracted from highs and lows in the arcs in order to assess the micro-level precision of the system, with precision measured in terms of agreement in polarity between the system's predictions and annotators' ratings. These annotations are also used to combine the audio and visual predictions. Next, we look at macro-level characterizations of movies by investigating whether there exist `universal shapes' of emotional arcs. In particular, we develop a clustering approach to discover distinct classes of emotional arcs. Finally, we show on a sample corpus of short web videos that certain emotional arcs are statistically significant predictors of the number of comments a video receives. These results suggest that the emotional arcs learned by our approach successfully represent macroscopic aspects of a video story that drive audience engagement. Such machine understanding could be used to predict audience reactions to video stories, ultimately improving our ability as storytellers to communicate with each other."
Improved Twitter Sentiment Analysis Using Naive Bayes and Custom Language Model,"In the last couple decades, social network services like Twitter have generated large volumes of data about users and their interests, providing meaningful business intelligence so organizations can better understand and engage their customers. All businesses want to know who is promoting their products, who is complaining about them, and how are these opinions bringing or diminishing value to a company. Companies want to be able to identify their high-value customers and quantify the value each user brings. Many businesses use social media metrics to calculate the user contribution score, which enables them to quantify the value that influential users bring on social media, so the businesses can offer them more differentiated services. However, the score calculation can be refined to provide a better illustration of a user's contribution. Using Microsoft Azure as a case study, we conducted Twitter sentiment analysis to develop a machine learning classification model that identifies tweet contents and sentiments most illustrative of positive-value user contribution. Using data mining and AI-powered cognitive tools, we analyzed factors of social influence and specifically, promotional language in the developer community. Our predictive model was a combination of a traditional supervised machine learning algorithm and a custom-developed natural language model for identifying promotional tweets, that identifies a product-specific promotion on Twitter with a 90% accuracy rate."
Sentiment analysis of twitter data,"Social networks are the main resources to gather information about people's opinion and sentiments towards different topics as they spend hours daily on social media and share their opinion. In this technical paper, we show the application of sentimental analysis and how to connect to Twitter and run sentimental analysis queries. We run experiments on different queries from politics to humanity and show the interesting results. We realized that the neutral sentiments for tweets are significantly high which clearly shows the limitations of the current works."
Multiple Instance Learning Networks for Fine-Grained Sentiment Analysis,"We consider the task of fine-grained sentiment analysis from the perspective of multiple instance learning (MIL). Our neural model is trained on document sentiment labels, and learns to predict the sentiment of text segments, i.e. sentences or elementary discourse units (EDUs), without segment-level supervision. We introduce an attention-based polarity scoring method for identifying positive and negative text snippets and a new dataset which we call SPOT (as shorthand for Segment-level POlariTy annotations) for evaluating MIL-style sentiment models like ours. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance against multiple baselines, whereas a judgement elicitation study shows that EDU-level opinion extraction produces more informative summaries than sentence-based alternatives."
Improving the Accuracy of Pre-trained Word Embeddings for Sentiment Analysis,"Sentiment analysis is one of the well-known tasks and fast growing research areas in natural language processing (NLP) and text classifications. This technique has become an essential part of a wide range of applications including politics, business, advertising and marketing. There are various techniques for sentiment analysis, but recently word embeddings methods have been widely used in sentiment classification tasks. Word2Vec and GloVe are currently among the most accurate and usable word embedding methods which can convert words into meaningful vectors. However, these methods ignore sentiment information of texts and need a huge corpus of texts for training and generating exact vectors which are used as inputs of deep learning models. As a result, because of the small size of some corpuses, researcher often have to use pre-trained word embeddings which were trained on other large text corpus such as Google News with about 100 billion words. The increasing accuracy of pre-trained word embeddings has a great impact on sentiment analysis research. In this paper we propose a novel method, Improved Word Vectors (IWV), which increases the accuracy of pre-trained word embeddings in sentiment analysis. Our method is based on Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging techniques, lexicon-based approaches and Word2Vec/GloVe methods. We tested the accuracy of our method via different deep learning models and sentiment datasets. Our experiment results show that Improved Word Vectors (IWV) are very effective for sentiment analysis."
10Sent: A Stable Sentiment Analysis Method Based on the Combination of Off-The-Shelf Approaches,"Sentiment analysis has become a very important tool for analysis of social media data. There are several methods developed for this research field, many of them working very differently from each other, covering distinct aspects of the problem and disparate strategies. Despite the large number of existent techniques, there is no single one which fits well in all cases or for all data sources. Supervised approaches may be able to adapt to specific situations but they require manually labeled training, which is very cumbersome and expensive to acquire, mainly for a new application. In this context, in here, we propose to combine several very popular and effective state-of-the-practice sentiment analysis methods, by means of an unsupervised bootstrapped strategy for polarity classification. One of our main goals is to reduce the large variability (lack of stability) of the unsupervised methods across different domains (datasets). Our solution was thoroughly tested considering thirteen different datasets in several domains such as opinions, comments, and social media. The experimental results demonstrate that our combined method (aka, 10SENT) improves the effectiveness of the classification task, but more importantly, it solves a key problem in the field. It is consistently among the best methods in many data types, meaning that it can produce the best (or close to best) results in almost all considered contexts, without any additional costs (e.g., manual labeling). Our self-learning approach is also very independent of the base methods, which means that it is highly extensible to incorporate any new additional method that can be envisioned in the future. Finally, we also investigate a transfer learning approach for sentiment analysis as a means to gather additional (unsupervised) information for the proposed approach and we show the potential of this technique to improve our results."
Visual and Textual Sentiment Analysis Using Deep Fusion Convolutional Neural Networks,"Sentiment analysis is attracting more and more attentions and has become a very hot research topic due to its potential applications in personalized recommendation, opinion mining, etc. Most of the existing methods are based on either textual or visual data and can not achieve satisfactory results, as it is very hard to extract sufficient information from only one single modality data. Inspired by the observation that there exists strong semantic correlation between visual and textual data in social medias, we propose an end-to-end deep fusion convolutional neural network to jointly learn textual and visual sentiment representations from training examples. The two modality information are fused together in a pooling layer and fed into fully-connected layers to predict the sentiment polarity. We evaluate the proposed approach on two widely used data sets. Results show that our method achieves promising result compared with the state-of-the-art methods which clearly demonstrate its competency."
Topic Based Sentiment Analysis Using Deep Learning,"In this paper , we tackle Sentiment Analysis conditioned on a Topic in Twitter data using Deep Learning . We propose a 2-tier approach : In the first phase we create our own Word Embeddings and see that they do perform better than state-of-the-art embeddings when used with standard classifiers. We then perform inference on these embeddings to learn more about a word with respect to all the topics being considered, and also the top n-influencing words for each topic. In the second phase we use these embeddings to predict the sentiment of the tweet with respect to a given topic, and all other topics under discussion."
NileTMRG at SemEval-2017 Task 4: Arabic Sentiment Analysis,"This paper describes two systems that were used by the authors for addressing Arabic Sentiment Analysis as part of SemEval-2017, task 4. The authors participated in three Arabic related subtasks which are: Subtask A (Message Polarity Classification), Sub-task B (Topic-Based Message Polarity classification) and Subtask D (Tweet quantification) using the team name of NileTMRG. For subtask A, we made use of our previously developed sentiment analyzer which we augmented with a scored lexicon. For subtasks B and D, we used an ensemble of three different classifiers. The first classifier was a convolutional neural network for which we trained (word2vec) word embeddings. The second classifier consisted of a MultiLayer Perceptron, while the third classifier was a Logistic regression model that takes the same input as the second classifier. Voting between the three classifiers was used to determine the final outcome. The output from task B, was quantified to produce the results for task D. In all three Arabic related tasks in which NileTMRG participated, the team ranked at number one."
Combining Lexical Features and a Supervised Learning Approach for Arabic Sentiment Analysis,"The importance of building sentiment analysis tools for Arabic social media has been recognized during the past couple of years, especially with the rapid increase in the number of Arabic social media users. One of the main difficulties in tackling this problem is that text within social media is mostly colloquial, with many dialects being used within social media platforms. In this paper, we present a set of features that were integrated with a machine learning based sentiment analysis model and applied on Egyptian, Saudi, Levantine, and MSA Arabic social media datasets. Many of the proposed features were derived through the use of an Arabic Sentiment Lexicon. The model also presents emoticon based features, as well as input text related features such as the number of segments within the text, the length of the text, whether the text ends with a question mark or not, etc. We show that the presented features have resulted in an increased accuracy across six of the seven datasets we've experimented with and which are all benchmarked. Since the developed model out-performs all existing Arabic sentiment analysis systems that have publicly available datasets, we can state that this model presents state-of-the-art in Arabic sentiment analysis."
Basic tasks of sentiment analysis,"Subjectivity detection is the task of identifying objective and subjective sentences. Objective sentences are those which do not exhibit any sentiment. So, it is desired for a sentiment analysis engine to find and separate the objective sentences for further analysis, e.g., polarity detection. In subjective sentences, opinions can often be expressed on one or multiple topics. Aspect extraction is a subtask of sentiment analysis that consists in identifying opinion targets in opinionated text, i.e., in detecting the specific aspects of a product or service the opinion holder is either praising or complaining about."
RETUYT in TASS 2017: Sentiment Analysis for Spanish Tweets using SVM and CNN,This article presents classifiers based on SVM and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for the TASS 2017 challenge on tweets sentiment analysis. The classifier with the best performance in general uses a combination of SVM and CNN. The use of word embeddings was particularly useful for improving the classifiers performance.
Crowdsourcing for Beyond Polarity Sentiment Analysis A Pure Emotion Lexicon,"Sentiment analysis aims to uncover emotions conveyed through information. In its simplest form, it is performed on a polarity basis, where the goal is to classify information with positive or negative emotion. Recent research has explored more nuanced ways to capture emotions that go beyond polarity. For these methods to work, they require a critical resource: a lexicon that is appropriate for the task at hand, in terms of the range of emotions it captures diversity. In the past, sentiment analysis lexicons have been created by experts, such as linguists and behavioural scientists, with strict rules. Lexicon evaluation was also performed by experts or gold standards. In our paper, we propose a crowdsourcing method for lexicon acquisition, which is scalable, cost-effective, and doesn't require experts or gold standards. We also compare crowd and expert evaluations of the lexicon, to assess the overall lexicon quality, and the evaluation capabilities of the crowd."
Deep Learning Paradigm with Transformed Monolingual Word Embeddings for Multilingual Sentiment Analysis,"The surge of social media use brings huge demand of multilingual sentiment analysis (MSA) for unveiling cultural difference. So far, traditional methods resorted to machine translation---translating texts in other languages to English, and then adopt the methods once worked in English. However, this paradigm is conditioned by the quality of machine translation. In this paper, we propose a new deep learning paradigm to assimilate the differences between languages for MSA. We first pre-train monolingual word embeddings separately, then map word embeddings in different spaces into a shared embedding space, and then finally train a parameter-sharing deep neural network for MSA. The experimental results show that our paradigm is effective. Especially, our CNN model outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline by around 2.1% in terms of classification accuracy."
On the Challenges of Sentiment Analysis for Dynamic Events,"With the proliferation of social media over the last decade, determining people's attitude with respect to a specific topic, document, interaction or events has fueled research interest in natural language processing and introduced a new channel called sentiment and emotion analysis. For instance, businesses routinely look to develop systems to automatically understand their customer conversations by identifying the relevant content to enhance marketing their products and managing their reputations. Previous efforts to assess people's sentiment on Twitter have suggested that Twitter may be a valuable resource for studying political sentiment and that it reflects the offline political landscape. According to a Pew Research Center report, in January 2016 44 percent of US adults stated having learned about the presidential election through social media. Furthermore, 24 percent reported use of social media posts of the two candidates as a source of news and information, which is more than the 15 percent who have used both candidates' websites or emails combined. The first presidential debate between Trump and Hillary was the most tweeted debate ever with 17.1 million tweets."
Semantic Sentiment Analysis of Twitter Data,"Internet and the proliferation of smart mobile devices have changed the way information is created, shared, and spreads, e.g., microblogs such as Twitter, weblogs such as LiveJournal, social networks such as Facebook, and instant messengers such as Skype and WhatsApp are now commonly used to share thoughts and opinions about anything in the surrounding world. This has resulted in the proliferation of social media content, thus creating new opportunities to study public opinion at a scale that was never possible before. Naturally, this abundance of data has quickly attracted business and research interest from various fields including marketing, political science, and social studies, among many others, which are interested in questions like these: Do people like the new Apple Watch? Do Americans support ObamaCare? How do Scottish feel about the Brexit? Answering these questions requires studying the sentiment of opinions people express in social media, which has given rise to the fast growth of the field of sentiment analysis in social media, with Twitter being especially popular for research due to its scale, representativeness, variety of topics discussed, as well as ease of public access to its messages. Here we present an overview of work on sentiment analysis on Twitter."
Identifying Restaurant Features via Sentiment Analysis on Yelp Reviews,"Many people use Yelp to find a good restaurant. Nonetheless, with only an overall rating for each restaurant, Yelp offers not enough information for independently judging its various aspects such as environment, service or flavor. In this paper, we introduced a machine learning based method to characterize such aspects for particular types of restaurants. The main approach used in this paper is to use a support vector machine (SVM) model to decipher the sentiment tendency of each review from word frequency. Word scores generated from the SVM models are further processed into a polarity index indicating the significance of each word for special types of restaurant. Customers overall tend to express more sentiment regarding service. As for the distinction between different cuisines, results that match the common sense are obtained: Japanese cuisines are usually fresh, some French cuisines are overpriced while Italian Restaurants are often famous for their pizzas."
Using objective words in the reviews to improve the colloquial arabic sentiment analysis,"One of the main difficulties in sentiment analysis of the Arabic language is the presence of the colloquialism. In this paper, we examine the effect of using objective words in conjunction with sentimental words on sentiment classification for the colloquial Arabic reviews, specifically Jordanian colloquial reviews. The reviews often include both sentimental and objective words, however, the most existing sentiment analysis models ignore the objective words as they are considered useless. In this work, we created two lexicons: the first includes the colloquial sentimental words and compound phrases, while the other contains the objective words associated with values of sentiment tendency based on a particular estimation method. We used these lexicons to extract sentiment features that would be training input to the Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify the sentiment polarity of the reviews. The reviews dataset have been collected manually from JEERAN website. The results of the experiments show that the proposed approach improves the polarity classification in comparison to two baseline models, with accuracy 95.6%."
Text Compression for Sentiment Analysis via Evolutionary Algorithms,"Can textual data be compressed intelligently without losing accuracy in evaluating sentiment? In this study, we propose a novel evolutionary compression algorithm, PARSEC (PARts-of-Speech for sEntiment Compression), which makes use of Parts-of-Speech tags to compress text in a way that sacrifices minimal classification accuracy when used in conjunction with sentiment analysis algorithms. An analysis of PARSEC with eight commercial and non-commercial sentiment analysis algorithms on twelve English sentiment data sets reveals that accurate compression is possible with (0%, 1.3%, 3.3%) loss in sentiment classification accuracy for (20%, 50%, 75%) data compression with PARSEC using LingPipe, the most accurate of the sentiment algorithms. Other sentiment analysis algorithms are more severely affected by compression. We conclude that significant compression of text data is possible for sentiment analysis depending on the accuracy demands of the specific application and the specific sentiment analysis algorithm used."
Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis Using a Two-Step Neural Network Architecture,"The World Wide Web holds a wealth of information in the form of unstructured texts such as customer reviews for products, events and more. By extracting and analyzing the expressed opinions in customer reviews in a fine-grained way, valuable opportunities and insights for customers and businesses can be gained. We propose a neural network based system to address the task of Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis to compete in Task 2 of the ESWC-2016 Challenge on Semantic Sentiment Analysis. Our proposed architecture divides the task in two subtasks: aspect term extraction and aspect-specific sentiment extraction. This approach is flexible in that it allows to address each subtask independently. As a first step, a recurrent neural network is used to extract aspects from a text by framing the problem as a sequence labeling task. In a second step, a recurrent network processes each extracted aspect with respect to its context and predicts a sentiment label. The system uses pretrained semantic word embedding features which we experimentally enhance with semantic knowledge extracted from WordNet. Further features extracted from SenticNet prove to be beneficial for the extraction of sentiment labels. As the best performing system in its category, our proposed system proves to be an effective approach for the Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis."
Aspect-Based Relational Sentiment Analysis Using a Stacked Neural Network Architecture,"Sentiment analysis can be regarded as a relation extraction problem in which the sentiment of some opinion holder towards a certain aspect of a product, theme or event needs to be extracted. We present a novel neural architecture for sentiment analysis as a relation extraction problem that addresses this problem by dividing it into three subtasks: i) identification of aspect and opinion terms, ii) labeling of opinion terms with a sentiment, and iii) extraction of relations between opinion terms and aspect terms. For each subtask, we propose a neural network based component and combine all of them into a complete system for relational sentiment analysis. The component for aspect and opinion term extraction is a hybrid architecture consisting of a recurrent neural network stacked on top of a convolutional neural network. This approach outperforms a standard convolutional deep neural architecture as well as a recurrent network architecture and performs competitively compared to other methods on two datasets of annotated customer reviews. To extract sentiments for individual opinion terms, we propose a recurrent architecture in combination with word distance features and achieve promising results, outperforming a majority baseline by 18% accuracy and providing the first results for the USAGE dataset. Our relation extraction component outperforms the current state-of-the-art in aspect-opinion relation extraction by 15% F-Measure."
Method for Aspect-Based Sentiment Annotation Using Rhetorical Analysis,"This paper fills a gap in aspect-based sentiment analysis and aims to present a new method for preparing and analysing texts concerning opinion and generating user-friendly descriptive reports in natural language. We present a comprehensive set of techniques derived from Rhetorical Structure Theory and sentiment analysis to extract aspects from textual opinions and then build an abstractive summary of a set of opinions. Moreover, we propose aspect-aspect graphs to evaluate the importance of aspects and to filter out unimportant ones from the summary. Additionally, the paper presents a prototype solution of data flow with interesting and valuable results. The proposed method's results proved the high accuracy of aspect detection when applied to the gold standard dataset."
Sentiment Analysis by Joint Learning of Word Embeddings and Classifier,"Word embeddings are representations of individual words of a text document in a vector space and they are often use- ful for performing natural language pro- cessing tasks. Current state of the art al- gorithms for learning word embeddings learn vector representations from large corpora of text documents in an unsu- pervised fashion. This paper introduces SWESA (Supervised Word Embeddings for Sentiment Analysis), an algorithm for sentiment analysis via word embeddings. SWESA leverages document label infor- mation to learn vector representations of words from a modest corpus of text doc- uments by solving an optimization prob- lem that minimizes a cost function with respect to both word embeddings as well as classification accuracy. Analysis re- veals that SWESA provides an efficient way of estimating the dimension of the word embeddings that are to be learned. Experiments on several real world data sets show that SWESA has superior per- formance when compared to previously suggested approaches to word embeddings and sentiment analysis tasks."
Radical-level Ideograph Encoder for RNN-based Sentiment Analysis of Chinese and Japanese,"The character vocabulary can be very large in non-alphabetic languages such as Chinese and Japanese, which makes neural network models huge to process such languages. We explored a model for sentiment classification that takes the embeddings of the radicals of the Chinese characters, i.e, hanzi of Chinese and kanji of Japanese. Our model is composed of a CNN word feature encoder and a bi-directional RNN document feature encoder. The results achieved are on par with the character embedding-based models, and close to the state-of-the-art word embedding-based models, with 90% smaller vocabulary, and at least 13% and 80% fewer parameters than the character embedding-based models and word embedding-based models respectively. The results suggest that the radical embedding-based approach is cost-effective for machine learning on Chinese and Japanese."
Benchmarking Multimodal Sentiment Analysis,"We propose a framework for multimodal sentiment analysis and emotion recognition using convolutional neural network-based feature extraction from text and visual modalities. We obtain a performance improvement of 10% over the state of the art by combining visual, text and audio features. We also discuss some major issues frequently ignored in multimodal sentiment analysis research: the role of speaker-independent models, importance of the modalities and generalizability. The paper thus serve as a new benchmark for further research in multimodal sentiment analysis and also demonstrates the different facets of analysis to be considered while performing such tasks."
Sentiment Analysis on Financial News Headlines using Training Dataset Augmentation,"This paper discusses the approach taken by the UWaterloo team to arrive at a solution for the Fine-Grained Sentiment Analysis problem posed by Task 5 of SemEval 2017. The paper describes the document vectorization and sentiment score prediction techniques used, as well as the design and implementation decisions taken while building the system for this task. The system uses text vectorization models, such as N-gram, TF-IDF and paragraph embeddings, coupled with regression model variants to predict the sentiment scores. Amongst the methods examined, unigrams and bigrams coupled with simple linear regression obtained the best baseline accuracy. The paper also explores data augmentation methods to supplement the training dataset. This system was designed for Subtask 2 (News Statements and Headlines)."
Strawman: an Ensemble of Deep Bag-of-Ngrams for Sentiment Analysis,"This paper describes a builder entry, named ""strawman"", to the sentence-level sentiment analysis task of the ""Build It, Break It"" shared task of the First Workshop on Building Linguistically Generalizable NLP Systems. The goal of a builder is to provide an automated sentiment analyzer that would serve as a target for breakers whose goal is to find pairs of minimally-differing sentences that break the analyzer."
Tensor Fusion Network for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis,"Multimodal sentiment analysis is an increasingly popular research area, which extends the conventional language-based definition of sentiment analysis to a multimodal setup where other relevant modalities accompany language. In this paper, we pose the problem of multimodal sentiment analysis as modeling intra-modality and inter-modality dynamics. We introduce a novel model, termed Tensor Fusion Network, which learns both such dynamics end-to-end. The proposed approach is tailored for the volatile nature of spoken language in online videos as well as accompanying gestures and voice. In the experiments, our model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for both multimodal and unimodal sentiment analysis."
Developing a concept-level knowledge base for sentiment analysis in Singlish,"In this paper, we present Singlish sentiment lexicon, a concept-level knowledge base for sentiment analysis that associates multiword expressions to a set of emotion labels and a polarity value. Unlike many other sentiment analysis resources, this lexicon is not built by manually labeling pieces of knowledge coming from general NLP resources such as WordNet or DBPedia. Instead, it is automatically constructed by applying graph-mining and multi-dimensional scaling techniques on the affective common-sense knowledge collected from three different sources. This knowledge is represented redundantly at three levels: semantic network, matrix, and vector space. Subsequently, the concepts are labeled by emotions and polarity through the ensemble application of spreading activation, neural networks and an emotion categorization model."
Multitask Learning for Fine-Grained Twitter Sentiment Analysis,Traditional sentiment analysis approaches tackle problems like ternary (3-category) and fine-grained (5-category) classification by learning the tasks separately. We argue that such classification tasks are correlated and we propose a multitask approach based on a recurrent neural network that benefits by jointly learning them. Our study demonstrates the potential of multitask models on this type of problems and improves the state-of-the-art results in the fine-grained sentiment classification problem.
On the Role of Text Preprocessing in Neural Network Architectures: An Evaluation Study on Text Categorization and Sentiment Analysis,"Text preprocessing is often the first step in the pipeline of a Natural Language Processing (NLP) system, with potential impact in its final performance. Despite its importance, text preprocessing has not received much attention in the deep learning literature. In this paper we investigate the impact of simple text preprocessing decisions (particularly tokenizing, lemmatizing, lowercasing and multiword grouping) on the performance of a standard neural text classifier. We perform an extensive evaluation on standard benchmarks from text categorization and sentiment analysis. While our experiments show that a simple tokenization of input text is generally adequate, they also highlight significant degrees of variability across preprocessing techniques. This reveals the importance of paying attention to this usually-overlooked step in the pipeline, particularly when comparing different models. Finally, our evaluation provides insights into the best preprocessing practices for training word embeddings."
Cross-Lingual Sentiment Analysis Without (Good) Translation,"Current approaches to cross-lingual sentiment analysis try to leverage the wealth of labeled English data using bilingual lexicons, bilingual vector space embeddings, or machine translation systems. Here we show that it is possible to use a single linear transformation, with as few as 2000 word pairs, to capture fine-grained sentiment relationships between words in a cross-lingual setting. We apply these cross-lingual sentiment models to a diverse set of tasks to demonstrate their functionality in a non-English context. By effectively leveraging English sentiment knowledge without the need for accurate translation, we can analyze and extract features from other languages with scarce data at a very low cost, thus making sentiment and related analyses for many languages inexpensive."
Explaining Recurrent Neural Network Predictions in Sentiment Analysis,"Recently, a technique called Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) was shown to deliver insightful explanations in the form of input space relevances for understanding feed-forward neural network classification decisions. In the present work, we extend the usage of LRP to recurrent neural networks. We propose a specific propagation rule applicable to multiplicative connections as they arise in recurrent network architectures such as LSTMs and GRUs. We apply our technique to a word-based bi-directional LSTM model on a five-class sentiment prediction task, and evaluate the resulting LRP relevances both qualitatively and quantitatively, obtaining better results than a gradient-based related method which was used in previous work."
How Important is Syntactic Parsing Accuracy? An Empirical Evaluation on Rule-Based Sentiment Analysis,"Syntactic parsing, the process of obtaining the internal structure of sentences in natural languages, is a crucial task for artificial intelligence applications that need to extract meaning from natural language text or speech. Sentiment analysis is one example of application for which parsing has recently proven useful.  In recent years, there have been significant advances in the accuracy of parsing algorithms. In this article, we perform an empirical, task-oriented evaluation to determine how parsing accuracy influences the performance of a state-of-the-art rule-based sentiment analysis system that determines the polarity of sentences from their parse trees. In particular, we evaluate the system using four well-known dependency parsers, including both current models with state-of-the-art accuracy and more innacurate models which, however, require less computational resources.  The experiments show that all of the parsers produce similarly good results in the sentiment analysis task, without their accuracy having any relevant influence on the results. Since parsing is currently a task with a relatively high computational cost that varies strongly between algorithms, this suggests that sentiment analysis researchers and users should prioritize speed over accuracy when choosing a parser; and parsing researchers should investigate models that improve speed further, even at some cost to accuracy."
An Automatic Contextual Analysis and Clustering Classifiers Ensemble approach to Sentiment Analysis,"Products reviews are one of the major resources to determine the public sentiment. The existing literature on reviews sentiment analysis mainly utilizes supervised paradigm, which needs labeled data to be trained on and suffers from domain-dependency. This article addresses these issues by describes a completely automatic approach for sentiment analysis based on unsupervised ensemble learning. The method consists of two phases. The first phase is contextual analysis, which has five processes, namely (1) data preparation; (2) spelling correction; (3) intensifier handling; (4) negation handling and (5) contrast handling. The second phase comprises the unsupervised learning approach, which is an ensemble of clustering classifiers using a majority voting mechanism with different weight schemes. The base classifier of the ensemble method is a modified k-means algorithm. The base classifier is modified by extracting initial centroids from the feature set via using SentWordNet (SWN). We also introduce new sentiment analysis problems of Australian airlines and home builders which offer potential benchmark problems in the sentiment analysis field. Our experiments on datasets from different domains show that contextual analysis and the ensemble phases improve the clustering performance in term of accuracy, stability and generalization ability."
W2VLDA: Almost Unsupervised System for Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis,"With the increase of online customer opinions in specialised websites and social networks, the necessity of automatic systems to help to organise and classify customer reviews by domain-specific aspect/categories and sentiment polarity is more important than ever. Supervised approaches to Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis obtain good results for the domain/language their are trained on, but having manually labelled data for training supervised systems for all domains and languages are usually very costly and time consuming. In this work we describe W2VLDA, an almost unsupervised system based on topic modelling, that combined with some other unsupervised methods and a minimal configuration, performs aspect/category classifiation, aspect-terms/opinion-words separation and sentiment polarity classification for any given domain and language. We evaluate the performance of the aspect and sentiment classification in the multilingual SemEval 2016 task 5 (ABSA) dataset. We show competitive results for several languages (English, Spanish, French and Dutch) and domains (hotels, restaurants, electronic-devices)."
Stock Volatility Prediction Using Recurrent Neural Networks with Sentiment Analysis,"In this paper, we propose a model to analyze sentiment of online stock forum and use the information to predict the stock volatility in the Chinese market. We have labeled the sentiment of the online financial posts and make the dataset public available for research. By generating a sentimental dictionary based on financial terms, we develop a model to compute the sentimental score of each online post related to a particular stock. Such sentimental information is represented by two sentiment indicators, which are fused to market data for stock volatility prediction by using the Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Empirical study shows that, comparing to using RNN only, the model performs significantly better with sentimental indicators."
BB_twtr at SemEval-2017 Task 4: Twitter Sentiment Analysis with CNNs and LSTMs,In this paper we describe our attempt at producing a state-of-the-art Twitter sentiment classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTMs) networks. Our system leverages a large amount of unlabeled data to pre-train word embeddings. We then use a subset of the unlabeled data to fine tune the embeddings using distant supervision. The final CNNs and LSTMs are trained on the SemEval-2017 Twitter dataset where the embeddings are fined tuned again. To boost performances we ensemble several CNNs and LSTMs together. Our approach achieved first rank on all of the five English subtasks amongst 40 teams.
Sentiment analysis based on rhetorical structure theory: Learning deep neural networks from discourse trees,"Prominent applications of sentiment analysis are countless, covering areas such as marketing, customer service and communication. The conventional bag-of-words approach for measuring sentiment merely counts term frequencies; however, it neglects the position of the terms within the discourse. As a remedy, we develop a discourse-aware method that builds upon the discourse structure of documents. For this purpose, we utilize rhetorical structure theory to label (sub-)clauses according to their hierarchical relationships and then assign polarity scores to individual leaves. To learn from the resulting rhetorical structure, we propose a tensor-based, tree-structured deep neural network (named Discourse-LSTM) in order to process the complete discourse tree. The underlying tensors infer the salient passages of narrative materials. In addition, we suggest two algorithms for data augmentation (node reordering and artificial leaf insertion) that increase our training set and reduce overfitting. Our benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of our approach. Moreover, our tensor structure reveals the salient text passages and thereby provides explanatory insights."
What we really want to find by Sentiment Analysis: The Relationship between Computational Models and Psychological State,"As the first step to model emotional state of a person, we build sentiment analysis models with existing deep neural network algorithms and compare the models with psychological measurements to enlighten the relationship. In the experiments, we first examined psychological state of 64 participants and asked them to summarize the story of a book, Chronicle of a Death Foretold (Marquez, 1981). Secondly, we trained models using crawled 365,802 movie review data; then we evaluated participants' summaries using the pretrained model as a concept of transfer learning. With the background that emotion affects on memories, we investigated the relationship between the evaluation score of the summaries from computational models and the examined psychological measurements. The result shows that although CNN performed the best among other deep neural network algorithms (LSTM, GRU), its results are not related to the psychological state. Rather, GRU shows more explainable results depending on the psychological state. The contribution of this paper can be summarized as follows: (1) we enlighten the relationship between computational models and psychological measurements. (2) we suggest this framework as objective methods to evaluate the emotion; the real sentiment analysis of a person."
NILC-USP at SemEval-2017 Task 4: A Multi-view Ensemble for Twitter Sentiment Analysis,"This paper describes our multi-view ensemble approach to SemEval-2017 Task 4 on Sentiment Analysis in Twitter, specifically, the Message Polarity Classification subtask for English (subtask A). Our system is a voting ensemble, where each base classifier is trained in a different feature space. The first space is a bag-of-words model and has a Linear SVM as base classifier. The second and third spaces are two different strategies of combining word embeddings to represent sentences and use a Linear SVM and a Logistic Regressor as base classifiers. The proposed system was ranked 18th out of 38 systems considering F1 score and 20th considering recall."
Sentiment Analysis of Citations Using Word2vec,"Citation sentiment analysis is an important task in scientific paper analysis. Existing machine learning techniques for citation sentiment analysis are focusing on labor-intensive feature engineering, which requires large annotated corpus. As an automatic feature extraction tool, word2vec has been successfully applied to sentiment analysis of short texts. In this work, I conducted empirical research with the question: how well does word2vec work on the sentiment analysis of citations? The proposed method constructed sentence vectors (sent2vec) by averaging the word embeddings, which were learned from Anthology Collections (ACL-Embeddings). I also investigated polarity-specific word embeddings (PS-Embeddings) for classifying positive and negative citations. The sentence vectors formed a feature space, to which the examined citation sentence was mapped to. Those features were input into classifiers (support vector machines) for supervised classification. Using 10-cross-validation scheme, evaluation was conducted on a set of annotated citations. The results showed that word embeddings are effective on classifying positive and negative citations. However, hand-crafted features performed better for the overall classification."
Arabic Language Sentiment Analysis on Health Services,"The social media network phenomenon leads to a massive amount of valuable data that is available online and easy to access. Many users share images, videos, comments, reviews, news and opinions on different social networks sites, with Twitter being one of the most popular ones. Data collected from Twitter is highly unstructured, and extracting useful information from tweets is a challenging task. Twitter has a huge number of Arabic users who mostly post and write their tweets using the Arabic language. While there has been a lot of research on sentiment analysis in English, the amount of researches and datasets in Arabic language is limited. This paper introduces an Arabic language dataset which is about opinions on health services and has been collected from Twitter. The paper will first detail the process of collecting the data from Twitter and also the process of filtering, pre-processing and annotating the Arabic text in order to build a big sentiment analysis dataset in Arabic. Several Machine Learning algorithms (Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression) alongside Deep and Convolutional Neural Networks were utilized in our experiments of sentiment analysis on our health dataset."
Data Selection Strategies for Multi-Domain Sentiment Analysis,"Domain adaptation is important in sentiment analysis as sentiment-indicating words vary between domains. Recently, multi-domain adaptation has become more pervasive, but existing approaches train on all available source domains including dissimilar ones. However, the selection of appropriate training data is as important as the choice of algorithm. We undertake -- to our knowledge for the first time -- an extensive study of domain similarity metrics in the context of sentiment analysis and propose novel representations, metrics, and a new scope for data selection. We evaluate the proposed methods on two large-scale multi-domain adaptation settings on tweets and reviews and demonstrate that they consistently outperform strong random and balanced baselines, while our proposed selection strategy outperforms instance-level selection and yields the best score on a large reviews corpus."
Leveraging Cognitive Features for Sentiment Analysis,"Sentiments expressed in user-generated short text and sentences are nuanced by subtleties at lexical, syntactic, semantic and pragmatic levels. To address this, we propose to augment traditional features used for sentiment analysis and sarcasm detection, with cognitive features derived from the eye-movement patterns of readers. Statistical classification using our enhanced feature set improves the performance (F-score) of polarity detection by a maximum of 3.7% and 9.3% on two datasets, over the systems that use only traditional features. We perform feature significance analysis, and experiment on a held-out dataset, showing that cognitive features indeed empower sentiment analyzers to handle complex constructs."
Fuzzy Ontology-Based Sentiment Analysis of Transportation and City Feature Reviews for Safe Traveling,"Traffic congestion is rapidly increasing in urban areas, particularly in mega cities. To date, there exist a few sensor network based systems to address this problem. However, these techniques are not suitable enough in terms of monitoring an entire transportation system and delivering emergency services when needed. These techniques require real-time data and intelligent ways to quickly determine traffic activity from useful information. In addition, these existing systems and websites on city transportation and travel rely on rating scores for different factors (e.g., safety, low crime rate, cleanliness, etc.). These rating scores are not efficient enough to deliver precise information, whereas reviews or tweets are significant, because they help travelers and transportation administrators to know about each aspect of the city. However, it is difficult for travelers to read, and for transportation systems to process, all reviews and tweets to obtain expressive sentiments regarding the needs of the city. The optimum solution for this kind of problem is analyzing the information available on social network platforms and performing sentiment analysis. On the other hand, crisp ontology-based frameworks cannot extract blurred information from tweets and reviews; therefore, they produce inadequate results. In this regard, this paper proposes fuzzy ontology-based sentiment analysis and SWRL rule-based decision-making to monitor transportation activities and to make a city- feature polarity map for travelers. This system retrieves reviews and tweets related to city features and transportation activities. The feature opinions are extracted from these retrieved data, and then fuzzy ontology is used to determine the transportation and city-feature polarity. A fuzzy ontology and an intelligent system prototype are developed by using Protégé OWL and Java, respectively."
Group Visual Sentiment Analysis,"In this paper, we introduce a framework for classifying images according to high-level sentiment. We subdivide the task into three primary problems: emotion classification on faces, human pose estimation, and 3D estimation and clustering of groups of people. We introduce novel algorithms for matching body parts to a common individual and clustering people in images based on physical location and orientation. Our results outperform several baseline approaches."
Structural Attention Neural Networks for improved sentiment analysis,"We introduce a tree-structured attention neural network for sentences and small phrases and apply it to the problem of sentiment classification. Our model expands the current recursive models by incorporating structural information around a node of a syntactic tree using both bottom-up and top-down information propagation. Also, the model utilizes structural attention to identify the most salient representations during the construction of the syntactic tree. To our knowledge, the proposed models achieve state of the art performance on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank dataset."
Fuzzy Based Implicit Sentiment Analysis on Quantitative Sentences,"With the rapid growth of social media on the web, emotional polarity computation has become a flourishing frontier in the text mining community. However, it is challenging to understand the latest trends and summarize the state or general opinions about products due to the big diversity and size of social media data and this creates the need of automated and real time opinion extraction and mining. On the other hand, the bulk of current research has been devoted to study the subjective sentences which contain opinion keywords and limited work has been reported for objective statements that imply sentiment. In this paper, fuzzy based knowledge engineering model has been developed for sentiment classification of special group of such sentences including the change or deviation from desired range or value. Drug reviews are the rich source of such statements. Therefore, in this research, some experiments were carried out on patient's reviews on several different cholesterol lowering drugs to determine their sentiment polarity. The main conclusion through this study is, in order to increase the accuracy level of existing drug opinion mining systems, objective sentences which imply opinion should be taken into account. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model obtains over 72 percent F1 value."
Distributed Real-Time Sentiment Analysis for Big Data Social Streams,"Big data trend has enforced the data-centric systems to have continuous fast data streams. In recent years, real-time analytics on stream data has formed into a new research field, which aims to answer queries about what-is-happening-now with a negligible delay. The real challenge with real-time stream data processing is that it is impossible to store instances of data, and therefore online analytical algorithms are utilized. To perform real-time analytics, pre-processing of data should be performed in a way that only a short summary of stream is stored in main memory. In addition, due to high speed of arrival, average processing time for each instance of data should be in such a way that incoming instances are not lost without being captured. Lastly, the learner needs to provide high analytical accuracy measures. Sentinel is a distributed system written in Java that aims to solve this challenge by enforcing both the processing and learning process to be done in distributed form. Sentinel is built on top of Apache Storm, a distributed computing platform. Sentinels learner, Vertical Hoeffding Tree, is a parallel decision tree-learning algorithm based on the VFDT, with ability of enabling parallel classification in distributed environments. Sentinel also uses SpaceSaving to keep a summary of the data stream and stores its summary in a synopsis data structure. Application of Sentinel on Twitter Public Stream API is shown and the results are discussed."
"The Evolution of Sentiment Analysis - A Review of Research Topics, Venues, and Top Cited Papers","Sentiment analysis is one of the fastest growing research areas in computer science, making it challenging to keep track of all the activities in the area. We present a computer-assisted literature review, where we utilize both text mining and qualitative coding, and analyze 6,996 papers from Scopus. We find that the roots of sentiment analysis are in the studies on public opinion analysis at the beginning of 20th century and in the text subjectivity analysis performed by the computational linguistics community in 1990's. However, the outbreak of computer-based sentiment analysis only occurred with the availability of subjective texts on the Web. Consequently, 99% of the papers have been published after 2004. Sentiment analysis papers are scattered to multiple publication venues, and the combined number of papers in the top-15 venues only represent ca. 30% of the papers in total. We present the top-20 cited papers from Google Scholar and Scopus and a taxonomy of research topics. In recent years, sentiment analysis has shifted from analyzing online product reviews to social media texts from Twitter and Facebook. Many topics beyond product reviews like stock markets, elections, disasters, medicine, software engineering and cyberbullying extend the utilization of sentiment analysis"
Sentiment Analysis for Twitter : Going Beyond Tweet Text,"Analysing sentiment of tweets is important as it helps to determine the users' opinion. Knowing people's opinion is crucial for several purposes starting from gathering knowledge about customer base, e-governance, campaigning and many more. In this report, we aim to develop a system to detect the sentiment from tweets. We employ several linguistic features along with some other external sources of information to detect the sentiment of a tweet. We show that augmenting the 140 character-long tweet with information harvested from external urls shared in the tweet as well as Social Media features enhances the sentiment prediction accuracy significantly."
Asymptotic Performance Analysis of Majority Sentiment Detection in Online Social Networks,"We analyze the problem of majority sentiment detection in Online Social Networks (OSN), and relate the detection error probability to the underlying graph of the OSN. Modeling the underlying social network as an Ising Markov random field prior based on a given graph, we show that in the case of the empty graph (independent sentiments) and the chain graph, the detection is always inaccurate, even when the number of users grow to infinity. In the case of the complete graph, the detection is inaccurate if the connection strength is below a certain critical value, while it is asymptotically accurate if the strength is above that critical value, which is analogous to the phase transition phenomenon in statistical physics."
"Balotage in Argentina 2015, a sentiment analysis of tweets","Twitter social network contains a large amount of information generated by its users. That information is composed of opinions and comments that may reflect trends in social behavior. There is talk of trend when it is possible to identify opinions and comments geared towards the same shared by a lot of people direction. To determine if two or more written opinions share the same address, techniques Natural Language Processing (NLP) are used. This paper proposes a methodology for predicting reflected in Twitter from the use of sentiment analysis functions NLP based on social behaviors. The case study was selected the 2015 Presidential in Argentina, and a software architecture Big Data composed Vertica data base with the component called Pulse was used. Through the analysis it was possible to detect trends in voting intentions with regard to the presidential candidates, achieving greater accuracy in predicting that achieved with traditional systems surveys."
Towards Sub-Word Level Compositions for Sentiment Analysis of Hindi-English Code Mixed Text,"Sentiment analysis (SA) using code-mixed data from social media has several applications in opinion mining ranging from customer satisfaction to social campaign analysis in multilingual societies. Advances in this area are impeded by the lack of a suitable annotated dataset. We introduce a Hindi-English (Hi-En) code-mixed dataset for sentiment analysis and perform empirical analysis comparing the suitability and performance of various state-of-the-art SA methods in social media.  In this paper, we introduce learning sub-word level representations in LSTM (Subword-LSTM) architecture instead of character-level or word-level representations. This linguistic prior in our architecture enables us to learn the information about sentiment value of important morphemes. This also seems to work well in highly noisy text containing misspellings as shown in our experiments which is demonstrated in morpheme-level feature maps learned by our model. Also, we hypothesize that encoding this linguistic prior in the Subword-LSTM architecture leads to the superior performance. Our system attains accuracy 4-5% greater than traditional approaches on our dataset, and also outperforms the available system for sentiment analysis in Hi-En code-mixed text by 18%."
Sentiment Analysis of Review Datasets Using Naive Bayes and K-NN Classifier,"The advent of Web 2.0 has led to an increase in the amount of sentimental content available in the Web. Such content is often found in social media web sites in the form of movie or product reviews, user comments, testimonials, messages in discussion forums etc. Timely discovery of the sentimental or opinionated web content has a number of advantages, the most important of all being monetization. Understanding of the sentiments of human masses towards different entities and products enables better services for contextual advertisements, recommendation systems and analysis of market trends. The focus of our project is sentiment focussed web crawling framework to facilitate the quick discovery of sentimental contents of movie reviews and hotel reviews and analysis of the same. We use statistical methods to capture elements of subjective style and the sentence polarity. The paper elaborately discusses two supervised machine learning algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbour(K-NN) and Naive Bayes and compares their overall accuracy, precisions as well as recall values. It was seen that in case of movie reviews Naive Bayes gave far better results than K-NN but for hotel reviews these algorithms gave lesser, almost same accuracies."
Sentiment Analysis of Twitter Data for Predicting Stock Market Movements,"Predicting stock market movements is a well-known problem of interest. Now-a-days social media is perfectly representing the public sentiment and opinion about current events. Especially, twitter has attracted a lot of attention from researchers for studying the public sentiments. Stock market prediction on the basis of public sentiments expressed on twitter has been an intriguing field of research. Previous studies have concluded that the aggregate public mood collected from twitter may well be correlated with Dow Jones Industrial Average Index (DJIA). The thesis of this work is to observe how well the changes in stock prices of a company, the rises and falls, are correlated with the public opinions being expressed in tweets about that company. Understanding author's opinion from a piece of text is the objective of sentiment analysis. The present paper have employed two different textual representations, Word2vec and N-gram, for analyzing the public sentiments in tweets. In this paper, we have applied sentiment analysis and supervised machine learning principles to the tweets extracted from twitter and analyze the correlation between stock market movements of a company and sentiments in tweets. In an elaborate way, positive news and tweets in social media about a company would definitely encourage people to invest in the stocks of that company and as a result the stock price of that company would increase. At the end of the paper, it is shown that a strong correlation exists between the rise and falls in stock prices with the public sentiments in tweets."
Lexicon Integrated CNN Models with Attention for Sentiment Analysis,"With the advent of word embeddings, lexicons are no longer fully utilized for sentiment analysis although they still provide important features in the traditional setting. This paper introduces a novel approach to sentiment analysis that integrates lexicon embeddings and an attention mechanism into Convolutional Neural Networks. Our approach performs separate convolutions for word and lexicon embeddings and provides a global view of the document using attention. Our models are experimented on both the SemEval'16 Task 4 dataset and the Stanford Sentiment Treebank, and show comparative or better results against the existing state-of-the-art systems. Our analysis shows that lexicon embeddings allow to build high-performing models with much smaller word embeddings, and the attention mechanism effectively dims out noisy words for sentiment analysis."
The survey of sentiment and opinion mining for behavior analysis of social media,"Nowadays, internet has changed the world into a global village. Social Media has reduced the gaps among the individuals. Previously communication was a time consuming and expensive task between the people. Social Media has earned fame because it is a cheaper and faster communication provider. Besides, social media has allowed us to reduce the gaps of physical distance, it also generates and preserves huge amount of data. The data are very valuable and it presents association degree between people and their opinions. The comprehensive analysis of the methods which are used on user behavior prediction is presented in this paper. This comparison will provide a detailed information, pros and cons in the domain of sentiment and opinion mining."
SentiHood: Targeted Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis Dataset for Urban Neighbourhoods,"In this paper, we introduce the task of targeted aspect-based sentiment analysis. The goal is to extract fine-grained information with respect to entities mentioned in user comments. This work extends both aspect-based sentiment analysis that assumes a single entity per document and targeted sentiment analysis that assumes a single sentiment towards a target entity. In particular, we identify the sentiment towards each aspect of one or more entities. As a testbed for this task, we introduce the SentiHood dataset, extracted from a question answering (QA) platform where urban neighbourhoods are discussed by users. In this context units of text often mention several aspects of one or more neighbourhoods. This is the first time that a generic social media platform in this case a QA platform, is used for fine-grained opinion mining. Text coming from QA platforms is far less constrained compared to text from review specific platforms which current datasets are based on. We develop several strong baselines, relying on logistic regression and state-of-the-art recurrent neural networks."
Supervised Term Weighting Metrics for Sentiment Analysis in Short Text,"Term weighting metrics assign weights to terms in order to discriminate the important terms from the less crucial ones. Due to this characteristic, these metrics have attracted growing attention in text classification and recently in sentiment analysis. Using the weights given by such metrics could lead to more accurate document representation which may improve the performance of the classification. While previous studies have focused on proposing or comparing different weighting metrics at two-classes document level sentiment analysis, this study propose to analyse the results given by each metric in order to find out the characteristics of good and bad weighting metrics. Therefore we present an empirical study of fifteen global supervised weighting metrics with four local weighting metrics adopted from information retrieval, we also give an analysis to understand the behavior of each metric by observing and analysing how each metric distributes the terms and deduce some characteristics which may distinguish the good and bad metrics. The evaluation has been done using Support Vector Machine on three different datasets: Twitter, restaurant and laptop reviews."
A cumulative approach to quantification for sentiment analysis,"We estimate sentiment categories proportions for retrieval within large retrieval sets. In general, estimates are produced by counting the classification outcomes and then by adjusting such category sizes taking into account misclassification error matrix. However, both the accuracy of the classifier and the precision of the retrieval produce a large number of errors that makes difficult the application of an aggregative approach to sentiment analysis as a reliable and efficient estimation of proportions for sentiment categories.  The challenge for real time analytics during retrieval is thus to overcome misclassification errors, and more importantly, to apply sentiment classification or any other similar post-processing analytics at retrieval time. We present a non-aggregative approach that can be applied to very large retrieval sets of queries."
Sentiment Analysis on Bangla and Romanized Bangla Text (BRBT) using Deep Recurrent models,"Sentiment Analysis (SA) is an action research area in the digital age. With rapid and constant growth of online social media sites and services, and the increasing amount of textual data such as - statuses, comments, reviews etc. available in them, application of automatic SA is on the rise. However, most of the research works on SA in natural language processing (NLP) are based on English language. Despite being the sixth most widely spoken language in the world, Bangla still does not have a large and standard dataset. Because of this, recent research works in Bangla have failed to produce results that can be both comparable to works done by others and reusable as stepping stones for future researchers to progress in this field. Therefore, we first tried to provide a textual dataset - that includes not just Bangla, but Romanized Bangla texts as well, is substantial, post-processed and multiple validated, ready to be used in SA experiments. We tested this dataset in Deep Recurrent model, specifically, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), using two types of loss functions - binary crossentropy and categorical crossentropy, and also did some experimental pre-training by using data from one validation to pre-train the other and vice versa. Lastly, we documented the results along with some analysis on them, which were promising."
Connecting Data Science and Qualitative Interview Insights through Sentiment Analysis to Assess Migrants' Emotion States Post-Settlement,"Large-scale survey research by social scientists offers general understandings of migrants' challenges and provides assessments of post-migration benchmarks like employment, obtention of educational credentials, and home ownership. Minimal research, however, probes the realm of emotions or ""feeling states"" in migration and settlement processes, and it is often approached through closed-ended survey questions that superficially assess feeling states. The evaluation of emotions in migration and settlement has been largely left to qualitative researchers using in-depth, interpretive methods like semi-structured interviewing. This approach also has major limitations, namely small sample sizes that capture limited geographic contexts, heavy time burdens analyzing data, and limits to analytic consistency given the nuances of qualitative data coding. Information about migrant emotion states, however, would be valuable to governments and NGOs to enable policy and program development tailored to migrant challenges and frustrations, and would thereby stimulate economic development through thriving migrant populations. In this paper, we present an interdisciplinary pilot project that offers a way through the methodological impasse by subjecting exhaustive qualitative interviews of migrants to sentiment analysis using the Python NLTK toolkit. We propose that data scientists can efficiently and accurately produce large-scale assessments of migrant feeling states through collaboration with social scientists."
Building accurate HAV exploiting User Profiling and Sentiment Analysis,"Social Engineering (SE) is one of the most dangerous aspect an attacker can use against a given entity (private citizen, industry, government, ...). In order to perform SE attacks, it is necessary to collect as much information as possible about the target (or victim(s)). The aim of this paper is to report the details of an activity which took to the development of an automatic tool that extracts, categorizes and summarizes the target interests, thus possible weaknesses with respect to specific topics. Data is collected from the user's activity on social networks, parsed and analyzed using text mining techniques. The main contribution of the proposed tool consists in delivering some reports that allow the citizen, institutions as well as private bodies the screening of their exposure to SE attacks, with a strong awareness potential that will be reflected in a decrease of the risks and a good opportunity to save money."
Select-Additive Learning: Improving Generalization in Multimodal Sentiment Analysis,"Multimodal sentiment analysis is drawing an increasing amount of attention these days. It enables mining of opinions in video reviews which are now available aplenty on online platforms. However, multimodal sentiment analysis has only a few high-quality data sets annotated for training machine learning algorithms. These limited resources restrict the generalizability of models, where, for example, the unique characteristics of a few speakers (e.g., wearing glasses) may become a confounding factor for the sentiment classification task. In this paper, we propose a Select-Additive Learning (SAL) procedure that improves the generalizability of trained neural networks for multimodal sentiment analysis. In our experiments, we show that our SAL approach improves prediction accuracy significantly in all three modalities (verbal, acoustic, visual), as well as in their fusion. Our results show that SAL, even when trained on one dataset, achieves good generalization across two new test datasets."
INSIGHT-1 at SemEval-2016 Task 5: Deep Learning for Multilingual Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis,"This paper describes our deep learning-based approach to multilingual aspect-based sentiment analysis as part of SemEval 2016 Task 5. We use a convolutional neural network (CNN) for both aspect extraction and aspect-based sentiment analysis. We cast aspect extraction as a multi-label classification problem, outputting probabilities over aspects parameterized by a threshold. To determine the sentiment towards an aspect, we concatenate an aspect vector with every word embedding and apply a convolution over it. Our constrained system (unconstrained for English) achieves competitive results across all languages and domains, placing first or second in 5 and 7 out of 11 language-domain pairs for aspect category detection (slot 1) and sentiment polarity (slot 3) respectively, thereby demonstrating the viability of a deep learning-based approach for multilingual aspect-based sentiment analysis."
A Hierarchical Model of Reviews for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis,"Opinion mining from customer reviews has become pervasive in recent years. Sentences in reviews, however, are usually classified independently, even though they form part of a review's argumentative structure. Intuitively, sentences in a review build and elaborate upon each other; knowledge of the review structure and sentential context should thus inform the classification of each sentence. We demonstrate this hypothesis for the task of aspect-based sentiment analysis by modeling the interdependencies of sentences in a review with a hierarchical bidirectional LSTM. We show that the hierarchical model outperforms two non-hierarchical baselines, obtains results competitive with the state-of-the-art, and outperforms the state-of-the-art on five multilingual, multi-domain datasets without any hand-engineered features or external resources."
A Machine Learning Analysis of Twitter Sentiment to the Sandy Hook Shootings,"Gun related violence is a complex issue and accounts for a large proportion of violent incidents. In the research reported in this paper, we set out to investigate the pro-gun and anti-gun sentiments expressed on a social media platform, namely Twitter, in response to the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Connecticut, USA. Machine learning techniques are applied to classify a data corpus of over 700,000 tweets. The sentiments are captured using a public sentiment score that considers the volume of tweets as well as population. A web-based interactive tool is developed to visualise the sentiments and is available at http://www.gunsontwitter.com. The key findings from this research are: (i) There are elevated rates of both pro-gun and anti-gun sentiments on the day of the shooting. Surprisingly, the pro-gun sentiment remains high for a number of days following the event but the anti-gun sentiment quickly falls to pre-event levels. (ii) There is a different public response from each state, with the highest pro-gun sentiment not coming from those with highest gun ownership levels but rather from California, Texas and New York."
Dynamic Allocation of Crowd Contributions for Sentiment Analysis during the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election,"Opinions about the 2016 U.S. Presidential Candidates have been expressed in millions of tweets that are challenging to analyze automatically. Crowdsourcing the analysis of political tweets effectively is also difficult, due to large inter-rater disagreements when sarcasm is involved. Each tweet is typically analyzed by a fixed number of workers and majority voting. We here propose a crowdsourcing framework that instead uses a dynamic allocation of the number of workers. We explore two dynamic-allocation methods: (1) The number of workers queried to label a tweet is computed offline based on the predicted difficulty of discerning the sentiment of a particular tweet. (2) The number of crowd workers is determined online, during an iterative crowd sourcing process, based on inter-rater agreements between labels.We applied our approach to 1,000 twitter messages about the four U.S. presidential candidates Clinton, Cruz, Sanders, and Trump, collected during February 2016. We implemented the two proposed methods using decision trees that allocate more crowd efforts to tweets predicted to be sarcastic. We show that our framework outperforms the traditional static allocation scheme. It collects opinion labels from the crowd at a much lower cost while maintaining labeling accuracy."
"Semantic descriptions of 24 evaluational adjectives, for application in sentiment analysis","We apply the Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM) approach (Goddard and Wierzbicka 2014) to the lexical-semantic analysis of English evaluational adjectives and compare the results with the picture developed in the Appraisal Framework (Martin and White 2005). The analysis is corpus-assisted, with examples mainly drawn from film and book reviews, and supported by collocational and statistical information from WordBanks Online. We propose NSM explications for 24 evaluational adjectives, arguing that they fall into five groups, each of which corresponds to a distinct semantic template. The groups can be sketched as follows: ""First-person thought-plus-affect"", e.g. wonderful; ""Experiential"", e.g. entertaining; ""Experiential with bodily reaction"", e.g. gripping; ""Lasting impact"", e.g. memorable; ""Cognitive evaluation"", e.g. complex, excellent. These groupings and semantic templates are compared with the classifications in the Appraisal Framework's system of Appreciation. In addition, we are particularly interested in sentiment analysis, the automatic identification of evaluation and subjectivity in text. We discuss the relevance of the two frameworks for sentiment analysis and other language technology applications."
A Perspective on Sentiment Analysis,"Sentiment Analysis (SA) is indeed a fascinating area of research which has stolen the attention of researchers as it has many facets and more importantly it promises economic stakes in the corporate and governance sector. SA has been stemmed out of text analytics and established itself as a separate identity and a domain of research. The wide ranging results of SA have proved to influence the way some critical decisions are taken. Hence, it has become relevant in thorough understanding of the different dimensions of the input, output and the processes and approaches of SA."
Re-presenting a Story by Emotional Factors using Sentimental Analysis Method,"Remembering an event is affected by personal emotional status. We examined the psychological status and personal factors; depression (Center for Epidemiological Studies - Depression, Radloff, 1977), present affective (Positive Affective and Negative Affective Schedule, Watson et al., 1988), life orient (Life Orient Test, Scheier & Carver, 1985), self-awareness (Core Self Evaluation Scale, Judge et al., 2003), and social factor (Social Support, Sarason et al., 1983) of undergraduate students (N=64) and got summaries of a story, Chronicle of a Death Foretold (Gabriel Garcia Marquez, 1981) from them. We implement a sentimental analysis model based on convolutional neural network (LeCun & Bengio, 1995) to evaluate each summary. From the same vein used for transfer learning (Pan & Yang, 2010), we collected 38,265 movie review data to train the model and then use them to score summaries of each student. The results of CES-D and PANAS show the relationship between emotion and memory retrieval as follows: depressed people have shown a tendency of representing a story more negatively, and they seemed less expressive. People with full of emotion - high in PANAS - have retrieved their memory more expressively than others, using more negative words then others. The contributions of this study can be summarized as follows: First, lightening the relationship between emotion and its effect during times of storing or retrieving a memory. Second, suggesting objective methods to evaluate the intensity of emotion in natural language format, using a sentimental analysis model."
Stock trend prediction using news sentiment analysis,"Efficient Market Hypothesis is the popular theory about stock prediction. With its failure much research has been carried in the area of prediction of stocks. This project is about taking non quantifiable data such as financial news articles about a company and predicting its future stock trend with news sentiment classification. Assuming that news articles have impact on stock market, this is an attempt to study relationship between news and stock trend. To show this, we created three different classification models which depict polarity of news articles being positive or negative. Observations show that RF and SVM perform well in all types of testing. Naïve Bayes gives good result but not compared to the other two. Experiments are conducted to evaluate various aspects of the proposed model and encouraging results are obtained in all of the experiments. The accuracy of the prediction model is more than 80% and in comparison with news random labeling with 50% of accuracy; the model has increased the accuracy by 30%."
MOSI: Multimodal Corpus of Sentiment Intensity and Subjectivity Analysis in Online Opinion Videos,"People are sharing their opinions, stories and reviews through online video sharing websites every day. Studying sentiment and subjectivity in these opinion videos is experiencing a growing attention from academia and industry. While sentiment analysis has been successful for text, it is an understudied research question for videos and multimedia content. The biggest setbacks for studies in this direction are lack of a proper dataset, methodology, baselines and statistical analysis of how information from different modality sources relate to each other. This paper introduces to the scientific community the first opinion-level annotated corpus of sentiment and subjectivity analysis in online videos called Multimodal Opinion-level Sentiment Intensity dataset (MOSI). The dataset is rigorously annotated with labels for subjectivity, sentiment intensity, per-frame and per-opinion annotated visual features, and per-milliseconds annotated audio features. Furthermore, we present baselines for future studies in this direction as well as a new multimodal fusion approach that jointly models spoken words and visual gestures."
A Piece of My Mind: A Sentiment Analysis Approach for Online Dispute Detection,We investigate the novel task of online dispute detection and propose a sentiment analysis solution to the problem: we aim to identify the sequence of sentence-level sentiments expressed during a discussion and to use them as features in a classifier that predicts the DISPUTE/NON-DISPUTE label for the discussion as a whole. We evaluate dispute detection approaches on a newly created corpus of Wikipedia Talk page disputes and find that classifiers that rely on our sentiment tagging features outperform those that do not. The best model achieves a very promising F1 score of 0.78 and an accuracy of 0.80.
"Universal, Unsupervised (Rule-Based), Uncovered Sentiment Analysis","We present a novel unsupervised approach for multilingual sentiment analysis driven by compositional syntax-based rules. On the one hand, we exploit some of the main advantages of unsupervised algorithms: (1) the interpretability of their output, in contrast with most supervised models, which behave as a black box and (2) their robustness across different corpora and domains. On the other hand, by introducing the concept of compositional operations and exploiting syntactic information in the form of universal dependencies, we tackle one of their main drawbacks: their rigidity on data that are structured differently depending on the language concerned. Experiments show an improvement both over existing unsupervised methods, and over state-of-the-art supervised models when evaluating outside their corpus of origin. Experiments also show how the same compositional operations can be shared across languages. The system is available at http://www.grupolys.org/software/UUUSA/"
Sentiment-enhanced Multidimensional Analysis of Online Social Networks: Perception of the Mediterranean Refugees Crisis,"We propose an analytical framework able to investigate discussions about polarized topics in online social networks from many different angles. The framework supports the analysis of social networks along several dimensions: time, space and sentiment. We show that the proposed analytical framework and the methodology can be used to mine knowledge about the perception of complex social phenomena. We selected the refugee crisis discussions over Twitter as the case study. This difficult and controversial topic is an increasingly important issue for the EU. The raw stream of tweets is enriched with space information (user and mentioned locations), and sentiment (positive vs. negative) w.r.t. refugees. Our study shows differences in positive and negative sentiment in EU countries, in particular in UK, and by matching events, locations and perception it underlines opinion dynamics and common prejudices regarding the refugees."
"Fusing Audio, Textual and Visual Features for Sentiment Analysis of News Videos","This paper presents a novel approach to perform sentiment analysis of news videos, based on the fusion of audio, textual and visual clues extracted from their contents. The proposed approach aims at contributing to the semiodiscoursive study regarding the construction of the ethos (identity) of this media universe, which has become a central part of the modern-day lives of millions of people. To achieve this goal, we apply state-of-the-art computational methods for (1) automatic emotion recognition from facial expressions, (2) extraction of modulations in the participants' speeches and (3) sentiment analysis from the closed caption associated to the videos of interest. More specifically, we compute features, such as, visual intensities of recognized emotions, field sizes of participants, voicing probability, sound loudness, speech fundamental frequencies and the sentiment scores (polarities) from text sentences in the closed caption. Experimental results with a dataset containing 520 annotated news videos from three Brazilian and one American popular TV newscasts show that our approach achieves an accuracy of up to 84% in the sentiments (tension levels) classification task, thus demonstrating its high potential to be used by media analysts in several applications, especially, in the journalistic domain."
Recursive Neural Conditional Random Fields for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis,"In aspect-based sentiment analysis, extracting aspect terms along with the opinions being expressed from user-generated content is one of the most important subtasks. Previous studies have shown that exploiting connections between aspect and opinion terms is promising for this task. In this paper, we propose a novel joint model that integrates recursive neural networks and conditional random fields into a unified framework for explicit aspect and opinion terms co-extraction. The proposed model learns high-level discriminative features and double propagate information between aspect and opinion terms, simultaneously. Moreover, it is flexible to incorporate hand-crafted features into the proposed model to further boost its information extraction performance. Experimental results on the SemEval Challenge 2014 dataset show the superiority of our proposed model over several baseline methods as well as the winning systems of the challenge."
Sentiment Analysis in Scholarly Book Reviews,"So far different studies have tackled the sentiment analysis in several domains such as restaurant and movie reviews. But, this problem has not been studied in scholarly book reviews which is different in terms of review style and size. In this paper, we propose to combine different features in order to be presented to a supervised classifiers which extract the opinion target expressions and detect their polarities in scholarly book reviews. We construct a labeled corpus for training and evaluating our methods in French book reviews. We also evaluate them on English restaurant reviews in order to measure their robustness across the domains and languages. The evaluation shows that our methods are enough robust for English restaurant reviews and French book reviews."
Sentiment Analysis of Twitter Data: A Survey of Techniques,"With the advancement of web technology and its growth, there is a huge volume of data present in the web for internet users and a lot of data is generated too. Internet has become a platform for online learning, exchanging ideas and sharing opinions. Social networking sites like Twitter, Facebook, Google+ are rapidly gaining popularity as they allow people to share and express their views about topics,have discussion with different communities, or post messages across the world. There has been lot of work in the field of sentiment analysis of twitter data. This survey focuses mainly on sentiment analysis of twitter data which is helpful to analyze the information in the tweets where opinions are highly unstructured, heterogeneous and are either positive or negative, or neutral in some cases. In this paper, we provide a survey and a comparative analyses of existing techniques for opinion mining like machine learning and lexicon-based approaches, together with evaluation metrics. Using various machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes, Max Entropy, and Support Vector Machine, we provide a research on twitter data streams.General challenges and applications of Sentiment Analysis on Twitter are also discussed in this paper."
Sentiment/Subjectivity Analysis Survey for Languages other than English,Subjective and sentiment analysis have gained considerable attention recently. Most of the resources and systems built so far are done for English. The need for designing systems for other languages is increasing. This paper surveys different ways used for building systems for subjective and sentiment analysis for languages other than English. There are three different types of systems used for building these systems. The first (and the best) one is the language specific systems. The second type of systems involves reusing or transferring sentiment resources from English to the target language. The third type of methods is based on using language independent methods. The paper presents a separate section devoted to Arabic sentiment analysis.
Semisupervised Autoencoder for Sentiment Analysis,"In this paper, we investigate the usage of autoencoders in modeling textual data. Traditional autoencoders suffer from at least two aspects: scalability with the high dimensionality of vocabulary size and dealing with task-irrelevant words. We address this problem by introducing supervision via the loss function of autoencoders. In particular, we first train a linear classifier on the labeled data, then define a loss for the autoencoder with the weights learned from the linear classifier. To reduce the bias brought by one single classifier, we define a posterior probability distribution on the weights of the classifier, and derive the marginalized loss of the autoencoder with Laplace approximation. We show that our choice of loss function can be rationalized from the perspective of Bregman Divergence, which justifies the soundness of our model. We evaluate the effectiveness of our model on six sentiment analysis datasets, and show that our model significantly outperforms all the competing methods with respect to classification accuracy. We also show that our model is able to take advantage of unlabeled dataset and get improved performance. We further show that our model successfully learns highly discriminative feature maps, which explains its superior performance."
SentiBench - a benchmark comparison of state-of-the-practice sentiment analysis methods,"In the last few years thousands of scientific papers have investigated sentiment analysis, several startups that measure opinions on real data have emerged and a number of innovative products related to this theme have been developed. There are multiple methods for measuring sentiments, including lexical-based and supervised machine learning methods. Despite the vast interest on the theme and wide popularity of some methods, it is unclear which one is better for identifying the polarity (i.e., positive or negative) of a message. Accordingly, there is a strong need to conduct a thorough apple-to-apple comparison of sentiment analysis methods, \textit{as they are used in practice}, across multiple datasets originated from different data sources. Such a comparison is key for understanding the potential limitations, advantages, and disadvantages of popular methods. This article aims at filling this gap by presenting a benchmark comparison of twenty-four popular sentiment analysis methods (which we call the state-of-the-practice methods). Our evaluation is based on a benchmark of eighteen labeled datasets, covering messages posted on social networks, movie and product reviews, as well as opinions and comments in news articles. Our results highlight the extent to which the prediction performance of these methods varies considerably across datasets. Aiming at boosting the development of this research area, we open the methods' codes and datasets used in this article, deploying them in a benchmark system, which provides an open API for accessing and comparing sentence-level sentiment analysis methods."
"Social networks, happiness and health: from sentiment analysis to a multidimensional indicator of subjective well-being","This paper applies a novel technique of opinion analysis over social media data with the aim of proposing a new indicator of perceived and subjective well-being. This new index, namely SWBI, examines several dimension of individual and social life. The indicator has been compared to some other existing indexes of well-being and health conditions in Italy: the BES (Benessere Equo Sostenibile), the incidence rate of influenza and the abundance of PM10 in urban environments. SWBI is a daily measure available at province level. BES data, currently available only for 2013 and 2014, are annual and available at regional level. Flu data are weekly and distributed as regional data and PM10 are collected daily for different cities. Due to the fact that the time scale and space granularity of the different indexes varies, we apply a novel statistical technique to discover nowcasting features and the classical latent analysis to study the relationships among them. A preliminary analysis suggest that the environmental and health conditions anticipate several dimensions of the perception of well-being as measured by SWBI. Moreover, the set of indicators included in the BES represent a latent dimension of well-being which shares similarities with the latent dimension represented by SWBI."
Approaches for Sentiment Analysis on Twitter: A State-of-Art study,"Microbloging is an extremely prevalent broadcast medium amidst the Internet fraternity these days. People share their opinions and sentiments about variety of subjects like products, news, institutions, etc., every day on microbloging websites. Sentiment analysis plays a key role in prediction systems, opinion mining systems, etc. Twitter, one of the microbloging platforms allows a limit of 140 characters to its users. This restriction stimulates users to be very concise about their opinion and twitter an ocean of sentiments to analyze. Twitter also provides developer friendly streaming API for data retrieval purpose allowing the analyst to search real time tweets from various users. In this paper, we discuss the state-of-art of the works which are focused on Twitter, the online social network platform, for sentiment analysis. We survey various lexical, machine learning and hybrid approaches for sentiment analysis on Twitter."
Benchmarking sentiment analysis methods for large-scale texts: A case for using continuum-scored words and word shift graphs,"The emergence and global adoption of social media has rendered possible the real-time estimation of population-scale sentiment, bearing profound implications for our understanding of human behavior. Given the growing assortment of sentiment measuring instruments, comparisons between them are evidently required. Here, we perform detailed tests of 6 dictionary-based methods applied to 4 different corpora, and briefly examine a further 20 methods. We show that a dictionary-based method will only perform both reliably and meaningfully if (1) the dictionary covers a sufficiently large enough portion of a given text's lexicon when weighted by word usage frequency; and (2) words are scored on a continuous scale."
Sentiment Analysis on YouTube: A Brief Survey,"Sentiment analysis or opinion mining is the field of study related to analyze opinions, sentiments, evaluations, attitudes, and emotions of users which they express on social media and other online resources. The revolution of social media sites has also attracted the users towards video sharing sites, such as YouTube. The online users express their opinions or sentiments on the videos that they watch on such sites. This paper presents a brief survey of techniques to analyze opinions posted by users about a particular video."
Overcoming Language Variation in Sentiment Analysis with Social Attention,"Variation in language is ubiquitous, particularly in newer forms of writing such as social media. Fortunately, variation is not random, it is often linked to social properties of the author. In this paper, we show how to exploit social networks to make sentiment analysis more robust to social language variation. The key idea is linguistic homophily: the tendency of socially linked individuals to use language in similar ways. We formalize this idea in a novel attention-based neural network architecture, in which attention is divided among several basis models, depending on the author's position in the social network. This has the effect of smoothing the classification function across the social network, and makes it possible to induce personalized classifiers even for authors for whom there is no labeled data or demographic metadata. This model significantly improves the accuracies of sentiment analysis on Twitter and on review data."
SentiWords: Deriving a High Precision and High Coverage Lexicon for Sentiment Analysis,"Deriving prior polarity lexica for sentiment analysis - where positive or negative scores are associated with words out of context - is a challenging task. Usually, a trade-off between precision and coverage is hard to find, and it depends on the methodology used to build the lexicon. Manually annotated lexica provide a high precision but lack in coverage, whereas automatic derivation from pre-existing knowledge guarantees high coverage at the cost of a lower precision. Since the automatic derivation of prior polarities is less time consuming than manual annotation, there has been a great bloom of these approaches, in particular based on the SentiWordNet resource. In this paper, we compare the most frequently used techniques based on SentiWordNet with newer ones and blend them in a learning framework (a so called 'ensemble method'). By taking advantage of manually built prior polarity lexica, our ensemble method is better able to predict the prior value of unseen words and to outperform all the other SentiWordNet approaches. Using this technique we have built SentiWords, a prior polarity lexicon of approximately 155,000 words, that has both a high precision and a high coverage. We finally show that in sentiment analysis tasks, using our lexicon allows us to outperform both the single metrics derived from SentiWordNet and popular manually annotated sentiment lexica."
Social Media Analysis for Product Safety using Text Mining and Sentiment Analysis,"The growing incidents of counterfeiting and associated economic and health consequences necessitate the development of active surveillance systems capable of producing timely and reliable information for all stake holders in the anti-counterfeiting fight. User generated content from social media platforms can provide early clues about product allergies, adverse events and product counterfeiting. This paper reports a work in progresswith contributions including: the development of a framework for gathering and analyzing the views and experiences of users of drug and cosmetic products using machine learning, text mining and sentiment analysis, the application of the proposed framework on Facebook comments and data from Twitter for brand analysis, and the description of how to develop a product safety lexicon and training data for modeling a machine learning classifier for drug and cosmetic product sentiment prediction. The initial brand and product comparison results signify the usefulness of text mining and sentiment analysis on social media data while the use of machine learning classifier for predicting the sentiment orientation provides a useful tool for users, product manufacturers, regulatory and enforcement agencies to monitor brand or product sentiment trends in order to act in the event of sudden or significant rise in negative sentiment."
Sentiment Uncertainty and Spam in Twitter Streams and Its Implications for General Purpose Realtime Sentiment Analysis,"State of the art benchmarks for Twitter Sentiment Analysis do not consider the fact that for more than half of the tweets from the public stream a distinct sentiment cannot be chosen. This paper provides a new perspective on Twitter Sentiment Analysis by highlighting the necessity of explicitly incorporating uncertainty. Moreover, a dataset of high quality to evaluate solutions for this new problem is introduced and made publicly available."
Robust Image Sentiment Analysis Using Progressively Trained and Domain Transferred Deep Networks,"Sentiment analysis of online user generated content is important for many social media analytics tasks. Researchers have largely relied on textual sentiment analysis to develop systems to predict political elections, measure economic indicators, and so on. Recently, social media users are increasingly using images and videos to express their opinions and share their experiences. Sentiment analysis of such large scale visual content can help better extract user sentiments toward events or topics, such as those in image tweets, so that prediction of sentiment from visual content is complementary to textual sentiment analysis. Motivated by the needs in leveraging large scale yet noisy training data to solve the extremely challenging problem of image sentiment analysis, we employ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). We first design a suitable CNN architecture for image sentiment analysis. We obtain half a million training samples by using a baseline sentiment algorithm to label Flickr images. To make use of such noisy machine labeled data, we employ a progressive strategy to fine-tune the deep network. Furthermore, we improve the performance on Twitter images by inducing domain transfer with a small number of manually labeled Twitter images. We have conducted extensive experiments on manually labeled Twitter images. The results show that the proposed CNN can achieve better performance in image sentiment analysis than competing algorithms."
Twitter Sentiment Analysis,"This project addresses the problem of sentiment analysis in twitter; that is classifying tweets according to the sentiment expressed in them: positive, negative or neutral. Twitter is an online micro-blogging and social-networking platform which allows users to write short status updates of maximum length 140 characters. It is a rapidly expanding service with over 200 million registered users - out of which 100 million are active users and half of them log on twitter on a daily basis - generating nearly 250 million tweets per day. Due to this large amount of usage we hope to achieve a reflection of public sentiment by analysing the sentiments expressed in the tweets. Analysing the public sentiment is important for many applications such as firms trying to find out the response of their products in the market, predicting political elections and predicting socioeconomic phenomena like stock exchange. The aim of this project is to develop a functional classifier for accurate and automatic sentiment classification of an unknown tweet stream."
Better Document-level Sentiment Analysis from RST Discourse Parsing,"Discourse structure is the hidden link between surface features and document-level properties, such as sentiment polarity. We show that the discourse analyses produced by Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) parsers can improve document-level sentiment analysis, via composition of local information up the discourse tree. First, we show that reweighting discourse units according to their position in a dependency representation of the rhetorical structure can yield substantial improvements on lexicon-based sentiment analysis. Next, we present a recursive neural network over the RST structure, which offers significant improvements over classification-based methods."
Simple Text Mining for Sentiment Analysis of Political Figure Using Naive Bayes Classifier Method,Text mining can be applied to many fields. One of the application is using text mining in digital newspaper to do politic sentiment analysis. In this paper sentiment analysis is applied to get information from digital news articles about its positive or negative sentiment regarding particular politician. This paper suggests a simple model to analyze digital newspaper sentiment polarity using naive Bayes classifier method. The model uses a set of initial data to begin with which will be updated when new information appears. The model showed promising result when tested and can be implemented to some other sentiment analysis problems.
Adapting sentiment analysis for tweets linking to scientific papers,"In the context of altmetrics, tweets have been discussed as potential indicators of immediate and broader societal impact of scientific documents. However, it is not yet clear to what extent Twitter captures actual research impact. A small case study (Thelwall et al., 2013b) suggests that tweets to journal articles neither comment on nor express any sentiments towards the publication, which suggests that tweets merely disseminate bibliographic information, often even automatically. This study analyses the sentiments of tweets for a large representative set of scientific papers by specifically adapting different methods to academic articles distributed on Twitter. Results will help to improve the understanding of Twitter's role in scholarly communication and the meaning of tweets as impact metrics."
Reflections on Sentiment/Opinion Analysis,"In this paper, we described possible directions for deeper understanding, helping bridge the gap between psychology / cognitive science and computational approaches in sentiment/opinion analysis literature. We focus on the opinion holder's underlying needs and their resultant goals, which, in a utilitarian model of sentiment, provides the basis for explaining the reason a sentiment valence is held. While these thoughts are still immature, scattered, unstructured, and even imaginary, we believe that these perspectives might suggest fruitful avenues for various kinds of future work."
"Twitter Sentiment Analysis: Lexicon Method, Machine Learning Method and Their Combination","This paper covers the two approaches for sentiment analysis: i) lexicon based method; ii) machine learning method. We describe several techniques to implement these approaches and discuss how they can be adopted for sentiment classification of Twitter messages. We present a comparative study of different lexicon combinations and show that enhancing sentiment lexicons with emoticons, abbreviations and social-media slang expressions increases the accuracy of lexicon-based classification for Twitter. We discuss the importance of feature generation and feature selection processes for machine learning sentiment classification. To quantify the performance of the main sentiment analysis methods over Twitter we run these algorithms on a benchmark Twitter dataset from the SemEval-2013 competition, task 2-B. The results show that machine learning method based on SVM and Naive Bayes classifiers outperforms the lexicon method. We present a new ensemble method that uses a lexicon based sentiment score as input feature for the machine learning approach. The combined method proved to produce more precise classifications. We also show that employing a cost-sensitive classifier for highly unbalanced datasets yields an improvement of sentiment classification performance up to 7%."
Twitter Sentiment Analysis Applied to Finance: A Case Study in the Retail Industry,"This paper presents a financial analysis over Twitter sentiment analytics extracted from listed retail brands. We investigate whether there is statistically-significant information between the Twitter sentiment and volume, and stock returns and volatility. Traditional newswires are also considered as a proxy for the market sentiment for comparative purpose. The results suggest that social media is indeed a valuable source in the analysis of the financial dynamics in the retail sector even when compared to mainstream news such as the Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones Newswires."
Idioms-Proverbs Lexicon for Modern Standard Arabic and Colloquial Sentiment Analysis,"Although, the fair amount of works in sentiment analysis (SA) and opinion mining (OM) systems in the last decade and with respect to the performance of these systems, but it still not desired performance, especially for morphologically-Rich Language (MRL) such as Arabic, due to the complexities and challenges exist in the nature of the languages itself. One of these challenges is the detection of idioms or proverbs phrases within the writer text or comment. An idiom or proverb is a form of speech or an expression that is peculiar to itself. Grammatically, it cannot be understood from the individual meanings of its elements and can yield different sentiment when treats as separate words. Consequently, In order to facilitate the task of detection and classification of lexical phrases for automated SA systems, this paper presents AIPSeLEX a novel idioms/ proverbs sentiment lexicon for modern standard Arabic (MSA) and colloquial. AIPSeLEX is manually collected and annotated at sentence level with semantic orientation (positive or negative). The efforts of manually building and annotating the lexicon are reported. Moreover, we build a classifier that extracts idioms and proverbs, phrases from text using n-gram and similarity measure methods. Finally, several experiments were carried out on various data, including Arabic tweets and Arabic microblogs (hotel reservation, product reviews, and TV program comments) from publicly available Arabic online reviews websites (social media, blogs, forums, e-commerce web sites) to evaluate the coverage and accuracy of AIPSeLEX."
Video (GIF) Sentiment Analysis using Large-Scale Mid-Level Ontology,"With faster connection speed, Internet users are now making social network a huge reservoir of texts, images and video clips (GIF). Sentiment analysis for such online platform can be used to predict political elections, evaluates economic indicators and so on. However, GIF sentiment analysis is quite challenging, not only because it hinges on spatio-temporal visual contentabstraction, but also for the relationship between such abstraction and final sentiment remains unknown.In this paper, we dedicated to find out such relationship.We proposed a SentiPairSequence basedspatiotemporal visual sentiment ontology, which forms the midlevel representations for GIFsentiment. The establishment process of SentiPair contains two steps. First, we construct the Synset Forest to define the semantic tree structure of visual sentiment label elements. Then, through theSynset Forest, we organically select and combine sentiment label elements to form a mid-level visual sentiment representation. Our experiments indicate that SentiPair outperforms other competing mid-level attributes. Using SentiPair, our analysis frameworkcan achieve satisfying prediction accuracy (72.6%). We also opened ourdataset (GSO-2015) to the research community. GSO-2015 contains more than 6,000 manually annotated GIFs out of more than 40,000 candidates. Each is labeled with both sentiment and SentiPair Sequence."
Sentiment Analysis For Modern Standard Arabic And Colloquial,"The rise of social media such as blogs and social networks has fueled interest in sentiment analysis. With the proliferation of reviews, ratings, recommendations and other forms of online expression, online opinion has turned into a kind of virtual currency for businesses looking to market their products, identify new opportunities and manage their reputations, therefore many are now looking to the field of sentiment analysis. In this paper, we present a feature-based sentence level approach for Arabic sentiment analysis. Our approach is using Arabic idioms/saying phrases lexicon as a key importance for improving the detection of the sentiment polarity in Arabic sentences as well as a number of novels and rich set of linguistically motivated features contextual Intensifiers, contextual Shifter and negation handling), syntactic features for conflicting phrases which enhance the sentiment classification accuracy. Furthermore, we introduce an automatic expandable wide coverage polarity lexicon of Arabic sentiment words. The lexicon is built with gold-standard sentiment words as a seed which is manually collected and annotated and it expands and detects the sentiment orientation automatically of new sentiment words using synset aggregation technique and free online Arabic lexicons and thesauruses. Our data focus on modern standard Arabic (MSA) and Egyptian dialectal Arabic tweets and microblogs (hotel reservation, product reviews, etc.). The experimental results using our resources and techniques with SVM classifier indicate high performance levels, with accuracies of over 95%."
Indonesian Social Media Sentiment Analysis With Sarcasm Detection,"Sarcasm is considered one of the most difficult problem in sentiment analysis. In our ob-servation on Indonesian social media, for cer-tain topics, people tend to criticize something using sarcasm. Here, we proposed two additional features to detect sarcasm after a common sentiment analysis is conducted. The features are the negativity information and the number of interjection words. We also employed translated SentiWordNet in the sentiment classification. All the classifications were conducted with machine learning algorithms. The experimental results showed that the additional features are quite effective in the sarcasm detection."
Comparing methods for Twitter Sentiment Analysis,"This work extends the set of works which deal with the popular problem of sentiment analysis in Twitter. It investigates the most popular document (""tweet"") representation methods which feed sentiment evaluation mechanisms. In particular, we study the bag-of-words, n-grams and n-gram graphs approaches and for each of them we evaluate the performance of a lexicon-based and 7 learning-based classification algorithms (namely SVM, Naïve Bayesian Networks, Logistic Regression, Multilayer Perceptrons, Best-First Trees, Functional Trees and C4.5) as well as their combinations, using a set of 4451 manually annotated tweets. The results demonstrate the superiority of learning-based methods and in particular of n-gram graphs approaches for predicting the sentiment of tweets. They also show that the combinatory approach has impressive effects on n-grams, raising the confidence up to 83.15% on the 5-Grams, using majority vote and a balanced dataset (equal number of positive, negative and neutral tweets for training). In the n-gram graph cases the improvement was small to none, reaching 94.52% on the 4-gram graphs, using Orthodromic distance and a threshold of 0.001."
Ensemble of Generative and Discriminative Techniques for Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews,"Sentiment analysis is a common task in natural language processing that aims to detect polarity of a text document (typically a consumer review). In the simplest settings, we discriminate only between positive and negative sentiment, turning the task into a standard binary classification problem. We compare several ma- chine learning approaches to this problem, and combine them to achieve the best possible results. We show how to use for this task the standard generative lan- guage models, which are slightly complementary to the state of the art techniques. We achieve strong results on a well-known dataset of IMDB movie reviews. Our results are easily reproducible, as we publish also the code needed to repeat the experiments. This should simplify further advance of the state of the art, as other researchers can combine their techniques with ours with little effort."
LABR: A Large Scale Arabic Sentiment Analysis Benchmark,"We introduce LABR, the largest sentiment analysis dataset to-date for the Arabic language. It consists of over 63,000 book reviews, each rated on a scale of 1 to 5 stars. We investigate the properties of the dataset, and present its statistics. We explore using the dataset for two tasks: (1) sentiment polarity classification; and (2) ratings classification. Moreover, we provide standard splits of the dataset into training, validation and testing, for both polarity and ratings classification, in both balanced and unbalanced settings. We extend our previous work by performing a comprehensive analysis on the dataset. In particular, we perform an extended survey of the different classifiers typically used for the sentiment polarity classification problem. We also construct a sentiment lexicon from the dataset that contains both single and compound sentiment words and we explore its effectiveness. We make the dataset and experimental details publicly available."
Sentiment Analysis based on User Tag for Traditional Chinese Medicine in Weibo,"With the acceptance of Western culture and science, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has become a controversial issue in China. So, it's important to study the public's sentiment and opinion on TCM. The rapid development of online social network, such as twitter, make it convenient and efficient to sample hundreds of millions of people for the aforementioned sentiment study. To the best of our knowledge, the present work is the first attempt that applies sentiment analysis to the domain of TCM on Sina Weibo (a twitter-like microblogging service in China). In our work, firstly we collect tweets topic about TCM from Sina Weibo, and label the tweets as supporting TCM and opposing TCM automatically based on user tag. Then, a support vector machine classifier has been built to predict the sentiment of TCM tweets without labels. Finally, we present a method to adjust the classifier result. The performance of F-measure attained with our method is 97%."
"A Scalable, Lexicon Based Technique for Sentiment Analysis","Rapid increase in the volume of sentiment rich social media on the web has resulted in an increased interest among researchers regarding Sentimental Analysis and opinion mining. However, with so much social media available on the web, sentiment analysis is now considered as a big data task. Hence the conventional sentiment analysis approaches fails to efficiently handle the vast amount of sentiment data available now a days. The main focus of the research was to find such a technique that can efficiently perform sentiment analysis on big data sets. A technique that can categorize the text as positive, negative and neutral in a fast and accurate manner. In the research, sentiment analysis was performed on a large data set of tweets using Hadoop and the performance of the technique was measured in form of speed and accuracy. The experimental results shows that the technique exhibits very good efficiency in handling big sentiment data sets."
Exploiting Social Network Structure for Person-to-Person Sentiment Analysis,"Person-to-person evaluations are prevalent in all kinds of discourse and important for establishing reputations, building social bonds, and shaping public opinion. Such evaluations can be analyzed separately using signed social networks and textual sentiment analysis, but this misses the rich interactions between language and social context. To capture such interactions, we develop a model that predicts individual A's opinion of individual B by synthesizing information from the signed social network in which A and B are embedded with sentiment analysis of the evaluative texts relating A to B. We prove that this problem is NP-hard but can be relaxed to an efficiently solvable hinge-loss Markov random field, and we show that this implementation outperforms text-only and network-only versions in two very different datasets involving community-level decision-making: the Wikipedia Requests for Adminship corpus and the Convote U.S. Congressional speech corpus."
A Clustering Analysis of Tweet Length and its Relation to Sentiment,"Sentiment analysis of Twitter data is performed. The researcher has made the following contributions via this paper: (1) an innovative method for deriving sentiment score dictionaries using an existing sentiment dictionary as seed words is explored, and (2) an analysis of clustered tweet sentiment scores based on tweet length is performed."
Two-dimensional Sentiment Analysis of text,"Sentiment Analysis aims to get the underlying viewpoint of the text, which could be anything that holds a subjective opinion, such as an online review, Movie rating, Comments on Blog posts etc. This paper presents a novel approach that classify text in two-dimensional Emotional space, based on the sentiments of the author. The approach uses existing lexical resources to extract feature set, which is trained using Supervised Learning techniques."
Comparing and Combining Sentiment Analysis Methods,"Several messages express opinions about events, products, and services, political views or even their author's emotional state and mood. Sentiment analysis has been used in several applications including analysis of the repercussions of events in social networks, analysis of opinions about products and services, and simply to better understand aspects of social communication in Online Social Networks (OSNs). There are multiple methods for measuring sentiments, including lexical-based approaches and supervised machine learning methods. Despite the wide use and popularity of some methods, it is unclear which method is better for identifying the polarity (i.e., positive or negative) of a message as the current literature does not provide a method of comparison among existing methods. Such a comparison is crucial for understanding the potential limitations, advantages, and disadvantages of popular methods in analyzing the content of OSNs messages. Our study aims at filling this gap by presenting comparisons of eight popular sentiment analysis methods in terms of coverage (i.e., the fraction of messages whose sentiment is identified) and agreement (i.e., the fraction of identified sentiments that are in tune with ground truth). We develop a new method that combines existing approaches, providing the best coverage results and competitive agreement. We also present a free Web service called iFeel, which provides an open API for accessing and comparing results across different sentiment methods for a given text."
Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis to Extract Meticulous Opinion Value,"Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis is a process of identifying opinions in large unstructured/structured data and then analysing polarity of those opinions. Opinion mining and sentiment analysis have found vast application in analysing online ratings, analysing product based reviews, e-governance, and managing hostile content over the internet. This paper proposes an algorithm to implement aspect level sentiment analysis. The algorithm takes input from the remarks submitted by various teachers of a student. An aspect tree is formed which has various levels and weights are assigned to each branch to identify level of aspect. Aspect value is calculated by the algorithm by means of the proposed aspect tree. Dictionary based method is implemented to evaluate the polarity of the remark. The algorithm returns the aspect value clubbed with opinion value and sentiment value which helps in concluding the summarized value of remark."
Credibility Adjusted Term Frequency: A Supervised Term Weighting Scheme for Sentiment Analysis and Text Classification,We provide a simple but novel supervised weighting scheme for adjusting term frequency in tf-idf for sentiment analysis and text classification. We compare our method to baseline weighting schemes and find that it outperforms them on multiple benchmarks. The method is robust and works well on both snippets and longer documents.
Sentiment Analysis: A Survey,"Sentiment analysis (also known as opinion mining) refers to the use of natural language processing, text analysis and computational linguistics to identify and extract subjective information in source materials. Mining opinions expressed in the user generated content is a challenging yet practically very useful problem. This survey would cover various approaches and methodology used in Sentiment Analysis and Opinion Mining in general. The focus would be on Internet text like, Product review, tweets and other social media."
Sentiment Analysis by Using Fuzzy Logic,"How could a product or service is reasonably evaluated by anyone in the shortest time? A million dollar question but it is having a simple answer: Sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis is consumers review on products and services which helps both the producers and consumers (stakeholders) to take effective and efficient decision within a shortest period of time. Producers can have better knowledge of their products and services through the sentiment analysis (ex. positive and negative comments or consumers likes and dislikes) which will help them to know their products status (ex. product limitations or market status). Consumers can have better knowledge of their interested products and services through the sentiment analysis (ex. positive and negative comments or consumers likes and dislikes) which will help them to know their deserving products status (ex. product limitations or market status). For more specification of the sentiment values, fuzzy logic could be introduced. Therefore, sentiment analysis with the help of fuzzy logic (deals with reasoning and gives closer views to the exact sentiment values) will help the producers or consumers or any interested person for taking the effective decision according to their product or service interest."
Tripartite Graph Clustering for Dynamic Sentiment Analysis on Social Media,"The growing popularity of social media (e.g, Twitter) allows users to easily share information with each other and influence others by expressing their own sentiments on various subjects. In this work, we propose an unsupervised \emph{tri-clustering} framework, which analyzes both user-level and tweet-level sentiments through co-clustering of a tripartite graph. A compelling feature of the proposed framework is that the quality of sentiment clustering of tweets, users, and features can be mutually improved by joint clustering. We further investigate the evolution of user-level sentiments and latent feature vectors in an online framework and devise an efficient online algorithm to sequentially update the clustering of tweets, users and features with newly arrived data. The online framework not only provides better quality of both dynamic user-level and tweet-level sentiment analysis, but also improves the computational and storage efficiency. We verified the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approaches on the November 2012 California ballot Twitter data."
Optimization Of Cross Domain Sentiment Analysis Using Sentiwordnet,"The task of sentiment analysis of reviews is carried out using manually built / automatically generated lexicon resources of their own with which terms are matched with lexicon to compute the term count for positive and negative polarity. On the other hand the Sentiwordnet, which is quite different from other lexicon resources that gives scores (weights) of the positive and negative polarity for each word. The polarity of a word namely positive, negative and neutral have the score ranging between 0 to 1 indicates the strength/weight of the word with that sentiment orientation. In this paper, we show that using the Sentiwordnet, how we could enhance the performance of the classification at both sentence and document level."
Sentiment Analysis Using Collaborated Opinion Mining,"Opinion mining and Sentiment analysis have emerged as a field of study since the widespread of World Wide Web and internet. Opinion refers to extraction of those lines or phrase in the raw and huge data which express an opinion. Sentiment analysis on the other hand identifies the polarity of the opinion being extracted. In this paper we propose the sentiment analysis in collaboration with opinion extraction, summarization, and tracking the records of the students. The paper modifies the existing algorithm in order to obtain the collaborated opinion about the students. The resultant opinion is represented as very high, high, moderate, low and very low. The paper is based on a case study where teachers give their remarks about the students and by applying the proposed sentiment analysis algorithm the opinion is extracted and represented."
Topic and Sentiment Analysis on OSNs: a Case Study of Advertising Strategies on Twitter,"Social media have substantially altered the way brands and businesses advertise: Online Social Networks provide brands with more versatile and dynamic channels for advertisement than traditional media (e.g., TV and radio). Levels of engagement in such media are usually measured in terms of content adoption (e.g., likes and retweets) and sentiment, around a given topic. However, sentiment analysis and topic identification are both non-trivial tasks.  In this paper, using data collected from Twitter as a case study, we analyze how engagement and sentiment in promoted content spread over a 10-day period. We find that promoted tweets lead to higher positive sentiment than promoted trends; although promoted trends pay off in response volume. We observe that levels of engagement for the brand and promoted content are highest on the first day of the campaign, and fall considerably thereafter. However, we show that these insights depend on the use of robust machine learning and natural language processing techniques to gather focused, relevant datasets, and to accurately gauge sentiment, rather than relying on the simple keyword- or frequency-based metrics sometimes used in social media research."
Sentiment Analysis in the News,"Recent years have brought a significant growth in the volume of research in sentiment analysis, mostly on highly subjective text types (movie or product reviews). The main difference these texts have with news articles is that their target is clearly defined and unique across the text. Following different annotation efforts and the analysis of the issues encountered, we realised that news opinion mining is different from that of other text types. We identified three subtasks that need to be addressed: definition of the target; separation of the good and bad news content from the good and bad sentiment expressed on the target; and analysis of clearly marked opinion that is expressed explicitly, not needing interpretation or the use of world knowledge. Furthermore, we distinguish three different possible views on newspaper articles - author, reader and text, which have to be addressed differently at the time of analysing sentiment. Given these definitions, we present work on mining opinions about entities in English language news, in which (a) we test the relative suitability of various sentiment dictionaries and (b) we attempt to separate positive or negative opinion from good or bad news. In the experiments described here, we tested whether or not subject domain-defining vocabulary should be ignored. Results showed that this idea is more appropriate in the context of news opinion mining and that the approaches taking this into consideration produce a better performance."
Sentiment Analysis: How to Derive Prior Polarities from SentiWordNet,"Assigning a positive or negative score to a word out of context (i.e. a word's prior polarity) is a challenging task for sentiment analysis. In the literature, various approaches based on SentiWordNet have been proposed. In this paper, we compare the most often used techniques together with newly proposed ones and incorporate all of them in a learning framework to see whether blending them can further improve the estimation of prior polarity scores. Using two different versions of SentiWordNet and testing regression and classification models across tasks and datasets, our learning approach consistently outperforms the single metrics, providing a new state-of-the-art approach in computing words' prior polarity for sentiment analysis. We conclude our investigation showing interesting biases in calculated prior polarity scores when word Part of Speech and annotator gender are considered."
Using Self-Organizing Maps for Sentiment Analysis,"Web 2.0 services have enabled people to express their opinions, experience and feelings in the form of user-generated content. Sentiment analysis or opinion mining involves identifying, classifying and aggregating opinions as per their positive or negative polarity. This paper investigates the efficacy of different implementations of Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) for sentiment based visualization and classification of online reviews. Specifically, this paper implements the SOM algorithm for both supervised and unsupervised learning from text documents. The unsupervised SOM algorithm is implemented for sentiment based visualization and classification tasks. For supervised sentiment analysis, a competitive learning algorithm known as Learning Vector Quantization is used. Both algorithms are also compared with their respective multi-pass implementations where a quick rough ordering pass is followed by a fine tuning pass. The experimental results on the online movie review data set show that SOMs are well suited for sentiment based classification and sentiment polarity visualization."
General Purpose Textual Sentiment Analysis and Emotion Detection Tools,"Textual sentiment analysis and emotion detection consists in retrieving the sentiment or emotion carried by a text or document. This task can be useful in many domains: opinion mining, prediction, feedbacks, etc. However, building a general purpose tool for doing sentiment analysis and emotion detection raises a number of issues, theoretical issues like the dependence to the domain or to the language but also pratical issues like the emotion representation for interoperability. In this paper we present our sentiment/emotion analysis tools, the way we propose to circumvent the di culties and the applications they are used for."
NRC-Canada: Building the State-of-the-Art in Sentiment Analysis of Tweets,"In this paper, we describe how we created two state-of-the-art SVM classifiers, one to detect the sentiment of messages such as tweets and SMS (message-level task) and one to detect the sentiment of a term within a submissions stood first in both tasks on tweets, obtaining an F-score of 69.02 in the message-level task and 88.93 in the term-level task. We implemented a variety of surface-form, semantic, and sentiment features. with sentiment-word hashtags, and one from tweets with emoticons. In the message-level task, the lexicon-based features provided a gain of 5 F-score points over all others. Both of our systems can be replicated us available resources."
Exploring The Contribution of Unlabeled Data in Financial Sentiment Analysis,"With the proliferation of its applications in various industries, sentiment analysis by using publicly available web data has become an active research area in text classification during these years. It is argued by researchers that semi-supervised learning is an effective approach to this problem since it is capable to mitigate the manual labeling effort which is usually expensive and time-consuming. However, there was a long-term debate on the effectiveness of unlabeled data in text classification. This was partially caused by the fact that many assumptions in theoretic analysis often do not hold in practice. We argue that this problem may be further understood by adding an additional dimension in the experiment. This allows us to address this problem in the perspective of bias and variance in a broader view. We show that the well-known performance degradation issue caused by unlabeled data can be reproduced as a subset of the whole scenario. We argue that if the bias-variance trade-off is to be better balanced by a more effective feature selection method unlabeled data is very likely to boost the classification performance. We then propose a feature selection framework in which labeled and unlabeled training samples are both considered. We discuss its potential in achieving such a balance. Besides, the application in financial sentiment analysis is chosen because it not only exemplifies an important application, the data possesses better illustrative power as well. The implications of this study in text classification and financial sentiment analysis are both discussed."
Sentiment Analysis : A Literature Survey,"Our day-to-day life has always been influenced by what people think. Ideas and opinions of others have always affected our own opinions. The explosion of Web 2.0 has led to increased activity in Podcasting, Blogging, Tagging, Contributing to RSS, Social Bookmarking, and Social Networking. As a result there has been an eruption of interest in people to mine these vast resources of data for opinions. Sentiment Analysis or Opinion Mining is the computational treatment of opinions, sentiments and subjectivity of text. In this report, we take a look at the various challenges and applications of Sentiment Analysis. We will discuss in details various approaches to perform a computational treatment of sentiments and opinions. Various supervised or data-driven techniques to SA like Naïve Byes, Maximum Entropy, SVM, and Voted Perceptrons will be discussed and their strengths and drawbacks will be touched upon. We will also see a new dimension of analyzing sentiments by Cognitive Psychology mainly through the work of Janyce Wiebe, where we will see ways to detect subjectivity, perspective in narrative and understanding the discourse structure. We will also study some specific topics in Sentiment Analysis and the contemporary works in those areas."
Statistical sentiment analysis performance in Opinum,The classification of opinion texts in positive and negative is becoming a subject of great interest in sentiment analysis. The existence of many labeled opinions motivates the use of statistical and machine-learning methods. First-order statistics have proven to be very limited in this field. The Opinum approach is based on the order of the words without using any syntactic and semantic information. It consists of building one probabilistic model for the positive and another one for the negative opinions. Then the test opinions are compared to both models and a decision and confidence measure are calculated. In order to reduce the complexity of the training corpus we first lemmatize the texts and we replace most named-entities with wildcards. Opinum presents an accuracy above 81% for Spanish opinions in the financial products domain. In this work we discuss which are the most important factors that have impact on the classification performance.
Twitter Sentiment Analysis: How To Hedge Your Bets In The Stock Markets,"Emerging interest of trading companies and hedge funds in mining social web has created new avenues for intelligent systems that make use of public opinion in driving investment decisions. It is well accepted that at high frequency trading, investors are tracking memes rising up in microblogging forums to count for the public behavior as an important feature while making short term investment decisions. We investigate the complex relationship between tweet board literature (like bullishness, volume, agreement etc) with the financial market instruments (like volatility, trading volume and stock prices). We have analyzed Twitter sentiments for more than 4 million tweets between June 2010 and July 2011 for DJIA, NASDAQ-100 and 11 other big cap technological stocks. Our results show high correlation (upto 0.88 for returns) between stock prices and twitter sentiments. Further, using Granger's Causality Analysis, we have validated that the movement of stock prices and indices are greatly affected in the short term by Twitter discussions. Finally, we have implemented Expert Model Mining System (EMMS) to demonstrate that our forecasted returns give a high value of R-square (0.952) with low Maximum Absolute Percentage Error (MaxAPE) of 1.76% for Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). We introduce a novel way to make use of market monitoring elements derived from public mood to retain a portfolio within limited risk state (highly improved hedging bets) during typical market conditions."
WikiSent : Weakly Supervised Sentiment Analysis Through Extractive Summarization With Wikipedia,"This paper describes a weakly supervised system for sentiment analysis in the movie review domain. The objective is to classify a movie review into a polarity class, positive or negative, based on those sentences bearing opinion on the movie alone. The irrelevant text, not directly related to the reviewer opinion on the movie, is left out of analysis. Wikipedia incorporates the world knowledge of movie-specific features in the system which is used to obtain an extractive summary of the review, consisting of the reviewer's opinions about the specific aspects of the movie. This filters out the concepts which are irrelevant or objective with respect to the given movie. The proposed system, WikiSent, does not require any labeled data for training. The only weak supervision arises out of the usage of resources like WordNet, Part-of-Speech Tagger and Sentiment Lexicons by virtue of their construction. WikiSent achieves a considerable accuracy improvement over the baseline and has a better or comparable accuracy to the existing semi-supervised and unsupervised systems in the domain, on the same dataset. We also perform a general movie review trend analysis using WikiSent to find the trend in movie-making and the public acceptance in terms of movie genre, year of release and polarity."
Feature Specific Sentiment Analysis for Product Reviews,"In this paper, we present a novel approach to identify feature specific expressions of opinion in product reviews with different features and mixed emotions. The objective is realized by identifying a set of potential features in the review and extracting opinion expressions about those features by exploiting their associations. Capitalizing on the view that more closely associated words come together to express an opinion about a certain feature, dependency parsing is used to identify relations between the opinion expressions. The system learns the set of significant relations to be used by dependency parsing and a threshold parameter which allows us to merge closely associated opinion expressions. The data requirement is minimal as this is a one time learning of the domain independent parameters. The associations are represented in the form of a graph which is partitioned to finally retrieve the opinion expression describing the user specified feature. We show that the system achieves a high accuracy across all domains and performs at par with state-of-the-art systems despite its data limitations."
Sentiment Analysis of Document Based on Annotation,"I present a tool which tells the quality of document or its usefulness based on annotations. Annotation may include comments, notes, observation, highlights, underline, explanation, question or help etc. comments are used for evaluative purpose while others are used for summarization or for expansion also. Further these comments may be on another annotation. Such annotations are referred as meta-annotation. All annotation may not get equal weightage. My tool considered highlights, underline as well as comments to infer the collective sentiment of annotators. Collective sentiments of annotators are classified as positive, negative, objectivity. My tool computes collective sentiment of annotations in two manners. It counts all the annotation present on the documents as well as it also computes sentiment scores of all annotation which includes comments to obtain the collective sentiments about the document or to judge the quality of document. I demonstrate the use of tool on research paper."
User-level sentiment analysis incorporating social networks,"We show that information about social relationships can be used to improve user-level sentiment analysis. The main motivation behind our approach is that users that are somehow ""connected"" may be more likely to hold similar opinions; therefore, relationship information can complement what we can extract about a user's viewpoints from their utterances. Employing Twitter as a source for our experimental data, and working within a semi-supervised framework, we propose models that are induced either from the Twitter follower/followee network or from the network in Twitter formed by users referring to each other using ""@"" mentions. Our transductive learning results reveal that incorporating social-network information can indeed lead to statistically significant sentiment-classification improvements over the performance of an approach based on Support Vector Machines having access only to textual features."
A sentiment analysis of Singapore Presidential Election 2011 using Twitter data with census correction,"Sentiment analysis is a new area in text analytics where it focuses on the analysis and understanding of the emotions from the text patterns. This new form of analysis has been widely adopted in customer relation management especially in the context of complaint management. With increasing level of interest in this technology, more and more companies are adopting it and using it to champion their marketing efforts. However, sentiment analysis using twitter has remained extremely difficult to manage due to the sampling bias. In this paper, we will discuss about the application of using reweighting techniques in conjunction with online sentiment divisions to predict the vote percentage that individual candidate will receive. There will be in depth discussion about the various aspects using sentiment analysis to predict outcomes as well as the potential pitfalls in the estimation due to the anonymous nature of the internet."
A new ANEW: Evaluation of a word list for sentiment analysis in microblogs,"Sentiment analysis of microblogs such as Twitter has recently gained a fair amount of attention. One of the simplest sentiment analysis approaches compares the words of a posting against a labeled word list, where each word has been scored for valence, -- a 'sentiment lexicon' or 'affective word lists'. There exist several affective word lists, e.g., ANEW (Affective Norms for English Words) developed before the advent of microblogging and sentiment analysis. I wanted to examine how well ANEW and other word lists performs for the detection of sentiment strength in microblog posts in comparison with a new word list specifically constructed for microblogs. I used manually labeled postings from Twitter scored for sentiment. Using a simple word matching I show that the new word list may perform better than ANEW, though not as good as the more elaborate approach found in SentiStrength."
A Matter of Opinion: Sentiment Analysis and Business Intelligence (position paper),"A general-audience introduction to the area of ""sentiment analysis"", the computational treatment of subjective, opinion-oriented language (an example application is determining whether a review is ""thumbs up"" or ""thumbs down""). Some challenges, applications to business-intelligence tasks, and potential future directions are described."
A Sentimental Education: Sentiment Analysis Using Subjectivity Summarization Based on Minimum Cuts,"Sentiment analysis seeks to identify the viewpoint(s) underlying a text span; an example application is classifying a movie review as ""thumbs up"" or ""thumbs down"". To determine this sentiment polarity, we propose a novel machine-learning method that applies text-categorization techniques to just the subjective portions of the document. Extracting these portions can be implemented using efficient techniques for finding minimum cuts in graphs; this greatly facilitates incorporation of cross-sentence contextual constraints."
