[News Analysis] Star filmmakers flock to streaming,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000246054?sid=104,"Tue, 09 May 2023 18:22:00 +0900","Slow recovery of local film industry, different profit structure lead directors to examine optionsDirector Lee Byeong-heon looks into the monitor while shooting for ""Extreme Job."" (CJ Entertainment)Movie directors including star filmmakers Lee Byeong-heon and Jason Lee will release their next projects soon after the release of movies “Dream” and “My Heart Puppy,” respectively, earlier this year, but this time as Netflix drama series.Lee Byeong-heon, known for the hit comedy “Extreme Job” (2019), is expected to release “Chicken Nugget,” starring Kim Yoo-jung and Ryu Seung-ryong, as a Netflix original series sometime toward the year-end.Kim appears as Choi Min-ah, who turns into a chicken nugget after entering a suspicious machine by accident. His father, Choi Sun-man (Ryu), and Go Baek-jung (Ahn Jae-hong), a man who had a crush on Min-ah, struggle to find her.Lee’s “Chicken Nugget,” which is based on a webtoon of the same title, has already garnered industry’s attention -- it will reunite Ryu of “Extreme Job” and the director, as well as bringing Ahn of JTBC hit drama “Melo is My Nature” to star again in the director’s project.Cast announcement of Netflix original ""Chicken Nugget"" (Netflix)Jason Lee, who helmed “Midnight Runners” (2017), is also venturing into the world of streaming with “Bloodhounds,” which has been slated for release on Netflix in the second quarter of this year.The new K-drama is also based on the webtoon of the same title, revolving around promising boxer Gun-woo (Woo Do-hwan) who enters the dark world of moneylending to pay off his mother’s debt. Lee Sang-yi and Kim Sae-ron also appear as figures who work in the powerful and notorious business.Earlier this year, director Jung Ji-woo of “Eungyo” (2012) and “Happy End” (1999) unveiled his first ever series on Netflix with the thriller “Somebody.”Director Kang Yoon-sung of “The Outlaws” (2017) also decided to return with another action thriller, “Big Bet,” late last year -- not on the silver screen but via Disney+.Industry insiders view the slow comeback of Korean cinema as leading star filmmakers to turn to streaming platforms as an alternative.“It is not an exaggeration that film production has become very difficult after the pandemic because investment (in films) has literally dried up,” an industry insider who has worked at an agency promoting local films for a decade told The Korea Herald.Director Jang Hang-jun of the sports-comedy “Rebound,” which opened in April, said the film could not have opened without the help of investment from Nexon, as the film had been turned down so many times by investors.Director Lee of “Dream” also said during the press briefing prior to the movie’s premiere in April that it took eight years to open the film for various reasons, one of them being investment issues.According to the industry, South Korean films recorded 79.8 billion won ($60.1 million) in sales for the first three months that ended in March, about one fourth that compared to pre-pandemic times in 2019.In February, ticket sales of Korean films accounted for 19.5 percent of all film ticket sales, the lowest portion in 19 years.Of the eight Korean films that opened in wide release this year, the majority of them did not come close to their break-even point -- except director Yim Soon-rye’s first-ever action film “The Point Men,” which recorded 1.72 million admissions.Korean Film Council data showed that approximately 90 Korean films that have received at least 5 billion to 10 billion won of investment have yet to be released, making it difficult to create a “virtuous cycle” of money flow.“These investors are now cash-strapped because they can’t recoup their money as films are not opening. This makes it difficult to invest in new films, thus the investment is gradually drying up in the broad film scene,” an official with a decade of experience at a local film distribution firm said.In addition to the stagnant state of the film industry due largely to the yearslong pandemic that kept moviegoers away from cinemas and halted or delayed new movie releases, there is the issue of surging ticket price.Before the pandemic, many people only needed to decide what to watch at the theater. Now, many are asking whether a film is really worth watching at the theater at all. Movie tickets, which cost an average of 11,000 won in 2020, now cost 14,000 won on average. A night out at the movies for two people with popcorn and drinks could set a moviegoer back some 40,000 won.A total of 98.6 million people visited theaters from January to November 2022, according to cinema operators. This is an increase of about 89.6 percent from the previous year, when COVID-19 was at its peak and the local film industry was brought to a halt. Despite the increase, the figure is only about 48 percent of the pre-pandemic level in 2019.Following in the footsteps of smash hit series “Squid Game” on Netflix, filmmakers are stepping into the world of streaming where they do not have to worry about attracting investment. The profit sharing structure is also somewhat assuring.In the world of streaming, an increasing number of Korean drama lovers and their attention and love for Korean dramas directly translates into the platforms' sales and profit.In releasing its first quarter report on April 19, Netflix said that “The Glory” was the biggest reason behind its better-than-expected 3.7 percent on-year increase, raking in $8.1 billion in sales.Cast and crew shoot a scene for ""The Glory."" (Netflix)“The Glory” was one of 25 works of Korean content unveiled by Netflix, backed by a whopping 550 billion won in investment. Figures show that at least 60 percent of some 230 million Netflix subscribers worldwide had watched at least one K-content in the last year. This year, Netflix will release 34 new Netflix original Korean works.“We’re even seeing film production companies revising their scripts so they can release the projects via streaming platforms as an alternative to cinema. We need special measures from the government such as sponsoring film productions so that the production firms can pay back the cost once the films start to create profits,” said Park Ki-yong, chairperson of the Korean Film Council.Despite perks such as large investment and global reach, there are other aspects to working with streaming services that could prove detrimental.“'Netflix Original’ means the content's intellectual property belongs to Netflix, meaning that no matter how powerful or influential the content is, the original producer or writer cannot gain any benefit. In other words, South Korea’s unique, creative and original contents are slipping through,” an industry insider who declined to be named told The Korea Herald."

Watcha says edgy series was a simple business decision,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/640/0000025768?sid=106,"Thu, 23 Jun 2022 17:19:00 +0900","   Watcha's Chief Marketing Officer Kim Hye-jung speaks during an interview with the JoongAng Ilbo on June 2 at its building in Seocho-dong, southern Seoul. [KWON HYUK-JAE]     Watcha, Korea's streaming service, said making ""Semantic Error"" was a simple, calculated business decision based on years of data and a good measure of analysis. It was not as much of a gamble as it might first have seemed.      ""Semantic Error"" is series about a campus romance between two male students, played by a pair of minor K-pop stars: Jaechan of DKZ and Park Seo-ham, who was with KNK.    Released in February, it was the most watched on Watcha for eight weeks running and is being adapted into a full-length film, a first for a streaming service. The film will be shown at the Bucheon International Fantastic Film Festival (Bifan) on July 7.    The actors are now relatively well known.    The success of ""Semantic Error"" is significant not only because it was Watcha's first original series, but also because it limelighted the under-the-radar boy love (BL) genre, in which relatively tame stories about close relationships between men are featured.    The JoongAng Ilbo recently interviewed Watcha Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) Kim Hye-jung and discussed how the company is holding its own against Tving, Coupang Play and Waave in terms of home competition and Netflix, Apple TV+, Disney+ from overseas.       A scene from Watcha original series ""Semantic Error"" [WATCHA]     ""We're extremely grateful because it is proof that what Watcha pursues and its values are being accepted and recognized,"" Kim said from Watcha's building in Seocho-dong, southern Seoul.    Watcha's vision is ""to make a variety of content where everyone's differences are accepted, and each individual's tastes are respected by others.""    The creation of a BL series wasn't a coincidence, she says, but a meaningful achievement as it was in line with the company's values.    Data was behind Watcha's bold move into BL, which other local broadcasters or cable channels have avoided. Watcha, which initially started out as a rating and recommendation service called Watchapedia in 2012, has about 700 million pieces of rating data accumulated over the last decade.    ""We did not start working on 'Semantic Error' with the determination, 'OK, let's try BL,' but we could see in our data analysis that although there was high demand for the genre, not enough supply was met.""    Another critical factor for enhancing the overall quality of content lies in the environment. Regardless of their position in the company or their department, all employees can access the accumulated data and offer their opinions.    ""For our newbies, they are surprised to see how much we interact and communicate,"" Kim said. ""Anyone can formulate an opinion for content, and if that perspective sounds valid, we choose it and apply it, and adjust it to fit the needs of the project.""    After Watcha creates the content, it actively takes suggestions or follows demand based on customer feedback. The sole reason why the company decided to adapt ""Semantic Error"" into film was that there were ""so much demand"" from the users.    ""We saw many posts online that said they would love to watch the series in theaters, and we have received countless emails with similar requests,"" Kim said. ""It wasn't an easy decision to make because there are many factors we need to take in to turn a series into a film, but we decided to pursue it because we thought it was also part of the fandom culture to enjoy the content together.""    Due to Watcha's active response to users requests, it ranked No. 1 in brand loyalty among streaming services by Korea Customers Council for five consecutive years. According to Kim, she's plastered to the monitor to check user response almost 24/7.    ""Fans know that when they leave a post or a comment about the content, we'll see it.""    Watcha still ranks bottom in monthly active users (MAU) among seven streaming companies in Korea — Netflix, Wavve, Tving, Coupang Play, Disney+, Seezn and Watcha. And, in general, viewership numbers globally are under pressure due to the ending of the pandemic.    ""It has now become the new normal to watch OTT platforms, so I do not believe it will go back to the situation before the Covid-19 pandemic,"" she said using the industry jargon for streaming services. ""It is absolutely essential to more evidently outline Watcha's own distinctness at times like this.      ""I do not believe that big commercial hits that the absolute majority loves is the only criteria of success. As similar content continues to show across a variety of platforms, there will come a time when it will be critical for each streaming service to possess its own unique characteristics. I believe it's most important to become an irreplaceable service, where we can lead people to think 'if I want to watch a content like this, I should subscribe to Watcha.'""    "
US media 'clotheshorse' comment a reminder of first lady's fame and noto...,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000246253?sid=104,"Tue, 16 May 2023 17:03:00 +0900","Kim Keon Hee (Office of the President)A US newspaper’s recent comment calling South Korean First Lady Kim Keon Hee a “clotheshorse” and a subsequent complaint from one of its readers has garnered attention in South Korea, where the president's wife is both praised and surrounded by controversy.In a submission to the weekly readers’ grievances at the Washington Post, one reader took issue with the newspaper describing Kim as a “noted clotheshorse” in an April 27 article. The reader claimed that “gratuitous negative comments on visitors’ clothing are impolite” and that such remarks make the “work of our US government harder.”A clotheshorse, by dictionary definition, is a frame used to hang washed clothes, but it is also a slang term used to refer to a person who is very concerned with wearing fashionable clothes.What was initially the personal opinion of a single reader was blown out of proportion Tuesday morning when it was reported by many of the major news outlets in South Korea. As of 2 p.m., Tuesday, over 40 stories about the incident had surfaced since Yonhap News Agency first reported it, accompanied by comment sections filled with threads about whether or not she deserves to be ridiculed.South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol and his wife Kim Keon Hee pose with US President Joe Biden and US first lady Jill Biden ahead of a state dinner at the White House in Washington, on April 26. (AFP-Yonhap)The nation and its media have been closely following Kim, paying particular attention to her fashion during official outings and engagements. Last month, numerous headlines appeared about how a particular handbag brand sold out moments after Kim was seen carrying it during the presidential couple’s visit to the US.Some call it fashion diplomacy, but not all South Koreans appear to be reacting positively to the attention paid to the first lady’s style, or her very presence in the spotlight.Last month’s survey by local pollster Opinion Research Justice on 1,000 adults in the country showed that 61 percent of the respondents did not approve of Kim’s public appearances.Plagued by a series of allegations ranging from plagiarism to involvement in a stock price manipulation scheme, Kim had pledged ""quiet support"" for her husband before the presidential election. “I will live only as a wife, even if my husband gets elected,” she had said at the time.Despite the promise, Kim has been among the most visible first ladies in the country’s history. Last month, local Oh My News analyzed 67 photo news stories posted by the presidential office in March and found that 38 were of Yoon, 16 were of the first couple, and 13 were of just the first lady. The analysis also showed that an average of 16 photos were released in Kim’s total 13 photo stories, compared to seven for Yoon’s 38 stories.It is still unclear how much truth lies behind the controversies surrounding Kim, but this latest ""clotheshorse"" incident is a testament to how a story involving the first lady of South Korea -- no matter how trivial -- is bound to grab at least a few dozen headlines.First lady Kim Keon Hee plants a commemorative tree to mark the opening of the Yongsan Children's Garden in Yongsan-gu, Seoul, on May 4.

'설탕세' 부과...비만 얼마나 줄일까(연구),https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/296/0000062706?sid=103,"Tue, 31 Jan 2023 14:11:00 +0900","2018년 설탕세 도입한 영국, “6학년 여아 연 5천명 비만 예방”달콤한 유혹의 중심, 설탕. 설탕이 들어간 음료에 세금을 매기는 설탕세의 비만 예방 효과를 가늠할 수 있는 연구 결과가 영국에서 나왔다. 우리나라에서도 몇 년 전부터 관심을 보였다. [사진=게티이미지뱅크]설탕세가 영국에 도입된 이후 매년 6000명 이상의 초등 6학년 여자 어린이의 비만을 예방했다는 연구 결과가 나왔다.  영국 케임브리지대∙옥스퍼드대 공동 연구 결과에 따르면 영국이 2018년 4월 설탕이 들어간 음료에 설탕세(청량음료 산업부담금 또는 설탕음료세)를 도입한 이후 초등 6학년 여자 어린이의 비만 사례가 줄어든 것으로 나타났다. 하지만 남자 초등생과 유아학교 어린이에서는 설탕세와 비만의 연관성이 입증되지 않았다.  연구팀은 2014~2020년 유아학교 연령(4~5세)에서 초등 6학년(10~11세) 사이 어린이의 비만 수준 변화를 추적했다. 연구 결과 설탕세 도입 19개월 만에 초등학교 6학년 여자 어린이의 비만 수준이 종전에 비해 8% 낮아진 것으로 나타났다. 이는 연간 5234명의 비만을 예방하는 것에 해당한다. 특히 빈곤 지역에 사는 6학년 여자 어린이의 비만 수준은 9% 낮아졌다. 초등학교 6학년 남자 어린이의 비만 유병률에는 전반적으로 이렇다할 변화가 없었다.  영국에서 유아학교 연령 어린이는 10명 중 1명꼴이, 초등학교 6학년 어린이는 5명 중 1명꼴이 비만이다. 비만 어린이는 고혈압, 제2형 당뇨병, 우울증 등에 걸릴 위험이 높다.  영국 젊은이들의 첨가당 섭취량은 권장량보다 훨씬 더 많다. 특히 청소년기 후반에는 일반적으로 권장량(30g)의 2배가 넘는 70g의 첨가당을 매일 섭취한다. 첨가당의 가장 큰 원천은 설탕이 첨가된 음료수다. 빈곤 가정 어린이는 비만 위험이 더 높고 가당음료를 더 많이 소비할 확률이 더 높다.  영국 정부는 지나치게 많은 설탕 소비로부터 어린이를 보호하고 아동 비만 문제 해결을 위해 청량음료에 대해 2단계로 세금을 부과하는 설탕세를 도입했다. 청량음료 제조업체에서 거둔 세금은 교육부의 학교 스포츠 활동 운영에 썼다.  연구의 주요 저자인 케임브리지대 니나 로저스 박사(역학)는 ""설탕세가 매년 많은 어린이의 비만을 막는 데 도움이 될 수 있음을 보여준 첫 연구 결과""라고 말했다.  연구팀은 설탕세가 유아학교 남녀 어린이의 비만 예방으로 이어지지 않은 이유에 대해 ""아주 어린 아이들은 가당음료를 상대적으로 덜 소비하기 때문으로 추정된다""고 말했다. 그러나 설탕세가 초등학교 6학년 여자 어린이를 뺀 초등학생 전체 어린이의 비만 유병률에 별다른 영향을 미치지 않은 이유는 불명확하다. 남자 어린이들은 여자 어린이들보다 가당음료를 더 많이 소비한다. 일부 연구 결과를 보면 남자 어린이가 여자 어린이에 비해 TV를 더 많이 시청하고, 열량이 높은 식품을 선전하는 TV 광고에 더 쉽게 빠지는 것으로 나타났다.  이 연구 결과(Associations between trajectories of obesity prevalence in English primary school children and the UK soft drinks industry levy: An interrupted time series analysis of surveillance data)는 국제학술지 《플로스 메디슨(PLOS Medicine)》에 실렸고 미국과학진흥회 포털 '유레카 얼럿'이 소개했다.  국내에선 국회 입법조사처가 2020년 설탕세 도입을 검토했다. 2021년 7월엔 한국지방세연구원이 '설탕세의 해외사례와 지방세 정책방향' 보고서를 냈고 한국조세재정연구원도 관련 보고서를 발표했다. 국내 학계 일부에는 설탕세의 당위성에 의문을 드러냈다. 비만은 칼로리 과잉섭취 때문에 생기며 몸에서 남아도는 칼로리는 설탕 외에 단백질, 지방, 탄수화물 등 모든 영양소에서 생길 수 있다는 것이다.  노르웨이는 1922년 초콜릿, 설탕 제품세를 도입했다. 이어 헝가리, 프랑스, 핀란드가 탄산음료세를 부과했고 영국, 아일랜드, 이탈리아 등 유럽 국가에서 설탕세를 매겼다. 아시아에서는 태국(2017년), 필리핀(2018년), 말레이시아(2019년)가 설탕세를 걷고 있다. 남미의 멕시코, 칠레(2014년)도 설탕이 들어간 음료에 세금을 매기고 있다. 세계보건기구(WHO)는 2016년 설탕세 부과를 권고했다.

[Analysis] Korean cinema is having its moment in the sun,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000237193?sid=104,"Sun, 29 May 2022 17:40:00 +0900","			The 75th Cannes Film Festival was one of the most productive outings for South Korean movies to date, marking the first time the nation claimed two major trophies at one of the world’s most prestigious film events.It was another reminder of how the country’s cinema went from relative obscurity to claiming a bigger spotlight on the international stage.Song Kang-ho, star of “Broker,” became the first Korean in history to receive the best actor award, while Park Chan-wook added to his already-impressive collection with a best director trophy for “Decision to Leave.” The two films were among the five produced by South Koreans and screened at the festival, in or out of competition. With the big wins on Saturday, South Koreans have won at least one trophy in all of the competing categories at Cannes. Surge in international attentionPrior to the 21st century, South Korean movies were a near non-factor on the international stage. Among the few countrymen who had a reputation outside the country was Im Kwon-taek. His “ChunHyang” in 2000 became the first South Korean film to be selected to compete for Palme d’Or, and the star of his 1986 movie “The Surrogate Woman” Kang Soo-yeon won the best actress award in the 44th Venice International Film Festival the following year, making her the first Korean thespian to win at a major international film festival.This feat made Kang, who passed away earlier this month, the first home-grown celebrity to be dubbed a “world star” by local media.Song Kang-ho (CJ ENM)Im and Kang may have put South Korea on the cinematic map, but it was really the next generation of filmmakers and actors that expanded the country’s reputation. Lee Chang-dong’s “Oasis” won in 2002 for best director and emerging actress -- Moon So-ri -- followed with critically-acclaimed films like Park’s “Oldboy” (2003) and Lee’s “Secret Sunshine” (2007) that received prizes in the aforementioned festivals.Kim Ki-duk -- a controversial filmmaker in terms of directing style and personal misconduct following “MeToo” accusations -- won international acclaims such as the Golden Lion for Venice Film Festival’s Golden Lion for “Pieta (2012)” and Silver Bear for Best Director at Berlin International Film Festival for “Samaritan Girl.” Director Hong Sang-soo, recipient of the Silver Bear for “The Woman Who Ran” (2020) is another talented individual who was a beacon of controversy, as was his mistress and actress Kim Min-hee -- the star of the aforementioned film and the first Korean to win the Silver Bear for Best Actress at the Berlin International Film Festival for her performance in “On the Beach at Night Alone” (2017).But as in case of many award-winning films, very few of these films were box office hits. For example, “Oldboy” was one of the most financially successful of all the South Korean films that won at Venice, Berlin or Cannes, but garnered only $14.98 million worldwide in terms of box office sales.Numbers suggest that South Korean films have had limited appeal to global audiences, with their profits reliant mostly on the domestic box office success. According to US website Box Office Mojo, the biggest domestic hit of all time “The Admiral: Roaring Currents” (2014) made $131.6 million in South Korea but only $138.3 million worldwide. “Extreme Job” (2019) had worldwide box office sales of $120 million, of which $112 million was made locally. Even films like “Train to Busan” (2016), which was so successful that it landed one of its stars Don Lee (Ma Dong-seok) a Marvel Cinematic Universe gig, owed over half of its box office success to the South Korean audience. A scene from ""Parasite"" (CN ENM)Bong’s ‘Parasite’ a game-changerDirector Bong Joon-ho’s “Parasite” -- which also starred Song Kang-ho -- in 2019 was virtually the first homegrown film that was both critically well-received and a worldwide hit. The film was bombarded with honors that included winning the best picture, best director, best original screenplay and best international feature film at the 92nd Academy Awards, marking the first time a non-English language film won best picture and the first time a Korean film ever won at the Oscars. But what makes the film stand out from other critically-acclaimed Korean films -- apart from the fact that it was also the first Korean film to win Palme d’Or or to win at Golden Globes -- was that it was an international box office success. It was the world’s 31st most successful film in 2019 and made $269 million overall, making it the most lucrative South Korean film of all time. More importantly it only made $71.4 million in local ticket sales, unlike the other Korean films of the past that relied heavily on local box office.This has led to the view that the global appeal of South Korean cultural content has been on the rise, as also seen by the success of K-pop and Korean TV series, like BTS and “Squid Game.” Incidentally, the 75th Cannes Film Festival also featured an out-of-competition screening of “Hunt,” the directorial debut of “Squid Game” star Lee Jung-jae.A scene from ""Broker"" (CJ ENM)Since 2019, South Korean films have claimed at least one award from the major categories at the Venice, Berlin or Cannes festivals, events that had been dubbed the “big 3” by local media.

"Worst Real Estate Market Ever: Jeonse or Sales, Selling Offers Piling Up",https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/032/0003187169?sid=104,"Fri, 18 Nov 2022 14:11:00 +0900","The view of Seoul’s Gangnam area from the Seoul Sky Observatory at Lotte World Tower. /Yonhap NewsThe apartment housing supply-demand index in Seoul dropped to below 70 points. A series of interest rate hikes and falling housing prices resulted in a decreasing buying trend. Consequently, the supply-demand index seems to have fallen, too.The supply-demand index for the nationwide apartment jeonse (lease on a lump-sum deposit) also dropped below 80 points. It is at a record low since the research on the index has begun.According to the time series analysis of weekly apartment prices by the Korea Real Estate Board (KREB) on November 18, the apartment supply-demand index in Seoul was 69.2, down from the previous week’s (70.7 points). It has gone below the 70-point mark for the first time in 123 months: it is the record low since the index of the first week of August 2012.If the index is lower than the reference point of 100, it indicates more sellers than buyers in the market.The apartment supply-demand index in Seoul fell below 100 points in the third week of November 2021, recording 99.6 points. Since then, it has been a ‘buyer’s market’ for 53 consecutive weeks. The desired buying and selling prices do not match, and the potential buyers keep pulling out of the market.According to the Seoul Real Estate Information Plaza, the number of reported apartment deals in October was 488 (based on the contrate date). Although the reporting period is not over yet, it is likely to be an all-time low for October’s business.In other provinces, the same index this week also dropped from the previous week’s: from 74.1 to 72.8 points in Gyeonggi-do and from 73.9 to 72.1 points in Incheon. Accordingly, the supply-buy index of the metropolitan area dropped from 73.0 to 71.6. The nationwide apartment supply-demand index has been below the 80-point mark for two consecutive weeks at 76.9 points (down from the previous week’s 78.5 points).The downward trend continues in the jeonse market as well. The nationwide apartment jeonse supply-demand index fell below the 80-point mark, from 80.4 to 78.4 points this week. Although the supply-demand index is relative, it may signify jeonse offers piling up in the market. In simple numerical terms, it is the lowest ever since the KREB started relevant research in July 2012. The apartment jeonse supply-demand index recorded 70.6 points.		"
[ANALYSIS] Yield troubles at Samsung Electronics endanger big bets,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/640/0000022191?sid=105,"Mon, 14 Mar 2022 16:38:00 +0900","  A Samsung Electronics employee inspects chip equipment at the company's plant in Hwaseong, Gyeonggi. [JOONGANG PHOTO]     Samsung Electronics is struggling with semiconductor yield problems that endanger its big bets on systems chips and the foundry business.    The problem, which has been evident for some time and a favorite topic of the semiconductor trade press, went prime time with the roll out of the latest Exynos, a system chip developed by Samsung Electronics that is supposed to compete with Qualcomm's Snapdragon line and allow the company, the largest smartphone maker in the world, to match the performance Apple products.      ""Samsung Electronics encountered trouble ramping up production yields of 4-nanometer chips as shown in the delay of its Exynos 2200 delivery,"" said Jeong In-seong, a semiconductor specialist who authored ""The Future of the Semiconductor Empire.""    The Exynos 2200's introduction was delayed for 1 week in January.    ""Samsung Electronics had to trim down the number of countries where Exynos-powered Galaxy S22 models retail because of the yield issue. It shipped them to only a handful of small markets in Europe,"" he said. In the company's major smartphone markets — the United States, Korea and India — all Galaxy S22s had Snapdragon processors.      The yield rate is the amount of a silicon wafer that is successfully made into dies, which are themselves packaged to become semiconductors. The lower the yields, the less product produced.        Samsung Electronics would not confirm the actual yields of its 4-nanometer chips, but media reports in Korea put the rate at between 20 percent and 30 percent. TSMC reported yields of around 80 percent for its 5-nanometer products in 2019.      Against this backdrop, Samsung Electronics recently initiated an internal probe into its foundry, or chip fabrication, business division. These probes are usually undertaken to look more closely into the operations of poorly-performing units, though a Samsung Electronics spokesperson said that in this case it is just ""a regular event to enhance competitiveness.""    It is the first time for the foundry business, which was made a separate division in 2017, to be the subject of such a probe.      Kang Moon-soo, head of the foundry market strategy team at Samsung Electronics, acknowledged the difficulties producing chips based on the latest manufacturing techniques during a conference call in January.      ""It is true that we have trouble achieving a stabilized yield rate in the beginning stage"" of adopting the new manufacturing process, Kang said, citing the complexity of the fabrication process.      With the steep rise in data traffic and the increased loads of sophisticated data functions for processing machine learning and metaverse functions, chip manufacturers like Samsung Electronics and Taiwan's TSMC are furiously working to pack more transistors onto integrated circuits (IC).      In doing so, they are beginning to bump up against certain technical and physical limits.      ""To increase the chip performance, the manufacturer must integrate more transistors onto the ICs that are already infinitesimal,"" said Greg Roh, an analyst at HMC Investment Securities. ""At the same time, it must manage possible overheating through different hardware and software techniques, since the higher the density of transistors the higher the chance of overheating.""      Samsung Foundry manufactures chips installed in the company's Galaxy S22 series — Exynos 2200 and Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 1.    The S22's data processing speed was on par with that of the S21, its predecessor, which came equipped with the Snapdragon 888 and the Exynos 2100. When compared to the iPhone series, the average score of the S22 Ultra, the high-end unit from the latest series, was in line with that of the iPhone 11 Pro, according to Geekbench.    TSMC fabricates processors for iPhones.      Local media outlets have reported that Qualcomm, one of the biggest foundry clients for the Korean chipmaker, has picked TSMC over Samsung Foundry to manufacture Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 Plus and the next version of the 8 Gen 1 series, which will be rated at 3 nanometer.      TSMC had 53.1 percent of the foundry market in the third quarter, according to Taiwanese research firm TrendForce, and Samsung Electronics had 17.1 percent.      When it comes to mobile processors, Samsung Electronics had 4 percent of market as of the final quarter last year, down 6 percentage points on year, according to Counterpoint Research.      ""Samsung Electronics is in the middle of rejigging its smartphone portfolio strategy of in-sourcing as well as outsourcing to Chinese ODMs. As a result, the share of MediaTek and Qualcomm chips have been growing across Samsung's smartphone portfolio, from the mid-range 4G and 5G models manufactured by ODMs to the flagship ones,"" the research firm wrote, referring to original design manufacturers, which make products under contract.        TSMC plans to invest $44 billion this year alone to ramp up production at its foundry business. Samsung Electronics upgraded its investment plan last year on processor development and foundry to 171 trillion won ($137.9 billion) by 2030, which means it is investing at about half the rate of TSMC.    The Suwon, Gyeonggi-based company made a big move last year to build a new foundry plant in Taylor, Texas, by investing at least $ 17 billion. Construction hasn't started yet, despite its initial plan to break ground in the first quarter.      ""Samsung Electronics' competitiveness in system-on-chips has weakened,"" said Kim Yang-jae, an analyst at KTB Investment & Securities.      ""It has increased the portion of outsourced chips into its own products,"" he said, projecting that the upcoming folding models, set to be released in the second half, will use Qualcomm's Snapdragon chips.

Apartment-Buying Sentiment Frozen: The Supply-Demand Index in Seoul Drop...,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/032/0003153866?sid=104,"Fri, 17 Jun 2022 13:56:00 +0900","Nearby apartment complexes seen from the Seoul Sky Observatory at the top of the Lotte World Tower in Songpa-gu, Seoul. Yonhap NewsThe demand to purchase apartments in Seoul fell for the sixth consecutive week.The higher base interest rate has increased the burden on households with loans to repay. This in turn has weakened the desire to “buy a home, even if one has to take out a loan” and decreased the demand for real estate investment as well.According to the time series analysis (as of June 13) of weekly apartment prices by the Korea Real Estate Board on June 17, the apartment supply-demand index in Seoul was 88.8, 0.6 points down from the previous week.The demand to buy apartments in Seoul dropped below 100 last November and has remained around 80-90 for the thirty-first week. For the supply-demand index, 100 is the reference point. If the index is lower than 100, it indicates that the demand to sell is higher than the demand to buy. The higher the index, the higher the demand to purchase an apartment. Thus, the latest figures show that there are more people who want to sell their apartments than those who want to buy them for the 31st week.According to the current state of real estate transactions (based on the contract date) on the Seoul Real Estate Information Plaza—a website run by the Seoul metropolitan government—there were only 15 apartments sold in the so-called “three Gangnam districts (Gangnam, Seocho, Songpa),” on June 17.One real estate agent in Banpo-dong, Seocho-gu, Seoul said, “The preference for ‘one smart apartment’ continues to grow stronger, but due to loan regulations and the interest rate hike, realistically, it’s hard to purchase an apartment in the three Gangnam districts as your first home. There has to be more people owning multiple homes who want to sell homes in mid to low price areas and move to high price areas to lead to sales in the three Gangnam districts, but currently, apartment transactions have practically disappeared throughout all areas of Seoul.”Apartments on sale continue to pile up. According to the data from Asil, a real estate company, the number of apartments for sale in Seoul exceeded 60,000 for the first time on May 24, and as of June 17, the number has increased to 64,150.However, the real estate industry believes the figures also include some “illusions.” The government temporarily removed the real estate sale tax for people with multiple homes, sending out a “sell” signal to the market, but most of the major property subject to heavy sale taxes were already sold last year. Thus, the industry claims that there are a lot of property that owners put up for sale to “test” the market because of an atmosphere that seems to be telling them to sell.One real estate agent in Gaepo-dong, Gangnam-gu, Seoul said, “The people who are putting their property up for sale are not lowering the prices because they think that people who want to buy a home, will buy it even if they sell at that price, and people who want to buy a home just go around asking the price. This situation is repeating.”On June 16, the government announced the direction of the new government’s economic policies and said it would drastically lower the property holding tax for people with multiple homes. So people with multiple property who don’t have an urgent need to sell their property could withdraw some of the property they put up for sale.Meanwhile, the national supply-demand index (93.793.4) and the supply-demand index in the Seoul metropolitan area (91.190.8) dropped slightly from the previous week, showing that the demand for homes remain weak nationwide.Total demand also fell after making a surprise climb the previous week. The apartment jeonse (lease on a lump-sum deposit) supply-demand index in Seoul was 94.7, 0.3 points down from the previous week (95.0), and the national figure (97.096.6) and the figure for the Seoul metropolitan area (95.795.3) also dropped slightly from the previous week.

[Beyond Earth] ‘Space traffic control will be huge market’,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000245983?sid=104,"Mon, 08 May 2023 08:58:00 +0900","Nara Space looking to become S. Korea’s first system integration company to put small satellite into orbitNara Space CEO Park Jae-pil holds up a cube satellite figure during an interview with The Korea Herald in Seoul on May 2. (Im Se-jun/The Korea Herald)As the global space race gets heated, more satellites will be launched into space. Dealing with the increasing number of satellites will be an enormous market.Nara Space, a South Korean startup specializing in developing small satellites and providing solutions with satellite images of the Earth, is aiming to become a pioneer in the space traffic control sector.“We think the market for controlling space traffic or markets related to space traffic will grow immensely,” Park Jae-pil, CEO of Nara Space, told The Korea Herald in an interview held at the space startup’s office in Seoul on May 2.“Eventually, the time will come for the satellites that can fuel other satellites, clean up space garbage and even take down hostile satellites when needed,” he said.According to a report by Fortune Business Insights, the global small satellite market is projected to grow to $12 billion in 2029 from $5.6 billion in 2022, with a compound annual growth rate of 11.5 percent.As part of the government’s space projects, Nara Space has been working on the research and development of removing space garbage. Park noted the startup’s technology of operating satellites in close proximity to other satellites as a foundational technology that can be used in various areas.Nara Space will look to become Korea’s first system integration company to put a nano satellite, which is developed with its technology and assembled by its personnel, into orbit in October. Named Observer-1A, the satellite will be loaded onto SpaceX’s launch vehicle Falcon 9 for space travel. The Observer-1A weighs 25 kilograms and is the size of a microwave.“The satellite has a resolution of 1.5 meters. With our super-resolution technology, the satellite imagery service can be offered in a resolution of 0.5 meters. In that case, we will be able to provide global-level services by having the highest resolution given the size (of the satellite),” said Park.The mission of the Observer-1A is to test the satellite’s image-taking capability and check whether it can capture certain places according to the planned schedule. The satellite will be able to take one image per orbit, which means that it will produce a satellite image every 90 minutes. The duration of the mission is expected to last between two and three years, according to the CEO.Researchers at Nara Space work on a satellite at the company's office in Seoul on May 2. (Kan Hyeong-woo/The Korea Herald)Nara Space has received the highest level of technical-readiness certification from the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration for its onboard computer, also known as OBC, technology. The startup’s OBC, which works as the brain of a satellite to control various operations, was able to capture the ejection moments of the four cube satellites launched into orbit on Korea’s homegrown Nuri rocket in June last year.The CEO underscored that the company’s goal is to be operating 100 satellites five years from now with a well-established system of mass production, noting that having such an amount of satellites in space will allow Nara Space to provide real-time information about major cities across the world through satellite imagery.“The goal is to be able to assemble one small satellite with five people. We are working on optimizing the internal blueprint to cut down the time consumption while also trying to make the satellite assembly process resemble the manufacturing of a computer,” said Park.The 35-year-old CEO established Nara Space in 2015. The startup raised 10 billion won ($7.6 million) in series A funding in May 2022.Another core business of Nara Space is Earthpaper, a satellite data analysis platform. Park explained that Earthpaper is like Google and Coupang in the way that it allows users to search for satellite images and buy them with easier access.“There are people who are not familiar with satellite images. For example, city managers, those in charge of disaster control or people working at financial companies might not know how to utilize satellite images. We offer them insight pages so that they can learn how to use satellite images for what they do,” he said.According to the CEO, the number of Earthpaper users reached about 30,000 during the closed beta test period. He noted the company is close to launching its open beta test.“Our goal is to provide satellite data to those who find it difficult to access them because we believe a society where satellite data can be used without our recognition will come,” said Park."
Top 20% of Houses in the Greater Seoul Area Are Valued at Over 1.5 Billi...,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/032/0003095849?sid=104,"Thu, 02 Sep 2021 17:09:00 +0900","			[경향신문] A variety of housing types that accommodate the citizens of Seoul seen from the Seoul Sky Observatory at Lotte Tower in Songpa-gu, Seoul. Lee Joon-heonHousing prices recently soared and the average price of the top 20% of houses in the Seoul metropolitan area exceeded 1.5 billion won for the first time.According to a time series analysis of the monthly housing price trend by KB Kookmin Bank’s Liiv Real Estate on September 2, the average price of houses located in the greater Seoul area that fell in the fifth quintile (top 20%) last month was 1,508,930,000 won. This was the highest price since KB began disclosing its statistics of the Seoul metropolitan area in April 2013.The price of fifth quintile homes in this area surpassed 1 billion won in September 2018, then increased by 100 million won in a year and three months, exceeding 1.1 billion won in December 2019. Seven months later in July 2020, the average price surpassed 1.2 billion won and just three months later exceeded 1.3 billion won. The price exceeded 1.4 billion won last February, only four months later. Finally, in just six months, the price jumped again from 1.4 billion to surpass 1.5 billion won.The price of homes has made a steep climb, rising 264.45 million won in the past year. Compared with two years ago, prices have risen by 438.45 million won. Compared with the prices in May 2017 (790.62 million won), when the Moon Jae-in government entered office, prices nearly doubled, increasing by 718.31 million won.A closer look at the regions showed that homes located in Seoul in the fifth quintile were valued at 2,227,940,000 won. Prices increased by nearly 300 million won (299.28 million won) from a year ago and by over 500 million won (502.48 million won) from two years ago. Compared to when the incumbent government launched in May 2017 (1,213,270,000 won), the price of homes jumped by over a billion won (1,014,660,000 won).During the same period, housing prices in Gyeonggi-do rose from 539.12 million won to nearly 962 million won and are now approaching one billion won. In Incheon, prices increased slightly over 270 million won from 430 million won to 700.6 million won.The housing price quintile share ratio in the Seoul metropolitan area constantly rose from 6.4 in January-June 2020 to 6.9 in October, reflecting the widening gap between the prices of expensive and cheap housing. Meanwhile, the ratio remained at 6.8 from November 2020 to February this year, then dropped to 5.9 last month and is showing a different pattern from last year. Experts believe this is because the prices of cheaper houses in the greater Seoul area are climbing swiftly.The prices of homes located in this area that belong to the first quintile (bottom 20%) rose 35.0% (65.9 million won) in the last year, a rate much bigger than the increase of 21.2% (264.4 million won) seen among houses in the fifth quintile during the same period. Park Won-kap, senior real estate expert at KB Kookmin Bank said, “There was a clear trend of home buyers leaving Seoul and moving to Gyeonggi and Incheon, which have easy access to Seoul, when the housing prices in Seoul jumped.”		"

"Why Kospi could be headed for 3,000",https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000223958?sid=104,"Wed, 09 Dec 2020 17:38:00 +0900","An electronic board in a currency dealing room of Hana Bank headquarters in Seoul shows Kospi's closing mark at 2,755.47 Wednesday. (Yonhap)Stock analysts are setting bullish targets on South Korea‘s main stock market index Kospi, as optimism for strong earnings growth next year abound, while investors backed by ample market liquidity are zeroing in on equities as their choices are increasingly limited. The views came as the Kospi on Wednesday resumed its record run by closing at 2,755.47. The index rebounded 2 percent from a day prior when Kospi retreated from the five-trading-day rally since the start of December. Kospi, whose combined market cap of over 900 constituents exceeds 1,890 trillion won ($1.7 trillion), has been navigating new highs as foreign investors turned into net buyers of Korean stocks from November. An estimate by international investment banking group JPMorgan’s Asia Pacific Equity Research team showed Wednesday that it set its Kospi target at 3,200 by the end of 2021, as it continues to be an outperformer among MSCI emerging-market countries. “We believe higher valuation should be justified on the back of increasing optimism on COVID-19 vaccination and higher visibility on earnings recovery,” read JPMorgan‘s report “Korea Year Ahead 2021.”The stock market is seeing an increased aggregate price-to-earnings valuation as more health care stocks and battery stocks become large caps, as well as a potential upside to earnings next year that is driving higher valuation multiples of the overall market, it added. Meanwhile, Korean retail investors supported by ample liquidity -- as interest rates have remained at near-zero levels and the government laid out stimulus packages -- are expected to witness tougher government real estate policies to tackle housing prices, which will narrow retail investors’ destinations.“Equities remain the top preferred investment method (in Korea) propelled by strict restrictions on the housing market,” wrote JPMorgan. The forecast comes along with local analysts‘ optimism for Korea’s exports momentum next year as the macroeconomic setting improves. Global demand for manufactured goods will add to the upside potential of Korean firms‘ profits and the valuation of the stock market in the export-driven economy, as the COVID-19 impact wanes with the projected vaccine commercialization and weak US dollar is further likely to attract foreign investors, wrote Lee Kyoung-min, a strategist at Daishin Securities.“As December passes, investors should be ready for the new era when Kospi is headed for 3,000 and above,” Lee wrote.But Lee added that a market correction from the recent rally is expected before end-2021, as some retail investors are expected to unload stocks before year-end to avoid taxes imposed on those holding at least 1 billion-won worth of shares of a single company, while the Korean won may unexpectedly weaken against the US dollar. Other analysts also forecast that Kospi would exceed the 3,000 mark, given the average 12-month trailing price-to-book ratio of the MSCI Korea Index since 2002 that stood at 1.17 as of Dec. 4. Bruce Lee, a quantitative analyst at Kakaopay Securities, said the Kospi market cap could grow 11 percent next year to just over 3,000, based on its time series analysis of trailing price-to-book ratio of Kospi.“A time series analysis appears to be more justifiable (than a peer group valuation) to forecast the stock market in a melt-up rally,” Lee wrote.

The statistical agency used a new sample and survey method for the first time to calculate the income disparity.   The multiple figure for the first quarter of last year was 5.18 times when calculated by the new methodology and 5.8 times by the old one.   If the old standards were applied, the figure for the first quarter of this year is reportedly estimated to be more than six. This would be the worst ever, breaking the previous record of 5.95 times higher for the first-quarter 2018.   The agency also excluded one-person households from the sample.

[News Analysis] Will Lee’s release turn tide for Samsung?,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000229862?sid=104,"Mon, 09 Aug 2021 20:04:00 +0900","Samsung expected to expedite major decisions to fend off rising challenges in chip industrySamsung Vice Chairman Lee Jae-yong (middle) finger-points at a construction site for a new chip plant in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, in January. (Samsung Electronics)With its de facto chief Lee Jae-yong set to be released from jail this week, attention is turning to the fate of Samsung Electronics in its mission to become the world’s No. 1 integrated device manufacturer amid a heightening race for leadership in the global chip market. With a void at the top leadership, the IT giant has been suffering from apparent delays in its decision-making process, affecting significant investment plans. Lee’s return is expected to expedite the firm’s internal decision-making process, as it seeks to cement its position in the semiconductor industry and seek new businesses for the future. “Expectations are rising again within the company that Lee, with his global networks, could kick-start large investments and M&As,” said an industry insider. “It would restore investors‘ and consumers’ trust in Samsung‘s future.”The most urgent task for Samsung is to finalize the US investment plan that will ramp up its production and presence in the US both by winning powerful US clients like Qualcomm, Google and Facebook and keeping its rivals Intel and TSMC in check. It has been more than seven months that Samsung was rumored to be planning a new chip foundry in the US, but a final decision has been put off. Samsung wasn’t able to announce a final version of the plan even during President Moon Jae-in’s visit to Washington in May. At the time, the company’s Vice Chairman Kim Ki-nam of the semiconductor division mentioned Samsung was to invest around $18 billion in the US for a chip plant as he accompanied the president on the trip, but not further details. Among five regions in the US, including Texas, Arizona and New York, Samsung is still mulling the benefits and profits, including tax incentives, of building a plant in the US. The new US plant would be crucial for Samsung to keep up with its Taiwanese rival TSMC in its foundry business. Taiwan’s TSMC that has kept over 50 percent of the global foundry market has announced it is investment more than $100 billion for the next three years. In Arizona, the Taiwanese firm is building five new factories, according to its announcement in May. Amid the current dearth of chips affecting various industries across the world, the capacity to produce sufficient chips has become highly sought-after. The unrivalled US processor developer Intel is also jumping into the foundry market by planning to build a new manufacturing plant. Intel is also rumored to be preparing to acquire Global Foundries, a smaller foundry firm owned by an Abu Dhabi fund, to expand its chip manufacturing capacity. “Timing and speed are important factors in the chip race,” an industry official said. “The chipmakers around the world are speeding up their investments. Lee’s return would help speed up the decision-making process at Samsung.”“It is true that Samsung’s force for decision-making has been undermined due to Lee’s absence,” said Lee Chang-han, vice chairman of Korea Semiconductor Industry Association. “Investments in the semiconductor industry, which take massive amounts of money, desperately need the decision of someone who is in a position of responsibility.” Samsung has not announced any sizeable M&A plans since its Harman takeover in 2016, which was led by Lee Jae-yong. The company said in February it was seriously considering an acquisition in three years, but any details are unlikely to be released unless Lee returns to management. In 2018, Lee announced a plan to invest 171 trillion-won by 2021 to make Samsung the top player in the system-on-chip market by 2030. But executions of the related plans have been held back for the last seven months, with no announcement of a major achievement. It is trying to expand its presence in the mobile processor market with its Exynos chipset, and increase sales of automotive image processor ISOCELL. Samsung is also facing new risks from the mobile business after the heyday of the flagship Galaxy S series. Once the world’s largest smartphone vendor, Samsung sold 13.5 million units of Galaxy S21 series from January to June, according to data by Counterpoint Research. The sales volume was 20 percent less than the predecessor’s record at 17 million last year. China’s Xiaomi rose to the top spot in the overall smartphone market share last month, beating both Samsung and Apple in the second quarter, according to data by market researcher Canalys. “Samsung would have to find a solution to the stagnating smartphone market either by going for the high-end market to compete against Apple or by going aggressively in the low-end market to take down rivals like Xiaomi,” an industry official said.

(LEAD) finance minister-minimum wage,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/001/0010102595?sid=104,"Wed, 23 May 2018 16:36:00 +0900","(LEAD) Finance minister signals flexibility in meeting minimum wage goal (ATTN: UPDATES with finance minister's comments in paras 5-6, 9)    BUSAN, May 23 (Yonhap) -- South Korea's top economic policymaker said Wednesday that the government plans to take a flexible approach to achieving its goal for the minimum wage after carefully looking at the economic impact and reactions from local business owners.    The Moon Jae-in administration increased the minimum wage for all workers by 16.4 percent this year to 7,530 won (US$7) from 6,470 won in 2017, after setting a goal of raising hourly pay to at least 10,000 won by 2020.    The government said the hike is aimed at income-led economic expansion and a reduction of the pay gap between workers, but critics argue that the increase is actually hurting entry level jobs and weighing down the local economy.    ""I think there is a need for flexibility on reaching (the minimum wage's) target, taking into consideration the impact and responses from the market and business owners,"" Finance Minister Kim Dong-yeon told reporters in Busan. He was speaking on the sidelines of the 53rd annual meeting of the African Development Bank (AfDB) held in the southeastern port city.South Korea's Finance Minister Kim Dong-yeon speaks during an annual meeting of the African Development Bank (AfDB) held in Busan, 450 km southeast of Seoul, on May 23, 2018. (Yonhap)""The preliminary study results showed that the hike in the minimum wage didn’t have a statistically significant impact on the job market in the first quarter,"" Kim said. ""The minimum wage's effect on employment needs a long-term time series analysis.""   The policymaker said the government also should look into how much the local market and business owners can handle the new wage system.   When asked whether the government can attain its goal of 3 percent economic growth, Kim said the Korean economy is on the right course so far this year.   ""I think there are some economic signals that can be interpreted in various ways,"" Kim said. ""Looking at macroeconomic factors, however, the Korean economy is well on its way towards the government's 3 percent growth goal.""   Though South Korea's economy rebounded 1.1 percent in the first quarter from three months earlier and consumer sentiment improved over the period, Kim said the tepid job market, rising oil prices and uncertainties in emerging economies pose downside risks.   The Bank of Korea (BOK) held its growth economic forecast at 3 percent for 2018, the same as that of the International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).   But local think tanks and some global investment banks recently set their predictions slightly below 3 percent, as the supercycle for semiconductors, a key economic driver, was expected to near its peak in the latter half of this year.    The strengthening local currency and uncertainties in the oil market in the wake of revived U.S. sanctions on Iran were also cited as downside risks for Asia's fourth-largest economy, which heavily relies on exports.    ejkim@yna.co.kr(END)"

[Insight] 美 최대 곡물회사 매년 수백만달러 절감 어떻게,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/009/0002845711?sid=101,"Fri, 23 Nov 2012 13:44:00 +0900","■ 액센츄어와 함께하는 애널리틱스 활용전략③ 관행ㆍ직관의 오류 잡아내려면  ""더 이상 개선할 곳이 없는데…""미국의 사료 생산업체 A사는 최근 깊은 고민에 빠졌다. 역대 최악의 가뭄이 미국 전역을 덮치면서 옥수수 가격이 폭등했기 때문이다. 미국 시카고상품거래소(CBOT)에서 거래되는 옥수수 선물가격도 한 달 새 25%씩 뛰었다. 미국에서 사육 중인 소의 절반 이상은 옥수수 사료를 먹고 자란다. 국제 곡물가격 폭등이 회사 경영 상황을 위협하기 시작했다. 비상이 걸린 A사는 비용절감을 위한 대책팀을 즉각 꾸린 뒤 브레인스토밍과 다중 투표 등을 통한 전통적인 카이젠(KAIZEN) 활동에 돌입했다. 카이젠은 개선(改善)의 일본식 표현으로 생산설비나 도구를 개량하거나, 제조과정에서 비효율적인 요소를 찾아내 지속적으로 개선해나가는 경영기법이다. 카이젠 활동은 경영진의 지시에 따른 톱다운(top-down) 방식이 아닌 현장 직원들이 직접 체험하고 느낀 의견을 반영해 업무 효율을 높이는 바텀업(bottom-up) 방식을 따른다. 그러나 꾸준히 카이젠 활동에 나섰던 A사의 현장 직원들은 혼란에 빠지고 말았다. 관행과 직관에 익숙해져 개선할 곳을 더 이상 찾지 못하게 된 것이다.  A사는 액센츄어와 함께 제조과정에서 관행적으로 이뤄졌던 부분들을 하나하나 분석해보기로 했다.A사는 옥수수 사료 생산과정에서 매번 특수한 효소를 투입하곤 했다. 이 효소가 옥수수 사료의 단백질 함유량을 결정한다고 직관적으로 믿어왔기 때문이다. A사는 옥수수 가루의 단백질 함유량을 높이기 위해 이 효소의 투입량을 관행적으로 높여왔다. 효소의 투입량이 늘어날수록 옥수수 사료 제조비용도 덩달아 뛰었다.A사는 액센츄어의 애널리틱스(analytics) 기법을 통해 효소 투입량에 따른 옥수수 사료의 단백질 함유량에 대한 상관관계를 분석했다. 놀라운 결과가 나타났다. 사료를 위한 옥수수 가루 제조과정에서 효소의 투입량을 늘리더라도 단백질 함량이 늘어나지 않은 것이다. 심지어 효소를 가장 적게 넣더라도 단백질 함량이 줄지 않는 결과가 나타났다. A사는 애널리틱스를 활용한 결과를 토대로 효소 투입량을 과거 대비 최대 20% 줄일 수 있었다. 이 밖에 A사 카이젠팀은 제조공장의 원자로가 필요 이상으로 과열되고 있다는 사실도 자료 분석을 통해 밝혀냈다. A사는 이 같은 개선활동을 통해 연간 20만달러(약 2억2000만원)의 비용을 절감할 수 있었다.A사 현장 직원들은 그동안 생산 효율을 높이기 위해 카이젠 활동에 꾸준히 나섰지만 습관적으로 단백질 함유량이 높은 옥수수 가루를 만들기 위해 필요 이상의 효소를 투입해왔다. 애널리틱스를 활용한 객관적인 분석 자료가 없었다면 기존 관행에 사로잡혀 있던 현장 직원들을 설득하기가 쉽지 않았을 것이다.  기술 발전으로 인해 제조공정이 점점 복잡해지면서 기업들은 무엇부터 개선해 나가야 할지 깨닫지 못하는 난관에 빠지곤 한다.미국 최대 곡물 생산회사인 B사도 마찬가지다. B사는 앞서 언급한 A사와 반대로 곡물의 단백질 손실로 인해 매년 수백만 달러 손해를 입곤 했다. 높은 품질의 곡물을 생산하려면 효과적인 제조과정을 거쳐 최대한 많은 양의 단백질이 곡물에 남아 있도록 해야 한다. 그러나 최근 몇 달간은 상황이 악화돼 곡물의 단백질 손실 정도가 심각한 수준에 다다랐다.B사도 A사처럼 현장 대응팀을 꾸려 카이젠 활동에 나섰다. 그러나 복잡한 공정에 부딪혀 무엇부터 개선해야 할지 깨닫지 못했다. 곡물에 단백질 성분이 그대로 남아 있도록 하려면 탱크 밸브 파이프 등과 연계된 수많은 단위조작(unit operations) 등 복잡한 제조공정을 거쳐야 한다. 파트별로 한정된 지식만을 갖고 있는 현장 직원들이 단순한 가정을 토대로 곡물 제조공정을 수정한다면 오히려 단백질이 대거 손실되는 사태에 직면할 수도 있었다.액센츄어는 B사가 카이젠 활동을 통해 문제의 근본 원인을 찾을 수 있도록 도움을 줬다. 먼저 B사가 직면한 현 상황에 대한 기초 정보와 직원들의 업무 숙련도를 토대로 곡물 제조 전 과정을 상호관계도로 그려냈다. 이어 공정별 자료를 꼼꼼히 모은 뒤 애널리틱스 작업에 돌입했다. 액센츄어는 회귀분석 등 다양한 통계분석을 통해 단백질 손실을 빚어낸 공정이 어느 부분인지 파악하는 데 성공했다. 분석 결과는 평소 현장 직원들이 생각했던 원인 분석과는 큰 차이가 있었다.공정 역량 분석(process capability analysis)를 통해 제조과정에서 중요 역할을 하는 탱크 1개가 기준치의 절반 이상을 초과해 운영되고 있었다. 또한 송신기의 수치가 75% 수준에 다다르면 탱크가 기준치를 초과해 넘쳐 흐른다는 사실을 알아냈다. 시계열분석(time series analysis)을 통해 3개 장비 중 2개의 수치가 내려갈수록 실적이 부진해진다는 결과를 도출해냈다. 또한 현장 직원들이 일부 장비를 제대로 이용하지 못한 것이 단백질 손실을 야기했다는 사실도 알아냈다.

X세대 신세대인 젊음들은 지금과 별반 다르지 않았다. 락카페에 들락거리는 삼천포와 해태의 에피소드는 지금의 클럽문화와 비슷하다. 지하에서 4층까지 소위 ‘물’에 따라 차별도 있고 촌뜨기 출입금지도 여전했다. 하지만 그들은 아날로그 감성에 젖었다. 갑작스런 정전시간에 그들은 이종환의 ‘밤을 잊은 그대에게’를 들으며 낭만에 젖었고, 라디오 빌보드차트에 귀기울였다. 연세대 농구팀 ‘상민’오빠를 쫓아다니던 나정, 그리고 서태지와 아이들의 노래를 열창하며 홀로 댄스에 빠진 조윤진은 1994년 젊음의 상징이다. 우연히 방송사 대기실에서 만난 서태지(?)가 조윤진에게 나눠준 꼬깔콘은 아이돌 그 자체였다. 말 못하는 어머니가 보내온 간장게장을 먹었다가 대소동을 빚었다고 처음 발설한 자신의 과오를 사과하는 삼천포. 멋도 모르고 꼬깔콘을 먹었다가 되레 얻어맞는 장면은 그 당시 서태지 열풍이 어느 정도인지 다시 한번 보여준다. 장면마다 그들은 더 이상 학점의 노예도 아니요, 토익점수나 스펙 만들기에 올인하는 주인공들은 더더욱 아니었다. 갓 시골서 올라온 어리버리한 순진남 삼천포는 여름방학 기간에 대학생으로서 평소자신 스스로에게 약속한 자전거 전국일주를 다짐한다. 세상을 향한 젊은이의 꿈과 의지가 드러난다.<과거와 현재를 넘나드는 옴니버스 서술…매회 마다 퀴즈 풀 듯 호기심 자극>응답1994 제작진은 옴니버스 서술로 과거와 현재를 수시 넘나든다. 퀴즈를 던지듯 드라마 매회 마다 시청자의 궁금증을 끊임없이 자극한다. 나정의 남편 ‘김재준’은 쓰레기와 하숙생 중 과연 누구일까. 궁금증은 과거와 현재를 오가며 반전에 반전을 거듭한다. 연애와 결혼은 과연 다른 것일까. 시청자들은 2013년 자신의 준거틀을 통해 1994년을 들여다보고 있다.그렇다고 응답1994는 ‘거침없이 하이킥!’은 아니다. 드라마에 코미디, 예능을 단순히 얹어놓지 않았다. 오히려 옴니버스 단막드라마에 리얼버라이어티, 다큐를 조금씩 기술적으로 융합해 놓은 듯 하다. 1박2일과 개그콘서트, 다큐3일을 모두 버무려놓았다고나 할까. 익숙한 금토드라마인데도 새로운 장르를 보는 듯한 착각을 시청자들에게 던져준다. 요즘 말대로 창의적 융합의 사고가 만들어낸 작품이랄까? 늘상 그랬듯이 TV 앞에서 웃고 돌아서면 이내 허전함을 느끼는 드라마가 아니라 매회 잔잔한 공감을 남기는 이유는 무엇일까?<1박2일, 개그콘서트, 다큐3일 버무린 창의적 융합…20년의 사회변화상 ‘나의 모습’에 공감>아마도 시계열 분석(Time Series Analysis)을 하듯 1994년과 2013년의 시차를 두고 20년의 사회변화상을 드러내줌으로써 너무 낯설게 달라진 ‘나의 모습’을 발견하고 공감하게 하는 것이 아닐까 싶다. 김일성의 죽음과 기상관측사상 최고의 여름폭염, 서태지신드롬, 농구대잔치, 연고전, 차인표 등 스타신드롬을 재생해보면서 과거로 묻혀버린 기억을 되살려 결국 시청자를 타임머신의 주인공으로 만들어 버렸다.가정해체와 극심한 취업난, 원룸의 고독, 대화끊긴 식탁, 꿈을 잃은 젊음, 벌어지는 빈부격차, 극한 지역감정, IMF의 악몽, 88만원의 세대, 끝없는 편의점 알바......2013년 지금 우리는 ‘응답하라! 1994년’에 어떤 응답을 해야하는 것일까. 또 ‘응답하라 ! 1994’는 지금 우리에게 어떤 응답을 해올 것인가. 김경호 논설위원 겸 방송문화비평가국민일보 쿠키뉴스의 뉴스룸 트위터, 친절한 쿡기자 ☞ twitter.com/@kukinewsroom갓 구워낸 바삭바삭한 뉴스 ⓒ 국민일보 쿠키뉴스(www.kukinews.com), 무단전재 및 재배포금지[뉴스 미란다 원칙] 취재원과 독자에게는 국민일보 쿠키뉴스에 자유로이 접근할 권리와 반론·정정·추후 보도를 청구할 권리가 있습니다. 고충처리인(gochung@kmib.co.kr), 쿠키뉴스(kuki@kmib.co.kr)/전화:02-781-9711"
소득불평등 심한 국가에 학교폭력도 많다,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/001/0006352093?sid=102,"Thu, 04 Jul 2013 06:00:00 +0900"," 서울종로구 동숭동 마로니에공원에서 해성여자고등학교 학생들이 학교폭력 추방 댄스 플래시몹을 벌이고 있다. <<연합뉴스DB>>    (서울=연합뉴스) 서한기 기자 = 소득불평등 수준이 높은 국가일수록 학교폭력 경험률이 높다는 외국 연구결과가 나왔다.    보건의료 연구공동체 시민건강증진연구소(소장 김창엽 서울대 보건대학원 교수)는 4일 이런 내용을 담은 해외논문 '학교폭력과 살인, 소득불평등의 관계'를 공개했다.    이 논문은 프랭크 J. 엘가(Frank. J. Elgar) 박사 등이 국제 학술저널 '국제 공중보건'(International Journal of Public Health) 최근호에 실은 것. 연구팀은 1994년부터 2006년까지 세계보건기구(WHO)가 4년 단위로 벌인 '학령기 아동의 건강행동 연구'(the World Health Organisation-Health Behaviour in School-aged Children study) 자료를 활용해 결합 시계열 분석(pooled time series analysis) 방법으로 분석했다.     이를 통해 연구팀은 117개 국가의 소득불평등(지니계수)과 학교폭력 경험률의 관계를 살펴봤다. 학교폭력 경험은 가해 경험, 피해 경험, 가해와 피해 중복경험으로 측정했다.    연구결과를 보면, 먼저 소득불평등 수준을 사분위수(Quartile)로 나눠 평균 발생률을 비교한 결과, 소득불평등이 높으면 학교폭력 경험률이 높게 나타났다. 두 번째로 국가 단위의 소득불평등 수준이 개인의 학교폭력 경험률에 어떤 영향을 미치는 지 분석한 결과, 국가의 소득격차가 클수록 학교폭력 경험률이 증가했다.    이는 학교폭력 피해 경험, 가해 경험, 피해와 가해 중복 경험 비율 모두에서 같은 결과를 보였다.     즉, 소득불평등지수(지니계수)가 10% 악화하면 학교폭력 피해경험은 2.9%, 가해경험 2.5%, 가해와 피해 중복경험 4.0% 각각 상승하는 등 서로 연관이 있는 것으로 나타났다.    시민건강증진연구소는 ""이 연구결과는 학교폭력의 원인과 책임을 학생 개인과 폭력 게임이나 영상물이 넘치는 주변환경으로 돌리면서 인성교육 강화를 해결방안으로 내놓는 한국사회에 문제의식을 던진다""고 지적했다.    그러면서 정부를 비롯한 한국사회가 학교폭력을 부르는 근본 원인에 대해 진지하게 성찰하고, 더는 무의미한 정책들의 실험대상으로 청소년을 희생시키지 말아야 한다고 연구소는 주문했다.    학교폭력은 청소년의 건강수준을 보여주는 하나의 지표이다. 특히 국가단위 학교폭력 발생률은 그 국가 청소년의 정신적 건강수준과 밀접한 관련이 있다.    실제로 올해 청소년폭력예방재단이 발표한 전국학교폭력실태조사를 보면, 응답자의 12.0%가 지난 1년간 학교폭력 피해를 경험했다.이 중에서 44.7%는 학교폭력 피해로 말미암아 자살생각을 한 것으로 조사됐다.    한국방정환재단과 연대 사회발전연구소가 올해 보고한 우리나라 청소년의 주관적 행복지수를 보면, 경제협력개발기구(OECD) 23개국 중 최하위인 23위를 기록했다.    shg@yna.co.kr[이 시각 많이 본 기사]☞ 北, 판문점 연락채널 재가동…""개성공단 방북 허용""(종합2보)☞ 이동욱 ""사극, 너무 쉽게 생각했던 것 같아요""☞ <개성공단 사태 3개월만에 돌파구 열릴까>☞ -윔블던테니스- 조코비치·델 포트로, 4강서 격돌(종합)☞ 北 ""개성공단 기업인·관리위 방북 허용""(종합)▶ 연합뉴스 모바일앱 다운받기  ▶ 인터랙티브뉴스<저작권자(c)연합뉴스. 무단전재-재배포금지.>"
언론은 지금 쇠고기 촛불-6월 항쟁 '닮은꼴' 논쟁,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/047/0001942444?sid=102,"Tue, 03 Jun 2008 10:19:00 +0900","			[오마이뉴스 박주현 기자]공론장이 원활히 작동하지 않고 있다. 그래서일까. 이념적 스펙트럼의 간격도 넓고, 그 골도 깊다. 과학적인 방법인 '시계열분석(time series analysis)'을 굳이 도용하지 않더라도 드러난 현상만으로도 간극을 가늠해 볼 수 있다. 전통 미디어의 의제 공급 채널보다 더욱 빨라진 수용자들의 피드백에서 읽을 수 있다.      '쇠고기 촛불 인파'와 '이명박 정권 출범 100일'을 바라보는 관점이 여전히 다르다. 다양성은 존중돼야 마땅하다. 그러나 의제설정과 반응에 있어서 간극이 너무 벌어졌다. 신문의 사설에서 드러난 상관조정기능은 순기능보다 역기능 쪽에 무게 중심이 실려 있는 듯하다.민심의 분노를 바라본 신문 사설의 온도차가 심하다. '임계치냐, 비임계치냐'를 놓고 대립하는 모습은 단적인 경우다. 대중의 분노를 이념적 관점에서 대립관계를 보이고 있는 서울지역 신문들과 냉정한 이성을 되찾고자 하는 지역신문의 사설로 대비된다. 이명박 정부 출범 100일을 하루 앞둔 2일자 각 신문 사설에서 묻어났다. 서울은 크게 두 부류의 색채다. <경향신문>과 <한겨레>는 서울시청 앞 광장에 모인 10만여 시민을 비롯해 전국 100여 곳에서 동시다발적으로 쏟아져 나온 '쇠고기 촛불 인파'를 이명박 정부에 대한 국민적 분노와 절망을 극명하게 보여준 것이라고 해석했다.경향, 한겨레 ""4·19, 6월 항쟁과 다를 바 없다""무늬만 다를 뿐, 48년 전 4·19와 21년 전 6월 항쟁과 다를 바 없다고 비유했다. <경향>은 이날 '이명박 대통령은 정녕 파국을 바라는가'에서 최근의 '쇠고기 항쟁'을 ""거대하고 도도한 국민적 외침을 보고 있노라면 21년 전 전두환 군사독재정권을 굴복시켰던 6월 항쟁의 모습이 떠오르기도 한다""고 했다.사설은 6월 항쟁과 비슷하지만 다른 점도 적지 않다고 했다. 그 첫 번째 이유다. ""주권자인 국민이 군사독재정권 또는 독재의 모습을 띠어가는 정권에 대해 항거했다는 점에서는 맥락을 같이 한다""는 것. 그러나 ""6월 항쟁이 군부독재 타도와 대통령 직선제 쟁취라는 정치적 민주화에 대한 요구였다면, 지금의 촛불 항쟁은 미국산 쇠고기 수입 반대 또는 재협상 촉구라는 생활밀착형 현안에서 출발해 대통령 퇴진 요구 등으로 확산됐다는 점에서 차이가 있다""고 진단했다. 무엇보다 결정적인 차이는 항쟁의 주체가 다르다는 것이다. 그럼에도 ""대통령이 '양초 자금 구입처' 운운으로 드러난 현재의 인식과 자세를 근본적으로 바꾸지 않는 한 이 모든 묘방과 수습책은 헛된 노력에 그칠 것""이라고 못 박았다.<한겨레>도 이날 사설 '이명박 대통령은 국민을 적으로 돌리려는가'에서 촛불집회로 드러난 민심의 분노 수위를 이보다 더욱 높게 평가했다. 그 수위가 거의 임계치를 향해 치닫고 있다고 한 이 사설은 ""48년 전 4·19를 떠올리게 한다. 갈수록 뜨거워지고, 더 커지는 양상이다""고 전했다.촛불집회가 청와대로 향한 것은 심각한 사태라고 보았다. 이 사설은 그러면서 ""지금 이명박 정부는 그런 국민을 적으로 돌리려 하고 있다""며 ""그 결과는 참담할 것""이라고 경고했다. ""4·19나 6월 항쟁과 달리, 지금은 젊은 엄마와 10대 등 '범국민'이 앞장섰다""는 이 사설은  그 뒤를 잇는 주체들에 주목했다. 사설은 말미에서 사태를 수습하는 길은 복잡하지 않다고 했다. 즉, 대통령이 국민에게 항복하면 된다는 것이다. ""장관이나 참모 몇 사람 바꾸고 말뿐인 다짐을 한다고 해결될 일이 아니고 대통령 스스로 국민의 목소리에 귀를 기울이는 쪽으로 바뀐 모습을 보여줘야 한다""고 해법을 제시한 이 사설은 결국 ""쇠고기 수입 장관 고시를 철회하고 재협상을 하겠다고 밝히는 것이 그 첫걸음""이라고 진단했다. 조선, 중앙, 동아가 걱정하는 주체는 진정 누구인가?’이들 두 신문과는 달리 친 이명박 정권의 편에 서왔던 <조선><동아><중앙>의 보수신문 보도태도는 기류를 달리 해석했다. <조선>은 이날 사설 '청와대 코앞에 밀어닥친 시위대를 보며'에서 양비론적 시각에서 비판했다.  ""촛불집회 자체는 존중받아야 하지만 정부가 불법 부정을 저지른 것도 아닌데 청와대 코앞 도로를 불법으로 점거하고 밤새도록 시위를 하는 것은 지나친 일""이라며 시민들을 나무랬다. 그러면서 사설은 시위대에 아기를 태운 유모차를 끌고 나온 사람, 장애인도 섞여 있어 위험천만하다고 우려를 표시한 뒤 따끔하게 질책했다. ""이제 취임한 지 석 달이 겨우 지난 대통령을 향해 '물러가라'고 하는 것이나 지금 시대에 '독재 타도'를 외치는 것도 순수하다고 보기는 어렵다""고 참가 시민들을 나무랐다. 그러더니 시위진압에 경찰특공대를 동원한 경찰도 문제가 있다고 뜬금없는 쪽으로 화살을 돌렸다. 말미에선 정부에까지 책임을 물었다. ""지금 정부의 대응은 불은 산에 번지는데 물은 개천에 뿌리는 격""이라며 ""이번 사태를 가라앉힐 수 있는 방법은 물대포가 아니라 국민의 마음을 풀어주는 것""이라고 결론을 던졌다. 시민도, 정부도 모두 잘못했다는 양비론적 상관조정기능에선 순기능보다 역기능이 더 짙게 묻어났다.      ▲ '6월 민주항쟁 아니다?' <동아일보> 2일자 사설 			   ⓒ 동아일보      <동아>는 대놓고 6월 항쟁은 아니라고 <경향>과 <한겨레>가 박은 못을 정면으로 부정했다. 이날 사설 '쇠고기 촛불시위는 '6월 민주항쟁'이 아니다'에서다. ""6월 민주항쟁은 군사반란과 광주 유혈진압을 통해 집권한 전두환 정권의 독재 연장 음모를 막기 위해 전 국민이 함께 일어난 궐기였다""는 이 사설은 ""항쟁의 역사적 의의와 젊은 학생들의 희생을 생각한다면 미국산 쇠고기의 위생검역 조건 협상에서 촉발된 촛불시위를 결코 동렬에 놓을 수 없다""고 했다. ""그것은 민주항쟁에 참여한 학생과 시민들을 모욕하는 것이나 마찬가지""라고 덧붙인 사설 은 ""쇠고기 촛불시위를 6월 민주항쟁으로 몰아가고 싶은 세력이 있다면 국민 건강을 위협해 정치적 목적을 이루려는 집단이라고 의심할 수밖에 없다""고까지 했다. 그동안 <경찰 '확성기 지휘부' 수사 방침> <청, ""촛불문화제 인정, 가두시위는 엄단""> <쇠고기 무관한 ""공기업 민영화 반대"" 구호 외치기도> 등의 기사에서 청와대와 경찰의 입장을 그대로 전달하며 '촛불문화제'에 대한 불법성을 강조해 온 신문이다. 이 정부에 대한 일편단심을 이날 사설에서도 변치 않고 확인 시켜 주었다.  <중앙>은 이날 사설 '취임 100일에 새 출발을 하려면'에서 전임 대통령들의 사례를 들었다. 그러면서 은근슬쩍 용기를 불어 넣어 주려는 의도가 묻어났다. ""100일의 시행착오에서 가르침을 얻어 자신과 정권을 쇄신하면 이 대통령은 반전(反轉)의 동력을 얻을 수 있다""는 사설은 ""곧 발표될 국정쇄신책은 새 출발의 전환점이어야 한다""고 격려와 충고, 주문들을 담았다.""대통령은 허물은 적고 능력이 많은 프로를 널리 골라 새 분위기에서 새로운 시스템을 가다듬어야 한다""며 인적쇄신에 강한 무게를 두었다. 그러나 '촛불'이 보수신문에 대한 압박과 규탄으로 번지고 있는 이는 뭘까. <조선><중앙><동아>등 보수신문 구독거부운동은 물론 이 신문에 광고를 게재한 광고주 압박 운동으로까지 확대되고 있다. 조갑제닷컴 ""이명박, 싸우지 않으면 망한다""      ▲ ""싸우지 않으면 그냥 망한다?"" <조갑제 닷컴> 화면 캡쳐 			   ⓒ 조갑제 닷컴      불매운동에 그치지 않고 시민과 주부들이 직접 광고주에게 항의전화를 하는 등 적극적인 움직임을 보이고 있는 것에 대해 언론학자들은 매우 이례적인 피드백 또는 수용자들의 전략적·적극적 대응으로 보고 있다.그럼에도 대표적 보수논객인 조갑제씨는 더 노골적이다. 그가 운영하는 인터넷 사이트에 '싸우지 않으면 그냥 망한다. 존망위기 이명박의 선택' '광우병 관련 10개 괴담 중 셋이 MBC발' 등의 글에서 보수세력의 총궐기를 연일 촉구하고 있다. 그는 ""이명박 정부도 KBS, MBC에 못지않은 홍보기능을 갖고 있는데도 비겁함과 무사안일함에 빠져 그 기능을 제대로 쓰지 않아 새빨간 거짓말이 진실로 둔갑하도록 방치했다""며 ""이 사태는 이 대통령의 완전한 자업자득""이라고 흥분했다. ""거짓말 사령부 KBS, MBC에 대해서 한 마디 반격을 하지 않았다""는 것이다. 그는 ""대처나 레이건이 이런 꼴을 당했다면 그들은 매일 몇 차례씩 기자회견을 하면서 두 방송을 말로 죽였을 것""이라며 제대로 대응하지 못한 국무총리, 청와대 대변인과 문화부 장관 등을 질타했다. 한나라당도 그는 ""식물인간화 되어 버렸다""고 비난했다. 위기에 빠졌을 때 대통령을 도와주지 못했다는 것이다.그러면서 그는 해법을 제시했다. 대통령만이 이 사태를 해결할 수 있다는 것이다. ""약 200만 명의 인력을 지휘하고, 약 260조원의 예산을 쓰는 그가 선동세력의 거짓말에 무릎을 꿇는 타협-퇴각 노선을 수정하지 않는다면 그의 마지막 지지층인 골수보수층이 이탈하거나 이들이 먼저 대통령 퇴진을 요구하게 될 것""이라며 ""대통령이 공분심에 몸을 떨면서 진실과 헌법에 기초하여 국가공권력을 엄정하게 행사한다면 그의 지지율은 일주일 안으로 50%까지 오를 것""이라고 했다. 과연 그럴까.그의 해법제시에는 이 나라 주인인 국민은 안중에도 없는 듯했다. 촛불 든 시민들을 '거짓말쟁이'이라고 표현한 그의 주장이 오히려 해괴하고 치졸하다. 전국 주요 일간신문 사설들의 이를 반증한다. 지역에 따라 입장이 다소 다르긴 하지만 보편타당한 논거들이다.

10년 동안 2131명 ‘사람 잡은 폭염’,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/037/0000002482?sid=102,"Wed, 16 May 2007 09:18:00 +0900","3월29일 기상연구소가 인제대와 공동으로 개최한 ‘생명기상합동워크숍’.우리 몸이 더위에 어떻게 반응하는지는 앞 기사에서 잘 살펴봤을 것이다. 그런데 폭염으로 숨진 개인의 사망원인이 과연 더위 때문이었는지는 사망 당시 직장(直腸)의 체온을 측정해보면 알 수 있다. 그러나 사망원인을 판정할 때 직장의 체온을 측정하는 것은 관례가 아니므로 폭염으로 인한 사망으로 기록되는 경우는 매우 드물다. 따라서 폭염이 직접적인 원인이 되어 사망한 경우를 확인하기는 쉽지 않다. 특정 지역이나 인구집단에서 폭염으로 평상시보다 초과 발생한 사망이 얼마나 되는지 추정하기 위해서는 통계학적인 연구방법을 활용한다. 이른바 시계열분석(time series analysis)의 일종인 일반화 부가모형(GAM)이 주로 적용되는데, 이 방법은 세계적으로 잘 정립돼 있다. 2003년 유럽을 강타한 폭염으로 프랑스 9개 도시에서 1만5000여 명이 사망했다거나 1994년 일본 오사카에서 1400여 명이 사망했다는 등의 보도도 이 방법을 통해 추정한 결과다.필자는 서울에서 여름철 폭염으로 사망한 사람이 얼마인지를 추정하기 위해 먼저 서울의 여름철 기온과 사망률의 관계를 알아봤다. 온대지방에 있는 도시의 경우 기온이 온난한 봄과 가을에 사망자가 적고 겨울과 여름에 늘어나는 것이 일반적이다.기상재해로 인한 사망·실종자 수보다 많다 2051년 서울에서만 폭염으로 640명이 초과 사망할 것으로 추정된다. 서울은 1994년부터 2003년까지 10년 동안 6월부터 8월 말까지 매일 평균기온과 (사고사를 제외한) 사망자 수의 관계를 알아본 결과, 하루 평균기온이 28.1℃를 넘어서면 사망자가 급격히 늘어나는 것으로 관찰됐다. 평균기온이 28.1℃(이를 역치온도라 한다)에서 1℃씩 증가하면서 사망률은 평상시보다 9.6%씩 증가했다. 이는 평상시 서울에서 하루 사망자가 100명이라면 평균기온이 28.1℃와 29.1℃ 사이인 날에는 108명에서 111명까지 사망했음을 뜻한다. 65세 노인의 경우 더 낮은 온도에서부터 더 큰 비율로 사망자가 증가했다.일평균 기온이 역치온도 이상인 날들의 평균기온을 구하고 여기에 도출된 통계모형을 적용하면, 평상시보다 초과로 발생한 사망자 수를 계산할 수 있다. 최근 가장 무더웠던 여름으로 기억되는 1994년 서울에서 평균기온이 28.1℃ 이상인 날은 여름 석 달 동안 33일이었는데, 이때 초과로 발생한 사망자 수는 738명으로 추정됐다. 같은 방식으로 1994년부터 2003년까지 서울 대구 인천 광주에서 발생한 초과사망자 수를 추정한 결과 94년 1083명, 95년 144명 등 모두 2131명이었다. 같은 기간 전국에서 기상재해로 사망 또는 실종한 것으로 집계된 사람은 1367명이었다(표1 참조). 이는 홍수나 태풍으로 인한 사망처럼 인과관계가 그 자리에서 밝혀지지 않기 때문에 제대로 알 수 없었지만 이 정도 규모라면 폭염도 기상재해의 일종이라 할 만하다. 게다가 폭염은 짧은 기간에 나타나기 때문에 피해 발생의 시급성은 더욱 심각하다.예년의 서울지역 여름철 평균기온은 22.6~25.6℃(1994년의 26.3℃는 제외)였다. 하지만 지금처럼 화석연료를 계속 사용한다면 지구온난화가 가속화되고, 그 결과 2032년 이후 여름철 평균기온은 대부분 26℃를 넘을 것으로 기상청은 전망했다.1995년부터 2003년까지 여름철 일평균 기온이 28.1℃를 웃돈 날은 많아야 16일을 넘지 않았다. 그러나 2032년 이후의 예측 결과로는 28.1℃를 넘는 날수가 대부분의 경우 20일 이상인 것으로 나타났다. 이에 근거해 필자는 서울지역의 기온과 사망자 발생의 관계함수에 미래의 여름철 기온 전망자료를 적용, 미래의 초과사망 위험을 추정했다(단, 2032년 이후에도 고온이 사망에 미치는 영향의 정도가 지금과 다르지 않고 2032~51년의 일평균 사망자 수가 2003년과 동일하며 2032~51년의 인구구성비가 2001년 1월1일과 동일하다는 점을 가정했다).연구 결과 1994년처럼 극심한 결과를 보이는 해는 예측되지 않았으나 연구대상 기간 주기적으로 300명 이상의 초과사망을 내는 더운 여름이 예측됐다. 또한 해마다 100명 이상씩 피해가 지속될 것으로 예측됐다. 이러한 결과가 시사하는 것은 여름철 고온으로 인한 초과사망 문제가 어쩌다 한 번 일어나는 ‘사건’이 아니라 앞으로 거의 매년 겪게 될 ‘재해’가 될 것이라는 우울한 전망이다.박정임 한국환경정책평가연구원 책임연구원 jeongim@kei.re.kr "

"[NEWS ANALYSIS] As foreigners rush back, market does an about-face",https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/640/0000006433?sid=101,"Sat, 28 Nov 2020 07:01:00 +0900","  The final Kospi and dollar prices against the won are displayed on the screens of a dealing room in Hana Bank in Jung District, central Seoul, on Friday. The benchmark Kospi closed at 2,633.45 on Friday, up 7.54 points, or 0.29 percent, from the previous day. [YONHAP]    Korea stocks have hit a series of new highs in recent days as foreign investors return to the market on hopes that a Covid-19 vaccine will put an end to the pandemic and a new U.S. administration will help Korean and Chinese exporters.     After the main index on Nov. 23 broke the 2,600-point mark for the first time, it has been trending upward — largely led by foreign investors. In November alone, foreign investors purchased a net 7.1 trillion won ($6.4 billion) of shares as of the 24th of the month. During the same period, retail investors offloaded 5.96 trillion won while institutions sold 980 billion won.       Korea stocks are now up roughly 80 percent from the year's low, which was hit on March 19 when the index touched 1,457.64. In March alone, foreign investors offloaded roughly 12 trillion won of shares — largely due to the uncertainties amid the Covid-19 pandemic.     Improved sentiment on the part of foreign investors is the major reason why the market has been showing quick signs of recovery.       “In August and September of the year, foreign investors showed a passive attitude toward the market due to the uncertainties in the overall economy,” said Cho Byung-hyun, a market analyst at Yuanta Securities. “However, with the decreasing uncertainties after the U.S. presidential election and the hopes of Covid-19 vaccine development, foreigners have been returning to the local market faster than ever before.”     Semiconductor makers and battery firms were particularly popular.     As of Nov. 24, foreigners bought 2.44 trillion won of Samsung Electronics’ shares. The company’s stock price jumped 19.6 percent in November alone.     During the period, foreigners also bought 1.34 trillion won of LG Chem’s shares followed by SK hynix, at 980 billion won.     The anticipations for large cap earnings next year seem to have driven the gain as the Covid-19 outbreak will likely keep boosting demand for chips.         Experts say the increase of the Kospi index is expected to continue at least for the rest of the year and possibly till the first half of next year.     On Nov. 25, researchers at Korea Capital Market Institute (KCMI) held a briefing on the prospect of next year's economy and stock market at the Financial Investment Center in Yeouido, western Seoul.     The researchers said the Kospi will continue showing an upward trend following next year, most likely to reach the 2,700 to 2,900 point by the end of the next year.     According to Jang Geun-hyuk, a macro-financial analyst at KCMI, more overseas investment, as well as young local retail investors, are expected to enter the stock market as the country’s economy recovers.     Brokerage houses in Korea agree on the forecast.     Heungkuk Securities estimates the Kospi would reach 3,000 point next year, while Hana Financial Investment and SK Securities predicted that it would reach 2,900. NH Investment & Securities, Yuanta Securities and Meritz Securities are all calling 2,800, while KB Securities and KTB Investment & Securities are both calling 2,750. Some brokerages, such as DB Financial Investment and Kiwoom Securities, said it would remain around the 2,600 mark.     The fast growth also raises some concern that a bubble is forming — but local analysts say the return of foreigners alone will support the index.     “It’s true that some items are priced higher than they should be, but considering the beginning of the year, when lots of foreigners offloaded their shares, there is still room for them to return,"" said Park Soo-min, an analyst at Shinyoung Securities. ""We expect the upward trend is likely to continue at least until the end of the year.""     More-than-enough liquidity in the market and hopes for improvement of the export figure are main forces boosting shares.     “I think it is not the time we should consider the valuation woes,” said Kang Hyun-jeong, an anylyst at Kyobo Securities. “Under the Joe Biden administration, the global economy can be normalized. With that, we can anticipate an improvement on international trade, as well as export figures, which can eventually lift the Kospi.”     “The near-zero interest rate is another driving force. As people who can't find the alternatives jump into the stock market, the main index is likely to rise further.”     The benchmark Kospi closed at 2,633.45 on Friday, up 7.54 points, or 0.29 percent, from the previous day.     Foreigners extended their buying spree for a 17th straight session — the longest since the 19-session streak that ended in August 2016 — purchasing a net 7.7 billion won, while retail investors bought a net 19.6 billion won. Institutions offloaded a net 28 billion won.     In Seoul, large-cap stocks closed higher on Friday.     Samsung Electronics added 0.29 percent to a fresh record of 68,200 won, while chipmaker SK hynix lost 0.6 percent to 98,800 won.       Rechargeable battery maker Samsung SDI added 0.18 percent to 551,000 won, while chemical firm LG Chem shed 0.74 percent to 810,000 won.     Hyundai Motor, the country's largest carmaker, rose 1.12 percent to 181,000 won, while steelmaker Posco lost 1.24 percent to 239,500 won.     Untact-themed stocks, such as Naver and Kakao, are losing steam. Naver declined 0.35 percent to 284,500 won, and its rival Kakao lost 0.27 percent to 373,000 won.     The Kosdaq index closed at 885.56, up 11.03 points, or 1.26 percent.       BY CHEA SARAH   [chea.sarah@joongang.co.kr] "

This unprecedented new addition loads a batch of AI-powered deep learning algorithms into each unit, boasting stunning performance and cost-effective pricing.Hikvision Dedicated DeepinViewEnhanced AI capabilitiesOver the last few years, artificial intelligence (AI) has been applied in many ways in security markets. As technology advances, AI chipset performance has improved to enable massive computing power using various algorithms and contributing to multi-intelligence functionality and higher accuracy. The new Dedicated DeepinView Cameras are an example of these advances, incorporating several AI-powered deep learning algorithms in one unit. What's more, these algorithms can be switched essentially putting 5 or 6 unique cameras in one housing.""Embedding switchable algorithms is a significant step for Hikvision to take in its AI product development. In a world of ever-changing technologies and functionalities, this approach creates great value for end users to try new technologies to ensure security, as well as to implement business intelligence and other applications,"" says Frank Zhang, President of the International Product and Solution Center at Hikvision. ""The benefits of our new offerings are numerous including reduced costs, improved efficiency, and speedy and effective incident response.""Switchable algorithmsThe Dedicated DeepinView cameras combine two product categories - the first is vehicle analysis where cameras combine automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) with vehicle attribute recognition. Attributes include the vehicle's make, color, and direction of movement. Typical uses include installation at checkpoints of city streets and at entrances & exits of buildings or industrial parks.  Models in the second category boast six switchable deep learning algorithms in one camera housing, including facial recognition, face counting, hard hat detection, perimeter protection, queue management, and multiple-target-type detection (detecting multiple targets and multiple types of targets at once). Accordingly, users can simply enable an algorithm manually for dedicated use, then later switch the algorithm as needed.Here is one example: hard hat detection. This algorithm can be used on construction sites to ensure safety and compliance. Specially-equipped DeepinView cameras can precisely distinguish a worker on the site wearing a hard hat from those without, and automatically deliver alerts when the hard hat violation is detected.Another example: in a retail setting, a face-counting function can be enabled to precisely count customers entering and leaving the store. Repeat customers and store staff can be automatically excluded in the process, helping store managers count new customers with precision.Flexibility among algorithms enables users to also switch among:Perimeter protection - to monitor outdoor areas needing security and deliver accurate alarms upon intrusions.Facial recognition - to grant authorized access to restricted areas in various organizations, such as school laboratories, archive rooms, and hospital pharmacies.Queue management - to better understand customer wait times, optimize staff levels, and enhance customer experience. HD clarity, day and nightEquipped with Hikvision's DarkFighter and LightFighter technologies, these cameras capture vivid and color images in extremely low-light environments or in scenes with strong backlighting where color and brightness balance is extremely difficult. Smooth Streaming mode further ensures a high-quality live feed.The Dedicated DeepinView Cameras are available in 2, 4, 8, and 12 MP resolutions for customers to choose from.More practical and deployable featuresFurthermore, metadata is supported to allow third-party platforms to receive data from Hikvision cameras for real-time video analysis or recorded into footage archives to enable rapid searching forensic evidence.Finally, these camera models also offer Vibration Detection for outdoor use, which detects and notifies users of vandalism.Find out moreTo find out more about the new Hikvision Dedicated DeepinView cameras, please visit https://www.hikvision.com/en/products/IP-Products/Network-Cameras/DeepinView-Series/, keywords: 7 series.###About Hikvision    Hikvision is an IoT solution provider with video as its core competency.

[Health-tech Korea] Matching curiosity with purpose in DNA analysis,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000199926?sid=104,"Thu, 03 May 2018 17:15:00 +0900","Brian Kang, founder and CEO of Genoplan (Park Hyun-koo/The Korea Herald)The Korea Herald is publishing a series of articles highlighting South Korea’s promising startups in the emerging sectors of digital health care and next-generation medical devices. This is the 18th installment. -- Ed.As genome sequencing costs have drastically dropped in the past few years, numerous startups have begun offering direct-to-consumer DNA analysis services through which individuals can learn about their genes and related health markers with a saliva sample.Finding out about one’s genetic makeup certainly sounds interesting. But to get more people on board, there must be good reasons for why someone should receive a DNA analysis.A South Korean health technology startup has set out to address this question of “so what?” that has often undermined the utility aspect of personalized DNA analyses, with a service model of presenting concrete benefits and a clear-cut action plan to the end-user.Genoplan was founded in 2014 by 37-year-old CEO Brian Kang, a US-trained medical sciences expert and a former employee at the Samsung Genome Institute. He set out to provide affordable, fast and practical DNA testing service.Connecting through genes So, how does it work? Genoplan collects a saliva sample from individual customers and analyzes the DNA contained in it. The results can be viewed online within around five days, which is faster than competing services that typically take 4-6 weeks to deliver results.On top of speed, the Korean startup provides what to do with their genetic makeup once they learn it.“We don’t stop at just informing people about their genotype and phenotype, but go on to connect consumers with appropriate products and service that best complement their unique genetic dispositions,” Kang said in a recent interview with The Korea Herald. To achieve this, Genoplan has adopted a business-to-business-to-consumer, or B2B2C business model. Genoplan sells its saliva collection kits and analytic solutions directly to partnered companies, instead of directly selling its services to lay consumers, Jang said. The services are sold as a package to partners at 30,000 won ($28) to 90,000 won per unit.Then the partner firms are the ones that offer the DNA testing kits to consumers, usually in a bundle with their own products.Genoplan currently has 12 such partners, including Dr. PNT, a personalized dietary supplements brand under GC Wellbeing, cosmetics brand Dr. G, gene-based lunchbox maker Stay Jungle and ING Life Insurance Korea. Its partners’ customers send their saliva kits to Genoplan’s lab, where the DNA is extracted and checked for certain markers. For a health supplements brand, this could include genes associated with a person’s blood glucose levels, caffeine metabolic rate or abdominal obesity.A personalized cosmetics brand, on the other hand, would request Genoplan to look into genes related to moisture retention, ability of sebum control, propensity to acne, photoaging and so on.Consumers can view the results on Genoplan’s website and be directed to a given brand’s related products and services that are best suited to their unique genetic predispositions. Internal surveys have shown that many customers have found the data useful and end up purchasing the recommended products, the CEO said.“I believe we’re the only company worldwide which has managed to create a seamless business-to-business-to-consumer DNA analysis service model,” he added.As of now, Genoplan can check for 100-200 different types of genetic health indicators. But more items can be easily added to accommodate new partner demands, the CEO said. As its database grows, the startup also hopes to build a networking platform where people with similar phenotypes can share and recommend medications or supplements that worked well for them. Time to go global Though Genoplan’s business is local for now, going global is close on the agenda. The startup is in talks with local partners to bring its business model to Japan this year. And next year, it hopes to branch out to other countries in Asia, Kang said. Eventually, the Korean health-tech startup wants to venture into the medical diagnostics segment. In the future, the firm hopes to start providing DNA-based liquid biopsy services to hospitals.Right now, many cancer patients undergo tissue biopsies -- in which doctors harvest a tissue sample to check if the cancerous tumor has been fully removed. But sometimes tissue biopsies cannot be performed on certain patients due to the likelihood of complications. This process could be replaced with a liquid biopsy -- examining samples of intravenous fluids like blood or urine -- to detect signs of circulating tumor DNA, Kang said. Based on this information, doctors could find out whether or not the cancer has relapsed. “Our vision is to bring the benefits of genetic information to everyone. To do this, we continue to work on finding out how genetic information can be best used to benefit people,” Kang said.

[Robert Sands] James Church’s Inspector O series and negotiating with N...,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000205232?sid=004,"Mon, 29 Oct 2018 17:15:00 +0900","			Upon arrival at my hotel in Hong Kong after a few weeks in Shenzhen, China, I raced to a pub. While reading John le Carre’s “The Honourable Schoolboy” and waiting on some fish and chips, an Englishman politely took the seat beside me. After some halting pleasantries, I realized he worked for a company to which I had just caused considerable (though necessary) trouble in my role as a corporate lawyer. We laughed and, to his credit, he remained as polite after learning that fact as he was before it. Yes, I wondered if it was truly the coincidence that it seemed to be -- but it was just that, a coincidence. As a heavy user of spy and mystery fiction, though, I have periodically revisited that night to consider the darker possibilities that such an incident might have engendered; and I thought again of that night recently while rereading “A Corpse in the Koryo” by James Church, which is about spies and lies and North Korea. For those working to divine North Korea’s strategy and tactics in its seemingly absurdist-play dealings with the rest of the world, fiction should serve as one resource among many. In negotiations, North Korea tends to use the same game plan that it has historically relied on because it works. You probably don’t need me to rehash its methods, but I do think we need to be reminded from time to time that North Korea is a real place with real people -- people with pride, emotions and a sense of history. There are plenty of quotes that observe how fiction negotiates terrain that other texts cannot, so we might as well settle upon an epigram from an absurdist -- Camus wrote that fiction “is the lie through which we tell the truth.” Through artifice, Church’s Inspector O series grants the reader access to the multilayered, real North Korea.The series is set in both North Korea and China’s Jilin Province (the region of Northeast China that borders North Korea and that is home to many ethnic Koreans), and Inspector O is used to lies, and gray, and weary and wary intrigue. Church (the pseudonym of a former “Western intelligence officer”) knows North Korea, and he’s a gifted writer who presents that land in crisp, unhurried prose and who breathes life into a believable, worldly Pyongyang inspector in North Korea’s Ministry of People’s Security. O is a well-traveled anthropologist of North Korea who wants no advice from foreigners. Nietszche said, “You must not want to see everything.” O doesn’t want to but he does.After le Carre established the contours of serious contemporary spy fiction, writers aspiring to a similar status seem to fear both coherence and any discernible action. In presenting a believable North Korea, Church must trade in a bit of the “nothing is as it seems” milieu; but, luckily for the reader, O is too blunt and obstinate for his own good (he refuses to habitually wear the obligatory pin that demonstrates a zealous fealty to the Kim dynasty), which makes it easier to follow the plots and attendant satellite plots of the novels. Church serves up good mysteries that make as much sense at the end as one could hope for, but the characters and setting are what render the series a potentially transformative tool.As the Trump, Moon and Xi governments grapple in their varying ways with North Korea, reading about Inspector O could serve as a medicinal corrective to much of the media’s and the government’s recurring diagnosis that North Korea is irrational and unknowable. The Inspector O books are in no way a defense of North Korea but, rather, include (among other things) a learned indictment grounded in experience, bleakness and acuity. So the series could serve as one causeway to a more knowing and useful engagement of North Korea. Inspector O is savvy and steely and imbued with a buried sadness beyond explication and, ultimately, exiled. He is, it would seem, a North Korean that Church has met. He is prickly, kind, obstinate, proud, odd, unkind, funny and ready to get the job done. He’s real.Church provides elegant reminders throughout the series that North Korea is an heir to an ancient civilization. For example, Church cites Korean poetry from the 14th century, and Inspector O’s relationship with and respect for wood seems informed by Shamanism. North Korea can make its connection to thousands of years of history easy to forget, but the state’s juche (“self-reliance”) philosophy and dystopian tactics derive at least in part from and are reactions to the grievances of Korean history -- a modern example being Japan’s colonization of the peninsula, which lasted until the end of World War II. For those negotiating with or trying to grasp the North Koreans, Church’s novels could serve as a means to step back and look past the zany belligerence.In any negotiation, knowing what the other party wants and why should be a baseline element for any preparation thereof. Approaching North Korea as so sui generis as to belie the utility of learning may be temporarily satisfying but is ultimately self-defeating. Be prepared. There are many great books and essays that could help: South Korean universities, such as Yonsei, and think tanks offer some of the best analysis on North Korea; “The Two Koreas” by Don Oberdorfer is also a great primer; other worthwhile entries include “A Most Enterprising Country” by Justin Hastings and the various websites dedicated to North Korean studies, such as NK News. Of course, there are also many memoirs by and treatments of defectors, many of whom spent time in North Korean prison camps. The well-crafted tales of Inspector O’s pursuits should be added to the syllabus. Robert SandsRobert Sands is a global transportation lawyer based in the United States. -- Ed.[코리아헤럴드] [K-POP HERALD] [페이스북] <ⓒKoreaHerald(www.koreaherald.com)무단전재 및 재배포 금지>		"
(News Focus) baseball-analysis,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/001/0008772977?sid=104,"Mon, 24 Oct 2016 09:06:00 +0900","(News Focus) Third time is charm for hitters, not for pitchers, in baseball postseasonBy Yoo Jee-ho   SEOUL, Oct. 24 (Yonhap) -- Two games into the second round playoff series in the Korea Baseball Organization (KBO), the third time has been the charm for hitters but not so much for starting pitchers.   The NC Dinos and the LG Twins have combined for three home runs, and all three of them came with the hitters facing the starters for the third time in the game.   In Friday's Game 1, LG's cleanup Luis Jimenez gave his club a 1-0 lead with a solo blast off NC starter Eric Hacker in the seventh inning.   In the eighth, No. 8 hitter Chung Sang-ho came to the plate for the third time against Hacker, and he too hit a solo shot for a 2-0 lead.   Those two long balls would have stood as the difference, if the Dinos hadn't rallied with three runs in the bottom of the ninth for the 3-2 walk-off win.   A home run did decide NC's 2-0 victory in Game 2 on Saturday, and it also came in the seventh inning, with No. 6 hitter Park Sok-min facing LG starter David Huff for the third time.   Park turned on an inside fastball for the decisive two-run homer, as the Dinos went up two games to none in the best-of-five series.   Previous statistical research and analysis suggest these events may not be merely coincidental, though they certainly seem like it.   In his 2013 article on BaseballProspectus.com, a website devoted to statistical analysis of baseball, Mitchel Litchman wrote pitchers tend to get hit more often each additional time they face the opposing lineup, not just because of fatigue but because of familiarity. In sum, the more a batter sees a pitcher's repertoire, the more likely he is to get a hit off that pitcher. And this is referred to as the ""times through the order penalty,"" or TTOP, in the analytics community.Park Sok-min of the NC Dinos watches his two-run home run against the LG Twins in their Korea Baseball Organization postseason game at Masan Stadium in Changwon, South Korea, on Oct. 22, 2016. (Yonhap)Take Park's game, for instance. Park made Huff work from the beginning and saw everything in the left-hander's arsenal before going deep.   In his first time up, Park battled Huff for seven pitches before flying out. Four of the pitches were four-seam fastballs, two were changeups, and one was a two-seam fastball.   Park saw six more pitches in his next at-bat, as he grounded out to second. Huff offered him two cutters to start off, and then gave him three straight four-seamers before getting him out on a changeup.   In the fateful third trip to the plate, Park went down 0-2 after a cutter and a changeup. Huff threw two more cutters -- Park took the first one for a ball and fouled off the second one.   Park hit another foul, this time off a four-seam fastball. Huff then went back to the same pitch and got burned. Catcher Yoo Kang-nam set up inside, but Huff's pitch went over the fat part of the plate, at belt high -- right in Park's wheelhouse.   Park said he changed his approach during the at-bat, after noticing a certain pattern by Huff.   ""I thought at first Huff would keep throwing me changeups to avoid an extra-base hit,"" Park said. ""But he kept coming inside. So I decided to give up on a changeup and tried to sit on anything inside.""   Knowing how effective Huff had been in the game attacking the inner part of the plate, Park said, ""I didn't want to be late on an inside fastball. I think the pitch was a mistake, and I knew I'd hit a home run as soon as I connected.""   Numbers over a longer haul paint a clearer picture.   In the KBO this year, hitters batted .285 when facing a pitcher for the first time in a game, with an on-base percentage of .358 and a slugging percentage of .421. The on-base-plus-slugging percentage (OPS) was .779. But in their third time against the same pitcher, the KBO players hit .286/.362/.435 for a .797 OPS.   The difference was even more pronounced in 2015. The KBO hitters put up a .263/.338/.394 line for a .732 OPS in their first meeting against a pitcher but had a .799 OPS the third time by slashing .283/.361/.438.   In Major League Baseball (MLB) last year, hitters slashed .247/.312/.390 the first time against a pitcher, an OPS of .702. Then batting for the third time against the same hurler, the big leaguers batted .270/.330/.440, with a .770 OPS.   In that 2015 season, pitchers on the Tampa Bay Rays faced 893 batters the third time through a lineup, the fewest in the majors.   With first-year manager Kevin Cash in charge, this was in part to protect the club's young pitchers by restricting the number of their innings, and in part to avoid having those unproven arms face a lineup for a third time.   The Rays were tied for first place in the American League East as late as June 30. They eventually ended in fourth among five teams in the division but topped the AL in rotation ERA with 3.63.   They say familiarity breeds contempt. In baseball, it often leads to hits.   jeeho@yna.co.kr(END)"
Big data analysis helps Samsung recruit employees,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/009/0003655345?sid=004,"Wed, 30 Dec 2015 13:15:00 +0900"," Access to big data and text-mining technology has changed how Samsung Group recruits new employees. According to multiple sources from South Korea’s top conglomerate, the group used its own big data analysis and text-mining solution to pick out the most appropriate applicants in its recruitment process for the first time this year. In January, Samsung Human Resources Development Center (in Yongin, Gyeonggi Province) developed an analysis program that applies big data and text-mining technology, said an official from the group’s future strategy office. “We used the program in hiring employees during our spring recruitment season for the first time, and applied the program more broadly in our autumn recruitment.”The program established a database by analyzing resumes and cover letters submitted by employees over the course of 20 years when they applied. Text-mining software sorts out high-quality information from a given text, and then the sorted information was analyzed into big data based on the actual performance and career path of the employees after joining Samsung.According to the conglomerate, the program allows the human resource department to select talented and the most appropriate individuals for Samsung. But it did not depend solely on this program. Job seekers who wanted to get a job in Samsung still had to pass Samsung’s job compatibility evaluation, the Global Samsung Aptitude Test (GSAT) and a series of interviews.The difference, however, was the newly adopted big data tool ultimately played a decisive role in hiring employees. Even if a candidate received a high score in his or her GSAT, the conglomerate dropped the candidate based on the big data analysis that projected poor future performance of the candidate. “There were many applicants (this year) who joined us by receiving high performance scores in the big data analysis although their actual GSAT scores were low,” said another official from Samsung Group who asked to be unnamed.The specially developed big data program also screened out applicants who have used too many flamboyant expressions or euphuistic phrases in their personal statements.The Samsung official from the future strategy office noted that big data analysis suggested recruited employees that used too many fancy words in their cover letters turned out to perform far below the average. The official, however, did not disclose what expressions are considered as flamboyant or excessive.Meanwhile, the conglomerate also used the big data analysis result to allocate new employees to appropriate departments.[ⓒ Maeil Business Newspaper & mk.co.kr, All rights reserved]		"

(Yonhap)For once, long balls didn't dominate the narrative -- though one homer did come at a crucial time. Instead, it was some well-placed hits with men in scoring position on the Tigers' part that got the offense going.   Their first run came with two outs in the third. Lee Myung-ki stepped to the plate with a man at second, and he went the opposite field for an RBI double.   Lee didn't try to do too much with an offspeed pitch by Doosan starter Michael Bowden, and instead just sliced it past left fielder Kim Jae-hwan, who was playing fairly shallow and didn't get a good read off the bat.   The Tigers were once again opportunistic in the fourth, when they added two runs on the board.   After one out, they drew two straight walks against Bowden. The right-hander then committed a balk -- he tried to throw to first base to hold the runner, but with his first baseman Oh Jae-il well off the bag, Bowden stopped in mid-motion -- to allow the runners to each move up a base.   With both men in scoring position, An Chi-hong at the plate made sure Bowden would pay the price. And like Lee before him, An didn't try to force the issue and simply chopped one through the gaping hole on the right side of a drawn-in infield for a 3-0 lead.Lee Myung-ki of the Kia Tigers celebrates his RBI double against the Doosan Bears in the top of the third inning in Game 3 of the Korean Series at Jamsil Stadium in Seoul. (Yonhap)The Bears got a run back on a sacrifice fly off Kia starter Pat Dean in the bottom fourth, and the Tigers responded right away with a run in the top fifth.   This time, it was No. 3 hitter Roger Bernadina rising to the occasion. With a man at third following a double and a sacrifice bunt, Bernadina pulled a sharp single to right -- the infielders were playing in again -- to restore a three-run lead for the Tigers.   In contrast, the Bears wasted some early opportunities to strike first. Min Byung-hun led off the game with a single but was stranded there. In the third, back-to-back singles with two outs placed men at the corners, but Park Kun-woo, one of the Bears' hottest hitters this postseason, popped out to second.   And they only eked out one run in the fourth after Kim Jae-hwan led off with a ringing double.   Nick Evans, a slumping slugger without a hit in the series, tried to spark the offense with a solo home run in the seventh.   But the Bears only managed one more run in this game, on Kim Jae-hwan's RBI single in the eighth.   After Kim's single made it 4-3, Oh Jae-il, the postseason leader with six home runs, came to the plate with men at the corners. He couldn't deliver the goods this time, as he popped out to catcher for the second out.   Yang Eui-ji then swung on the first pitch he saw from new pitcher, closer Kim Se-hyun, and flied out to right field to kill the rally.   And Yang's at-bat was an apt microcosm of the Bears' day on offense. The hitters frequently swung early in the count to help Dean, who only needed 53 pitches through five innings and 88 pitches through seven.   The Tigers put a man in scoring position again in the top ninth, and unlike the Bears, they made the most of it once again.   An Chi-hong led off with a single and Kim Sun-bin sacrificed him over to second. Then with two outs, Na Ji-wan came off the bench and blasted a two-run home run to left-center for a 6-3 lead.   And that also encapsulated the Tigers' offense for the day: when batters reached, they often came home.   Na was benched at the start after going hitless in his first seven at-bats in the series. And he said not getting into the starting lineup was the fuel that he might have needed.   ""Before the game, manager (Kim Ki-tai) told me I'd get a chance to hit with men on board,"" Na said. ""I was trying to be prepared for it.""   Na jumped on a fastball from reliever Kim Kang-ryul, and he said he was sitting dead red, believing the pitcher wouldn't throw him a breaking pitch with a man at third and risk bouncing one in the dirt.

Korea-US Divided on ‘Pace of Inter-Korean Relations’ [News Analysis],https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/032/0002899985?sid=104,"Thu, 18 Oct 2018 18:53:00 +0900","U.S. Ambassador to South Korea emphasized on October 17 that the “inter-Korean dialogue must remain linked to denuclearization,” and that South Korea should stay “synchronized with the United States.”The remarks came in his keynote speech during a meeting of security experts in Seoul co-hosted by the Asan Institute for Policy Studies and the Woodrow Wilson Center. Before the remarks, he said, “We are, of course, cognizant of the priority that President Moon Jae-in and his administration have placed on improving South-North relations.” His statement hints a concern that the inter-Korean relations are progressing too rapidly while North Korea’s denuclearization measures and the North-US negotiations are showing a hesitant pace. Meanwhile, Korean Ambassador Cho Yoon-je to the United States said something different at Washington DC on October 16 (local time), as he attended a forum co-hosted by the Sejong Institute and the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR). The ambassador first said, “I want to emphasize that it continues to be our position that the inter-Korean process should proceed along with the denuclearization process and that international sanctions should be faithfully implemented.” Then he continued, ""But we also think that these processes may not always move mechanically at the same speed.”There was only four hours of time difference before the remarks of the two ambassadors had been made public, which led to speculations that there might be a problem in the South Korea-U.S. cooperation. Both men emphasized that there should not be a huge gap between the inter-Korean relations and the North-U.S. denuclearization talks and that the two factors must work in harmony, creating a virtuous cycle. According to Cheong Wa Dae spokesperson Kim Eui-gyeom, “South Korea and the United States are maintaining cooperation in the best of terms.”But in what the two diplomats said, there is a clear divide in views regarding North Korea. Cheong Wa Dae believes that the inter-Korean relations can drive North-U.S. negotiations and that the progress of the relations will eventually expedite denuclearization. When the North-U.S. talks face an impasse, the speedy progress of South and North Korean relations can pull them.At the forum, Ambassador Cho said, “Positive momentum on one side can pull the other process along, creating a virtuous cycle.” It is in the same context that President Moon said in his address on Korea’s Liberation Day, “Developments in inter-Korean relations are not the by-effects of progress in the relationship between the North and the United States. Rather, advancement in inter-Korean relations is the driving force behind denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.”Such perception of Cheong Wa Dae appeared as a series of actions. It is quite noteworthy that major decisions to which the United States showed sensitive responses were made when the North-U.S. dialogue reached a deadlock, such as the opening of the joint liaison office, South and North Korea’s new military agreement, and the launch of the inter-Korean railroad.Meanwhile, the United States has different ideas. Its position is that the inter-Korean relations must proceed at the same pace with that of the denuclearization actions. Since North Korean nuclear weapons and missiles pose immediate security threats to the United States, the American government does not have any intention to surrender initiative in this matter to another country. When the two Koreas improve their relations, it might create a positive environment for the denuclearization talks. But what the United States is concerned about is that widely different paces could hinder to the North-U.S. dialogue.The difference of view between South Korea and the United States stems from the ‘difference of trust in North Korea.’ Moon Jae-in administration is confident that Kim Jong-Un has a clear will to denuclearize. That is why the administration is trying to persuade the United States and the international community for some tangible actions, to show North Korea that it has made the right decision.On the other hand, Americans still believe that North Korea will not give up nuclear weapons. That is why there is a strong argument for ‘denuclearization first, sanctions relief later’ in the United States.Although South Korea and the United States have a joint goal of denuclearization and establishment of peace in the Korean Peninsula, it is natural that there are different views about the methodology as the two countries have different interests. The key issue is how promptly both parties can come up with a satisfactory solution when the difference in views becomes a thorny question.At the moment, South Korea and the United States demonstrate their divide in views regarding the problem question of ‘easing sanctions against North Korea.’ The United States realizes that it is impossible to continue the North-U.S. dialogue any further without discussing the issue of sanctions. Its recent and frequent emphasis on the importance of sanctions proves that the American government understands how the issue will become a major topic in negotiations.But it is still uncertain whether it is feasible to relieve sanctions in a partial and phased manner, following the progress of denuclearization. That is the question for the United States. With one measure of relief, all the sanctions may start to give way at once. But clinging to sanctions is not an option, either. The international sanctions against North Korea have weakened considerably already, and they may naturally become ineffectual even though the United States stick to them.A former government official and expert in this matter said, “While South Korea believes that now is the time to ease sanctions to drive the North’s denuclearization process, the United States is caught in the middle.” The expert then added, “Both South Korea and the United States should avoid publicly expressing their positions. It is important that the two parties have close discussions and make one well-tuned voice.”▶ 경향신문 SNS [트위터] [페이스북] ▶ [인기 무료만화 보기]©경향신문(www.khan.co.kr), 무단전재 및 재배포 금지"
[Election 2017] SWOT analysis of presidential candidate Sim Sang-jeung,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000185937?sid=104,"Mon, 17 Apr 2017 14:52:00 +0900","Rep. Sim Sang-jeung of the Justice Party (Yonhap)The Korea Herald is publishing a series of articles on major contenders in the forthcoming May 9 presidential election, using a SWOT analysis to present their strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. Below is the fifth and final installment on Sim Sang-jeung of the progressive Justice Party. – Ed. In South Korea’s crowded field of presidential candidates, Rep. Sim Sang-jeung stands out in more ways than one.She is the only woman -- a fiercely independent one unlike the “princess” Park Geun-hye whom voters last elected to be their president. A fighter to the core, the former labor activist does not shy away from sensitive issues such as gay rights and abortion, but at the same time has a surprisingly soft and likable image.Sim is also the only candidate from a major political party who does not hail from South or North Gyeongsang provinces. She was born in Paju, just north of Seoul, in 1959. StrengthsSim’s stance on key state policies has been quite consistent throughout her political career compared to other presidential hopefuls: they are the farthest to the left side of the political spectrum.She led the campaign to oppose the South Korea-US Free Trade Agreement a decade ago, which is her key differentiating point from the candidate of the liberal Democratic Party of Korea, Moon Jae-in.Sim’s consistency and unwavering commitment to progressive values is the reason why she has some of the most steadfast and faithful supporters who put the three-term lawmaker among the top recipients of political donations. WeaknessesFor Sim, the biggest challenge comes from the traditional rivalry between liberals and conservatives, which even divided the country geographically into the liberal Jeolla and the conservative Gyeongsang provinces.Amid the two’s vested rights and electoral battles over the past decades, far-left candidates have often been pressured to resign for the sake of a victory for the liberals or form a united front against the conservatives.It is also estimated that a sizable number of progressive supporters choose liberal candidates at polls in order to prevent their ballots from being “wasted.”According to opinion polls, Sim’s support rating stands below 4 percent, lower than that of her party, which hovers at around 6 percent.OpportunitiesIn two previous presidential elections, progressive candidates quit midway, trapped in the “progressive-liberal shared destiny” mindset.Knowing this, Sim has declared a race to the finish line, no matter what.Sim’s camp is aiming for a double-digit score in voter support, pinning hopes on TV debates. Camp officials say the candidate has already shown off her resolute manner and policy credentials in the first round of the televised session Thursday.Though few see a real chance of Sim winning the May 9 presidential election, she could woo new supporters and boost the political weight of herself and her party in the post-election political landscape, analysts say.ThreatsMoney matters. Any candidate and his or her affiliated political party could be saddled with heavy debt as the National Election Commission only fully compensates campaign costs for those with ballots of at least 15 percent.Furthermore, those failing to grab 10 percent of votes will have to bear the full campaign cost, as not a single won will be recouped via the state fund.If Sim drops her bid midway again, she could face heavy criticism from her core supporters who, despite the concern of “wasted votes,” were willing to stick with her. There is a possibility that Sim will come under pressure to resign and endorse Moon Jae-in from the liberal Democratic Party to beat Ahn Cheol-soo of the People’s Party.By Kim Yon-se (kys@heraldcorp.com)[코리아헤럴드] [K-POP HERALD] [페이스북] <ⓒKoreaHerald(www.koreaherald.com)무단전재 및 재배포 금지>		"
[Election 2017] SWOT analysis of presidential candidate Yoo Seong-min,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000185768?sid=104,"Wed, 12 Apr 2017 16:49:00 +0900","Rep. Yoo Seong-min (Yonhap)The Korea Herald is publishing a series of articles on major contenders in the forthcoming May 9 presidential election, using a SWOT analysis to present their strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. Below is the fourth installment on Rep. Yoo Seong-min of the conservative Bareun Party. -- Ed. Like his party, Rep. Yoo Seong-min is a minor player in the race for presidency. Yoo’s Bareun Party has one of the lowest approval ratings for a conservative party in recent history, and his own ratings remain far behind the front-runners. However, Yoo is not without his strengths. Born to a judge father in 1958 in Daegu, Yoo holds a doctorate in economics and has a long experience of working as a researcher on related issues. He entered politics in 2005 through a parliamentary by-election, grew in presence and served as the floor leader of the defunct Saenuri Party in 2015. StrengthsYoo has one clear advantage over his rivals –--economic expertise. Yoo has a doctorate in economics and spent more than a decade as a researcher with the Korea Development Institute. Yoo also headed the conservative party’s think tank from 2002 until 2005, when he entered politics. In contrast, Moon Jae-in of the Democratic Party of Korea is a lawyer, while Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo of the People’s Party is a medical doctor who later became a software developer. Liberty Korea Party’s Hong Joon-pyo began his professional life as a public prosecutor. He is also known for speaking his mind regardless of the consequences. During his term at the KDI, he is said to have experienced unfair treatment for criticizing the Kim Dae-jung administration’s economic policies. He also spoke out against those of the Park Geun-hye administration.WeaknessesThe connection to former President Park Geun-hye is one of Yoo’s biggest weaknesses. Yoo was once a key ally of Park. However, after he criticized the idea of welfare without tax hikes, Park branded his actions a “betrayal” and he was forced to run as an independent in the following Assembly elections, before rejoining the Saenuri Party. The “traitor” brand was further strengthened when he defected from the party founded under Park’s leadership to form the Bareun Party. This image is being emphasized by the Liberty Korea Party and their candidate Hong, as they claim that they are the “rightful heirs” of Korean conservatism and that Yoo is a traitor. The low approval rating of Yoo’s party is also working against Yoo. The party is one of the least popular. Its ratings fell to 4 percent in a recent Gallup Korea poll, matching that of the Justice Party. Yoo’s support rating as a presidential candidate also remains far behind his rivals. The Gallup poll showed support for Yoo was at 4 percent, just over half that of Hong whose campaign was only officially launched Monday.OpportunitiesOpportunity is something Yoo appears to lack more than anything else. Polls showed the majority of voters support the two front-runners -- Moon and Ahn -- while Hong is going into overdrive to make up for lost time. Although Yoo claims that he is the right man to lead the conservatives, he and his party are still trailing behind the others, even in the conservative strongholds. However, his economic expertise could set him apart in the presidential candidates’ televised debate. Of the scheduled three live debates, two are to be conducted without prepared materials, and Yoo’s long experience as a researcher is expected by some people to give him an edge. The effect the debates will have on support ratings remains to be seen. Polls conducted after the debates held during the 2012 election showed that any changes in candidates’ ratings were within the margin of error. ThreatsFor Yoo, the main rival is not liberal front-runner Moon or centrist Ahn. It is Hong of the Liberty Korea Party, which he and his fellow Bareun Party politicians famously broke up with. Yoo and Hong are not just vying for the presidential job, but hegemony over the nation’s fractured political right. Yoo is likely to face more attacks from his conservative rival and pressure to merge with Hong. Hong has voiced the need for the two parties to merge on numerous occasions, and has even gone as far as to claim that Yoo and his party would “evaporate” if a merger does not occur before the election. With less than four weeks until voting day, Yoo has to expand his presence fast if he is to complete the race, a feat even some in his own party are beginning to doubt. The party has for now settled on seeing Yoo’s campaign through and Yoo has ruled out any form of alliance or merging his campaign with that of another.However, Rep. Kim Sung-tae -- the chief of Bareun Party’s election committee -- has hinted at the possibility of an alliance with Ahn of the People’s Party. Speaking on a radio interview, Kim said that politics is a living organism and that a politician must consider all possible means “within the frame of the presidential race.”By Choi He-suk (cheesuk@heraldcorp.com)[코리아헤럴드] [K-POP HERALD] [페이스북] <ⓒKoreaHerald(www.koreaherald.com)무단전재 및 재배포 금지>		"
[News Analysis] Severe headwinds greet Moon’s economic policymakers,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000205621?sid=104,"Mon, 12 Nov 2018 16:42:00 +0900","			South Korea’s newly appointed economic policymakers -- in contrast to their predecessors who took office with high hopes upon the inauguration of the Moon Jae-in administration -- appear to be off to a rocky start, amid escalating concerns and disapproval of the government’s economic policy direction.For the time being, the newly appointed deputy prime minister for economy and presidential chief of staff for policy are expected to press ahead with Moon’s disputed economic policies and try to bring new momentum to the nation’s stalled economy. At the heart of the dispute is the “income-led growth” initiative, one of the core pillars of President Moon’s economic visions, which has come under fire repeatedly over the past year against the backdrop of the nation’s slow growth and stalled job figures.The presidential office Cheong Wa Dae on Friday announced the replacement of former Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Kim Dong-yeon and Presidential Chief of Staff for Policy Jang Ha-sung. The two had long been in apparent conflict over their policy perspectives, especially concerning the disputed minimum wage hike plan and its impact on the economy.To fill their posts, the Blue House tapped insiders, gesturing that it plans to carry through its current policy keynotes without making drastic changes. Minister Kim was replaced by Hong Nam-ki, chief of the Office for Government Policy Coordination, and Jang by Senior Presidential Secretary for Social Affairs Kim Soo-hyun.Kim Soo-hyun, newly appointed Presidential Chief of Staff for Policy, speaks in a parliamentary committee meeting on Monday. (Yonhap)“My role will be to support the deputy prime minister as presidential secretary,” Kim said in a press briefing Sunday, underlining teamwork with Finance Minister nominee Hong.While Kim started his term immediately, nominee Hong will undergo a parliamentary confirmation hearing before taking office.“President Moon has asked me to take charge of the integrated operation of social and economic policies in general, which I embraced as his underlying intention to fully empower the deputy prime minister when it comes to the economy,” Kim also said.Despite the top Blue House official’s low-key gesture, a number of political observers including opposition lawmakers claimed that Kim is the real heavyweight in the new economic policymaking team.“(Kim) is the initiator of the real estate crisis and the central figure of (Moon’s) nuclear phase-out policies, as well as a member of the president’s inner circle,” Sohn Hak-kyu, chairman of minor opposition Bareunmirae Party, wrote on his social media account, lashing out at the latest reshuffle.“Hong, who is an obedient bureaucrat, is likely to be overshadowed by ideologically biased Kim, in which case our economy is doomed.”Kim’s ties with President Moon trace back to 2003, when both worked under the progressive Roh Moo-hyun administration, the former as secretary for state affairs and the latter as chief of staff. He also served as policymaker in Moon’s presidential election camp, in both 2012 and 2017.Observers point out that while Jang was officially the top policymaker, it was in fact Kim who took the lead in shaping Moon’s core economic policies -- including the nuclear phase-out plan, real estate regulations, and the income-led growth paradigm.It is due to these circumstances that his appointment as chief of staff was viewed as the president’s signal to keep up the current policy keynotes.But Kim’s policy plans are now likely to boomerang on him as most of them have so far failed to produce tangible results.Korea Investment & Securities on Monday predicted the country’s growth rate for next year would be 2.5 percent, down 0.2 percent from the Bank of Korea’s 2.7 percent. Global credit ratings firm Moody’s had also suggested likewise in a report unveiled last week.Also, the country’s jobless rate hit the highest for September since 2005, prolonging the job crisis, which former Deputy Prime Minister Kim partly attributed to the drastic pace of the wage hike.The real estate market has for months been swallowed up by speculation frenzy, despite the government’s series of loan restrictions and taxation of affluent multiple home owners.The nuclear phase-out plan, which aimed at shifting the nation’s power supplies by 2022, has also come under fire recently, due to huge deficits recorded by Korea Electric Power Corp.By Bae Hyun-jung (tellme@heraldcorp.com)[코리아헤럴드] [K-POP HERALD] [페이스북] <ⓒKoreaHerald(www.koreaherald.com)무단전재 및 재배포 금지>		"
[News Analysis] Conservative leaders resign after election debacle,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000201235?sid=104,"Thu, 14 Jun 2018 17:14:00 +0900","Hong Joon-pyo, the chairman of the main opposition Liberty Korea Party announces his resignation at a party meeting on Thursday. (Yonhap)Chairman Hong Joon-pyo of the main opposition Liberty Korea Party and Yoo Seong-min, co-chairman of the center-right minor opposition Bareunmirae Party, resigned from their positions Thursday, taking responsibility for their crushing defeat in the local elections and parliamentary by-elections. The ruling Democratic Party of Korea garnered sweeping victories in most regions, winning 14 out of the 17 mayoral and gubernatorial posts. The Liberty Korea Party only managed to grab two posts, in the conservative strongholds Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province. In the by-elections, the ruling party won 11 of 12 parliamentary seats.“We completely failed and the entire country has been passed (to the ruling party). Everything is my fault and every liability lies with me,” Hong said at a party meeting Thursday. “I respect the decision of the voters. I will step down from my chairman position today.”Rep. Yoo of the Bareunmirae Party also said that he accepts the results of the elections.“I put my best effort to sow the seeds for new, reformed conservative politics. But I believe my work fell short of the people’s expectations. I will take some time to re-examine ourselves and continue to strive to revive the collapsed conservatives,” Yoo said. His party, which was established by defectors from the Liberty Korea Party, failed to take even one seat among all the contested seats. Regarding Wednesday’s results, experts said it was a total loss for conservatives in the country, adding that if they do not come up with sincere measures, the damage may be “irreparable.”One of the biggest reasons behind the failure, they said, was that the conservative party was perceived as an “interest group” rather than a political representative of the people.“Regardless of the agenda, the conservative party strongly clashed with the ruling party and the government, and the series of events highlighted the party’s reputation as an interest group, not a political representative of the people,” Shin Yul, a political science professor at Myongji University, told The Korea Herald. Since President Moon Jae-in took office in May 2017, the main opposition party has been opposing government plans, from its appointment of the Cabinet and the government’s drive to amend the Constitution this year, to the efforts to engage North Korea, which have been generally hailed as a remarkable feat by the public.While it may be the role of opposition parties to keep the government in check, the party’s hard-line stance ran against the general public sentiment, and that attitude gave people the impression that it was opposing the government for the sake of opposition, Shin explained. The powerful conservative block was first fractured when a corruption scandal involving conservative President Park Geun-hye ended with her removal from office in March last year. The impeachment of Park was not traumatic enough to actually change the political ideologies of the people, Shin said. How the Liberty Korea Party dealt with the situation subsequently turned so-called “shy conservative” voters -- who would not publicly reveal their political stances -- to “angry conservatives” who refused to vote for the failed political faction, he explained.“It is the end of the conservative party. For a revival, they should choose to ‘die’ and start everything from the beginning. Resignation of the leadership and rebranding the name of the party will not save them,” Shin said. “I think the party should dissolve and all the lawmakers should stay as independents.” The scenario may sound extreme, but how the liberals swept the elections is also unprecedented, and therefore such exceptional measures will be the only way for a real breakthrough for the conservatives, he added.Jun Kye-wan, a political commentator, also explained that the old mindsets of conservative politics are based on elitism and nationalism, which hinder the conservatives from coming up with realistic conservative policies.“The conservatives earned their authority from the old dictatorship government a long time ago. The voters’ decision on Wednesday is the judgment against the conservatives for thinking that just a few at the top could teach and enlighten the people,” Jun said. As for ways for the Liberty Korea Party to be revived, experts say that strategic political moves are not solutions.“The Liberty Korea Party should come up with a new policy frame that can compete with the Moon administration’s big policies, especially in North Korea policies,” said Yoon Pyeong-joong, a professor of political philosophy at Hanshin University. “The conservative party still claims that South Korea should absorb the North in unification. It is just too difficult for them to admit the North as another state. But it is not the Cold War era anymore, and they have to now read the trends,” Yoon said. “As conservatives, they should bring policies that fit the reality and persuade the people.”By Jo He-rim (herim@heraldcorp.com)[코리아헤럴드] [K-POP HERALD] [페이스북] <ⓒKoreaHerald(www.koreaherald.com)무단전재 및 재배포 금지>		"
[Dominique Moisi] Why we need TV series like ‘Game of Thrones’,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000157257?sid=104,"Mon, 20 Apr 2015 19:17:00 +0900","Today’s popular television programs have become the equivalent of the feuilletons that began appearing in newspapers in the 19th century. Series like “Game of Thrones” and “Downton Abbey,” like Balzac and Dickens before them, serve as a source of entertainment and fodder for debate. In this sense, our television screenplays have emerged as key tools of social and political analysis.Such tools can be used to comprehend, for example, the difference between Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and U.S. President Barack Obama. Netanyahu is still stuck in the third season of “Homeland” ― that is, obsessed with Iran ― whereas Obama, having begun to include the renewed Russian threat in his strategic calculus, has already moved into the third season of “House of Cards.”Of course, the availability of such comparisons is rooted in what often drives a TV series’ popularity: its ability to hold up a mirror to a society ― to reflect its anxieties and longings ― and create a window through which outsiders can peer in.Consider “Downton Abbey,” a British period drama that follows the lives of the Crawley family and its servants in the family’s classic country house, from 1912 to the mid-1920s. Why are millions of people worldwide ― from Europe to the United States to Asia ― so attracted to these characters? Are they nostalgic for a time long past, which the show reconstitutes with exacting verisimilitude? Or are they fascinated by the social dynamics that the show explores?For Julian Fellowes, who created the series, the explanation lies elsewhere ― in our search for order in a chaotic world. People feel so disoriented nowadays, he believes, that they are drawn to “Downton Abbey’s” tidy realm, in which the setting, clearly delineated in space and time, is governed by strict rules. Just as the Crawley house serves as a kind of refuge for its characters, it may give its viewers a safe, predictable outlet by which to escape the tumultuous present ― and avoid the unknown future.Similarly, the American political drama “House of Cards” reflects a kind of disillusionment ― this time, with U.S. politics. Whereas “The West Wing,” a popular political drama that ran from 1999 to 2006, portrays the U.S. presidency ― held by a sophisticated, cultivated, and humanistic leader ― with a kind of longing, “House of Cards” immerses the viewer in a murky milieu of humanity’s worst impulses. In “House of Cards,” the world is not as viewers believe it should be, but as they fear it is.This is the opposite of the approach taken by the Danish political drama “Borgen,” which presents an idealized prime minister, Birgitte Nyborg. But the effect is similar. One often hears people saying that the true problem facing Denmark ― and, in particular, its political class ― is that Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt lacks Nyborg’s strengths.By exposing the fundamental challenges and anxieties facing a society, a TV series can, at times, almost prefigure the future. In France, “Engrenages” ― sold in English under the title “Spiral” ― explores the deep malaise of French society. In retrospect, the series seems to have foreshadowed the tragedies that beset the country in January. In particular, the fifth season, which aired in France in late 2014, offered a clinical description of how young people in the Paris suburbs went astray, while portraying the relationship between the police and their political superiors as cynical and even combative. The show’s dialogue could have come straight out of a real-life Parisian “power lunch.”The TV show that has emerged as the most hotly debated of our time is, without a doubt, “Game of Thrones,” a medieval fantasy epic based (increasingly loosely) on George R.R. Martin’s best-selling book series A Song of Ice and Fire. The series has become known not just for its massive budget or intricate storytelling, but also for its sustained choreography of brutal violence.Students of international politics, especially in Canada and the U.S., wonder whether the show, by stressing the role of sheer brutality, encourages a “realist” vision of the world. Could the savagery featured on “Game of Thrones” ― including abundant beheadings, rape, and sexual torture ― have helped to encourage the tactics of, say, Boko Haram and the Islamic State? Or could the series ― in which violence often begets more violence, but does not necessarily get the characters what they want ― actually be highlighting the limits of force?On a more philosophical level, the show’s universe ― a combination of ancient mythology and the Middle Ages ― seems to capture the mixture of fascination and fear that many people nowadays feel. It is a fantastic, unpredictable, and devastatingly painful world ― one that is so complex that even the show’s most loyal viewers often are confused. In this sense, it is much like the world in which we live.Though the West has no monopoly on the production of TV series, it undoubtedly dominates the field ― and thus the worldview that such shows reflect. Given this, one might wonder whether Chinese or Russian leaders are making time in their busy schedules to watch series such as “House of Cards” or “Game of Thrones,” in order to understand their rivals’ mentality.Leading government advisers, at least, seem to recognize the value of tuning in. A Chinese friend recently told me that “House of Cards” was very popular among China’s political elite. They relish the reminder that politics is just as ruthless in the U.S. as it is at home.By Dominique MoisiDominique Moisi, a professor at Sciences Po, is senior adviser at the French Institute for International Affairs and a visiting professor at King’s College London. ― Ed.

[News Analysis] End of a chaebol era? Unlikely,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000198051?sid=104,"Wed, 07 Mar 2018 17:13:00 +0900","(Yonhap)For Scott Park, a 42-year-old businessman in Seoul, seeing Samsung’s de facto chief paraded in handcuffs at the height of the presidential bribery scandal last year was not something that he thought he could expect just a few months earlier. To him, Samsung has always been a prime representation of the South Korean economy, more so in recent decades, as the conglomerate has pulled far ahead of its rivals, led by Lee Jae-yong with a global reputation to claim for.“It was because of how we grew up, believing that chaebol were the foundation of our thriving economy,” he said. “But things seem to be changing in the name of justice.”While there have been more than a few incidences of chaebol leaders being arrested, indicted or imprisoned in the past -- five out of the top 10 chaebol groups have had their leaders serve prison terms -- Lee’s detainment felt different to many Koreans.Perhaps it was because it came after the unprecedented scene of nine chiefs of the country’s largest conglomerates sitting side by side at the National Assembly in December of 2016, stifled by a barrage of criticisms from lawmakers. Or perhaps it was because the crime for which Lee was sentenced to -- bribing the politician -- was now being judged with more than a slap on the wrist but as a grave violation even for those that had been considered immortal beyond the realm of law.As Koreans witnessed changes in social climate toward chaebol, Lotte Group Chairman Shin Dong-bin became the latest mogul to be put behind bars last month by being sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison over his involvement in the high-profile scandal that impeached former President Park Geun-hye.These chaebol scions’ sentences made headlines all over the world. A Wall Street Journal column published late last year even labeled it the end of the chaebol era.In a tearful testimony in December last year, Samsung’s Lee said he won’t pursue the post of group chairman, and keep his scope of business within the tech giant, in his plea for a lighter appeal sentence.Lotte Group Chairman Shin Dong-bin enters the group's new skyscraper Lotte World Tower on unspecified date. (Lotte)On the surface, indeed, the change in the corporate circle appears imminent, together by the liberal Moon Jae-in government’s chaebol reform drive.But that’s not enough to entirely change “the nature of Korean chaebol,” said Korean experts on corporate governance.Despite persistent anti-public sentiment toward how their pursue their private interests and their expedient methods of transferring their wealth, the way of keeping the family control is likely to continue. And it is difficult to expect an immediate change in the way they operate, observers say.But why, despite their bitter lessons in prison?It goes without saying, the tendency of keeping the business within the control of family and bequeathing the assets to next-generations is a global thing. Around 70 percent of listed companies in Europe are controlled by families. But cases of South Korean chaebol seems to be on another level.“They have this obsession for succession, far severe than those in other countries,” said Bruce Lee, founder of Zebra Investment Management, a Seoul based hedge-fund. “I believe it’s because of the country’s deeply-rooted Confucian culture as well as (heavy) inheritance tax system,” he said.In Confucianism, the eldest son inherits the family assets and becomes responsible for the family, succeeding his father’s role. Founders’ have carried this tradition over into their managerial succession, as a way of keeping the ownership in the family, backed by hierarchical relations between employer and employee, writes Tan Soo Kee, a scholar at the University of Michigan in his paper titled “Influences of Confucianism on Korean Corporate Culture.” LG Twin Tower in Yeouido, Seoul (The Korea Herald)For last 60 years, South Korean chaebol thrived, entering markets around the world and allowing in foreign investments from the West.The inflow of foreign capital and the government’s adoption of market principles, however, brought chaebol under closer scrutiny. Despite the changing landscape, they have somehow succeeded in keeping their businesses under their control from generation to generation, even though their stakeholdings in their companies are relatively miniscule.According to CEOScore, eight out of the nation’s top 10 conglomerates have passed the leadership baton down for three generations. The top 10 groups own nearly 30 percent of all business assets in Korea, according to Fair Trade Commission.Five chairmen of the top 10 companies were second-generation chaebol scion, while Lotte Group is the only conglomerate under control of its founder Shin Kyuk-ho’s ownership. The 95-year-old chairman holds the largest portion in Kojyunsya, which controls Japanese operations of Lotte and ultimately the retailer’s operations in Korea.LG and GS, led by third-generation chaebol members, appear to be preparing to pass on the leadership to a fourth generation, according to industry watchers.Most Korean chaebol heads hold insignificant portions of their companies’ total shares, but control their empires through a complex cross-shareholding structure. And this makes Korean chaebol unique.Samsung’s Lee family runs the tech-to-finance empire with a little more than 1 percent of total shareholdings, while the family that runs Hyundai Motor owns 3.35 percent of shares, according to the FTC. The average percentage of shares held by chaebol families hovers around 3.5 percent in Korea.The notion of chaebol being major contributors to Korea’s economic miracle has paradoxically embedded the concept that regardless of the percentage of shares, Chaebol families are the owners of the companies. It has left many Koreans agonizing over a double standard: tolerating the conglomerate chief’s invincibility, yet loathing their unethical accumulation of wealth.“If US billionaire Warren Buffett acquires all of Hyundai Chairman Chung Mong-koo’s 3 percent share in the carmaker, would he become the most powerful leader in the company?” asks Park Ju-gun, president of CEOScore. “According to the market principles in the West, Buffett can, but it would never happen here because we still think that those who have the control over the companies, the so-called chairmen, are the owners, not shareholders.”The disproportionate power they exercise has long been a concern for foreign investors.“Foreign investors are concerned about conglomerates owning IT and steel and also retail businesses at the same time and they are all under the control of one family member who has very little expertise in each segment,” said Lee of Zebra Investment. Can these non-experts could improve return-on-equity? They don’t think so.”Pointing out the controversial merger between two Samsung affiliates in 2015 and Hyundai Motor’s acquisition of 10 trillion won land in Samseong-dong, Kim Woo-jin, associate professor of finance at Seoul National University, said that the decisions made by the owner families in pursuit of their interests put shareholders at risk.“The problem is not the succession itself, but the decisions made in pursuit of their own interests … The major problem of Samsung merger case, for instance, is not in (its purpose of) speeding up (Lee’s) succession, but that the company has inflicted tremendous damage to Samsung C&T shareholders in the course of that decision, and that the damage diverted profits to the owner family.”Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Lee Jae-yong leaves Seoul Detention Center last month. (Yonhap)Despite skepticism prevailing over chaebol reform, experts said there’s still room for improvement. “The similarity between the two, Joseon dynasty royals and chaebol families today, is that they hold absolute power and have no one to hold them accountable,” Park of CEOScore said. “The law on commercial business and corporate governance should be revised so that the government could launch a stronger monitoring system on chaebol and harsher punishment so that families cannot spend even a single penny for their own interests.” The Korean market is also still at an infant stage and it is premature to make a comparison with the west.“Markets in the west went through a series of historic events such as the Great Depressions and World Wars for the last 200 years,” Lee of Zebra said adding that the period over which Korea had embraced the principle of shareholder rights was closer to a decade.“Foreign investors are demanding a higher standard of transparency in governance and the National Pension Fund is gearing up to adopt stewardship code. If the market works together with these effort, chaebols will change eventually ... but it will take very long time.”The high-profile trials of Samsung and Lotte, may have changed public perception toward chaebol, but experts worry that that things will go back the way they were, citing previous trials involving other tycoons.“Did chairmen from CJ, Hanwha and SK change their governance or have their conviction at courts have tarnished the companies’ corporate reputation afterward?” a senior researcher at Korea Corporate Governance Service, who declined to be named.“Though the nation became less tolerant toward chaebol wrongdoing, conglomerates are still the dream workplace for many young people, reflecting that the power of capital remains dominant.” By Cho Chung-un (christory@heraldcorp.com)[코리아헤럴드] [K-POP HERALD] [페이스북] <ⓒKoreaHerald(www.koreaherald.com)무단전재 및 재배포 금지>		"

The tricky calculus of second boosters in mostly breakthrough-infected K...,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000238870?sid=104,"Wed, 03 Aug 2022 18:23:00 +0900","Vaccinations in time of omicron BA.XPresident Yoon Suk-yeol receives his second booster vaccination on July 13 at a public health clinic in Jung-gu, central Seoul. (Yonhap)This spring, South Korea saw one of the highest case rates of the original COVID-19 variant omicron BA.1 and its “sibling” BA.2 in the world. Now the country is distributing a second round of boosters to fight the most recently dominant BA.5, another omicron subvariant.The initial omicron surge that lasted from late January through April led to about 16 million cases here, peaking at a one-day high of 621,147 cases on March 17, according to the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency’s statistics. At the time, only about 3 percent of people in their 60s and above remained unvaccinated, with most cases being “breakthrough infections,” meaning infection after full vaccination. At the height of the BA.1-BA.2 wave from Feb. 27 to March 26, 7,179,059 people aged 12 and older -- the cutoff age for vaccination eligibility then -- were confirmed with an infection. Some 60 percent of them had been vaccinated with a third dose and 32 percent had completed their primary vaccine series.The widespread presence of relatively recent omicron breakthrough infections in the population raises the question of whether a fourth dose of a vaccine based on the original Wuhan strain is justified, and if so, for whom. Some data suggest hybrid immunity, or vaccine-induced immunity combined with natural immunity, may be superior to vaccination or infection alone. A June 15 article from the New England Journal of Medicine noted that hybrid immunity “resulting from previous infection and recent booster vaccination conferred the strongest protection.”The spread of BA.5 in South Korea seems to be sparing people with prior immunity, at least based on the KCDA’s early analysis.The KDCA said 97 percent of infections that occurred in the first week of July were in people with no documented infection history, with the other 3 percent being reinfections. Similarly, in the second week of July, people who have never been infected before made up 96 percent of new infections.Mixed messagesAs South Korea began distributing fourth doses in April, the KDCA said older adults were “recommended” to get boosted for the second time.The recommendation has since subtly shifted to “it depends.”According to the KDCA guidelines issued on July 28, boosters are optional for people who have been breakthrough-infected regardless of their age and risk profile. Anyone 50 and older are eligible to get a fourth dose, but only “if desired.”In a phone call with The Korea Herald on Sunday, Kwon Geun-young, the director of KDCA’s vaccination management division, said that “the context has changed with fourth doses.” “Unlike last year when we were distributing the first two doses and boosters, a lot more people have come down with an infection,” he said. “The basic premise of our second booster strategy is that it’s mainly for people who have never had COVID-19.”Kwon said this was because infection, especially infection after full vaccination, was known to provide some protection. “There is evidence that getting a second dose and finishing your primary series is helpful, even after infection. Whereas with a third or fourth dose, the evidence isn’t as clear that the additional vaccination would lead to a higher immunity in people who have had a breakthrough infection,” he explained.He said the July 28 guidelines were based on deliberations by the national advisory committee on immunization. And yet people who are at least 50 years old are still alerted to make their fourth dose appointments if their positive test was three months or longer ago. The KDCA’s text alert does not clearly state the changed recommendations for people with past infections.The alert, which is sent automatically to eligible people, reads: “As 120 days have passed from your third dose, you are due to receive your fourth dose.”Some health care workers delivering vaccinations report they were not informed about the update. A primary care physician whose office is in Seoul said that he “wasn’t familiar with the differing recommendations based on infection history.”On the confusion and mixed signals, Kwon said the KCDA “plans on working with municipalities to communicate the recommendation status better to the public.”The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency’s COVID-19 vaccination guidelines released July 28Second booster costs and benefits vs. BA.5How beneficial would a fourth dose of the original Wuhan vaccine be against BA.5 for people who were breakthrough-infected with BA.1 or BA.2?The KDCA said in reponse to The Korea Herald’s question on July 26 that no analysis has been carried out on that front yet.Park Young-joon, the head of the KDCA’s epidemiological investigation team, said that an analysis of data from Feb. 16-April 30 showed fourth doses were about 50 percent effective in preventing severe outcomes for a sustained period of time.Dr. Oh Ju-hwan, a public health policy professor at Seoul National University, said the changing cost-benefit assessment of the vaccine should be reflected in policy responses. “If potential risks of vaccination remain the same, while the benefits that can be gained from vaccination are reduced as a result of a new variant becoming dominant, that would result in some changes in the cost-to-benefit ratio,” he said.Oh pointed out South Korea has been “relying mostly on vaccination” to cope with its omicron phase of the pandemic.“We are taking the same approach with BA.5 that we had taken with BA.1 and 2, based on the assumption that similar results could be replicated,” he said. “There need to be efforts for adopting other interventions such as contact tracing that can complement the existing vaccines’ imperfect protection.”South Korea’s vaccine policy overall “hasn’t been data-driven,” said Dr. Chun Byung-chul, an infectious disease epidemiologist and the vice president of the Korean Vaccine Society.He said that at the moment, the data weren’t robust enough to be able to derive a meaningful cost-benefit analysis. “For instance, we still don’t have enough understanding about the lingering impacts of COVID-19, or long COVID.” 　Some concerns have also been raised about repetitive vaccination over a short span of time. In January, the European Medicines Agency had warned that frequent boosters could adversely affect immune response. 　Is infection like booster?The short answer from Dr. Jerome Kim, the director-general of the International Vaccine Institute, is yes. “As Dr. Fauci (director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases) said, ‘a live virus’ booster,” he said.In an e-mail exchange with The Korea Herald, he said that getting infected with BA.1 and BA.2 “appears to confer some, incomplete protection against BA.4/BA.5 infection and mild disease.” Hybrid immunity “confers protection against severe disease, hospitalization and death.”But neither would protect against the next infection.“Prior vaccination plus BA.1 infection would not protect you from getting BA.5, although it would protect against the worst manifestations of BA.5 -- that is, disease and death -- at least over the short term,” he said. That comes with several caveats, he added. The data suggesting cross-variant protection are primarily preprints and not yet fully reviewed, for one thing. The durability of that protection was not yet known, either. Then there were BA.2.75 and other worrying subvariants that bear watching. “It’s also worth remembering that people infected with BA.5 can be reinfected with BA.5,” he said.To boost or not to boostGiven the number of people in South Korea who were boosted and were infected by omicron between January to March, the timing for boosting was right to prevent BA.5 from reinfecting “hybrid-immune” or previously vaccinated and then BA.1-infected people, the International Vaccine Institute chief said.The remaining 60 percent of South Koreans who haven’t had a known infection also remained vulnerable. As of Tuesday, more than 20 million out of 51 million people here have had COVID-19 at least once over the course of the pandemic. So who should be getting their fourth vaccination?“If you are over 50 and or have underlying conditions, my opinion is yes, get boosted now,” Kim said. While there are new vaccines on the way, as the rollout is often not instantaneous, it is hard to know when they will be available in South Korea, he explained. “At least based on what the FDA told Moderna and Pfizer, (the FDA) wants a Wuhan-BA.5 bivalent, not a Wuhan/BA.1. The doses of the latter had started manufacturing, but given the FDA’s position, the companies are getting the Wuhan/BA.5 ready. This will be available late in the year,” he said.Health officials have vowed that omicron-adapted vaccines will reach South Korea over the remaining year. But out of the two updated vaccines in the pipeline – with one more up-to-date than the other -- it was uncertain which one the country will be getting. “We’re trying to bring in both the BA.1 vaccine and the vaccine against BA.4 and BA.5. As of now we’re still discussing which vaccine would be the one we’ll be administering,” a senior KDCA official said in response to The Korea Herald’s question on Tuesday. What happens with next variants?BA.5 probably won’t be the dominant strain at the end of the year, but vaccines would still retain some levels of protection, said Kim of the International Vaccine Institute. “We are relying on cross-protective immune responses. The original Wuhan-based vaccines have worked in alpha, beta, gamma, delta and omicron -- BA.1, BA.2, BA.4 and BA.5 -- to reduce hospitalizations and death through cross-protective responses,” he said.That would likely be the case with future variants of concern as well.“Given what we’ve seen regarding viral evolution so far, a bivalent Wuhan/BA.5 would give some level of cross protection against new isolates,” he said. Kim said the two-component vaccine would be better than the existing monovalent Wuhan vaccine. “If we look at the levels of inactivating or neutralizing antibodies against BA.5, the bivalent vaccine works better than the Wuhan one alone,” he said. “Whatever the next dominant strain -- whether it be pi or another subvariant of omicron -- it will likely be cross-neutralizable by the bivalent Wuhan/BA.5. So it will do well to prevent serious disease and death.” According to Dr. Paik Soon-young, an emeritus professor of microbiology at Catholic University of Korea, natural infection with the virus in theory would offer a “more holistic immunity” than an artificial one.“The vaccines elicit immune responses specific to the surface protein of the virus that is susceptible to mutations. Natural infection, on the other hand, prompts immune responses against other proteins where mutations seldom occur,” Paik said. “So hybrid immunity can be thought to be more resistant to variants.”By Kim Arin (arin@heraldcorp.com)"
[News Analysis] Park faces four choices,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000180783?sid=104,"Mon, 14 Nov 2016 17:25:00 +0900","The presidential office of Cheong Wa Dae (Yonhap)In the face of immense public pressure to resign over the series of corruption scandals involving her close aides, President Park Geun-hye claimed to be considering all possible options to break through the current political deadlock.But given the ever-worsening voter sentiment and political pressure, the scandal-ridden state chief’s action plan comes down to four choices -- voluntary resignation, partial renunciation of power, impeachment or maintaining the status quo despite all odds.None of Park’s stopgap actions so far -- including two public apologies, a shake-up of the Cabinet and the presidential secretariat, and her consent to let the legislature select a prime minister -- have come anywhere close to satisfying the vexed public.Status quoDespite all the odds, there are speculations that Park will continue to lie low in hopes of a possible rebound in public sentiment, especially among those once loyal to her.Lending credence to such a scenario is the fact that the president has mostly remained silent throughout the entire scandal over her associate Choi Soon-sil, ever since related reports first came to light in late October.Even when the prosecutorial investigation came up with circumstantial evidence seemingly indicating Park’s involvement in Choi’s extensive corruption and influence-peddling, the presidential office refrained from remarks.“It is inappropriate (for Cheong Wa Dae) to comment on a case which is under prosecutorial probe,” presidential spokesperson Jung Youn-kuk repeated every day in answer to reporters’ questions.The president, meanwhile, mostly remained secluded from public view, only attending preset diplomatic events.It was amid such a standoff that a record-breaking candlelight vigil was held Saturday in central Seoul and throughout the country, gathering over 1 million protesters but not quite drawing a tangible response from the Blue House.“The president has heard the people’s voices with a heavy heart and is aware of the graveness of the situation,” were the solemn yet only words coming from the presidential spokesperson in the wake of the rally.Significant renunciation of powerThe core idea is to hand over the president’s authority on key state affairs to an incoming prime minister and establish a powerful Cabinet to effectively replace the presidential office.Suggested as a compromise solution to shoving Park out of power while also preventing greater political confusion, the plan was put forward by the main opposition camp, which has been hesitant to call for the president’s immediate ouster. Park appears to have this plan in mind, having asked the opposition to field a new prime minister. Doubts, however, persist that Park may continue to remain the effective president, especially as she has so far refrained from clearly defining the intensified role of an incoming prime minister.Skeptics have also pointed out that a fill-in prime minister would not be able to exert actual power on state affairs, which would eventually lead to a power vacuum -- a situation no better than the possible political upheaval caused by impeachment, or even an earlier-than-expected presidential election.Another challenge is that the selection of a new prime minister is still up in the air.With her earlier appointment of Kim Byong-joon thwarted by the opposition, Park proposed that rival parties recommend an alternative candidate, an idea unlikely to pick up momentum due to the ongoing partisan divide.ImpeachmentImpeachment, the official sanction which the legislature is entitled to impose upon the state chief, has so far been shelved due to risks of backfiring.Based on Clause 65 of the Constitution, the National Assembly may vote on a motion of impeachment, if the president has breached the Constitution or other laws. Once the motion obtains the legislature’s approval, its final effectuation is to be decided by the Constitutional Court.Some opposition figures, mostly those from the People’s Party, have claimed that such a forceful procedure has now become inevitable given the president’s apparent refusal to step down.But it was former Saenuri Chairman Rep. Kim Moo-sung who rekindled talks of impeachment on Sunday, becoming the first ruling party official to call for the legal penalty upon the president.The ruling party bigwig’s move gave momentum to the stalled impeachment gesture, as the opposition camp, despite its parliamentary majority, would need some dozens of extra votes in order to pass the motion.President Park Geun-hye (Yonhap)The three opposition parties together hold 165 seats on the floor, short of a quorum of 200, which is two-thirds of the 300-seat Assembly.But ironically, as binding as the impeachment may be, this may be a less harmful solution for Park, considering the precedent of the late President Roh Moo-hyun.The then-opposition conservative party had motioned for the impeachment of the liberal president in 2004, but soon was hit by political backfire as the Constitutional Court dismissed the motion.It is, in fact, the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea that is refraining from suggesting impeachment, as it claims the months-long procedure would only buy more time for the distressed president and ruling party.Voluntary resignationDifferentiating themselves from the main opposition, the two minority opposition parties -- the runner-up People’s Party and progressive Justice Party -- assert that immediate resignation is the only acceptable response from a president who has utterly lost the nation’s trust.If Park decides to resign, though the choice seems unlikely, the Constitution states that a by-election be held within 60 days to elect a successor, who would take office not for the remaining of the predecessor’s term, but for a full five-year term. Until then, the prime minister would fill in.The only plausible reason Park may resort to this scenario -- and become the nation’s first democratically elected president to step down mid-term -- is that she has already reached a political dead end, only facing harsher consequences otherwise.The president’s approval rating, since recording a record-low of 5 percent on Nov. 4, still remained in the 5-11 percent range as of Monday, depending on the pollster.This unseen near zero public support, combined with a series of massive protests held each weekend, has already posed critical challenges for the president’s state operations.It has, however, been the consistent stance of the Blue House that a state leadership vacuum would only further intensify the current political chaos, as well as increase risks on the nation’s economy.Park’s resignation has also been shunned by the ruling conservative Saenuri Party, which has no leading presidential hopeful other than UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, whose affiliation with the party remains speculative.By Bae Hyun-jung (tellme@heraldcorp.com)			[코리아헤럴드] [K-POP HERALD] [페이스북] <ⓒKoreaHerald(www.koreaherald.com)무단전재 및 재배포 금지>"
[BUSINESS ANALYSIS] Sober assessment of the Korean economy,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000070512?sid=108,"Fri, 18 Jan 2008 10:01:00 +0900","			 This is the second in a two-part interview series with renowned economist and University of Cambridge Professor Chang Ha-joon. - Ed.He`s been acclaimed as one of the most promising young economists in academia. Professor Chang Ha-joon, of the University of Cambridge has already established himself as a leading global authority in the field of developmental economics, and he has a lot to say in regards to the development of Seoul`s economy. Academic fast-track  Born into a scholarly family (his father Chang Jae-shik is a former commerce minister and his brother Chang Ha-suk is also a well-known professor), Chang has accomplished much in the field of economics in a relatively short period of time. After graduating from Seoul National University, Chang received his Ph.D. from the Faculty of Economics and Politics at Cambridge in 1992.It was there the scholar formed his ideas regarding economical development and quickly garnered praise from his peers through his prolific publications. He has advocated a somewhat middle-ground approach between the prevailing polarized economic views of central planning versus unvarnished free-trade capitalist advocacy. The professor supports a broader approach to economic thinking, whereby a developing country considers its socio-economic factors as well as its unique history in formulating an appropriate policy. These recommendations go against the grain to a certain extent, as most poor nations have been pushed by organizations like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to follow a cookie-cutter approach to development. Scholarly success Some of Chang`s views have been articulated in numerous economic treatises that have been well received in the academic community. One of his seminal works is a book entitled ""Kicking Away the Ladder - Development Strategy in Historical Perspective"" published in 2002. In it, Chang argued that contrary to popular belief, the so-called advanced countries, including the United States and Great Britain, blatantly employed interventionist policies during their developmental period. These nations, once reaching the top of the food chain, then cynically spread the gospel of unfettered markets and free trade. According to Chang, they have used strong-arm tactics in pressuring less-advanced nations to attempt development in a disadvantageous manner, hence the analogy ""kicking away the ladder.""  Another highly acclaimed and more recent book, ""Bad Samaritans: Rich Nations, Poor Policies and the Threat to the Developing World"" published in 2007, continues the examination of ""bully"" nations who do not practice what they preach. An ironic twist on the biblical ""Good Samaritan"" parable, Chang recounts how the developed nations (the usual suspects such as the United States, Great Britain, etc.) and even not-quite developed nations like South Korea have historically been shamelessly protectionist but now under the banner of World Bank/IMF loan-sharking, are demanding poorer countries to follow a benchmark that never existed and is markedly detrimental to their self-interests. ""Bad Samaritans"" has been praised by prominent economists and experts from various schools of thought, from Joseph Stiglitz to Noam Chomsky as a witty, cogent argument against the growing tide of free-trade expansionism.These works among others led Chang to be bestowed with the 2003 Gunnar Myrdal Prize, and the 2005 Wassily Leontief Prize for Advancing the Frontiers of Economic Thought, two very prestigious awards in the field of economics.  Focus on Korea  Academic laurels aside, Chang has obviously kept a close eye on the economic development of his native South Korea. Many of his opinions however, do not always mesh with the conventional wisdom of the nation`s policymakers. Especially with close public scrutiny of the imminent changes to take place when President-elect Lee Myung-bak takes over in February, Professor Chang advocates a common-sense approach (detailed in part one of this interview) when dealing with the country`s economic problems. He stresses that a keen sense of history and sociological factors must be dutifully evaluated before proceeding with any major plans.Professor Chang has written and lectured extensively on the Korean economic situation. One of the points he has raised in the past is that the ambition to become ""developed"" does not simply imply ""becoming rich"" as most people think. He points out the fact that oil-rich countries like Saudi Arabia are far from being considered developed. Rather Korea should consider carefully what it means to be an advanced country. For Chang, Korea will be ""developed"" when it utilizes advanced technology and knowledge and synergistically implements those things into an effective system.In part two of The Korea Herald`s interview with Professor Chang, he discusses his views and recommendations as South Korea faces a challenging economic period and moves forward in that drive to become one of the world`s developed economies.KH: You`ve been described by your peers and other commentators as a ""contrarian."" Do you feel this is an apt description? Chang: In the sense that I don`t mind saying things that go against conventional wisdom, I am a contrarian. However, I am not a contrarian in the sense of saying ""contrary"" things just to be different from others.KH: After a cursory glance at your writings, many casual readers would not be remiss to assume that you often advocate a protectionist approach and are not averse to social welfare state policies. For a layperson to understand, how would you describe your school of thought? Chang: I don`t belong to any ""school."" I take what I think is good from everyone - from Friedrich Hayek to Karl Marx, so to speak. I advocate protectionism where it is necessary, while endorsing free trade where it is beneficial. Same with the welfare state. As I mentioned in one of my earlier answers, I think it has a very useful role to play, but I would not insist on having one in a poor country where the lack of tax and other administrative capacities make its running very difficult.KH: Korea`s economic development since the devastation of the Korean War, described by some as ""The Miracle on the Han River,"" has been well-documented as a success story. In your analysis, how do you assess Korea`s growth so far? Chang: Korea, together with Japan, Taiwan, Singapore, and Hong Kong, has achieved one of the fastest socio-economic transformations in human history. What Korea has achieved in terms of the increase in living standard in my life time of 44 years is equivalent to what Britain has achieved over the last two and half centuries and what the United States has achieved during the last century and half. If I were British, I could have been born during the reign of George III, in the late 18th century. We Koreans have lived through one of the most dramatic changes in human history and few realize the significance of their experiences.KH: But there is a current dichotomy in Korean economic perception where, despite an average of nearly 5 percent annual growth in gross domestic product, a rising per capita income, and brisk exports, the media always trumpets the sentiments of the average Korean who feels the economy is in the doldrums. The man on the street feels they are just as downtrodden as during the ""IMF period"".Chang: Absolute growth rate is one thing, but what makes Koreans worried is the slowdown. The country used to grow at seven, eight, or even nine percent only a decade ago. Compared to those, five percent does not look good.But more importantly, life has become harder for ordinary people. The benefits of what growth we have achieved have been distributed more unevenly in the last decade. Moreover, with the steep increase in job insecurity, due to the rise in the share of ""temporary"" workers and the end of ""lifetime employment"" for the white-collar workers in large firms, more people than ever are haunted by uncertain futures.KH: One of the suggested solutions to improve the nation`s lot is free trade. Your recent book ""Bad Samaritans"" blows a lot of holes into the ""World is Flat"" (famous book by Thomas Friedman advocating globalization) argument. However, despite the stagnated World Trade Organization process, we do see a preponderance of major bilateral free trade agreements signed between mutually interested nations, bullied or not. Are all aspects of globalization bad and is it really feasible for a country like South Korea to revert back into its ""Hermit Kingdom"" shell? Chang: Globalization brings lots of benefits, although it has its costs, unlike what some globalization enthusiasts want us to believe. All I am against is the particular form of globalization that dominates our time - that is, uncontrolled neo-liberal globalization.Those who argue that Korea has to open up more in order to ""join the tide of globalization"" are being disingenuous. Korea is already a highly open and globalized country. It would not become a ""hermit kingdom"" simply because it will not sign a free-trade agreement with the United States or does not deregulate its economy like Dubai. It is like telling someone who is worried about car emissions that he is against cars themselves.KH: Another recommendation is the ramping-up of Korea`s service sector development. Some pundits advocate following the Dubai or Singapore city-state model. Focusing mainly on industrial development is no longer tenable as a future growth engine, according to those pundits. Why shouldn`t we follow this so-called Singapore benchmark? Chang: Unlike what those pundits say, Singapore is not a service-based economy. It produces 35 percent more manufacturing output per capita than Korea does.Dubai is a city-state relying on services, but it is a country with less than quarter of a million citizens. Even including the foreign workers, which make up over 80 percent of the workforce, the country`s population is less than 1.5 million. Korea, with 50 million people, cannot follow that model. Even if it could, there is no room for another Singapore or Hong Kong in Asia. Dubai succeeded exactly because there was no one else in the region offering the kind of financial services it does.Also, why do those people think Korea can succeed in services, when it cannot in manufacturing? First of all, it sounds silly to argue that we abandon what we are already good at and try to do something that we are still not good at. Moreover, are the other countries specializing in services going to sit around and wait for Korea to take them over? We need to build on our strengths.KH: Overall, would you say you are optimistic or pessimistic in regards to Korea`s economic future? Chang: If things continue in the direction it has for the last ten years since the 1997 financial crisis, I am rather pessimistic. Due to the changes in our economic system made in the last ten years, we are not investing as much as before, enterprises are losing their ""animal spirits"", clever young people only seek secure jobs, like doctors and lawyers, and do not want to become scientists and engineers, who are the people who will come up with innovations that will drive the economy in the future. These do not make a great future for the country. I hope our leaders change the direction we are going before it is too late.Perhaps it is not the most optimistic of evaluations, but those who view the professor`s views as purely a scholarly exercise would be surprised to discover that his economic philosophy has had significant political influence in the case of one South American nation. The current president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, a former economist himself, has publicly stated that his crucial academic influence has come from Professor Chang himself.Whether policymakers here eventually adopt some of Chang`s economic prescriptions remain to be seen. The Lee Myung-bak transition team appears to be rolling full-steam ahead with policies that the professor has voiced some skepticism about. Whatever the outcome and immediate future of the nation`s development, the debate over which direction to take the country`s economy rages on, with a somewhat uncertain future. What is for certain is that Professor Chang will continue to be a thought-provoking and sometimes ""contrarian"" voice in the field of Korean economics.By Henry Shinn (henryshinn@heraldm.com)"
[Kosdaq Star] Time for Cafe24 to reap what it sows,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000198886?sid=104,"Sun, 01 Apr 2018 17:48:00 +0900","This is the 53rd in a series of articles analyzing major companies traded on the tech-heavy Kosdaq market. — Ed.Profitability is undeniably the key prerequisite for a firm seeking an initial public offering on the second-tier Kosdaq market.Showing a stable income has long been the clearest signal for market operator Korea Exchange and other relevant financial authorities to predict an IPO-aspirant company’s stock performance.But with changes in the speed and characteristics of the tech-savvy market, the financial authorities have recently allowed IPO-seeking firms to go through an alternative to such requirements, locally-dubbed the “Tesla policy.”Through a high-profile IPO attempt late last year, Cafe24 became the first company to be listed on Kosdaq without meeting profitability requirements.As an e-commerce technology provider dedicated to online fashion malls, its revenue has been overshadowed by investment expenses, leading to net loss and operating loss for five consecutive years until 2016.But the firm — a Korean equivalent to Canadian e-commerce firm Shopify — managed to go public on Feb. 8 thanks to the state-sponsored policy.Since then, Cafe24 has shown stellar growth in the market for the past two months. Cafe24 on Friday closed at 127,500 won ($120), up 7.4 percent from the previous trading day. This is more than double that of its offering price at 57,000 won fixed in January.For the past 20 trading days, the share price jumped 41 percent, while the foreign ownership ratio soared to 13 percent on Friday, from 4.6 percent 20 trading days before.Also on Friday, Cafe24’s market cap came to 1.13 trillion won, the 31st-largest in the stock market home to some 1,200 companies.Cafe24 touches on a variety of aspects of internet solutions for online fashion shops in its business. The commission fee for such solutions, ranging from payment gateway, domain addresses, messaging services to a platform that allows store owners to create a multi-language website, are major sources of revenue. Cafe24 also plays the role of online advertisement agency and web hosting agency, another source of income through commission fees.Separate from this, Cafe24 operates centers for entrepreneurs or aspiring founders that offer training programs on market analysis, taxation, trademarks and copyright. Also, the company runs 30 shared office spaces that accompany photography studios.An internal view of SOHO Business Center, Cafe24's shared working space. (Cafe24)Cafe24 has provided such solutions to some 1.5 million online shopping malls as of 2017, while some 67,500 of them are devoted to foreign direct sales of fashion products.Over 90 percent of its net income has stemmed from the domestic market, home to Korean online women’s fashion brand leaders such as “IMVELY,” “Mixxmix” and “HOTPING.”Kim Kyu-ri, an analyst at Shinhan Financial Investment, wrote in a recent note that time is ripe for Cafe24 to start seeing profits, while major investments — mostly workforce expansion — were completed last year.Kim projected the operating margin ratio would stand at 11.4 percent in 2018, while the net profit would rise 19.1 percent on-year.Founded in 1999, the company has been in the red from 2012 to 2016. Without the Tesla policy, Cafe24 would have been unable to prove its eligibility to go public. Traditionally, a firm had to submit its proof of decent performance -- when it comes to such issues as net profit or return-on-equity -- least 2 billion won in yearly net profit a year prior to the application or recorded return-on-equity at 10 percent.The operating losses originated from “increase in costs from overseas expansion,” according to Kim, citing sales-to-administrative expense ratio that averaged 101 percent from 2013 to 2016 and a decrease in the ratio to 81.5 percent in 2017 and 75.3 percent in 2018.With the Tesla policy, introduced in December 2016, Cafe24 was able to skirt IPO requirements and instead turned to three prerequisites -- market cap, continued revenue increase and the absolute volume of revenue -- for firms without profit.When it applied for an IPO through listing in October 2017, the market cap topped 400 billion won on Korea’s over-the-counter market, far exceeding the minimum requirement at 50 billion won. Its revenue grew 20.4 percent on average for two years — 17.9 percent in 2015 and 22.9 percent in 2016 — exceeding the requirement at 20 percent. Also a year prior to application, its net sales came to 101.9 billion won, above the minimum requirement at 3 billion won.Cafe24 gained a preliminary approval by the KRX in December, and it took another two months to have the firm listed on Kosdaq.This year, Cafe24 hinted that it will primarily target the Japanese market, where the firm observed an increased demand for Korean fashion products through direct sales online.By Son Ji-hyoung (consnow@heraldcorp.com)[코리아헤럴드] [K-POP HERALD] [페이스북] <ⓒKoreaHerald(www.koreaherald.com)무단전재 및 재배포 금지>		"
[ANALYSIS] North Korea's missile launch raises concern,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000174566?sid=104,"Wed, 22 Jun 2016 16:41:00 +0900","Japan`s Ground Self-Defense Force on Tuesday prepare the launch of a Patriot Advanced Capability-3 interceptor unit deployed to counter North Korea`s possible launch of a ballistic missile in Tokyo. (Yonhap)North Korea on Wednesday managed to fly its intermediate-range ballistic missile for 400 kilometers for the first time, sparking mixed assessments on its degree of success after its previous five launches went down in supposed failures.After its first Musudan missile launch at around 5:58 a.m. exploded in yet another failure, the communist state fired another missile about two hours later at 8:05 a.m.The second projectile’s flight, while well short of the 500 kilometer suspected minimum flight range of the Musudan, was assessed to have managed to sustain flight for a significant range. The Joint Chiefs of Staff said South Korea and the U.S. are conducting an assessment on the second launch as to whether it can be evaluated as a success.South Korea and the U.S. condemned the launch as a violation of the U.N. Security Council resolution. The UNSC in March adopted resolution 2270 that encompasses the strongest economic sanctions against Pyongyang to date.“Not only is the missile launch a clear violation of the UNSC resolution that bans it from conducting any launch using ballistic missile technology, it is a grave danger to the peace and security of the Korean Peninsula and the international society,” said Foreign Ministry spokesman Cho June-hyuck. “The government strongly condemns it (the launch) and solemnly warns that the North will face even stronger sanctions and pressure by us and the international society.”The U.S. State Department said it will raise its concerns at the U.N. to hold Pyongyang responsible for the actions.On the coattails of the launches, Cheong Wa Dae held a National Security Council meeting with the ministers of foreign affairs, unification and defense and the chief of National Intelligence Service to assess the North’s missile technology along with possible responses.During a meeting with the National Unification Advisory Council, President Park Geun-hye said, “Should North Korea go ahead with an additional nuclear test, the government will deal with it more sternly together with the international community. The North Korean regime must realize that at the end of reckless provocation only awaits complete isolation and self-destruction.” Musudan has a presumed range of 3,000 to 4,000 kilometers and can put the U.S. base in Guam within its striking range. Deployed for use since 2007, its presence has been a looming threat over Seoul as well as U.S. forces deployed in the Asia-Pacific region.But its first launch in April -- along with three subsequent ones prior to Wednesday -- have all ended in failures, raising questions about the legitimacy of the Musudan’s capacity.South Korean military, however, admitted that the North may have made some sort of breakthrough after the series of botched launches.“We suspect that there has been some progress in the functions of (the missile’s) engine,” said a Joint Chiefs of Staff official. A government official was quoted by local media as saying that the Musudan had flown 400 kilometers because Pyongyang shot it at a higher degree than usual. This sparked speculations that the North had deliberately reduced the range of the missile so that it will not fly into Japanese territory.The missile, fired from Wonsan, Gangwon Province, is presumed to have flown toward the East Sea. Military officials confirmed that the missile was shot at a higher degree, but declined to comment on what happened to the missile.Some officials downplayed the significance of the launch, saying it was a partial success of a random missile that has never actually been fired prior to this year.“Weapons are usually deployed after a string of test launches, but the Musudan bypassed this process. Just because a few managed not to be blown up, doesn’t mean it is a success,” said a military official. He added that the repeated launches of the Musudan, despite its failures, may just be an attempt by the North Korean military to cater to its youthful leader Kim Jong-un’s unreasonable demands.Kim in March ordered his troops to complete a test firing of a ballistic missile that can be armed with a nuclear warhead.But Kim Dong-yup, a professor at the Institute for Far Eastern Studies, said that the true purpose of the launch may not be to prepare the Musudan for actual use. Instead, he suspected that the launch is part of a bigger plan to acquire or boast the capacity to conduct a nuclear strike on the mainland U.S. The reentry vehicle is a critical technology for ballistic missiles. While the North is presumed to have the reentry technology for shorter-range missiles, the military has presumed that it will take some time for Pyongyang to acquire one for the intercontinental ballistic missiles.ICBMs with a range of over 10,000 kilometers have peak altitude of approximately 1,200 kilometers. Reentry from this height is accompanied by high pressure and temperature that inflict damages to the warhead. Citing the Japanese Defense Ministry, some news outlets said that the second missile flew to heights of over 1,000 kilometers, which borders the conventional peak altitude of ICBMs. The South Korean military did not confirm the speculation.“Musudan is merely the means to an end. ... By reducing the range and shooting it higher, it can simulate similar environment as the reentry of the ICBM,” Kim said.He pointed out that the North has demonstrated many aspects of a nuclear missile, such as engines, solid fuel -- which makes the missiles harder to detect -- a detonating device and nuclear warhead.“North Korea has been boasting its nuclear capacity, with the outside world not being threatened. This is because it has no reentry vehicle (for the ICBM). Acquiring this will complete the North’s nuclear capacity.”He said it is too early to determine whether the North’s launch was a reentry test, as he suspects, or if it had succeeded.“If (the launch) did managed to simulate (the reentry) of the ICBM, it can potentially become a frighteningly significant success.” By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)<ⓒKoreaHerald(www.koreaherald.com)무단전재 및 재배포 금지>"
[NEWS ANALYSIS] Chaebol’s governance restructuring hangs in balance,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000183827?sid=004,"Sun, 19 Feb 2017 15:56:00 +0900","(123rf)South Korea’s key conglomerates are expected to closely watch the National Assembly’s move this week over whether lawmakers would pass pending bills to limit their ownership in the course of governance restructuring.In light of the arrest of Samsung’s de facto leader Lee Jae-yong by the special prosecution over charges including bribery, hiding assets overseas and perjury, opposition lawmakers are pushing hard to pass the “economic democracy” bills that aim to restrict chaebol owners’ control over affiliates. The conglomerates have been moving to break the chain of circular shareholding amid heightened calls for transparent governance in recent years. Many of them have been trying to create a holding company structure to simplify the chain in a way that can also strengthen the leader’s control. The companies, however, are facing a double whammy as the opposition-led Assembly has also introduced a series of bills to revise laws to tighten the process of creating holding companies.The bills include a Commercial Law revision, proposed by Rep. Park Yong-jin of the Democratic Party of Korea, which aims to prevent a newly-formed entity from offering new shares owned by a separated company in the case of a spinoff. The bill seeks to ban corporate owners from getting voting rights through stocks they receive from new entities.Samsung for one, is to be hit the hardest in pursuing a holding company structure if lawmakers grant greenlight to the revision bill at the National Assembly’s plenary sessions scheduled on Thursday and March 2. Samsung Electronics had announced in November that it would split the tech giant into a holding company and an operating unit within six months. Observers said doing so would strengthen Lee’s management control with more voting rights from a new company going to Lee, under the current law.The revision bill, however, would force Lee to additionally buy higher stakes at Samsung Electronics if he wants more control, but the tech giant’s market cap currently sits at 266.3 trillion won ($231.5 billion), as of Friday, which makes it quite costly for Lee.“Considering political situations, it is difficult for Samsung Electronics to push the split in February or March,” said Yoon Tae-ho, an analyst at Korea Investment & Securities“The best scenario for Samsung is for the Commercial Law revision bill to be voted down at the Assembly and the company pushes the governance restructuring at the end of a presidential election, maybe in May.” In South Korea, the next presidential election is likely to be advanced to May from its usual December this year, as the Constitutional Court is expected to rule on the fate of disgraced President Park Geun-hye in March, following her parliamentary impeachment sparked by the influence-peddling scandal involving her confidante Choi Soon-sil.Meanwhile, retail and snack food giant Lotte Group plans to split and merge its four affiliates including Lotte Shopping, Lotte Confectionery, Lotte Chilsung and Lotte Food. Market watchers say the group is less vulnerable than Samsung to a law revision but can be somewhat affected. Lotte, for the time being, is likely to split each affiliate into investment and operating companies, and merge investment entities into a holding firm. In doing so, Lotte can seek to enhance Chairman Shin Dong-bin’s management control while weakening the circular shareholding chains. As Shin and his elder brother Shin Dong-joo, former vice chairman of Lotte Holdings in Japan, hold a similar portion of shares in Lotte affiliates, spinning off Lotte’s core subsidiaries will rarely affect their control over the group, Yoon said.For Lotte, scaling up Shin Dong-bin’s control over the group to a stronger level than that of Dong-joo will be the core issue in Lotte’s transition to a holding company structure, he noted.The nation’s largest shipbuilder Hyundai Heavy Industries also announced last month to split the company into six units and turn one of them, tentatively named Hyundai Robotics, into a holding company. At the upcoming shareholders’ meeting on Feb. 27, the company plans to get an approval for its plan to split in April and relist the holding company on the bourse in May. This is to break the circular shareholding structure among Hyundai Heavy Industries, Hyundai Samho Heavy Industries and Hyundai Mipo Dockyard.If the National Assembly passes a Fair Trade Act revision bill which would force corporate owners to mandatorily sell their stocks in the affiliates prior to the spinoff, the control of Chung Mong-joon, who has a 10.2 percent controlling stake in Hyundai Heavy Industries, will be weakened, said Lee Sang-hyeon, an analyst at Hi Investment & Securities.“Considering the power transition from Chung Mong-joon to his eldest son Chung Ki-sun (senior vice president of Hyundai Heavy Industries), Chung’s grip will be further weakened,” Lee said.Hyundai Motor Group has a similar structure to that of Hyudnai Heavy Industries. The automaker’s governance structure is circular, starting from Hyundai Mobis to Hyundai Motor to Kia Motors and back to Hyundai Mobis.Although the automaker did not announce any plan for a transition into a holding company, some raise the possibility, reports said. By Kim Yoon-mi (yoonmi@heraldcorp.com)[코리아헤럴드] [K-POP HERALD] [페이스북] <ⓒKoreaHerald(www.koreaherald.com)무단전재 및 재배포 금지>		"
[Jeffrey Robertson] Time to retake the foreign policy narrative,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000186080?sid=104,"Wed, 19 Apr 2017 17:52:00 +0900","			On April 15, global attention turned to Korea. Television, internet and social media feeds prioritized Korea over other breaking stories. Korea was at the center of the world’s attention. But it wasn’t South Korea. Global attention focused on Pyongyang and the 105th anniversary of the birth of Kim Il-sung.North Korea controls the foreign policy narrative – “stories” that shape the relationship between the state and its partners. It’s demonstrated incredible continuity in portraying itself as an irrational, threatening, and dangerous state that needs to be pacified, bribed, and appeased. Controlling the narrative comes easy to North Korea.North Korea is media-savvy. It’s discovered a magical formula, which encourages the parade observation, guesswork and speculation of Kremlinology, with the degenerate gossip and commentary of K-pop tabloids. Turn on any news network, and “experts” discuss Kim Jong-un’s strategic aims, missile size, fashion, or boyhood basketball dreams. This is North Korea’s image -- weird, distant, and startling. Inaccessibility means what passes as research and analysis would in any other case be considered speculative sensationalism. Add to this an incoherent, sensation-loving, truth-challenged, Twitter-obsessed foreign policy partner, and the media soil is fertile for North Korea’s domination. For no other reason than US policy, North Korea captured a global audience for the mundane opening of a startlingly ugly street in Pyongyang. South Korea has always faced an uphill battle to impact the foreign policy narrative. Books on “Korean foreign policy” on Google or Amazon show one or two lonely texts on South Korea and an abundance on North Korea. More recently, the impeachment process left South Korea’s foreign policy rudderless. During two periods South Korea wrested control from North Korea -- the Sunshine Policy, and the green growth initiative of the Lee administration -- and the former only occurred with the acquiescence of North Korea.The green growth initiative deserves greater attention. How was South Korea able to control the foreign policy narrative during this period?First, the green growth initiative was sound, well-designed and above-all, innovative policy. It addressed the twin challenges of global economic growth and environmental sustainability -- the biggest challenges humanity faces. The Lee administration addressed this challenge with a well-coordinated campaign that included establishment and hosting of the Global Green Growth Institute, the Climate Technology Center & Network, and the Green Climate Fund. South Korea was a global leader.Second, the green growth initiative coincided with an expansion in public diplomacy. Global attention turned to South Korea as it hosted the G20 Leaders’ Summit, the High-Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness, and the Nuclear Security Summit. At the same time, the Korea Foundation’s programs and Psy’s serendipitous Gangnam Style, promoted Korea internationally. However, South Korea’s control of the foreign policy narrative didn’t last. Before the Lee administration’s end, cracks appeared. On coming to power, the Park Geun-hye administration, all but discarded green growth. Despite subsequent efforts to position it in the new government’s agenda, momentum was lost. Green growth and control of the foreign policy narrative was forfeited to a lack of policy continuity.South Korea faces structural challenges in the maintenance of foreign policy continuity. Single five-year presidential terms; an imbalance in executive/legislative influence; a weak party system with a preference for differentiation among leaders; and the absence of bipartisanship on core issues impedes foreign policy continuity. But continuity is important. State representatives judge future behavior on previous behavior. By demonstrating continuity, a state shows consistency and credibility, and can better justify policy action. Most importantly, continuity increases a state’s control over the foreign policy narrative.In forthcoming research with the Korea Economic Institute of America, I explore options to address the challenge of policy continuity in South Korea. While constitutional revision would be the ultimate solution, there are other options – policies that would act as a supplement and ultimately complement to constitutional revision, if it were to occur. Policies to strengthen bureaucratic and legislative capacity, and increase public engagement in foreign policy processes could make a difference. Addressing the problem of foreign policy continuity should be a priority for the next South Korean administration. It would serve as a means to strengthen South Korea’s capacity to address better known foreign policy challenges, such as THAAD, Chinese economic pressure, or the U.S. alliance. Perhaps most importantly, addressing the challenge of continuity would allow South Korea to regain control over the foreign policy narrative.By Jeffrey RobertsonJeffrey Robertson is visiting fellow at the Asia-Pacific College of Diplomacy at the Australian National University and an assistant professor at Yonsei University in South Korea.

Strengthening economic alliance meets U.S. protectionism,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/640/0000037719?sid=101,"Tue, 25 Apr 2023 19:56:00 +0900","       Korea and the United States are at a crucial juncture in economic cooperation after the two countries pledged to work together in a wider range of areas, such as supply chain management for key technologies such as semiconductors and electric vehicle (EV) batteries.    The initiatives, which are seen taking the two countries beyond being merely trading partners, will set the tone for the future of the Korea-U.S. alliance, which is entering its 70th year.    While the call for deep economic ties has contributed to substantially increasing trade volumes and investment flows between the allies, it will be put to the test in the face of incentives and regulations favoring domestic companies.    Korean companies like Hyundai Motor, SK On and Samsung SDI announced over 10 trillion won ($7.4 billion) of investment on Tuesday while President Yoon Suk Yeol is in the United States for a state visit.    Other large Korean companies, including Samsung Electronics, committed billions of dollars to the United States last year, dominating the rankings in terms of new manufacturing projects in the country.      The United States is also slated to become Korea's largest export market this month, beating out China, which held the top spot for 20 years.    The trend is running straight into legislative reality, such as the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and CHIPS and Science Act. The laws either block Korean companies from receiving subsidies or impose strict conditions while backing U.S. car manufacturers and chipmakers.    Korean government officials and Korean company executives are scratching their heads and questioning where the United States is actually committed to maintaining and building on the economic relationship.    At a relationship crossroads  What followed the amicable visit by U.S. President Joe Biden last May was a string of laws that come with certain restrictions against Korean chip producers and automakers in favor of U.S. companies.    The country's two largest carmakers are not eligible for the incentive at all — at least until 2025 — as only models assembled in North America are eligible.    ""The IRA law does not consider the Korean companies' situation at all, and essentially, it doesn't have to,"" Park Chul-wan, a professor of automotive engineering at Sejong University, said. ""It's just a rule that maximizes the benefits for the United States.""      From left, Hyundai Motor Group Executive Chair Euisun Chung, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, and Jose Munoz, president at Hyundai Motor, celebrate with a champagne toast during the official groundbreaking for Hyundai's EV plant in Georgia on Oct. 25, 2022. [HYUNDAI MOTOR GROUP]     The rule came as Hyundai Motor announced a $5.4 billion electric vehicle plant in Georgia, its first EV-dedicated factory, last year.    The company's chief Euisun Chung promised another $5 billion investment in the United States through 2025 for innovative mobility technologies at his meeting with Biden during the president's three-day visit to Seoul last May.    Seo Chang-bae, a professor of Chinese studies at Pukyong National University, said in a forum event on April 18 that the new bills are ""attempts to keep Korean companies in check, not just Chinese companies,"" given Korean firms' large market share in the U.S. market.    ""The IRA seems to target China, but the essence is that the United States [is targeting] fast-growing foreign companies in the U.S. market.""    To receive subsidies under the CHIPS and Science Act, for instance, chipmakers must disclose sensitive business data, including yield rates.    The yield rate, the amount of a silicon wafer that is successfully made into dies, is considered a key indicator to determine a chip producer's manufacturing capabilities. It is often confidential.    The U.S. Commerce Department also limits recipients of CHIPS and Science Act funding from investing in the expansion of semiconductor manufacturing in China.    ""The U.S. regulations put us in a tough position,"" an executive at Samsung Electronics, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said.    ""This adds to the burden of carrying out a manufacturing project in the United States, a country with high labor costs,"" the executive said.    Brisk trade  Despite the apparent rift, trade between the two countries is at an unprecedented level.    The United States was Korea's largest export partner in early April, the first time in two decades. The long-time No.1 had been China.           Exports to the United States jumped 32.1 percent, while those to China plunged 31.9 percent this month through April 10 from a year earlier, according to the Korea Customs Service.    The shifting trend started taking shape last year.    Korea's exports to the United States reached a record high last year at $109.8 billion, up 14.5 percent compared to the previous year.    Exports to China fell 4.4 percent to $155.8 billion, affected by a prolonged trade tension between Washington and Beijing and weakening demand for chips.    ""At this rate, monthly exports to the United States will likely exceed exports to China for the first time in around 20 years,"" Chang Sang-sik, head of analysis at the Korea International Trade Association, said.    ""China is increasing its independence and trying to make its own products rather than importing from overseas, especially the intermediate goods,"" Chang said. ""Sluggish semiconductor exports are also a big problem, with the prices getting cheaper and cheaper over the years.""    Chang added that exports to the United States are expected to rise for the next few years following Korean companies' massive investments in the country.    ""With Korean automakers and battery makers building big manufacturing plants in the United States, exports of related materials and equipment will have to increase,"" Chang said.    ""Also, with the lingering tension between the United States and China, Korea is fulfilling the empty seats.""    Korea's exports to the United States have been reaching new highs every year over the past seven years, with the volume rising particularly steeper since 2012 when a free trade agreement between the two countries went into effect.    The value of the trade totaled $191.6 billion last year, double from $100.8 billion in 2011. When compared to 1965, when the Korea International Trade Association (KITA) began collecting related data, it is a 638-fold jump.    Auto has been the latest No. 1 export category to the United States since 2012. Before that, apparel and textiles were the biggest export items to the United States.    Korea's auto exports to the United States came in at an all-time high of $22.2 billion in 2022, around three times the $8.1 billion for semiconductors.    ""As of the trade agreement signing, the Korea-U.S. alliance developed from a security alliance to an economic alliance,"" Trade Minister Ahn Duck-geun said at a seminar held by the KITA on Monday.             Investment has also risen dramatically. Korea invested a total of $43.9 billion in the United States between 2002 and 2011, while the volume jumped 3.4-fold to $149.5 billion between 2012 and 2021, according to data from the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy.    The U.S. investment in Korea also doubled to $48 billion between 2012 and 2021, while it came in at $24.3 billion between 2002 and 2011.    Partners for ""resilient"" supply chain  The United States made it clear that it will bring more chip and EV-related manufacturing facilities to maintain its position in the industry and counter the influence of China.      In the EV segment, joint ventures are the typical form of cooperation between companies.    A series of joint battery plants announced by Korean battery companies and major U.S. automakers is a reflection of how the countries are leveraging their longstanding military ties into a broader economic partnership.      Korean companies have announced a total of 11 joint battery factories over the past three years in North America.    The most recent project involves SK On and Hyundai Motor building an electric vehicle battery plant in Georgia, a $5 billion commitment announced on Tuesday.      SK On's battery plant in Georgia [SK ON]     Korea has also been the largest contributor to creating jobs in the United States.      Around 350,000 jobs were newly created in the United States through reshoring and foreign direct investment this year, and of them, Korea created more than 35,000, surpassing Vietnam's 22,500, Japan's 14,349 and Canada's 13,671.    General Motors and Ford, the two largest U.S. automakers, have already formed joint ventures with at least two Korean battery makers.      ""The United States and Korea have taken steps domestically to reduce their emissions, while making climate change an important part of their efforts to expand the U.S.-Korea alliance beyond traditional security and economic issues,"" Troy Stangarone, senior director at the Korean Economic Institute of America, wrote in a recent report.        Ultium Cells' Ohio plant. Ultium Cells is a 50:50 joint venture between LG Energy Solution and General Motors [LG ENERGY SOLUTION]    LG Energy Solution, Samsung SDI and SK On promised 40-trillion-won of investment in the United States by the end of 2025, with about half of the projects already being announced or in the process of construction.      LG Energy Solution has formed Ultium Cells, a 50:50 joint venture with General Motors, to build three plants, each in Ohio, Tennessee and Michigan. A total of 8.4 trillion won has been committed to the three plants by Ultium.      Ford, the No. 2 automaker in the United States, has established BlueOval SK, a joint venture with SK On, a subsidiary of SK Innovation. BlueOval SK is investing $11.4 billion to build two plants in Kentucky and one in Tennessee.    ""To qualify for the IRA incentive, U.S. automakers have no choice but to strengthen partnerships with Korean battery makers in order to produce as many EVs as possible while not using Chinese batteries,"" Lee Ho-geun, an automotive engineering professor at Daeduk University, said.    In chips, Korean chipmakers like Samsung Electronics and SK hynix have superior manufacturing capabilities, whereas U.S. companies have a dominant market position in chip equipment technology.    In complementing each other, Samsung Electronics pledged to build more chip fabrication plants in the United States, following its promise of a $17 billion investment in Taylor, Texas.    A new chipmaking factory is scheduled to be completed this year, according to Samsung Electronics CEO Kyung Kye-hyun in January.    U.S. chip equipment and materials suppliers are looking to build their research and manufacturing facilities, although the size is far smaller than those of Samsung Electronics.    Lam Research opened a research center in Yongin, Gyeonggi, in April, while Applied Materials will build its research facility in the province of Gyeonggi.    Promise put to test    The broader economic cooperation was pronounced during Biden's visit to Korea last May.    ""President Yoon and President Biden recognize that the future of the Alliance will be defined by common efforts to address 21st century challenges,"" the joint statement for the summit meeting read.    ""In this vein, the two Presidents pledge to deepen and broaden cooperation on critical and emerging technologies, and cyber security. Both leaders also pledge to develop, use, and advance technologies in line with shared democratic principles and universal values,"" it said.    The statement cited semiconductors, EV batteries, artificial intelligence, quantum technology, biotechnology, biomanufacturing and autonomous robotics as areas of cooperation.    The pivot toward supply chain came as the United States is seeking to cut China off from the supply of critical technologies while making the country resilient from a sudden shortage of electronic parts.    ""Korea and the United States reaffirmed their commitment to increasing bilateral investment in the private sector and building strategic economic and technology partnership by launching communication channels for jointly managing supply chain,"" Kang Gu-sang, an associate research fellow at Korea Institute for International Economic Policy, said.    Heads of four Korean conglomerates are accompanying Yoon in his state visit to the United States, raising the possibility of the negotiations being on the summit agenda.    ""There are still some possibilities that we can push the United States to revise the law to make it favorable to Korean companies,"" Lee said.    ""For example, the U.S. government eased the rule and allowed leased vehicles to get the incentive, which is fortunate for Hyundai and Kia,"" Lee said. ""We can see the change as the result of the Korean government's continuous negotiations with the U.S. government, and there is still room for more.""   "
[NEW ANALYSIS]Park Geun-hye: from princess to queen?,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000043611?sid=108,"Sun, 02 May 2004 13:32:00 +0900","			  The following is the last in a two-part series about the post-election Grand National Party. - Ed.By Lee Joo-hee  Grand National Party Chairwoman Park Geun-hye showed the power of serenity during the latest general elections, emerging as a savior to the Grand National Party when its support was tumbling because of its impeachment of President Roh Moo-hyun and a series of corruption cases.The GNP won 121 seats in the 299-member National Assembly, far below its majority 149 in the outgoing 273-member parliament, but well above devastating estimates it would only secure about 100.Experts and critics alike attributed her success in cutting back the expected losses to the memory of her late father, former President Park Chung-hee.But they also acknowledged her leadership, which successfully generated a wave of reform in the conservative GNP, with a soft yet stern voice.Following the the GNP`s semi-successful elections, Park is now leading a move for a change that would put the focus on policymaking and remove party wrangling.But she faces a new challenge, with a chorus of voices within the party opposing the change of its main conservative policy line and taking note of the rapid expansion of her strength. Park is considered a potential next president.""I consider the elections the last chance the people have given us (the GNP), and we will be sure to fashion a new political strategy devoted to policy, as we have promised,"" Park told The Korea Herald.""The GNP will no longer engage in groundless accusations, denunciation of rival parties or political wrangling in order to create a fair competitive ground among parties in the National Assembly,"" she said.Born in 1952 to Park Chung-hee and Yook Young-soo, Park Geun-hye spent most of her childhood in Cheong Wa Dae while her father ruled the country under his military regime from 1961 to 1979.Park Geun-hye entered the political scene as acting First Lady in 1974 after her mother was assassinated by Moon Se-kwang, a pro-North Korean, in Japan.Although just 22 years old at the time, Park Geun-hye charmed the public, displaying a mix of femininity and strength as she stood by her father`s side.Five years later another tragedy hit when her father was shot dead by his information chief Kim Jye-kyu in an uprising against his dictatorship.To this day, Park Chung-hee remains one of the most controversial presidents in Korean history, since he suppressed any democracy movement with an iron hand, yet propelled the war-stricken economy of the nation into one of the fastest growing industries in the world.After the assassination, Park left Cheong Wa Dae and spent most of her time doing social work and writing books. She never married Then, in 1997, Korea was thrown into economic turmoil by the foreign exchange crisis.Finally submitting to repeated calls to enter the political arena, Park joined the GNP in 1998 and won a seat in by-elections in Daegu, Gyeongsang Province.She quickly attracted the attention of voters, who reminisced about the rapid economic growth in the 1970s under her father`s rule. She was reelected in the 2002 general elections.Park`s signature style - delicately pulled up hair, small-waisted jackets and long skirts - also reflects her political stance: moderate reform.""My only goal is to develop our politics firmly and in steps, and I will put my all for the interest of the nation,"" Park said, while refusing to say whether she may seek the presidency in the future.The next parliament may be the most tricky period of her political career.While the factional structure within the GNP remains vague, with newly elected members shifting from one side to the other between reformative and conservative, Park is beginning to voice her determination to shake off the conservative side of the party.""It is simple. The GNP`s conservativeness needs to be cleared away. There`s no such thing as radical conservative or moderate conservative. Conservative is conservative,"" Park said.But calls for a multiple leadership system are growing within the party.The GNP has provisionally decided to hold its national caucus June 15 to pick its new leadership, and experts say it is crucial for the party to choose the right path to keep its parliamentary power in the incoming Assembly.""The GNP must take a reasonable conservative approach and discard its old image of constantly lagging behind the times as the age of voters continues to grow younger,"" said Prof. Chung Hae-gu of Sungkonghoe University.Park Geun-hye was effective in introducing a generation shift inside the party, and it`s time now for the party to move in a concerted policy line rather than depend on a sole figure, Chung added.(angiely@heraldm.com)   "
[R\&D POLICY IN KOREA (8)] Time to change space development approach,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000084144,"Mon, 03 Aug 2009 07:10:00 +0900","			This is the eighth in a series of articles introducing the Korean government`s R&D policies. Researchers at the Science & Technology Policy Institute will explain Korea`s R&D initiatives aimed at addressing major socioeconomic problems facing the nation. - Ed.By Cho Hwang-hee  It`s high time for Korea to review the benefits from its investment in space development. Over the past 20 years since 1990, Korea has invested about 2.9 trillion won ($2.35 billion) into this field. The large size of investment indicates that Korea`s space development has passed the initial period of infrastructure expansion and now is at a turning point for a takeoff into a higher stage of qualitative growth.The budget for space development totaled around 380 billion won from 1990 to 1995, a period where Korea sought to enter this high-tech field. The budget rose to 165 billion won per year on average since the establishment of the national space development plan in 1996. At the initial stage, the focus was on fostering human recourses through ""learning by doing."" For example, the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology concluded a deal with Surrey University in the United Kingdom in the early 1990s to build a small satellite and educate 20 researchers. The project cost 7 billion won. Those 20 Koreans dispatched to the university were able to develop their expertise in system engineering through participation in the process of satellite construction. Some of those Korean scientists started a company called Satreci (Satrec Initiative) in 2000 after their return to Korea. SI has a strong competitive edge in the small satellite market.Researchers of government-funded research institutes and those affiliated with private companies also had opportunities to learn about satellite manufacturing and management from American companies through on-the-job programs. In the case of rocket projectiles, it was hard to learn from overseas companies. Therefore, Korean researchers accumulated experience and expertise in system technology by themselves within the nation.If we were to say the first 10 years of Korea`s space development history was an infrastructure-building stage, the second half could be called a growth stage. In other words, the first half was a period of fostering human resources and establishing infrastructure, while the second half was a period of accumulating knowledge and experiences.Korea has launched a total of 10 satellites over the past 20 years, with four of them still stationed in space. Three new satellites are being manufactured while one is awaiting its launch. Korea has successfully developed three science rockets - KSR-I, KSR-II and KSR-III. Currently, it is engaged in development of a launch vehicle, KSLV-1.How strong is Korea`s space development capacity? Korea has accumulated experiences in developing satellites and science rockets. Based on such experiences, Korea`s space development has grown significantly in terms of quantity. When we think about national space development capacity, there are two factors to be considered: The capacity of research institutes and that of private companies. It`s easy to see from Figure 2 that Korea`s space development is still weak in terms of the capacity of private enterprises.Since the establishment of the Korea Aerospace Research Institute in 1987, many project reports and industrial development plans unveiled measures to boost the space industry. For example, the medium-term national space development plan released in 1996 presented a new goal for Korea`s space development - making the nation one of the top 10 powerhouses by 2015. The global space industry market has been dominated by the top five leaders.The size of the global space industry has been growing steadily, reaching $123 billion in 2007. American and European companies are the market leaders, followed by Japanese companies. A company with sales revenue of $1.5 billion can join the global top 10. Japanese companies are catching up fast thanks to their strong technological prowess.Korea`s overall competitiveness in space development ranks eighth in the world thanks largely to strong government demand. Yet in terms of private-sector competitiveness, Korea is behind Israel, one-40th of the American level and one-fourth of the Japanese and Chinese levels. What do these figures mean? They mean that Korea should develop competitive space companies if it is to become one of the top 10 global leaders.How does the competitiveness of private companies translate into the competitiveness of a nation? Strong companies create new job opportunities and spur the advancement of research in the related fields. Without such private companies, there would be no added-value created in the industry and, by extension, no contribution to the growth of employment and the national economy.Most companies shown in Table 3, including Boeing, an American commercial aircraft manufacturer, are global leaders in space development which depend heavily on government demand. Unlike Korea, governments in advanced nations procure complex system products from the private sector. Such practices have indeed been an engine for the growth of American and European space companies.Korea Aerospace Industries is more of an aircraft manufacturing company than a space company. The only Korean player in the global space industry is Satreci which produces small satellites. It`s hard for a nation to foster its space industry if there are no competitive space system builders. Without a system builder, it is difficult to create a vertically integrated space industry because there would only be parts or subsystem manufacturers who do not create much added-value.Recently, Korea`s space development budget has reached 300 billion won per year, with the size of the national space industry market estimated at 200 billion won a year. Such a growth is significant compared with the initial stage two decades ago. But there`s still much room for growth for the Korean space industry. Although the size of market demand is small compared with that of advanced nations, it`s pretty big when we consider the size of the Korean economy. Taking all these facts into account, we believe that Korea`s space development campaign has reached a point where the previous public sector-based development approach should shift to one based on cooperation between the public and private sectors.In Europe, one commonly used strategy is to use government demand as a tool to spur technological innovations. Government demand stimulates technology development, helps create added-value and encourages universities to strengthen research and educational functions to meet growing demand for professional knowledge. In other words, government demand creates a virtuous cycle.In Korea, however, technology innovation is still at the initial stage where state-funded corporations focus on introducing and mastering foreign technologies. As a result, no ecosystem has emerged in the Korean space industry. In case of Sweden, there are three major space companies: Rymsbolaget, Saab Space and Volvo Aero. Also, there are many start-up companies operating in the niche market. For instance, Umbickal Design (www.umbilicaldesign.se), which was set up by a graduate of Lund University in 2001, has big clients such as NASA and ESA. In addition, Angstrom Aerospace Corporation (www.aaerospace.com), which was established by a researcher of Uppsala University in 2005, manufactures ultra-small surveillance satellites (25 kg) that can be launched from retrofitted fighters.In the past, Korea`s automobiles and electronics/home appliance companies built systems using imported parts and technologies. This assembly process helped them sharpen their production skills and develop their own products. That`s how Korea`s automobiles and electronics/home appliance companies have grown into global giants. Although satellites and rocket projectiles are different from mass-produced automobiles and home appliances, we should take lessons from those success stories.Space technology development challenges researchers to develop technologies that can be used in the conditions of extreme situations. So when new space technologies are developed, they usually have a huge technological spillover effect. Let us compare the spillover effect of aircraft and automobile. The technology spillover effect of aircraft is three times as large as that of automobile. However, the industrial spillover effect of aircraft is only 1.4 percent of automobile. One can easily see that space technologies have a significant technology spillover effect on other industries.Space technologies can either be used directly for producing consumer goods and services or as useful tools for undertaking R&D. Examples of the first case includes gyroscopes, structural analysis methods, heat-resistant materials, hazard analysis critical control points, food preservation technologies (retort and lyophilization), GPS and automobile navigation, basketball shoes, lasers, CT scanner and bar codes. Examples of the second case include photovoltaic cells, fuel cells and reverse osmosis purifiers.NASA in the United States and JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) make constant efforts to promote commercial applications of space technologies. For instance, NASA introduces its newly developed space technologies and spin-off technologies in their publications like Tech Briefs, Technology Utilization Program Report and NASA`s Spinoff. In Japan, JAXA is keen to transfer space technologies to producers of civilian goods. Examples include Iljin Industry, Ltd. which developed building materials in 2007 using heat-resistant materials from satellite rocket projectiles, and Karasawa Fine Ltd. which commercialized hazardous wastes disposal processors in 2004. Developing space technologies is pivotal if Korea is to increase the spillover effect of new technologies.As the global space industry is in its maturity stage, price competitiveness is becoming increasingly important. Futron conducted a survey of satellite manufacturing companies in May 2004 and found out that it took an average of 30 months to launch a commercial communications satellite (from the moment a company receives an order to the moment the satellite blasts off). Lockheed Martin spent 24 months while SS/Loral spent 40 months. A delay in the delivery of a satellite is caused by external factors such as the client` difficulties in securing funds and the delay in launch schedule. To shorten the satellite manufacturing period, companies adopt modular production systems and standardize bus to reduce costs. In advanced nations, satellite manufacturers also use a guideline for utilizing some high-quality parts used in other private sector industries. Such a guideline can help reduce time and cost in developing spacecraft parts.Mitsubishi Electric Corporation in Japan jumped into the small satellite market in 2009 based on its experience in developing government satellites. A small satellite takes one year and six months to manufacture, costs one-fourth of the bill for a medium- or large-sized satellite, and sells for 2-3 billion yen.Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, a leading heavy industry company in Japan, is a key player in Japan`s space development. It makes guided weapons (missiles), space rocket engines, rocket engine ground combustion chambers, and rocket projectile launchers. The development of a launch vehicle in Japan was first started by JAXA without cooperation with private companies. But JAXA has been cooperating with MHI since it started the H2B launch vehicle development project. In 2003, ""The Final Report of H-IIA Privatization Project Team"" proposed that the launch vehicle development project be spearheaded by the private sector. In September 2005, a cooperation deal was concluded between JAXA and MHI. A prime contractor system was also introduced to make the roles of each company clear. Such a change in Japan`s policies was meant to strengthen the competitiveness of Japanese space companies and increasing their value creation.Korea should also change its approach to space development if it wants to maximize the spillover effect of space technologies, enhance the productivity of private companies and join the ranks of advanced nations in space development.To do so, policymakers must understand the main characteristic of space technology: it is more of an ""extreme technology"" than of a high technology. In developing such a technology, the most valuable asset is experiences of failure. However, Korea has no such experience. Paradoxically that means it has not taken risk in space development. Its satellites have thus far been developed through joint projects with other nations or have been procured from overseas. These satellites were launched using foreign rocket projectiles.True, there were not many options available for Korea at the initial stage of space development. But such practices are certainly not suitable for a nation with 20 years of space development history. Since Korea`s domestic rocket projectiles were decommissioned after being used only once, it`s hard to talk about their reliability. No experience of failure means that Korea has not accumulated knowledge in the diverse fields related to space development and has not developed the capacity to manage crisis in case of failures.Since Korea`s domestic market is relatively small, it`s not a good idea to try to develop an entire family of launch rockets. A rocket family includes rocket projectiles of all sizes. You can choose a small, medium-sized or large one depending on the size of the satellite or spaceship to be lifted into the space. When a nation`s space industry enters into a growth stage, the size of the satellites it produces tends to increase. This is the result of ambitions of space development companies. Since demand for large satellites is limited, space firms` ambitious attempts do not lead to value creation. The best option for a nation with a relatively small domestic market like Korea is to standardize the size of satellite buses based on customer demand and to build a rocket projectile that fits the satellite.Now is indeed time for Korea to focus not only on the public aspects of space development but also on maximizing the economic benefits of its investment in space technologies."
[NEWS ANALYSIS]N. Korea uses missiles to up the ante,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000059196?sid=108,"Thu, 06 Jul 2006 10:02:00 +0900","U.S., Japan likely to expand Proliferation Security Initiative among other measures  By Lee Joo-hee and Annie I. Bang As the international community expressed shock at North Korean missile launches yesterday, governments of the six-nation member countries on North Korea`s nuclear negotiations scurried to forumulate their respective responses.South Korea, for its part, said it had anticipated the North would go ahead with the missile tests sometime this week. It sent the president`s chief national security secretary Song Min-soon to Washington and canceled the foreign minister`s diplomatic trip as a precautionary measure.Since May, reports have been pouring in from the United States and Japan that North Korea was preparing to launch the Taepodong-2 triple-stage long-range missile that could possibly reach parts of Alaska and Hawaii.North Korea`s decision to go ahead with the highly controversial move comes at a sensitive time of international concern over the stalled nuclear talks. Despite efforts by China to caution the North against the launch, the move has immediately raised questions about the intent behind Pyongyang`s actions which are widely considered a warning aimed at Washington hard-liners.Speculation over the repercussions also followed, including the strengthened Proliferation Strategy Initiative against weapons of mass destruction initiated by the United States and a freeze on inter-Korean exchanges.Pyongyang`s intent  Observers say North Korea was probably frustrated with the repeated denials by Washington on its demands for lifting financial sanctions and to meet one-on-one.""It is definitely a strong message not only towards the United States, but also towards the international community, warning not to look down on the country,"" said Nam Sung-wook, a North Korean studies professor at Korea University.But some other observers pointed out the failure of the ambitious long-range missile.""The failure may give Washington more reason to become harsher on the communist state as this showed the lack of North Korea`s missile launch capabilities,"" an expert said on condition of anonymity.Lee Jung-chul, researcher at the Samsung Economic Research Institute, said, ""The failure of the launch could even have worked to lower the security threat."" North Korea, which invests much into the export of missiles, has devoted at least eight years to developing the long-range missile.Some suspected the multiple launches of various missiles could be an attempt to ""camouflage"" the technical limitations of its Taepodongs.Another expert said the timing of the missile launch was to put ""political pressure"" on the United States on their Independence Day.""North Korea has a clear intention here,"" said Paik Hak-soon, head of inter-Korean relation studies at the Sejong Institute, a private think tank in Seoul. ""By launching a series of missiles on the Fourth of July, North Korea just upped political pressure on U.S. citizens and the policymakers in Washington, asking for direct bilateral talks with the United States."" North Korea has been boycotting the six-party talks citing Washington`s September guideline on American banks on dealing with a Macau-based bank for allegedly helping North Korea launder and circulate counterfeited dollars. The Banco-Delta Asia voluntarily cut off dealings with the North, which reportedly left the communist state stripped of a foreign exchange channel.In addition to ignoring North Korea`s demand to lift the ban, Washington also denied twice Pyongyang`s invitation to chief nuclear negotiator Christopher Hill of the United States.Observers said such actions may have provoked the reclusive state to once again use its ""brinkmanship.""  Seoul`s measures  The missile launches could not have come at a worse time for the Seoul government which has been trying to cajole Washington to talk more with Pyongyang, and urge a wider role from China to bring North Korea back to the six-party talks.China, which proposed the informal six-party talks as an alternative, could not have been any less frustrated at the latest development.Observers say this second missile crisis following a previous test launch in 1998 will continue for about three months, with the relevant nations taking their respective diplomatic stances and stepping up warnings.""I say the immediate tension will last for about three months. There will not be any immediate repercussion other than diplomatic movements but things could get uncontrollable once the military power restrictions begin,"" said Lee Jung-chul of SERI.North Korea is most likely to watch the reactions of the relevant countries for the time being and decide on its next step of action, observers said.Some observers noted that it was thus more important for the Seoul government to take well-choreographed measures.As the United States and Japan will significantly raise their restraints against the hermit state such as by strengthening the U.S.-led Proliferation Strategy Initiative against weapons of mass destruction in Northeast Asia, it is important for Seoul to keep communicating with the North, but at the same time be firm when it comes to maintaining a strong alliance with both Washington and Tokyo.Lee Jong-chul added that for the time being there will be no immediate impact on South Korea`s international credibility as the threat from the North has always been there.While hard-line voices within Washington could gain more say due to North Korea`s radical provocation, the Bush administration could also be equally pressured to resolve the conflict as both domestic and international criticism against its foreign policies continue to mount, observers said.(angiely@heraldm.com)  "
Manufacturers see sales fall for first time,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000163211?sid=104,"Tue, 27 Oct 2015 18:42:00 +0900","A large portion of manufacturing firms in Korea faced cash flow problems in the wake of their mounting debt on worsening profitability. (Bloomberg photo)The manufacturing sector saw sales fall last year, the Bank of Korea’s annual corporate analysis report showed Tuesday.According to the central bank report, 12,297 manufacturing firms nationwide saw their sales shrink by 1.6 percent from the previous year. Their sales grew 0.5 percent in 2013.This is the first time that the manufacturing industry has posted negative on-year growth since 1961, when South Korea started to compile official statistics on their performance. By segment, machinery, electro-mechanics and electronics saw sales slide 5.5 percent. Nonmetallic minerals producers posted a 3.1 percent drop, followed by petrochemicals and chemicals with 1.6 percent, metallic products with 1.2 percent and shipbuilding with 0.4 percent.Manufacturers also suffered a slowdown in profitability, the report noted. The ratio of their operating profit to sales posted 4.2 percent in 2014, while it was to 5.3 percent in 2013 and 5.1 percent in 2012.Further, the shipbuilding sector saw its profitability index fall by 3.2 percent last year, marking the only industry showing a negative growth in the profit-to-sales ratio.A BOK official attributed their performance to “the U.S. dollar’s weakness against the Korean won and the drop in raw materials prices last year.” The strong local currency could be linked to the extreme slump in exports.Amid the worsening corporate profitability, Financial Supervisory Service Gov. Zhin Woong-seob called for commercial banks to take the initiative in corporate restructuring.In his meeting with chief executives of 10 banks on Tuesday, Zhin said that “It is necessary to distinguish between good and bad (unviable players).”Via such activities, the market should stop funding to companies that have little potential for business normalization, he said.His remarks came after a series of research reports showed that the number of “zombie companies” which are unable to generate revenue to pay tax and interest on debts has shot up over the past few years.According to another BOK data, the number of manufacturing and nonmanufacturing firms with the ratio of operating profit to interest costs below 1 increased to 3,295 as of the end of 2014, up from 2,698 in 2009.The percentage of such troubled companies rose to 15.2 percent last year from 12.8 percent five years earlier, according to the bank.The interest coverage ratio is a barometer of how easily a company can pay interest on outstanding debt. A reading of less than 1 means a company cannot fully pay the interest with its operating profit.By Kim Yon-se (kys@heraldcorp.com)Park confronts NPAD over history textbooksHalloween party with BTS		[코리아헤럴드] [K-POP HERALD] [페이스북] [주니어헤럴드]구독신청 1588-0533<ⓒKoreaHerald(www.koreaherald.com)무단전재 및 재배포 금지>"
"No time to vote, or no desire to vote?",https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000125063?sid=104,"Mon, 08 Oct 2012 19:36:00 +0900"," Rival parties divided on extending voting time Assembly Voice looks into key issues and controversial bills through a series of interviews with rival lawmakers who lead the legislative debate at the National Assembly. ― Ed.A declining voter turnout is a problem in many established democracies. In the United States, for instance, the voter turnout has dropped since the 1960s, albeit with slight fluctuations.In South Korea, the same has been occurring. The voting rate for the past five presidential elections dropped from 89.2 percent in 1987 when direct voting was revived, to 63 percent in 2007.Amid prospects that the turnout will further plunge in this year’s presidential election on Dec. 19, the main opposition Democratic United Party has started to seek measures to encourage more people to vote by extending the voting time.Under the Public Official Election Act, balloting hours are from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. Balloting closes at 8 p.m. in by-elections. Election days, such as for president and the National Assembly, are stipulated by presidential decree as legal holidays for public offices and thus are not compulsory holidays for private businesses. The Labor Standards Act enables balloting within working hours by stipulating that an employer cannot reject a request from a worker to grant time necessary to exercise their civil rights during working hours.The DUP’s move, however, quickly led to politically-charged wrangling with the ruling Saenuri Party, which remains adamantly opposed.The Saenuri Party argues the voter turnout is low because of voter fatigue. Contending that Korea’s voting hours are comparable to the international average, it suggests fixing other technical problems such as distribution of polling stations.The DUP claims the Saenuri Party is afraid that younger people ― who tend to be more supportive of the progressive opposition ― will come out and vote. The DUP is pushing for reform in full force, establishing a special task force on Oct. 2 to work on extending the voting hours.Observers note that low voter turnout derives from a complicated mixture of causes and that the parties should tackle the issue multi-dimensionally.High voter turnout is considered important to prove the legitimacy of the system, but a low voting rate may also demonstrate that voters are content with the leading or likely winner in the case of a lopsided race.Other factors that can affect voter turnout include: indifference to politics; lack of salience among the rivaling parties and their pledges; habitual non-voters; education and economic levels of individuals; one or more weak candidates against a strong contender; demographic characteristics, as older people tend to vote more; and the ease of voting, such as the registration process.Alleviating voter fatigue is more crucial than extending hours The ruling Saenuri Party argues that the decreasing voter turnout in South Korea derives mostly from voter fatigue, not limited balloting hours.“The Saenuri Party deems that the low voting rate at the last presidential election came from other causes such as the people’s distrust of politics,” said Rep. Lee Cheol-woo, the party’s floor spokesman.The conservative party believes that it is therefore more important to figure out what other causes are, rather than pushing to extend the voting time two months ahead of the presidential election.“If the logic (of the main opposition Democratic United Party) is that extending the balloting hours will raise the voter turnout, how is it different from some random idea that a 24-hour balloting hour should be introduced,” Lee said.The Saenuri Party cites the balloting hours of other countries to demonstrate that Korea’s voting hours are appropriate.France, Germany and Australia, for instance, hold elections for 10 hours, while the average balloting hours for the United States is 12 hours, the same as Korea, Lee said.“There must be due reason if such developed countries that have experienced democracy for a long period of time show lower voter turnout than Korea but still do not extend voting hours,” Lee said.The Saenuri Party’s stated main reason for opposing an extension is that a revision right before the presidential election would cause confusion.Arguing that the election rules should be reviewed on a longer term basis, Lee said the party would also continue to work on better guaranteeing political rights of those working in small and mid-sized businesses or irregular workers who find it harder to cast their votes during their work hours.“It is more urgent to solve technical problems such as redistributing polling stations and expanding absentee voting. Attempting to solve the problem by extending the time is simply a strategic trick (by the DUP) ahead of the presidential election,” Lee said.Alleviating voter fatigue is more crucial than extending hours The ruling Saenuri Party argues that the decreasing voter turnout in South Korea derives mostly from voter fatigue, not limited balloting hours.“The Saenuri Party deems that the low voting rate at the last presidential election came from other causes such as the people’s distrust of politics,” said Rep.

Jin Sun-mee of the main opposition Democratic United Party says.The first-term lawmaker has submitted to the parliamentary committee on public administration and security a bill to extend the finish time for polling by two hours, from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m., but was met with Saenuri resistance.“The ruling Saenuri Party claims that the revision is inadequate as half of the people are negative over the idea, but this logic is flawed,” Jin said.The Saenuri’s floor spokesperson Rep. Lee Cheol-woo, in a counterargument, had cited a public survey conducted by local pollster Gallup Korea, in which 50 percent of the respondents answered against the extension and 48 percent in favor of it. “This is not about a conflict of two opposing rights,” she explained.“What the corresponding survey really indicates is that almost half of the population feels that the current voting hour system is insufficient and inconvenient.” The voting hour extension would be a crucial political innovation for them, while inflicting no harm upon the rights of the other skeptical half, she said.The lawmaker also accused the NEC of exaggerating the estimated costs to hold back the DUP bill.The election watchdog reported earlier that the two-hour extension would require an additional budget of 10 billion won ($9 million).“The NEC’s estimate was, however, based on an unnecessary double-shift and a list of excessive expenses, such as allocating four meals per official during their 14-hour duty,” Jin said.According to her analysis, the actual cost needed for the two-hour extension would be about 4.8 billion won.“This is much lower than the 10.9 billion won publicity budget spent to up the voter turnout in the last presidential election,” she said.“The NEC should have no reason to disapprove of this cost-efficient plan.” By Bae Hyun-jung (tellme@heraldcorp.com) [Hot News] ▶ Pop singer embroiled in alleged conflict with Psy▶ Daredevil readies 23-mile free fall▶ Tyson‘s New Zealand visa revoked▶ Deadly snake venom may make painkiller▶ Seoul to get more powerful, longer-range ballistic missiles"

His name had been mentioned as strong candidates for key financial posts up for grab in the past months, including the governor of Bank of Korea.“Euh has proved his ability to lead, while heading the Presidential Council on National Branding. He also presented a realistic vision for KB Financial during an interview, asserting that he is the right person to run it for the turbulent time ahead,” the committee said in a statement.Once formally appointed, Euh will take charge at the nation’s leading banking group for the next three years. It is a critical time for Korean banks, as they brace for a major change in the landscape, with the planned privatizations of Woori Bank this year and Korea Development Bank later on, as well as the sale of Korea Exchange Bank by U.S. private equity group.After the nomination, Euh said he would consider taking over Woori Bank to diversify Kookmin’s business portfolio, but is not interested in KEB.KB Financial, the parent of the nation’s largest commercial lender Kookmin, has repeatedly expressed its will to actively participate in the looming banking M&A market. In 2006, it had agreed to buy KEB from Lone Star for $7.3 billion, but the deal was cancelled amid legal complications regarding the U.S. firm.“The Korean banking sector lags competitiveness in the global stage and it is often suggested that the country needs a large bank, which would rank within the world’s top 50,” he said after winning the nomination.“We need a Samsung Electronics in the financial industry,” he said, vowing to make KB Financial one.Euh is also expected to put the group on better terms with the financial regulators.KB Financial had suffered a series of setbacks from the authorities, including the high-profile investigation into Kookmin Bank for alleged irregularities.Kang Chung-won, CEO of Kookmin, was nominated as the group’s chairman late last year, months after former chairman Hwang Young-key quit following sanctions from the financial regulator. But Kang withdrew in December amid the investigation, which was seen by the market as targeted at him, and claims that the nomination process was unfair.The new group chairman is to choose the replacement of Kang whose term as Kookmin CEO ends in October.By Lee Sun-young (milaya@heraldm.com)"

Bilateral talks with the United States is what the North has been aiming for right from the start, and it will continue to up the offensive until it gets its way,"" said Chun Seong-whun, researcher at the Korea Institute for National Unification.""To stop the situation from getting worse, the United States will have to agree to exclusive talks with North Korea."" On Tuesday, North Korea issued a Foreign Ministry statement denouncing the U.N. Security Council`s presidential statement condeming Pyongyang`s Sunday rocket launch.The North said it would reverse its nuclear disablement and boycott the six-party talks designed to end its nuclear weapons programs, in addition to strengthening its nuclear deterrent.Pyongyang also has ordered the pullout of all remaining U.N. nuclear inspectors.Considering the sharply hostile tone of the statement, experts said it was likely for Obama to eventually reach out to North Korean leader Kim Jong-il.""Special representative Stephen Bosworth has already indicated that the United States is open to talks with North Korea. It has left that door open,"" said Baek Seung-joo, a North Korean specialist at the Korea Institute for Defense Analyses.But there would be distinct ""redline"" to how much he would permit the North, such as drawing the line against any attempts to reverse the disablement process, Baek added.In the meantime, the six-party talks - put on hold since December - were expected to remain deadlocked, as the North said it would ""never again"" return to the discussions.""It will take some time for the six-nation talks to get back on track. At least until North Korea and the United States manage to strike a new deal,"" said Chun.""For the time being, the North has indeed gained more chips to bargain with, since it has now turned the entire process back to square one.""  Regarding Seoul`s role in engaging Pyongyang, critics said the government would first have to patch up inter-Korean relations before it can try to get through to the North.North Korea, in apparent attempts to get the upper hand in future relations with the United States, has been engaging in a series of saber-rattling measures aimed at grabbing Obama`s attention.Most of the criticism had been targeted at Seoul, with Pyongyang threatening military action and shutting down the inter-Korean border several times. On Sunday, it defied international warnings to fire a long-range rocket.The U.N. Security Council consequently issued a presidential statement, although it failed to adopt a new resolution as Seoul, Washington and Tokyo had called for. The statement largely focused on reactivating the sanctions towards the North drafted in the council Resolution 1718 adopted shortly after Pyongyang`s first nuclear test in 2006.By Kim Ji-hyun (jemmie@heraldm.com)"
[NEWS ANALYSIS]North gains leverage in talks with America,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000081774?sid=108,"Mon, 06 Apr 2009 00:35:00 +0900","			 With a long-range rocket launch, North Korea yesterday demonstrated its enhanced military threat and boosted diplomatic leverage in negotiations with the United States.It is also expected to embolden its leader Kim Jong-il`s grip on power as he enters a third term, having allegedly suffered a stroke last year.Meanwhile, the geopolitical risks and diplomatic tension from its rocket gambit will be limited and short-term, experts say.The provocative move earned the isolated nation global condemnation and may lead to a new U.N. resolution, though its likely effectiveness is questionable.In realpolitik, however, Pyongyang is expected to make gains on multiple levels. The launch represents major progress in the North`s pursuit of a reliable means of delivering weapons of mass destruction over an intercontinental range.In its desire to achieve the status of a bona fide nuclear state, North Korea has striven to acquire the intercontinental ballistic missile technology that could carry its nuclear warheads to the United States.In 2006, Pyongyang failed in its first test of the Taepodong-2 missile, which blew up 40 seconds after launch.The rocket yesterday blasted off from its northeastern coastal launch site of Musudan-ri and flew over Japan toward the Pacific.Pyongyang has developed the multi-stage rocket system in recent years, reportedly in cooperation with Iran, which sent its own communications satellite into orbit Feb. 2.Believed to possess several nuclear bombs, the North has widened its gap with South Korea in asymmetric warfare capability, though it would fall short of matching that of the combined forces of Seoul and Washington.However potent it is, however, the strategic risk from the rocket capability is seen as limited.""The Taepodong-2 could possibly reach Alaska but the likelihood of such a strike is negligible, since the North knows it would be devastated in any response,"" Brussels-based International Crisis Group said. ""The launch of a Taepodong-2 also takes weeks to prepare; in a time of considerable tensions the missile could be destroyed on the pad.""  Because the system must be launched from a fixed tower, its preparations are observable, the group said in a recent report.Domestically, the launch is seen as cementing Kim Jong-il`s rule, which needs external tension to maintain stability in his impoverished country.His supporters hail the technological advancement as the symbol of his leadership and a major achievement of his governing doctrine of ""a strong, great nation"" and ""military-first"" policy.The North`s newly-elected rubber stamp parliament is scheduled to convene on Thursday and reappoint Kim as chairman of the National Defense Commission, the governing body.Since Kim allegedly suffered from stroke in August, the North has conducted a series of major reshuffles of its military, administrative and political posts.""Unable to further delay post-Kim succession plans indefinitely, North Korea requires measures to strengthen its reciprocal regulation and internal control,"" said Park Sun-won, visiting fellow at Brookings Institute of the United States.""The current aggressive tactics by North Korea in using a missile launch attempt against the U.S. and in rapidly escalating various military threats against South Korea are closely linked to the internal political climate of North Korea,"" he said.The satellite launch will give a boost to the North`s propaganda highlighting its advanced position in space science compared with South Korea. Seoul plans to launch its first rocket possibly in July.The North will also claim to a stronger leverage in negotiations with the United States and in the six-party talks, which have been stalled since December due to differences over how to verify the North` denuclearization.The tension from the launch will continue for some time as South Korea, the United States and Japan seek to punish the North with a U.N. action to at least tighten enforcement of 2006 sanctions or individual economic retaliations.But the impasse is not expected to last long, experts say. The North`s saber-rattling would prove successful in attracting the attention of U.S. President Obama, who has been preoccupied with the economic slowdown and antiterrorism efforts in Afghanistan.The U.S. and South Korean governments have repeatedly indicated that they do not want the dialogue with the North to collapse. China also expressed willingness to continue with nuclear disarmament talks.The North`s new missile capability and the possibility of it selling the technology to other rogue nations are expected to add new ammunition in its pressure to win further concession and economic compensation from the United States.Seoul is walking on a tightrope in its two-track strategy to pressure Pyongyang to drop its arms programs while keeping dialogue open.Seoul yesterday condemned the North`s ""reckless"" rocket launch as a violation of the U.N. resolution and pledged a unified response with the international community.The government also reaffirmed its position of fully participating in a U.S.-led initiative to curb the spread of weapons of mass destruction, which largely targets North Korea, Syria and Iran.But Seoul said it will be patient and left open the possibility for dialogue with the North both bilaterally and through six-party framework.""The government cannot but express disappointment and regret over North Korea`s reckless act of firing a long-range rocket, which poses a serious threat to security on the Korean peninsula and the world,"" said presidential spokesman Lee Dong-kwan.""The government will take firm and stern countermeasures against the North`s provocation,"" Lee said. ""But we will also wait with patience and consistency for North Korea to change."" The United States also said Friday it is open to bilateral contacts with North Korea and urged it to return to six-nation talks.U.S. envoy to the North`s nuclear issue, Stephen Bosworth, said the nuclear talks must be at the center of diplomatic efforts.""That will not change. We will continue to have bilateral contact and we are prepared to open that channel at any point,"" he said in remarks at the Foreign Press Center in Washington.By Hwang Jang-jin (jjhwang@heraldm.com)"
[NEWS ANALYSIS]Mutual trust key to Korea-U.S. military ties,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000045685?sid=108,"Thu, 12 Aug 2004 13:32:00 +0900","			 U.S. troops on the Korean Peninsula are not only a visible deterrent to possible aggression by North Korea but also a constant target of anti-Americanism.The U.S. military presence dates back to 1945 when then unified Korea was liberated from 35 years of colonial rule at the end of the World War II and it is now at the center of a continuing debate that has this nation split by divided views.The airlift of 3,600 combat soldiers from the frontline border with North Korea to Iraq was completed yesterday. The redeployment started last Thursday with the departure of about 600 U.S. troops. The troops are from the U.S. 2nd Infantry Brigade of the 2nd Infantry Division.The two countries will discuss Aug. 19-20, at their 11th round of policy initiative talks, Washington`s plan to cut its troop presence here by one third to 25,000 within the next 18 months.The United States agreed with South Korea that it will shift the 7,000 troops now at the Yongsan Garrison in the heart of Seoul -?a constant source of friction with locals - to the Pyongtaek region by 2008. That move is part of a still-larger plan under which the U.S. military will reposition all its remaining forces in South Korea in coming years.Some see the troop cuts as a sign of strained relations between Seoul and Washington. Others view it as part of Washington`s new global strategy to realign its military forces worldwide and feel it`s time for Seoul to focus on building its own defenses and becoming less dependent on the United States. Since the 1950-53 Korean War ended without a peace treaty, Washington has kept its troops lined up alongside South Korea`s 650,000 troops to deter any aggressive moves by North Korea`s 1.1 million military.But the presence of American troops has become an increasingly sore point for many younger South Koreans, who see the large U.S. military presence as an insult to national sovereignty and a stumbling block to reunification of the peninsula.Many analysts say the American presence has had positive effects, especially in the chaotic aftermath right after Aug. 15, 1945 - Liberation Day from the Japanese occupation - and the Korean War. Some critics however say the U.S. troops came here as another occupation force.U.S. troop levels hit a record-high 325,000 at the end of the Korean War.""It was to South Korea`s benefit to have American soldiers here, even if they had their own grand plan for their own sake,"" said Yoon Chang-ro, 64, a retired army general and currently chief public relations officer at the Korean Veterans Association.Yoon said in an interview that the U.S. security guarantee against the North was most crucial because it provided an aura of confidence which attracted foreign investments and pushed South Korea`s economy to its current position as the 12th largest in the world.South Koreans have rarely understood how beneficial the U.S. presence has been, he said. Instead, blinded by national pride, Koreans began to look with disdain at American soldiers.Analysts said Washington`s active pressure for South Korean troops to participate in the big U.S. military campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq had also helped spark some anti-American protests and complaints of ""high-handed"" U.S. policy.But Yoon urged the nation to remember that about 54,000 U.S. troops were killed in the Korean War protecting the South from the communist North and Chinese troops.Years after the war, many U.S. servicemen still recall their time in South Korea with nostalgia and affection, he said. Those who participated in the Korean War are proud of their service and that in some way they contributed to its survival after the war to become one of the more developed countries in the world. They regret anti-U.S. feelings but note it`s mostly from younger South Koreans.Their strong feelings for Korea earned them the nickname ""Korea Mafia"" in the States and they have exerted themselves helping South Korea overcome hard times, Yoon said.Kim Yung-wook, who is in charge of government benefits at the Ministry of Patriots and Veterans Affairs, said, ""Their affections remain deep-rooted because they toured South Korea putting their lives at risk. Participation in war is not like sightseeing."" Still, contempt for U.S. policy and a desire to mend fences amid the ongoing nuclear standoff exist side by side.A recent survey found 39 percent of 800 respondents regarded the United States as the No. 1 threat to South Korea, with North Korea second at 33 percent.About 58 percent of people in their 20s and 47 percent in their 30s saw the United States as more dangerous than North Korea.These figures are a stark contrast to a 1993 survey in which just one percent picked Washington as a possible threat to South Korea.""Even if we want them to, the U.S. military would not stay in the peninsula if they want to leave. That simply means they have been here for their own sake,"" said Jin In-beom, a 28-year-old engineer.U.S. officials said most U.S. troops stationed on the peninsula enjoy the tour, pushing anti-American sentiment aside.""I really enjoy meeting the local community, eating the spicy foods and cultural encounters,"" Air Force Maj. Edwina Walton, a public affairs official, told The Korea Herald. Maj. Walton just started a fourth tour in Yongsan Garrison. The first tour was at Kunsan Air Base in 1993. By July 2006, when the present tour ends, it will mark a total five years in Korea.Koreans are some of the most kind, generous and giving people, Maj. Walton said. ""I`ve personally never witnessed an Anti-American protest. I love walking in my neighborhood with my Korean neighbors.""Most South Koreans like U.S. military members; they just don`t like some of our military members` actions sometimes, and that`s understandable. I don`t think the anti-sentiment is as big as the media portrays it to be. I really do love Korea. My parents always ask me when I`m coming home.""  The last major American troop reduction in South Korea was in 1971, during a period of detente with Moscow and Beijing, when the United States slashed its forces to 43,000 by pulling out the 20,000-member 7th U.S. Infantry Division.In 1992, the United States began a three-phase reduction of troops in South Korea but only the first was completed before the initial North Korean nuclear crisis erupted in 1994. The U.S. strength was then at 37.500, a level that has been maintained until the deployment of Iraq.The current U.S troop strength in South Korea, including the 2nd Brigade troops of the 2nd Infantry Division heading to Iraq, is 28,300 ground troops, 8,700 air force personnel and 480 navy soldiers and marines.Analysts say there is a big gap between the older generation which suffered through the war and the immediate aftermath and the young ones who focus more on national esteem and want a more independent Korean military posture.The old generation`s appreciation for the U.S. troop presence in South Korea is not shared by most younger South Koreans, especially after a series of regrettable crimes and incidents involving U.S. soldiers .Justice Ministry data shows about 59,000 American soldiers and their family members in South Korea were involved in some 52,000 crimes between 1967 and 2002. In 2003, as many as 571 U.S. military personnel, including family members, committed crimes in 501 cases.Another major source of anti-American sentiment is the limited jurisdiction of South Korea over American soldiers who allegedly commit crimes.Under the Status of Forces Agreement, which governs U.S. soldiers stationed in South Korea, Seoul has primary jurisdiction over U.S. soldiers accused of certain crimes committed when off duty. These cover only 12 serious offenses, including murder, arson, rape and fleeing a deadly traffic accident.The U.S. military maintains jurisdiction over troops who commit crimes while on duty.The acquittal of two U.S. service personnel in 2002 after their armored vehicle ran down and killed two South Korean teenage girls during a military operation stirred anti-U.S. fervor, said Kim Il-young, political scientist at Sungkyunkwan University.""Since the incident, the negative sentiments against U.S. troops that usually existed only among civil and student activists spread to ordinary citizens,"" Kim said.He sees the U.S. troop presence as not only as a deterrent against the North but as also aimed at balancing power in Northeast Asia. ""The withdrawal of the forces would rev up the armament races among Japan, two Koreas, China and Russia,"" he told The Korea Herald.Kim also said it is time to rearrange the bilateral relationship with the United States in line with the changed global situation. ""For Washington the war on terror and the end of the Cold War, and for Seoul the engagement policy with North Korea which divided views on the primary threat of North Korea - these are key factors requiring a repositioning of the alliance."" The problem is that some liberal South Koreans want to scrap the alliance, he added.Law professor Lee Jang-hie at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, who is actively engaged in revising the alliance, said it is immature to think that the redeployment of U.S. troops is a result of anti-American sentiment.The repositioning is because of Washington`s global realignment posture, he said. It would cut U.S. defense costs, as well as reduce unnecessary conflict with the Korean people by cutting down on crimes involving soldiers.Lee suggests another role the U.S. troops can play on the peninsula. ""They should engage fully in turning the armistice into a peace treaty."" The United States is a main signatory of the 1953 Armistice Treaty along with China and North Korea. South Korea was excluded from the treaty.Opposition lawmaker Park Jin, a foreign affairs expert, said the increasing influence of the younger generations has meant more criticism of South Korea`s dependent relationship with the United States.He said the U.S. military`s contribution to South Korea`s defense posture should not be a rationale for unilateral relations between the two countries but criticized anti-U.S. feelings which stem from unreasonable nationalism.Rearrangement of the Korea-U.S. alliance will be a turning point in relations but should not be done in a way that will hurt mutual trust between Seoul and Washington, he said.""I will develop the South Korea-U.S. alliance into a comprehensive, dynamic relationship in the long term after studying the future of the allies and their command systems,"" Defense Minister Yoon Kwang-ung told top military officials in Seoul yesterday.Yoon also put himself firmly behind President Roh Moo-hyun`s promise to pursue a ""cooperative self-defense system"". He said, ""To pursue the cooperative self-defense system. we will first build up a new defense capability focusing on anti-North Korea deterrence. Besides, we will maintain the Korea-U.S. alliance in a stable manner."" (smjoo@heraldm.com)      By Joo Sang-min  "
[NEWS ANALYSIS]Rice visits Seoul today to reaffirm strong alliance,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000045044?sid=108,"Fri, 09 Jul 2004 13:32:00 +0900","			  U.S. National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice will meet President Roh Moo-hyun in Seoul today, inviting much speculation what message one of the most influential figures in Washington will convey at a time when the two countries have to fine-tune some tricky issues.Special attention focuses on a personal letter from President George W. Bush to Roh, which Rice is expected to bring as the U.S. leader`s special envoy.Government officials say her one-day stay is aimed at reaffirming the ""strong alliance"" between the two countries, though some critics insist that bilateral relations have suffered a major setback under the liberal Roh administration.Rice`s visit to Seoul is the last leg of a three-nation Asian tour that took her to Japan on Wednesday and to China yesterday for what officials described as strategic talks ""President Bush will convey a clear message through Rice that Washington`s commitment to the security of South Korea is firm,"" a high-ranking presidential official said on condition of anonymity.The opposition Grand National Party and conservatives have attacked the Roh government, saying the recently-disclosed U.S. plan to reduce the number of its 37,000 soldiers in Korea by a third reflects a serious crack in the half-century alliance between the two countries.""Rice will explain Bush`s idea about the Seoul-Washington ties and the North Korean nuclear issue, and will listen to Roh`s opinions on the matters,"" the government official said.Foremost on the agenda of Rice`s talks with South Korean leaders will be the South`s planned troop dispatch to Iraq, the redeployment of U.S. soldiers in Korea and how to defuse tension surrounding the North`s nuclear weapons development program.Rice will have a separate meeting with National Security Adviser Kwon Chin-ho and Foreign Minister Ban Ki-moon before and after her session with Roh.Some observers said both sides may spend more time on the troop dispatch issue because her visit comes just a month before the South begins to deploy 3,000 soldiers to the post-war Middle Eastern country.Rice may express the U.S. government`s appreciation about Seoul`s consistent commitment to the troop dispatch despite worsening circumstances following the execution last month of Korean hostage Kim Sun-il by Islamic militants, the observers said. She may also convey Bush`s condolences to the South Korean public on the hostage tragedy.Adjusting the positions of the two governments on the North Korean nuclear problem is another urgent issue. The prolonged standoff dominated her talks with Japanese and Chinese officials.Some political experts said the Bush administration hopes that Rice`s Asian tour will help drum up voter support before the presidential election in November by showing that its diplomacy in the region is going smoothly.Bush`s hard-line stance on North Korea has been attacked by many diplomatic experts both in the United States and Korea.Some optimistic observers said Rice will present Washington`s softer stance on Pyongyang, as the two Cold War foes have recently shown some signs of improving the ties, though they remain apart on key pending issues.During the third round of six-party nuclear talks last month, the United States presented its most detailed proposal to end the standoff with North Korea since it erupted in October 2002. Last week, their foreign ministers held rare bilateral talks in Jakarta last week.Washington proposed that Pyongyang agree to a series of disarmament measures over three-month period in return for economic benefits and an easing of its diplomatic isolation.""Rice visits Seoul at such an important time, when the two countries need to closely cooperate on a host of crucial issues,"" said Prof. Yun Duk-min at the Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security.Seoul officials are set to use Rice`s visit here to create more favorable diplomatic environment.""Her talks with Roh and other officials will help the two countries manage pending issues in a stable manner and strengthen the alliance between Seoul and Washington,"" a senior government official said.The necessity of promoting close bilateral cooperation has been underscored by the government and the ruling Uri Party, as recent economic reports have pointed out that any signs showing a deterioration of the relationship will undermine the government`s efforts to induce foreign investment in the divided peninsula.""We will call on the U.S. side to demonstrate flexibility on the North Korean issue to enable nuclear talks entering into a substantial stage to settle the issue,"" the official said  (shj@heraldm.com)     By Seo Hyun-jin    "
[NEWS ANALYSIS] The never-ending row with Japan,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000073908?sid=108,"Thu, 22 May 2008 10:01:00 +0900","			 Like many of his predecessors, President Lee Myung-bak began his office this February with energetic ambitions to put the historical row with Japan in the past and to prioritize economic cooperation.His pledge to develop bilateral relations on the basis of a ""future-oriented"" policy had, in fact, already been stated by most of his predecessors.But it did not take long before the vicious cycle of controversy turned again with news reports this past weekend that Japan is pushing to renew its Dokdo sovereignty claim in education guidelines. Some say the challenge came sooner than anticipated.Even for Lee, with his vision of ""pragmatic diplomacy,"" the history issue was too tempting an opportunity to pass. It led to his office and the Cabinet going all out in relaying a protest to Tokyo on Monday by summoning the Japanese ambassador here.Beleaguered by plummeting popularity due to the stalling economy, controversy over U.S. beef imports and aggravated inter-Korean relations, Lee chose to highlight his patriotism by making it publicly known that the president was upset by the latest Japanese provocation.Indeed, the drastic turn of atmosphere between Korea and Japan barely a month after the friendly talks between Lee and Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda proved once again that the matter of history between the two nations is a chronic problem.""History with Japan is something to be managed. The debate will never dissolve. It is about how well each government manages it,"" said professor Park Chul-hee of Seoul National University.""The pending history debate is about political symbolism and sovereignty. It is hard for either country to back down,"" he added.Professor Lee Won-duk of Kookmin University agreed. ""Why can`t Korea and Japan let bygones be bygones? It`s because the people from each country possess different views."" Park said, ""The problem is that in Japan, a diplomatic feud with Korea over history is considered part of the bureaucratic mechanism and interest."" So the question that follows is: Did the Lee administration anticipate the historical row would emerge again despite the pledge to leave it in the past? Absolutely, observers say, perhaps not so soon, but absolutely.The issue relates to nationalism, bureaucracy and politics, and will remain a major part of regional dynamics both for Seoul and Tokyo, they explain.Korea and Japan are mainly at odds over the sovereignty of the Dokdo islets in the East Sea. Korea, which controls the islets with a group of permanent maritime police, views Dokdo as a symbol of its independence from Japanese rule. Another point of debate is with Japan`s history textbooks, which Asian neighbors claim glorify Tokyo`s past atrocities. Korea and Japan also need to renegotiate the borders of the exclusive economic zone in the East Sea. They even have different names for the sea, with Japan calling it the Sea of Japan. Compensation for former sex slaves remains a sticking point, as well as Japanese leaders` past visits to the Yasukuni Shrine.The bickering over history has persisted since Korea`s independence from Japanese colonial rule (1910-1945).The Republic of Korea`s first president, Syngman Rhee, who served between 1948 and 1960, maintained an adamant anti-Japan attitude throughout his administration. He drew a so-called ""Rhee Syngman line"" in the East Sea centering on the Dokdo islets in January 1952, ordering prompt seizure of any Japanese fishing vessels that violated it.Then came the President Park Chung-hee era between 1963 and 1979. Under staunch military dictatorship, Park`s main goal was to develop the economy, driving him to change the policy radically to a Japan-friendly one.In 1961, Park, then head of the nation`s reconstruction supreme committee, met then Japanese Prime Minister Hayato Ikeda while visiting the United States, and agreed to normalize relations. The following year, then Korean Central Intelligence Agency head Kim Jong-pil and Japanese Foreign Minister Masayoshi Ohira secretly agreed on compensation for the Korean victims of Japanese colonial rule. Their agreement later became the source of controversy with allegations that Korea caved into Japan for the sake of economic gains.Park`s plan to forge a normalization treaty with Japan, announced in March 1964, prompted massive protests across the nation among activists and students. On June 3, 1964, about 10,000 students and citizens took to the streets. Park declared martial law, closing down all universities for over a month.But even during Park`s Japan-friendly rule, the ghosts of history often came back to haunt, such as when Kim Dae-jung, then an opposition leader and later South Korea`s 15th president, was abducted and taken to Seoul in 1973 from Tokyo where he was in exile. Kim was returned to his Seoul home 129 hours later. But diplomatic tension emerged when Korea refused to cooperate with a Japanese police investigation into the case.Relations further chilled when first lady Yuk Young-soo was shot and killed by Mun Se-gwang, a Japanese-born North Korean, on Independence Day, Aug. 15, 1974.During the rule of army-general-turned-President Chun Doo-hwan between 1980 and 1988, the first reciprocal summit visits were made. The cooperative atmosphere continued until his successor Roh Tae-woo, who served between 1988 and 1993.It was during former President Kim Young-sam`s administration that the history row began to sink in as a chronic diplomatic variable. Kim, as the first president to run a civilian government, strongly vowed in 1995 that he would ""teach Japan a lesson."" His successor Kim Dae-jung, who took office in 1998, tried to start off his presidency with a friendly gesture, vowing to lift the ban against Japanese cultural products and enthusiastically promoting civil and economic exchanges. His counterpart Keizo Obuchi was the perfect partner for Kim`s drive, as the two leaders worked to improve relations, putting unresolved history issues on the backburner. In October 1998, Korea finally began the first phase of beginning cultural exchanges with Japan, starting with movies, videos and comics. Upon Obuchi`s death in May 2000, Yoshiro Mori took over. Mori was also considered a friendly counterpart.The congenial atmosphere, however, radically changed upon the inauguration of conservative Junichiro Koizumi as Japan`s 87th prime minister in 2001.Koizumi, backed by right-wing politicians, went ahead with a visit to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine, stating that his tribute was being made as Japan`s leader. Korea, China and other Asian nations vehemently contested the visit, as 14 Class A war criminals are honored among the 2.5 million war dead at the shrine.In an apparent attempt to patch up broken relations, former President Roh Moo-hyun vowed, just as Lee Myung-bak did, to put the past in the past upon his inauguration in 2003.Yasukuni shrine visits, however, continued. A bigger blow was dealt in January 2005, when Japan began taking a series of provocative measures.The Dokdo row flared when Japan`s Shimane prefecture legislated Feb. 22 as Takeshima Day to mark the 100th anniversary of the first claim on Dokdo. The Japanese refer to Dokdo as Takeshima.Japan then ignored warnings from Korea and China and approved in April final versions of new textbooks retaining historical distortions and adding further claims to Dokdo.It was barely months after Roh and Koizumi agreed in 2004 to foster bilateral relations through shuttle summit talks. Roh, who had maintained that diplomatic relations with Japan would be dealt with directly by the Foreign Ministry, ended up publicizing on the presidential website strong resentment towards Japan`s challenges in March.As Koizumi went ahead with another visit to Yasukuni in 2005, the shuttle summit was suspended.Relations with Japan remained courteously tense, with the leaders meeting up on the sidelines of international events, but not exclusively.Then came businessman-turned-politician Lee Myung-bak, who vowed to implement ""pragmatic diplomacy."" By holding summit talks with Japan`s 91st Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda in April, Lee vowed not to bring up history as long as there remained maturity and sincerity between the two nations.Upon the latest fissure over Japan`s reported move to include its Dokdo claim in textbook guidelines, some criticized Lee for turning a blind eye.But to questions on whether Lee ""overreacted"" to the reports by ""directly ordering"" Foreign Minister Yu Myung-hwan to relay a protest, observers were mixed.""In truth, when it comes to the historical debate with Japan, there is no right answer. We just have to move towards better managing the situation such as through fortified cooperation with international organizations,"" professor Lee Won-duk said.""While there are some similarities, there are also significant differences in how the peoples of Korea and Japan themselves view history. It is just a matter of time that one of the issues becomes the subject of a diplomatic row,"" he added.For the time being, both governments support a bilateral history research committee made up of historians and scholars as part of the effort to resolve the history row.The committee completed its first tenure from 2002 to 2005. The outcome, however, was criticized for lacking any power in resolving the gap in history interpretation.""For the scholars` research to be effective, they must be endorsed by the government,"" said Park Chul-hee.The committee entered its second tenure last year, with the next session opening in Tokyo next month.Lee Won-duk said in dealing with the permanent problem of history with Japan, the Seoul government would need to consider three key circumstances: ""Public opinion, Japan`s measures and diplomatic strategy.""

[Analysis] GNP caught in crisis,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/028/0002121362,"Tue, 06 Dec 2011 13:55:00 +0900","[한겨레] GNP lawmakers attribute it mainly to party leaders lacking leadership and crisis management abilityBy Seong Yeon-cheolThe Grand National Party is drifting, having lost its bearings following a series of blows including the DDoS attack on the National Election Commission and the railroading through the National Assembly of the Korea-US Free Trade Agreement (KORUS FTA) ratification bill. Some are criticizing the GNP for having lost its function as a ruling party and slipped into a suspended state.“It would not be wrong to describe the Grand National Party in its current state as brain-dead,” said a newly-elected lawmaker from the Yeongnam region, traditionally a ruling party stronghold.Arguments for reform, which surfaced in the immediate aftermath of the GNP’s October 26 Seoul mayoral by-election defeat, have produced no particular results so far, 40 days later. The process has stopped short at the discussion stage. This has included calls for the party leadership to resign, calls for the party headquarters to be abolished, arguments for the introduction of a public primary election system with universal participation, theories that former chairwoman will make an early announcement of her bid for next year’s presidential election, and talk of taxation reform.The first identified cause of these problems is Chairman Hong Joon-pyo, who has shown his limitations. Many criticize Hong for having actually exacerbated the disaster faced by the party by making comments that had no bearing on public sentiment, totally failing to grasp the crisis at hand. Hong incurred public opposition by saying, in the aftermath of the Seoul mayoral by-election loss, that the GNP had “neither won nor lost.” Immediately after the DDoS attack on the NEC, he showed a complacent understanding of the situation by commenting on Twitter that “looking after the big family household leaves no time for sleeping.”At the GNP Supreme Council meeting on the night of Dec. 4, Hong was also criticized by other Supreme Council members for showing no interest in the DDoS attack and calling for discussion of reform only. Hong did apologize for the DDoS attack, but other participants at the meeting reported that he “did not want to do even that.”Political commentator Go Seong-guk said, “When an accident occurs, you have to get a grasp of how serious it is and react at an appropriate level, but [the GNP] is merely making the situation worse, with no such grasp.”One newly-elected lawmaker said the actions of former GNP Chairwoman Park Geun-hye, as the “defacto master” of the party, is “ruling from behind the scenes like the mother of a young king” and also impeding reform. “Even in a situation when it has become clear that the system under Hong is not viable, Park is standing by and doing nothing,” said one newly-elected lawmaker from Yeongnam.Lawmakers belonging to reformist factions of the GNP such as Minbon 21, which has led movements within the party toward reform, have lost their way. Unable to escape the aftereffects of the railroading of the FTA ratification bill, they are scattered in all directions and wondering what political course of action to take next.Criticism is also being directed toward the majority of Lee Myung-bak faction lawmakers, who have remained silent throughout discussions of reform, then taken the wind out of the sails by taking issue not with the content of discussions but with their procedures and format. These lawmakers, who constitute a majority within the GNP, have impeded the flow of reform at all sorts of gatherings of lawmakers by claiming that “it’s wrong to forget that it was thanks to the president that we got elected, and demand an apology from him.”Shin Yool, politics and international relations professor of Myongji University said, “Despite the fact that the current party leadership has no capacity for crisis management, the Cheong Wa Dae and Park Geun-hye are avoiding reform because of their mutual interests. It appears that this dynamic structure within the party will make it hard for it to start functioning properly again.”        Please direct questions or comments to [englishhani@hani.co.kr] 공식 SNS [통하니] [트위터] [미투데이] | 구독신청 [한겨레신문] [한겨레21]Copyrights ⓒ 한겨레신문사, 무단전재 및 재배포 금지<한겨레는 한국온라인신문협회(www.kona.or.kr)의 디지털뉴스이용규칙에 따른 저작권을 행사합니다.>"
[ANALYSIS \& FEATURE] Korea shifts toward more open social relations,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000063156,"Fri, 09 Mar 2007 10:02:00 +0900","More citizens need to participate in social networks to build trust  Following is the seventh in a 10-part series exploring the issue of social capital in Korea. - Ed.By Yang Jung-ho Over the past several decades Korea has experienced diverse economic and social changes. These changes also affect the general lifestyles of Koreans.For example, in 1950s and 1960s most Koreans believed blood was thicker than water. In this sense, family-oriented relationships were emphasized. There was strong trust among family members such as parents and children.But recently these traditional relationships have changed unexpectedly from strong trust to conditional trust in private relations. Parents are hesitant to place confidence in their children because they worry that their children may not care for them well later in life.This is a warning sign that our society can go move in the wrong direction. Even if family members are unable to trust each other, the level of distrust in other sectors of our society is getting worse. Due to these problems, many Korean scholars and government officials are paying special attention to social capital to enhance social trust in Korea. Some people may ask why social capital matters in Korean society, or whether it can help to build a trusting society. If we know more about social capital, it will be easy for us to answer these questions.Social capital is widely used in recent years, from academic papers to government reports. While there are differing definitions by many scholars, social capital is based on trust, reciprocity, networks and collective action. Through social interactions, individuals can share their resources, build trust with each other, and finally integrate into society.Basically, social capital is related to social relations or social networks among individuals. Peter M. Blau clearly pointed out this aspect of social capital: ""To speak of social life is to speak of the association between people - their associating in work and in play, in love and in war, to trade or to worship, to help or to hinder. It is in the social relations men establish that their interests find expression and their desires become realized.""  Many people think that Koreans tend to be involved in many forms of social networks with friends and coworkers, but no previous surveys had systemically examined the diverse features of social capital in Korean society.Last year, the Korea Development Institute conducted the first comprehensive survey on social capital. The results showed some changing patterns in social networks and trust in Korean society.Korean people actively participate in very wide forms of social networks. Even the rates of civic participation vary across associations or organizations. For example, only 2.1 percent of Koreans are members of environmental and animal rights groups, while 50.4 percent have a membership to alumni associations.In general there is evidence that traditional forms of social networks such as alumni, regional, and kinship associations are still relatively active compared to other voluntary organizations. However, we need to point out that many Koreans also participate in new forms of social networks such as sports or hobby clubs and cyber communities. The changing patterns of social networks imply that Korean society is shifting toward more open social relations.This appears to be consistent with a majority of Koreans reporting that they do not have any difficulties talking to members of the opposite sex, or people with different income, religions, and political opinions. It is well known that Koreans tend to be more homogenous than heterogeneous when they gather. But the KDI report shows that most individuals are more open and tolerant than what we thought. Thus this can make Korean society more democratic and allow each individual to easily join civic organizations.Closed social networks, called ""yeonjul,"" are a major social problem. Even though yeonjul is a form of social networking, this close and personal relationship prevents outside groups from sharing the inside group`s resources.Many Korean scholars are concerned about the unique types of social networks maintained by school, kinship, and regional associations, and what these imply for making an open civil Korean society. Fortunately, since the late 1980s, social democratization has reshaped traditional social networks and this has also altered the characteristics of yeonjul.Consequently, while the influence of yeonjul has declined, the opportunity to engage in social networks has gradually increased. This is also confirmed by the KDI survey. More than 50 percent citizens responded that they never have been asked to use their personal social networks or yeonjul. Moreover, most Koreans are unlikely to depend on yeonjul in order to find a job or to do business.We can expect that our society will become more open and democratic in the future. However, the rate of being asked to use yeonjul differs across regions. For example, people living in South Gyeongsang Province and Gwangju areas are more likely to be asked to use their yeonjul networks than those in other areas. These response patterns are closely related to the fact that almost all ruling parties in our modern political history are deeply rooted in these two areas.In a society where each individual is freely involved in voluntary organizations, social capital can be easily accumulated because people are supposed to do this as the duty of a citizen in civic society. Without engaged citizenship, it is hard to build or develop civic society. Through frequent social interactions between individuals, citizens share goals with an understanding that we need to respect different opinions and that there are many alternative ways of achieving those goals.This is a typical feature of advanced nations. It is proven that high levels of social capital are the key factor in maintaining sustainable development in advanced nations. Thus it is not surprising the Korean government is focusing on social capital at this time.According to the recent KDI survey, on average people voluntarily involved in organizations perceived lower levels of generalized social trust compared to those who did not participate in any organizations. Moreover, social networks and trust present quite an interesting pattern. That is, participation in both traditional and new forms of social networks increases generalized social trust.These social networks include associations or organizations related to humanitarian aid or human rights, political parties, alumni, region, and kinship. It is undeniable that in Korea there are high levels of trust among members in traditional social networks. What is important is that new forms of social networks are also related to high levels of social trust.The spread of engaged individuals in new social networks may stimulate more voluntary civic participation in diverse organizations. And as a result, social trust in Korean society can be increased dramatically.There are close connections between social network and trust in our society. If we want to build high levels of social capital, more citizens need to engage in diverse organizations, especially new forms of social networks such as political parties and human rights groups.But creating social capital takes continuous effort with clear long-term visions. A single government policy in a short time period cannot achieve this goal. Instead, every citizen should voluntarily participate in each social network and their participation must be a part of their everyday life. I believe Korea has much potential to wisely utilize all resources to create social capital. If things go in the right direction, Korea will become an advanced nation with high social capital in the future.Yang Jung-ho is a professor teaching education at Sungkyunkwan University in Seoul.

[ANALYSIS \& FEATURE] Social capital greases the wheels of society,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000063035?sid=108,"Tue, 20 Feb 2007 10:02:00 +0900"," Experts say war and military dictatorships have hampered growth of social trust in Korea  Following is the first in a 10-part series which will shed light on social capital in Korea. - Ed.By Ko Kyoung-tae Jin Min-jung, a barista at the Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, becomes anxious when asked to work with other employees of Coffee Bean franchises at her branch.""Coworkers and I are concerned about what people are doing and whether they might make mistakes - consciously and unconsciously. It is very nerve-racking,"" the 23 year-old Seoulite said.""Even though they had the same job training, learned the same manuals as we did, we are just nervous about them. On the contrary, I have very deep intimacy with my coworkers.""  Such exclusiveness does not prevail only on the workplaces in Korea.Experts point out Koreans place very low credit with business partners, strangers, government offices and even laws.A recent survey by the Korea Development Institute partly revealed such deep-rooted cultural suspicions.The state-run think tank found last month that less than one third of the population think their government is reliable, posting 3.3 out of 10 in an index measuring public trust.Less than 11 percent of respondents said they trust the National Assembly, far below 22.9 percent with U.S. citizens and 18.2 percent with Japanese.Such a gap in trust stokes not only anxieties with politicians and sociologists but also academic interests from some interdisciplinary economists.As social confidence is found to be deeply related to social stability and economic growth, they have been trying to conceptualize this intangible but strikingly important social ingredient.This led to the coining of the new socioeconomic jargon - social capital.While physical capital refers to tangible assets such as buildings, machineries and cash, social capital largely indicates immaterial assets that arise from trust among individuals.The neology incorporates a wide variety of social connections so that it may indicate reciprocity between business partners and long-built credit between banks and debtors.The terminological ambiguity has been seamlessly engendering fresh definitions, but researchers mostly agree that social capital stems from trust and reliability built from positive human relations.Trust, mutual understanding and shared values and behaviors that bind community members are integral components in the new capital, which makes cooperative action possible in boardrooms, civic groups and even on streets.In the World Bank`s 1999 survey it defined social capital as, ""the institutions, relationships, and norms that shape the quality and quantity of a society`s social interactions."" The basic premise to put social wellness in the category of capital is that it is buttressing major social barometers such as economic growth, the crime rate, health data and educational achievement.It particularly helps reduce the transaction costs associated with formal mechanisms like contracts, hierarchies, bureaucracies and legal enforcements.Without a certain amount of social capital or trust between business partners, every contract should seek to specify meticulous clauses in all possible contingencies.Such wasteful transactions are seen in the labor pacts of auto plants that are as thick as telephone books and pages-long insurance provisions in tiny letters.Every security brokerage is tape-recording all phone calls from clients to better deal with possible legal complaints.A lack of social capital drives firms to spend more time and money in preventing unforeseen loopholes.But companies are not the only payer for plugging the trust gap.A 24-year-old security guard at a state-run casino, who requested to be identified only with her surname Park, is one of the victims of the trust shortfall.She had to visit local labor offices over a dozen times just to earn her legal holidays on a year-long contract with a casino security firm.""The job contract that the company directly gave me was like a kid`s drawing,"" Park said.""They scribbled some crude, unclear terms on a white paper without mentioning about off-duty days, working hours and annual leave. The paper was quite different from what I had heard at a job offering.""  The low confidence in her employer turned her to consult government labor experts, which was frustratingly time-consuming and raised questions of untrustworthiness.""I was annoyed by the fact that even subcontractors of the government are not credible. I also lost my trust in the irresponsible labor officials.""  What does such low social capital cost her? Foot-aching visits to labor offices, several sleepless nights and low commitment and productivity in her workplace.Observers are especially concerned that Korea is still suffering from low social confidence despite decades-long rapid industrialization and democratization.Korea is considered to have the worst labor disputes among major developed economies, and the downtowns of some cities are too often occupied with rallies by interest groups, political protestors and religious associations.Trustless relations have hampered talks between policymakers and opponents, halting major tunnel and road projects for years.Volunteering and social contribution are still low compared to Western societies, and civic engagements are mostly out of Korean`s interests.Experts point out the Korean War and long-standing military dictatorships have prevented citizens from building social capital over the decades.The three year long war, which had devastated the Korean peninsular from 1950 to 1953, is cited as a main culprit for the trust shortage.""The postwar days were totally different,"" said Kim Bong-kook, a 62 year-old retiree.""Some villages were under the control of the South Korean Army during the day, but of North Korean guerillas at night. Nobody could trust anybody."" The tragedy was followed by military-led regimes which had ruled out fair negotiations, democratic decisions and civil associations for decades.This caused a two-tier moral system among Koreans, with good behavior reserved for family and personal friends, and a decidedly lower standard of attitudes in the public sphere.In contrast to the below-average credits on strangers and public agencies, the KDI survey noted Koreans feel more confident in private relations such as those with coworkers and alumni.""Many groups achieve internal cohesion at the expense of outsiders, who can be treated with suspicion, hostility, or outright hatred,"" Francis Fukuyama, a renowned U.S. political economist, said in a paper.Recent statistics and research consistently demonstrates that further social development must be based on attaining higher social capital.""Social capital allows citizens to resolve collective problems more easily,"" Robert Putnam, a pioneer political scientist in social capital, said in his popular book ""Bowling Alone: The collapse and revival of American community."" ""Social capital greases the wheels that allow communities to advance smoothly. Where people are trusting and trustworthy, and where they are subject to repeated interactions with fellow citizens, everyday business and social transactions are less costly."" (kkt@heraldm.com)"
[NEWS ANALYSIS]Nuke worries escalate ahead of U.S. votes,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000046673?sid=108,"Sat, 02 Oct 2004 10:02:00 +0900","			  Concerns are growing that the crisis over North Korea`s nuclear weapons program may soon come to a head. The communist state and the United States have been ratcheting up their war of words, exchanging their harshest warnings in some months.With the U.S. presidential election just one month away, North Korea warned Monday that the danger of war on the peninsula was snowballing, and said it has made nuclear weapons to protect the country from increasing U.S. nuclear threats.The United States responded that it would consider referring the nuclear issue to the U.N. Security Council. That could result in political and economic sanctions against the North.On the same day as the U.S. response, the U.S. Senate passed a bill with the stated aim of improving human rights conditions in North Korea, a move the communist state condemned as targeting the overthrow of its regime.Analysts dismiss the likelihood of any disastrous nuclear event before the November election, but concerns persist that there could be an ""October surprise,"" in the form of a nuclear test or some other activity.After the six-party nuclear talks over North Korea`s nuclear ambitions failed to resume last month as scheduled, Pyongyang and Washington blamed each other for the rupture, as usual.The two Koreas, the United States, Japan, China and Russia had agreed to hold a fourth-round of the multilateral talks before the end of last month, after they finished a third round in June in Beijing without a breakthrough.On Monday, however, North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Choe Su-hon told the U.N. General Assembly that ""Washington`s hostile policies toward Pyongyang destroyed the foundation of six-way negotiations."" Choe also asserted that North Korea had turned the plutonium from 8,000 spent fuel rods into nuclear weapons as a deterrent against a preemptive U.S. attack.State Department Spokesman Richard Boucher responded that North Korea should stop ""bragging"" about its nuclear capability and return to the negotiating table.""We`ve seen a whole series of claims from the North Koreans about `watch out, we`re doing this; watch out we`re doing that,`"" Boucher said.U.S. Undersecretary of State for Arms Control John Bolton said, ""I think it would be fair to say that if, at some point, North Korea continues to stonewall, then I think the Security Council is the next logical step."" Adding fuel to the simmering confrontation, the U.S. Senate unanimously approved a bill Wednesday seeking the improvement of human rights in North Korean. The bill had been passed earlier by the House of Representatives, but with some differences that will need reconciling before it can be signed by President Bush.With the two enemies showing little sign of backing off, government officials and political analysts don`t believe the six-way talks will resume before the Nov. 2 U.S. election.If John Kerry should win the election, negotiations would likely be delayed further until after he took office in January, because North Korea would not be interested in talking with a lame-duck government, officials say.""There`s literally no possibility that the nuclear talks will be held before the election, and even if there were negotiations this month, there would be little progress,"" said Yonsei University political science professor Kim Woo-joon.""North Korea probably hopes for better deals if Democratic contender John Kerry should win the election,"" he added.Under the last Democratic administration in the United States, headed by President Clinton, Washington and Pyongyang accomplished a major reduction of tension. During the Clinton administration`s final weeks, U.S. Secretary of State Madeline Albright made an official trip to Pyongyang, and there was talk of Clinton visiting Pyongyang as well to normalize relations.Further detente was preempted, however, by the distraction of the undecided U.S. election in Florida. Then, when Bush took office he immediately reversed the U.S. policy of detente with the North, cutting off most communication, and in his January 2002 State of the Union Address he labeled North Korea part of an ""axis of evil."" If Democratic candidate Al Gore had taken office instead of Bush, the Clinton policy of detente would almost certainly have continued.Is an October surprise looming? Despite the Washington-Pyongyang deadlock, experts and government officials say it looks unlikely that North Korea will conduct its first nuclear test this month or that any other big confrontation will happen before the U.S. election.""There`s little possibility of a so-called October crisis,"" Cho Tae-yong, director-general of the Foreign Ministry`s task force on the North Korea nuclear issue, says. ""North Korea`s nuclear test is a high-risk gamble that can turn its neighbors to enemies. Also it is too late for the North to make any such attempt before the election."" Professor Kim of Yonsei said, ""There has been persistent speculation about a nuclear test by North Korea in October, but I`m highly skeptical that the North has the technology to test nuclear weapons. The recent exchanges of hard-line rhetoric seem to be part of bluffing before the election."" ""As for the United States, it`s preoccupied with Iraq and other domestic issues and thus its focus is not on the North. There will be no preemptive strikes against the North,"" by the U.S., Kim said.Professor Ryoo Kihl-jae at Kyungnam University`s Graduate School of North Korean Studies echoed this view, saying any ""October surprise"" would remain just a rumor.""It`s not the first time that rumors of a nuclear crisis have circulated. The North`s indication that it has nuclear weapons seems to be a desperate attempt to attract the United States` attention,"" Ryoo said.Others, however, are mindful of recent news reports that U.S. intelligence services have seen signs that North Korea was preparing to conduct its first test of nuclear arms. The North is suspected of possessing several nuclear wea-pons.When a mushroom-shaped cloud rose in North Korea last month, it raised fears that the North had indeed conducted a nuclear test but the cloud was later attributed to other causes. Nonetheless, the event reflected deep international concern that a North Korean nuclear test was just a matter of time.Efforts to resume talks South Korea, which has tried to facilitate nuclear negotiations, is now in a difficult position due to the recent disclosures that its scientists conducted nuclear experiments involving plutonium and uranium in the 1980s and the 2000s. The disclosures sparked concerns of a nuclear arms race in Northeast Asia.North Korea has accused the United States of applying double standards, saying Washington demands nuclear disarmament by North Korea while ignoring Seoul`s past nuclear experiments.The U.S. passage of the North Korean human rights bill has also dismayed Seoul, which worries about a potential negative impact on inter-Korean negotiations and the diplomatic process to resolve the nuclear problem.""We believe the human rights law should not hamper inter-Korean relations or efforts to resolve the North Korean nuclear problem,"" ruling Uri Party spokesman Im Jong-sok said.Cho at the Foreign Ministry says, ""We have come clean on our past nuclear activities and have no intentions of developing nuclear weapons. Although North Korea is taking issue with the nuclear experiments, I don`t expect it will be a drag on the diplomatic process."" (soyoung@heraldm.com)  By Kim So-young    "
[NEWS ANALYSIS]Will labor party compromise with reality?,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000043697?sid=108,"Wed, 05 May 2004 13:32:00 +0900","			 Known as the ""godfathers of labor activism"" or ""street fighters"" for their labor activism, the 10 lawmakers-elect were given a big hand by supporters at the Daehangno, a favorite hangout for college students.They belong to the progressive Democratic Labor Party, which for the first time won seats in The National Assembly in the April 15 general elections, and carry a big load as the standard bearers for labor.Thousands of labor union members, farmers and college students gathered at a rally marking May Day last Saturday to celebrate the party`s performance in winning 10 seats in the 299-member legislature.Hand in hand, to underscore their cohesion, the 10 renewed their pledge to stand up for the socially disadvantaged.With one seat more than the former ruling Millennium Democratic Party and its first representation in parliament, the labor party has been receiving more attention than it ever has.""The party`s entry in parliament heralds the first time in 50 years that there will be an explicitly progressive voice representing workers, farmers and low-income earners in the conservative parliament,"" Choi Chang-ryul, a political scientist at Yong In University, told The Korea Herald.Kim Il-young, a political watcher at Sungkyunkwan University, said the party would push strongly to revamp the tax system to help the underprivileged.His view was that the DLP would push for reform measures but not to point of ignoring the nation`s established economic system.The arrival in parliament of a progressive force apparently at odds with current economic policies has caused concern in business circles that the DLP`s radical views on reform might disrupt the economic system.Underlining these concerns, representatives of a foreign bank and a credit-rating agency recently visited the party to feel out what policy line it would  take in the incoming Assembly.But Finance and Economy Minister Lee Hun-jai said South Korea would stick to its existing policy to stimulate investment and maintain market stability.DLP secretary-general Roh Hoe-chan said: ""Don`t exaggerate. Our 10 seats in the 299-member parliament is just like pouring a bucket of hot water into a vast bathtub filled with cold water,"" he said. ""I think the conservative parliament is the one which has been radical, only serving building owners and the rich."" In line with the party`s campaign motto ""taxes to the rich, welfare to the poor,"" the DLP plans to press for a controversial ""wealth tax"" on the rich.The DLP, backed by the 650,000-member Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, has vowed to get a new tax system adopted under which people with assets in excess of 1 billion won ($865,000) must pay a cumulative tax.""The tax balance, which we expect to be 1.1 billion won levied on approximately 20,000 to 50,000 rich people, would be used as welfare funds for free education and medical care,"" said DLP spokesman Kim Dae-gon.""It is not on based on how they accumulated their wealth, but on the idea that we should protect the socially disadvantaged,"" he said.The DLP has also long called for participation of labor unions in management and reform of Korea`s family-owned conglomerates, or chaebol, in a bid for transparent management - an idea that irks business leaders.Even though the party only has 10 seats, the moves for more equitable distribution of wealth and union involvement in management continue to generate concern, analysts said.Local businesses and some analysts have expressed concern that DLP legislators will likely attempt to make laws that favor labor unions and might disrupt the establishment, despite the fact that it only has a minimal influence in parliament.By contrast, others expect labor-management relations to become more stable because labor unions would bear more social responsibilities in parliament.""They will be all ears to voices of workers, who are their key support base, but would not blindly curry favor with them, thus tempering the market economy or labor-management relations,"" said Prof. Choi of Yong In University.""While keeping the party`s identification as a progressive force, the DLP will try to widen its support base by enlisting moderate voters, as that`s what contemporary political parties seek,"" Choi explained.The party`s lawmakers-elect comprise what some view as a ""dream team"" of former labor activists.At the top of the list is Kwon Young-ghil, the party`s chief, who led various umbrella union groups such as the National Union of Media Workers and the Korea Confederation of Trade Unions before he founded the DLP in 2000.""The party`s success in the polls was a victory for those against social discrimination and who want to reunite the two Koreas,"" Kwon, 63-year-old former Paris correspondent of the Korean newspaper Seoul Sinmun, told a May Day gathering in the southeastern industrial city of Changwon.He said the party would abolish discrimination against irregular workers and he called on the government to implement a five-day work week, without cutting pay or changing present working conditions.Dan Byoung-ho, 54, is an icon of labor activism. He started working at a construction company and had to endure a 12- hour workday. The difficult working conditions led him to form a union and he later went on to head the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, a nationwide umbrella labor group.He spent a total of 8-1/2 years behind bars on six counts of violating labor-related laws.Sim Sang-jeoung, 45, led the largest union strike in 1985 with the collaboration of 22 labor unions. ""Girls aged between 14 to 16 had to work in a sleazy working conditions where, in summer, they made clothes for the winter,"" she recalled.While studying history in Seoul National University, Sim quit and got a sewing job in Guro, an area in eastern Seoul full of small sized factories. She spent more than 10 years on the run from the law for interfering in labor affairs as a third party and violating the draconian National Security Law.In the 1980s, some college students like Sim sought jobs in factories, without identifying themselves as college students, and helped other workers to establish labor unions.DLP secretary-general Roh Hoe-chan, 48, who earned his fame in a series of TV debate for his witty criticism, was among those who worked as a disguised laborer.Kang Ki-kap, 51, former vice chairman of Korean Peasants League, and Hyun Ae-ja, 42, former chairman in Jeju affiliation in Korean Women Farmers` Association, were elected as lawmakers under the proportional representation system.Peasants have been protesting the government`s push to ink free trade agreements with other countries, fearing the accords will result in a flood of cheap foreign agricultural goods, thus threatening their livelihood.The DLP faces its first test in summer when the KCTU has vowed to stage strikes in June if its demands, including an increase in the minimum wage, are not addressed during negotiations.The party said it would help legislate reasonable proposals from the group. Its spokesman Kim Seong-hee said the decision whether to strike or not was entirely up to the union, but the party hoped the union would not take that step.As for foreign affairs, the party supports the withdrawal of the 37,000 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea and opposes South Korea`s troop deployment to Iraq.It wants to take more generous steps toward communist North Korea and to discuss establishing a peace treaty between the old foes.Party leader Kwon said his party would introduce a motion to block the government`s plan to dispatch 3,600 troops to Iraq when the new parliament opens later this month and said he was willing to visit Pyongyang to meet with its leader Kim Jong-il.Prof. Choi said the party should rid itself of its amateurish image and project a practical and competent face to the public.""The public did not support the party based on its explicit policies but because of its clean image in comparison to the already existing parties,"" he said.""The fate of the party depends on relations between principles and pragmatism,"" said Sungkyunkwan University political observer Kim Il-young.(smjoo@heraldm.com)      SN01 ;TISeoul City launches English help-line ;DA20040505 ;TX The Seoul Metropolitan Government started Monday to provide an English help-line for expatriates in Seoul at the Seoul Help Center for Foreigners.""You may talk to English-speaking foreign volunteers to get general information on daily living by calling 02-797-8212,"" said a press release from the city government.It also said English speaking volunteers will staff the general information desk of the SHC weekdays from 9:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. and 2 p.m. to 5 p.m.Inquiries may be made in one of three ways: by dropping in to the SHC, by calling the Help-line or by e-mailing the SHC at hotline@seoul.go.kr.

"[How to manage your assets ( 16 )] With a hot KOSPI, is this best time t...",https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000065321?sid=108,"Mon, 18 Jun 2007 10:02:00 +0900","			 The following is the 16th in a series of articles analyzing financial products and offering tips for managing your assets. - Ed.It has been a very exciting few weeks for investors. The KOSDAQ is doing better than ever, despite concerns regarding inflation and interest rates. Brokers are telling you that you should get in when the market is hot. They even go as far as telling you to ""Grab the opportunity before it fizzles.""  The KOSPI and KOSDAQ have been as hot as this premature summer weather lately. Looking at moving average charts over last few years, you will all see what I mean.Each market has its ceiling. Each element of the market has its real earning potential as well as real value. Practice your own skepticism with the market: Is the market really building a foundation for a stronger future, or is it just nonsense, unjustifiable by any rationale? How about trading volume? Has there been significantly more volume, or are some of ""the big players"" making waves?  Just to be clear, I am not implying anything here since I am not an expert on the KOSPI or the KOSDAQ. I have never worked in the Korean stock market, nor have I followed it for a long time. I am just suggesting some questions you should be concerned with. I am objective since I have no mental or financial attachment to this market.Any unjustified market fluctuation always calls for market corrections. Just take caution before you make any big changes in your holdings, so you will not come out a victim after a market correction.A rule of thumb is that you do not get into the market when the market is temporarily hot.It is dangerous to be shortsighted by short ups and downs. There are not absolute theories of the behavior of stock markets. However, there are trends to market behavior. For instance, whenever a potential increase in interest rates looms, you will always hear about concerns of inflation and how the increase in interest would affect the stock indexes. Then, professionals try to justify any market performance with that reason.In reality, I think it has been quite some time since we felt the direct impact of inflation. Yes, it is true the market reacts to any Fed decision regarding interest rates, however, we are not likely to see any long term effects after the Feds` announcements. After a couple of days, the market goes back to business as usual.The Feds` obsession with having inflation under control should have been calculated into market projections. It is even boring to see market analysis and reports related to that matter so often. Do not read more into what actually is actually there: market makers` effort to stay in the spotlight. After going through the market reaction for a few days I urge you to see whether there have been big changes in the market as well as your position in the market, perhaps, with the exception of brokers fees, trading charges and possible taxable events that were brought onto you. Do not react to insignificant and temporary situations.However, this may be a good time to consider rebalancing your portfolio. We easily get attached to certain stocks and fall in love with them. Once these stocks hit a peak and start moving downwards, we can talk about the heydays until we turn blue, but it is not going to do us any good. How do we decide when to rebalance our portfolios? That`s something to be looked at, and it deserves a whole other conversation. We will continue with that next time. Till then, happy investing.By Jenny Hollingsworth The writer is a Korean-American with extensive experience as an asset manager on Wall Street.

"[NEWS ANALYSIS]N.K. seeks Obama`s attention, experts say",https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000079918?sid=108,"Mon, 19 Jan 2009 03:05:00 +0900","			 Although the message was addressed to South Korea, most experts here believe North Korea was talking mostly to the United States when it threatened a full-fledged confrontation with Seoul that could include military provocations.Hit by starvation and international isolation, Pyongyang is reportedly counting on the incoming Barack Obama administration to offer relief by normalizing their bilateral relationship. Analysts therefore believe the North was desperate to signal that it wants Washington to deliver on these expectations.""North Korea is clearly testing the United States. It wants to be on top of Washington`s agenda when President-elect Obama takes office, and it also has high hopes that it may mend fences with the United States under the new president,"" said Kim Tae-woo, vice president of the Korea Institute for Defense Analyses.Because the North can not afford to issue the United States with a direct threat, Kim said Pyongyang aimed at South Korea instead to get its message across.Experts also read a growing sense of frustration from North Korea toward Seoul`s hardnosed policies. Further, many said the message was a part of its usual brinksmanship tactics aimed to keep Seoul ""in line."" On Saturday, a spokesman for the chief of the General Staff of the North`s Korean People`s Army delivered a statement saying it had chosen the path of ""full confrontation"" with the South because the Lee Myung-bak administration had done the same, and with the assistance of outside powers.Further reflecting Pyongyang`s jitters over what may happen after Obama is sworn in, North Korean Foreign Ministry said in a separate statement on Saturday that it would be unwilling to shut down its nuclear weapons program unless it is guaranteed ""total security"" from the United States.The ministry said North Korea`s future ties with the United States are an issue that is ""totally independent"" from the issue of its retaining nuclear weapons.Earlier this month, the North issued a message that appeared to assume a softer tone against Washington, even hinting that it could abandon its nuclear weapons if relations with the United States start to improve.Pyongyang`s ties with Washington remain tense despite a series of breakthroughs in denuclearization talks over the past couple of years. A complete disablement of North`s atomic facilities, however, is yet to come.North Korea`s statements came just days before Obama`s inauguration on Jan. 20.Many had predicted Pyongyang would try to test the waters with the new U.S. government, which some said may be less hawkish due to its Democratic Party membership.But a recent confirmation hearing for Secretary of State-designate Hilary Clinton, who pledged ""aggressive efforts"" to denuclearize the North, indicated that Obama may not be as soft as believed.""Based on this observation, North Korea probably has decided it needs to appear as hard as ever unless it sees exactly what Obama`s North Korean policies will be,"" said Kim of the defense institute.Cheong Seong-chang, senior research fellow at the Sejong Institute, concluded that Saturday`s statement was more about brinkmanship diplomacy than a real military threat.""The North is stepping up pressure for South to ease up on its stance,"" Cheong said.Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the Graduate School of North Korean Studies said the Saturday statement could be a follow-up measures to the so-called ""Dec. 1 measure,"" under which North Korea sealed off the inter-Korean border and dismissed a large part of the South Korean staff working at the Gaeseong Industrial Complex and Mount Geumgang.Pyongyang had said the measures were tit-for-tat to the Lee administration`s persistently anti-North policies.Lee remains supportive of inter-Korean dialogue, but he has said denuclearization is the ""utmost priority.""  Seoul also has been reluctant to follow up on previous inter-Korean agreements, which has furthered incensed the North Koreans.Kim Jong-il`s latest health problems seem to have added to North Korea`s political anxiety, experts noted.Intelligence sources recently announced Kim has designated his youngest son, Kim Jong-un, as his successor.""The confrontation message may actually signal a pending power shift,"" said Cheong of Sejong. ""After all, the North has used similar tactics to keep the regime together when Kim Jong-il was designated as Kim Il-sung`s successor.""  Seoul, for the time being, has upped its military readiness but is trying to refrain from over-reacting, officials said.By Kim Ji-hyun (jemmie@heraldm.com)"
[NEWS ANALYSIS]Will `Green New Deal` work,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000079601?sid=108,"Wed, 07 Jan 2009 10:01:00 +0900","			 The ""Green New Deal"" calls for spending more than 50 trillion won ($38 billion) to build bike roads, re-develop four big rivers, recycle waste and other environment-friendly projects to create jobs and jumpstart the economy.The government unveiled the ambitious package yesterday, and officials hope that the plan will not only prevent the Korean economy from falling into a recession but will also provide a new growth engine. But it remains to be seen whether the package will meet the government`s goals, analysts said.""With exports weak, Korea is going all out to boost domestic consumption by expanding fiscal spending on public projects,"" said Bae Sang-geun, a research at Korea Economic Research Institute.The 50-trillion won package consists of 9 main and 27 accompanying projects, which aim to create as many as 960,000 new jobs over the next four years. At the center of the package is the highly-controversial plan to redevelop four biggest rivers - Han, Nakdong, Yeongsan and Geum, which drew criticism from opposition politicians, environmentalists and some economists.The other main projects include bike roads and an eco-friendly public transit system; a national land and property management system; anti-flood facilities and dam construction; renewable energy and green cars; waste re-use; forestation; green buildings; and urban stream rehabilitation.""This is a multi-purpose plan, aiming for job creation, coping with climate change and providing a new growth engine for the economy at the same time,"" Finance Minister Kang Man-soo told a press briefing.The package is the latest in a series of measures that Korea has offered since the start of a financial crisis in September. It has pledged $30 billion in extra fiscal spending, corporate tax breaks and income-tax reductions.""Some 4.3 trillion in funds are already earmarked this year for the Green New Deal programs, and the rest will be raised from central and provincial governments and the private sector,"" Kang said.For the entire span of four years, the central government plans to spend a total of 37.5 trillion won and expects some 5.3 trillion won to come from rural governments and the rest 7.2 trillion won from the private sector.Once those measures take effect, the country`s annual economic growth could reach 3 percent this year, government officials said. The Bank of Korea`s latest forecast is 2 percent. The economy probably contracted in the fourth-quarter of 2008 from a quarter earlier, Kang said last week.""There is no doubt that we have to expand fiscal spending. But the question is where to put state funds to give the fastest and most far-reaching boost to the economy,"" Bae said.Hyun Jung-taik, president of the Korea Development Institute, stressed that the money should be spent in areas that can create as many jobs as possible, economically stimulating and shovel-ready, rather than environmentally friendly and long-term ones.""We must keep the priority clear here. Helping the economy comes before a long-term strategy now,"" he said. ""If it happens to be environmentally friendly, that will be perfect."" Some analysts also raise doubt over the Green New Deal`s estimate that it would create 960,000 jobs.According to government officials, nearly 96 percent of the jobs involve simple physical labor in fields like construction, rather than quality skills and expertise.

[NEWS ANALYSIS] Banks sell foreign-denominated assets,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000077353?sid=108,"Tue, 07 Oct 2008 10:41:00 +0900","			 With the country`s economic policymakers urging banks to focus on securing foreign currency, local banks are looking to sell off foreign currency-denominated assets.Following the fall of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. last month, local banks have been experiencing foreign currency liquidity problems, prompting the government to announce a series of countermeasures, including plans to pour $10 billion into the currency swap market and generate an additional $5 billion through the Export-Import Bank of Korea.However, the measures drew criticism that it presented a potential moral hazard for local banks in that they may come to rely on the government to bail them out each time they experience liquidity problems.Faced with such criticism, the government is now urging the private sector take its own measures, and Minister of Strategy and Finance Kang Man-soo told a meeting of bank presidents yesterday that while the government will continue to provide support, it will also monitor and penalize financial institutions that fail to make the necessary efforts.According to industry sources, local banks have already engaged foreign currency-raising measures including selling foreign currency-denominated assets and taking out loans secured against such assets.Kookmin Bank and Woori Bank, which have been selling off foreign currency assets to generate cash, are said to be considering selling additional assets while Hana Bank is reviewing plans to sell European and other foreign bonds.As of June, Kookmin Bank had $16.5 billion worth of foreign currency-denominated assets, of which foreign currency-denominated securities account for $1.3 billion.Of Woori Bank`s $31.1 billion in foreign currency-denominated assets, $1.71 billion is held in form of foreign currency-denominated securities. For Hana Bank, foreign currency-denominated securities account for $1.46 billion of its $15.7 billion foreign currency-denominated assets.However, the banks say that selling off foreign currency-denominated securities may not be as easy as it sounds due to the poor market conditions and that lowering the price of the assets could raise questions about the banks` credit worthiness.Under such conditions, banks have resorted to holding back foreign currency loans and reducing export bill purchases. This has raised criticism from Financial Services Commission Chairman Jun Kwang-woo, who said that such measures could cause foreign currency liquidity to worsen in the long term.Aside from selling assets, local banks have come up with a number of benefits to attract foreign currency deposits such as high interest rates and exemption from exchange and transfer fees.In the recent weeks, Kookmin Bank raised the interest rate for foreign currency deposits to 4.88 percent while Woori Bank`s rates have gone from 1.9 percent to 3.5 percent.By Choi He-suk (cheesuk@heraldm.com)"
News Analysis: Kia Motors' Sell-Off in Trouble after Aborted Second Auct...,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000006061?sid=101,"Fri, 25 Sep 1998 00:00:00 +0900","			By Lee Kap-soo Staff reporter With the second round of auctions being aborted for bankrupt Kia Motors Corp. and its sister truck maker, Asia Motors Co., the Kia disposal issue is facing a dilemma. A senior official at Chong Wa Dae, the Blue House, said yesterday that the Seoul government will try for a third time to auction off Kia Motors Corp. after failing in the two previous attempts. ``I understand that Kia Motors and Asia Motors are go to on the auction block for a third time,'' said presidential spokesman Park Ji-won told reporters. Kang Bong-kyun, chief economic aide for President Kim Dae-jung said, ``The government's position is to hold a third auction, but Kia could be disposed of through a negotiated private tender. ``Accordingly, the government ministers concerned will hold a meeting in the immediate future to make decisions related to a third auction,'' he said. Creditors of the debt-stricken Kia also appear to prefer a third auction because the disposal of Kia through negotiated private contracts could bring about more amounts of debt being written off. Industry experts, meanwhile, cited the growing possibility that Kia would be disposed through a series of ``big deal'' swaps between major conglomerates, including Hyundai, Daewoo, and Samsung. Apart from these measures, the Kia auction management office is mulling over ways to establish a new corporation to take over Kia's bad debts, restructure the firm and sell the financially-improved Kia to a prospective buyer. However, all of the cited measures have had negative responses, analysts here said. Nobody can guarantee the success of a third auction as creditors are reluctant to offer additional debt write-offs, they said. Disposing of Kia through a ``big deal'' between Korea's major conglomerates is expected to face strong opposition from U.S. auto giants Ford Motor and General Motors over the fairness of the international auction. Ford Motor, which pulled out of the second round auction Sept. 12, citing Kia's ``unreasonably high amount of debt,'' said yesterday that it is opposed to the idea of disposing of Kia through big deals. The U.S. motor company also said that it would not participate in a third Kia auction unless a greater part of Kia's massive bad debts are written off. Analysts say there is no way to make Kia viable under current market situations without further writing off debts, estimated 11.86 trillion won ($8.9 billion). To lure prospective buyers, Kia's creditors offered to write off 2.9 trillion won ($2.1 billion) of Kia's principal debt for the second auction, but ended in failure as all three bidders _ Hyundai, Daewoo, and Samsung _ called for additional write-offs. The three reportedly demanded write-offs in the tune of more than 3 trillion won, in addition to the 2.9 trillion won write-off offered before the second auction. The first auction, which included Ford, also collapsed due to demands for write-offs. "
[DAVID IGNATIUS] U.S. buying time with Iran,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000102354?sid=104,"Sun, 09 Jan 2011 17:51:00 +0900"," WASHINGTON ― The Obama administration has concluded that Iran’s nuclear program has been slowed by a combination of sanctions, sabotage and Iran’s own technical troubles. Because of the delay, U.S. officials see what one describes as “a little bit of space” before any military showdown with Iran.Israeli officials, too, see more time on the clock. Moshe Yaalon, Israel’s deputy prime minister, noted the Iranian slowdown in a Dec. 29 interview with Israel Radio and said the West has up to three years to stop Tehran from making a bomb.“These (Iranian) difficulties slow the timeline, of course,” said Yaalon, a former Israeli defense chief. “Thus we cannot talk about a ‘point of no return.’” A senior Obama administration official told me he agreed: “They’re not moving as fast as we had feared a year ago.”  This new assessment of Iran’s nuclear setbacks has lowered the temperature on what had been 2010’s hottest strategic issue. Last summer, Jerusalem and Washington were talking themselves into a war fever, prompted in part by a powerful article in The Atlantic by Jeffrey Goldberg that starkly described the likelihood of military action. This fever seems to have broken.What’s increasingly clear is that low-key weapons ― covert sabotage and economic sanctions ― are accomplishing many of the benefits of military action, without the costs. It’s a devious approach ― all the more so because it’s accompanied by near-constant U.S. proposals of diplomatic dialogue ― but in that sense it matches Iran’s own operating style of pursuing multiple options at once.Officials won’t discuss the clandestine program of cyberattack and other sabotage being waged against the Iranian nuclear program. Yet we see the effects ― in crashing centrifuges and reduced operations of the Iranian enrichment facility at Natanz ― but don’t understand the causes. That’s the way covert action is supposed to work.The most direct confirmation that sabotage has paid off came from Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who said in November that the Stuxnet computer virus had damaged the Natanz operation. “They succeeded in creating problems for a limited number of our centrifuges with the software they had installed in electronic parts,” he said.A fascinating (and remarkably detailed) account of the Stuxnet attack was published Dec. 22 by the Institute for Science and International Security (http://bit.ly/em4TsM ). The study described how the virus was targeted to attack a key electronic control in the centrifuges, known as a “frequency converter,” so that the spin of the rotors was increased and slowed in a way that would cause a malfunction.According to the ISIS report, the virus may have been introduced in early or mid-2009. By late 2009 or early 2010, the study said, Iran decommissioned and replaced about 1,000 centrifuges ― far more than normal breakage. The virus hid its electronic tracks, but an analysis by the security firm Symantec showed that the code included the term “DEADFOO7,” which could refer to the aviation term for a dead engine, and also be a play on James Bond’s fictional code name.Stuxnet was just one of what appeared to have been a series of efforts to disrupt the supply chain of the Iranian nuclear program. “Such overt and covert disruption activities have had significant effect in slowing Iran’s centrifuge program,” concluded the ISIS.The delays in the Iranian program are important because they add strategic warning time for the West to respond to any Iranian push for a bomb. U.S. officials estimate that if Iran were to try a “break out” by enriching uranium at Natanz to the 90 percent level needed for a bomb, that move (requiring reconfiguration of the centrifuges) would be detectable ― and it would take Iran one to two more years to make a bomb.The Iranians could try what U.S. officials call a “sneak out” at a secret enrichment facility like the one they constructed near Qom. They would have to use their poorly performing (and perhaps still Stuxnet-infected) old centrifuges, or an unproven new model. Alternative enrichment technologies, such as lasers or a heavy-water reactor, don’t appear feasible for Iran now, officials say. Foreign technology from Russia and other suppliers has been halted, and the Iranians can’t build the complex hardware (such as a “pressure vessel” needed for the heavy-water reactor) on their own.The Obama administration keeps holding the door open for negotiations, and another round is scheduled this month in Istanbul. But the real news is that Tehran has technical problems ― bringing sighs of relief (and a few mischievous smiles) in the West.By DAVID IGNATIUS David Ignatius’ e-mail address is davidignatius@washpost.com. ― Ed.(Washington Post Writers Group)"
Imported car sales surge to all-time high,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000029065?sid=108,"Thu, 04 Apr 2002 16:16:00 +0900","			Sales of imported cars in Korea soared to an all-time monthly high of 1,163 units in March, a report said yesterday, citing the nation`s economic upturn and aggressive marketing among key contributors.The Korea Automobile Importers & Distributors Association (KAIDA) said that its nine member companies expanded local sales in March by 76 percent year-on-year to a total of 1,163 vehicles, the highest monthly volume since the opening of the nation`s automotive market in 1987.The previous monthly record of 1,137 units was set in July 1996, KAIDA officials said, forecasting further sales growth in the coming months.First-quarter imported-vehicle sales here swelled to 2,788 units, marking a 72 percent expansion from 1,621 units in the year-earlier period, the association said. At the beginning of this year, the KAIDA said that imported-vehicle sales here would hit an all-time high of 10,500 units this year, jumping about 40 percent from last year`s sales volume of 7,747 units. Sales of imported cars are projected to rise above the 15,500-level in 2003, buoyed by economic recovery, excise tax cuts and expansion of dealer networks, according to its long-term projections.In March, BMW Korea retained its market leader position with monthly sales of 344 units, while the second-ranked Toyota Motor Korea sold 234 units of its Lexus series. Behind them, Mercedes-Benz sold 176 units, followed by DaimlerChrysler (101), Ford/ Lincoln (81), Volvo (71), Audi (68), Volkswagen (45), Cadillac (12), Saab (10), Porsche (8), Land Rover (7) and Jaguar (5).In particular, BMW, Lexus, Benz and Porsche recorded their best monthly sales since their arrival in Korea. ""The ES300, the mainstay model for the Lexus series, surged to 151 units in March sales, or a total of 297 units in the first quarter, retaining its status as the single best-selling imported model in Korea,"" a Toyota Motor Korea official said. BMW 530i and BMW 525i ranked as the second- and third-best selling models, respectively.According to the KAIDA analysis, imported cars with engine displacement of less than 3,000 cc accounted for 77.8 percent of the total first-quarter sales, up from 68.2 percent in the same quarter of 2001.By price, models in the range of 50 million won (about $37,900) to 70 million won accounted for 30.2 percent, or 843 units, of the first-quarter total. Meanwhile, Seoul accounted for 61 percent, or 1,702 units, of the quarterly total, the association noted.(cmyoo@koreaherald.co.kr)By Yoo Cheong-mo Staff reporter"
It is about time Korea becomes even ‘smarter’,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000093286?sid=104,"Wed, 16 Jun 2010 17:46:00 +0900","			 Back when most of humanity lived in the countryside, our ancestors created some of history’s most useful urban innovations. Paved roads, aqueducts and sewers, and great universities and libraries are just a few of the ancient innovations that helped our cities thrive.But I wonder -- are we still committed to the kind of bold thinking that propels urban civilization forward?  Much depends on the answer to that question. As we confront an array of momentous challenges, from climate change to the economy, it is becoming clear that cities must figure prominently in the solutions.In 2007, we crossed a major threshold. For the first time ever, more than half of all humans were urban dwellers. By 2050, that number will rise to 70 percent. In light of these statistics, the nations that prevail in the future will be the ones that make their cities more productive, more efficient and healthier places to live and work.Investment will flow to these advanced metropolises. Highly skilled and educated workers will seek them out. Cities that haven’t addressed the key issues -- crime, transportation, education, sustainable development and so forth -- will be at an extreme disadvantage.Complicating matters is the fact that city problems are by nature hard problems. Put a million or two people in a relatively small space with a finite infrastructure, and there will be a broad spectrum of challenges. This is especially true for older cities, where the infrastructure was not designed to meet modern demands.Here in South Korea, we have 37 cities with a population of more than 49 million -- Seoul, Daejeon, Daegu and Busan are some of the major cities. Fortunately, digital and physical infrastructures are converging, and as a result, we are now able to understand complex urban systems that previously resisted investigation.One benefit of the microelectronics revolution is that tiny, inexpensive sensors -- embedded in everything from transportation networks to food distribution systems to waterways -- can supply a torrent of relevant data.That data, analyzed and interpreted with sophisticated software, allows us to make better use of both natural and man-made resources and systems. We can apply these new capabilities to predict traffic jams with uncanny accuracy, make office buildings more environmentally efficient, trace contaminated food products back to their source, and do a host of other important things.Some nations are already working hard with these technologies in creating the cities of the future. In Shanghai, China, IBM just held the SmarterCities Forum that brought together approximately 800 political and business leaders from across the country to explore urban solutions. Participants heard a variety of advanced global projects and solutions which have been making cities “smarter.”  But these leaders were there to do more than listen. They will take the knowledge they gained at the conference and apply it in projects across the world.Here in Korea we have our own success stories to tell. For example, IBM has been selected to build a public safety system for Incheon Free Economic Zone using IBM hardware and software products. High resolution cameras are used to view and monitor activities in the IFEZ, helping the Authority prevent crime and even predict possible events by recognizing and analyzing certain patterns and data in real-time. It detects suspicious objects or people by identifying and analyzing patterns in the footage and simultaneously notifies the results to relevant agencies via high-speed wired or wireless networks. Also, the system allows for easy search and analysis of past data and connection to other digital appliances.The city infrastructure project, initiated by Incheon metropolitan government and IFEZ Authority, is aiming to prevent crimes targeted at women and children, driven by the government’s efforts of turning Incheon into a major economic hub in Northeast Asia which is also conducive to foreign investment.But we should be doing so much more. Recently, there has been a series of child kidnappings and sexual assaults that left the citizens of Korea in astonishment. Previously convicted offenders raped children or made attempts to rape children by kidnapping girls on school grounds. Some of the incidents even led to the gruesome murder of the rape victims in the end.Public safety not only in IFEZ but across Korea could be making a remarkable turnaround with smarter systems by preventing incidents like the ones above. Considering the fact that many of the crime scenes took place within school zones, a smarter safety system for the sake of child protection could be implemented on school grounds, utilizing complete high-definition and wide-view security camera systems which could be linked to the closest police station who are equipped with the manpower to mobilize in emergency situations.Then who would be up for taking on the task of making smarter and safer cities? Korea already has an abundant pool of talent. Korea has amazingly talented people who can contribute to make such changes -- mathematicians, engineers, business experts -- as well as marvelous universities. It is well known that Korean talent is always sweeping Olympiad competitions in math and science. Also, the whole world is aware of Korea’s outstanding high-technology including mobile and electronic devices, automobiles and countless others. Equipped with the smartest manpower and smartest technology, I see all of them taking part in building South Korea’s future into a smarter one.Such a talent base gives us a big advantage. What’s needed now is for our political leaders to take a holistic look at how urban areas can use this technology to build a competitive advantage in a globalized world.Leaders at all levels must work to ensure that our regulations, policies and institutions encourage innovation, not hinder it. And they must help to create the standards needed to deploy intelligent systems that interoperate with other government services -- for example, common interfaces that allow water, traffic, and public safety systems to “talk” to each other.Just as ancient aqueducts made big cities possible by successfully addressing the problem of supplying clean water to a large number of residents, building intelligence into today’s cities can equip our citizens to live better, more productive lives.The key factor we need to complete “Smarter Cities” is the systematic integration of various city functions.“Smarter City” effectively interconnects all functions of an “Island Operation” in which security, healthcare, communication, education, transportation and public services are individually operated. In other words, the “Systems of Systems” is the “Smarter City” and we will be the ones to start the engine.By anticipating China‘s urbanization for the upcoming 25 years, the leaders of China pondered upon the related issues in order to plan the 2010 Shanghai Expo as a turning point to the new era. It makes me wonder whether I was the only one impressed by such insight.The writer is director of general business of IBM Korea – Ed."
"[Alliance in Action] At S. Korea-US summit, extended deterrence upgrade ...",https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000244871?sid=104,"Wed, 29 Mar 2023 19:02:00 +0900","Ex-ambassador to US Ahn Ho-young says Seoul must enhance its own defense capabilities, not just rely on the USAhn Ho-young, former South Korean ambassador to the United States, speaks during an interview with The Korea Herald. (Lee Sang-sub/The Korea Herald)This is the first installment of a series of interviews, features and analysis on the South Korea-US alliance -- a 70-year-old partnership that has been instrumental in shaping the Korean Peninsula's contemporary history from the ruins of the 1950-53 Korean War, and which continues to serve as a stalwart pillar of regional security, as well as its challenges ahead. -- Ed.Former South Korean Ambassador to the US, Ahn Ho-young, has urged leaders of the US and South Korea to hold an in-depth discussion on upgrading US measures to strengthen extended deterrence, its commitment to defending South Korea using the full extent of its military capabilities.The call comes ahead of a summit in Washington next month, where South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol will meet with US President Joe Biden to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the bilateral alliance.Ahn has stated that there is a ""sense of urgency"" for stronger extended deterrence, as South Korea faces a significant security threat from North Korea.""More than 70 percent of Koreans question whether we should just rely on the (current) extended deterrence measures as they face looming threats from Pyongyang every single day, and that we also should develop nuclear weapons on our own,"" Ahn said in an interview with The Korea Herald, citing multiple surveys conducted in recent months.""(This is why) the two leaders should discuss whether the current extended deterrence is adequate for the present situation,"" he said, when asked what priorities the two countries should have on the summit table.Expectations are high ahead of the summit for the two countries to forge a stronger-than-ever alliance to deter North Korea's provocations and continued threats of nuclear attacks. Ahn said he believes that the alliance is and should continue to be at the center of protecting democratic values and the rule of law.""At a time when the world order is in a state of flux, what we need is to protect the universal values of free democracy, the rule of law and human rights with countries that share these values,"" he said.""As these values are currently under threat from the rise of autocracies, as well as the growing threat posed by North Korea, I believe the alliance between South Korea and the US is crucial in protecting them.""Last year, North Korea fired at least 70 ballistic missiles over 30 rounds, including eight intercontinental ballistic missiles. So far this year, it has fired eight missiles in just three months. The regime is also preparing for its seventh nuclear test which Seoul forecasts could be carried out at some point when all physical preparations are done.Ahn said he is supportive of a NATO-style nuclear-planning groups to deter growing insecurity on the Korean Peninsula, and emphasized that South Korea must take steps to enhance its own defense capabilities, rather than relying solely on the US.And there has also been ""a positive shift in perception"" towards the program in the US in recent years, he said.“That is the feeling that I receive by meeting people from the US, the one that I received last year and this year. It is evolving. It is getting more positive,” he said.According to a report released in January 2021, the Chicago Council on Global Affairs recommended the creation of an Asian Nuclear Planning Group that would include Australia, Japan and South Korea in the US nuclear planning processes. Another report released in January of this year by the CSIS suggested that the US should establish a framework for joint nuclear planning, similar to a North Atlantic Treaty Organization planning group.“It is essential for South Korea to strengthen its response capabilities and the three-axis system, rather than relying solely on the US,"" Ahn said.The three-axis system refers to the South Korean military’s response plan to intercept and destroy North Korea’s nuclear weapons and missiles and destroy key facilities such as its command. This system includes the Kill Chain system, the Korea Air and Missile Defense and the Korea Massive Punishment and Retaliation plan.The Kill Chain system would launch a preemptive strike against the North's missile facilities and possibly its leadership if an imminent attack is detected; the KAMD would intercept North Korean missiles heading for the South; and the KMPR would be used to take out North Korea's leadership and military facilities if it strikes South Korea.During former Lee Myung-bak and Park Geun-hye administrations, the term, “three-axis system,” was used, but during the Moon Jae-in government, terms such as ""Kill Chain"" were virtually abolished out of consideration for inter-Korean relations.Under the Yoon administration, it seeks to “drastically strengthen” the three-axis system in the face of North Korea's nuclear and missile advancement and provocations.Bring up IRA, CHIPS ActOn the economic front, the former ambassador to the US suggested that President Yoon address unfair US policies, including the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS and Science Act, during the upcoming summit with President Biden. Ahn believes that these policies have the potential to harm South Korean companies, and that it is appropriate to raise these issues ""at the state head level.""Korean chip firms such as Samsung Electronics and SK hynix could potentially expose their sales and technology confidential information during the screening process by US authorities under the CHIPS and Science Act. Additionally, if they receive subsidies from the US, they are prohibited from expanding their chip production capacity in China by more than 5 percent for the next decade.Korean carmakers have been concerned that they have been experiencing unexpected losses from the enactment of the IRA. Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors say their electric vehicle sales have decreased as the act only entitles EVs assembled in North America to a subsidy.Related to these unfair measures by the US, Ahn raised concerns that if the US does not comply with international rules and regulations and pursues its own benefits only, it will ""lose its moral high ground"" and may even be seen as giving up the rule of law. He believes that such measures are particularly worrisome, because they are causing the most trouble for its allies, including South Korea.Ahn pointed out that during Biden's visit to Korea last year, he met with leaders of Samsung Electronics and Hyundai Motors, and SK Chairman Chey Tae-won was called to the White House for a meeting two months later when he announced a significant investment in the US.“Companies like Samsung, Hyundai Motor and SK are the ones that most positively respond to and cooperate with US policies,” he said. “However, they are also the ones most seriously impacted by US measures.”Ahn is confident that frank discussions between Yoon and Biden can effectively address concerns regarding these policies. ""I believe that a transparent and frank dialogue between the two leaders will lead to solutions that benefit both countries and further strengthen the alliance at such an important time,"" he said.Ahn was Seoul's former top envoy to the US in the conservative Park Geun-hye administration from 2013 to 2017. The career diplomat also served as South Korean ambassador to the European Union and Belgium and a Sherpa ambassador to the G20 before being appointed as vice foreign minister in 2012. Following a term as president of the University of North Korean Studies between 2018 and 2022, he is currently Chair Professor of North Korean Studies at Kyungnam University."

With the housing market-related liquidity growing, home prices have continued to rise in recent weeks, industry watchers note.Whether the reviving property market will affect the capital flow will be closely watched by analysts and monetary policymakers.""We expect a `property market factor` to be critical in the supply and demand of the stock market,"" said Kang Sung-mo, chief strategist at Korea Investment & Securities Co. Although there is no statistical evidence available, past records support a direct capital movement between the property and the equity market, he said.The policy measures to curb property speculation unveiled in August last year and March this year, for example, boosted the local bourse that had undergone a correction at that time, he added.Retail and local institutional players have extended their investment while foreign investors who once were dominant, have began to shun Korean stocks. Savings funds, in particular, were a major source of capital that cushioned the selling spree of foreign investors until recently.""But now, rising housing prices will likely to induce many retail investors to buy property,"" the strategist said. The daily average stock-type savings funds flowing into the local bourse is estimated to be at a record low of between 10 billion and 20 billion won.A series of the regulator`s warnings do not seem to deter commercial lenders from extending mortgage loans to households seeking to buy property.Kim Seong-hwa, director of the bank supervision department at the FSS yesterday warned financial institutions of a potential credit risk stemming from a business downturn and a sharp fall in housing prices. ""We intend to bolster our monitoring of the pace of household debt growth and the financial health of institutions,"" he said.Mortgage loans surged in October as an increasing number of households heavily borrowed from financial institutions on anticipation of surging housing prices in the coming months, industry sources say. In October, the combined fresh loans of the nation`s four prime lenders - Kookmin, Shinhan, Woori and Hana Bank - reached almost 1.9 trillion won, according to industry estimates.The new credit demand began to pick up in September after staying sluggish for about three months. At the end of October, mortgage loans extended by the banks totaled 139.1 trillion won.Banks` aggressive marketing strategies and downward trends in  mortgage loan interest rates should sustain the growth momentum in new mortgage loan demand throughout the year, according to banking officials.The North Korea issue has turned out to be a mere political event - so far - and a sharp pick up in housing prices will take on greater importance in future monetary policy-making, analysts said.With rising domestic liquidity, many industry experts have warned that massive floating funds could distort capital markets. While the stock market has undergone a correction phase, investors remained reluctant to make a long-term investment decision and have invested in money market funds and other short-term financial products. Excessive floating funds are not desirable because it makes it difficult to channel sufficient long-term capital into the corporate sector via the stock market.Historically low interest rates have induced many Koreans to heavily borrow money to purchase apartments. ""As long as rates remain low, liquidity should continue to expand, driving up housing prices,"" said D.S. Shin, economist at Samsung Securities Co.Domestic bank`s average interest rate on household loans stands at 6 percent, half of what it was 10 years ago, he notes.A shift by the government to an expansionary stance in an effort to prevent economic slowdown because of the North Korea issue is also likely to boost housing prices, he added.(jungmin@heraldm.com)   "
[TECH ANALYSIS]Korean breakthrough in hydrogen storage,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000059967?sid=108,"Tue, 15 Aug 2006 10:02:00 +0900","Professor Ihm`s new compound could provide key to making hydrogen-based cars  By Choi He-suk Professor Ihm Ji-soon of Seoul National University`s School of Physics and Astronomy, recently announced his research team has developed a new compound that can store hydrogen. Experts say his development of a new material could prove to be the key to making hydrogen vehicles cheaper and safer.Some scientists believe that the biggest obstacle in finding an alternative to fossil fuel is presented by motorized vehicles. Electricity for general use can be generated with nuclear power, but a miniature nuclear generator mounted on a car is an unlikely solution. For some researchers hydrogen-based technology represents the only plausible solution to producing mobile power generating units.Hydrogen can be burned in a similar process to fossil fuel combustion or it can be used to generate energy in specially designed devices known as fuel cells.In a fuel cell the only reactants required for the generation of energy are hydrogen and oxygen, and the resultant reaction has higher efficiency than conventional engines.""Hydrogen fuel cells are nearly twice as energy efficient as conventional internal combustion engines using fossil fuels,"" said Hong Seong-ahn, director of the National R&D Organization for Hydrogen and Fuel Cell at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology.However, there are many obstacles that must be overcome before hydrogen cars become widely distributed.One major problem is the lack of an effective method of hydrogen storage on board vehicles. When at ambient temperature and pressure, the range provided by a finite volume of hydrogen gas is only a fraction provided by the same volume of fossil fuel.""Because it is a gas and therefore has large volume, storing enough hydrogen is a major obstacle in making hydrogen vehicles efficient,"" said Hong.""Currently the most common method of hydrogen storage is using pressurized containers, but this method has draw backs in terms of safety because of the pressure required."" The current method requires the gas to be stored at pressures 700 times greater than the ground level atmosphere.Another currently available method of storage is liquefaction, a process that converts gases into liquids using high pressures and low temperatures. The liquefaction method reduces the volume but also decreases the amount of energy released by hydrogen.The major draw back for both these methods is that the processes to liquefy or compress hydrogen require a large amount of energy, to the extent that the energy gained by using hydrogen fuel is cancelled out by the losses made in the preparation processes.However, the hydrogen storage problem could soon become a thing of the past following Ihm and his team`s groundbreaking discovery.The new material enables hydrogen storage at relatively high temperatures and low pressure by storing hydrogen, not as a gas or a liquid, but as a solid.The material consists of titanium attached to polyacetylene, an organic polymer formed by a series of acetylene molecules linking together. Several titanium atoms bind at regular intervals along the polyacetylene molecules and form highly stable bonds.The team developed the material using a supercomputer which simulates reactions and calculates energy changes within the given parameters. Initially the team used the computer to test thousands of different combinations using different polymers and elements.Further tests showed that of all the elements tested, titanium formed the most stable complex with polyacetylene molecules and also had the largest capacity for hydrogen binding.The new material developed by Ihm has a potential hydrogen storing capacity that exceeds the U.S. Department of Energy`s goal set for 2010 by 25 percent.""This material binds hydrogen with absolutely no energy input, and the hydrogen can then be extracted using relatively small amounts of energy,"" said Lee Hoon-kyung, a Ph.D student who played a major part in Ihm`s research.""The amazing thing about our discovery is not the fact that we have developed a hydrogen storing material, it is the fact that our material binds and releases hydrogen using very little energy and that the process can be controlled with precision."" One advantage of the material developed by Ihm is that the polyacetylene molecules hold the titanium atoms at a fixed distance from each other. Without the rigid polyacetylene structure the titanium atoms would bind to each other following hydrogen extraction, reducing the hydrogen binding capacity.The structure formed between the polyacetylene molecules themselves provide Ihm`s findings with another key advantage over previously developed materials. The polyacetylene molecules become entangled with each other forming a solid structure ideal for the safe storage of hydrogen.The strength of the bonding between titanium and polyacetylene and between titanium and hydrogen also play a very important role in making Ihm`s research successful.Other researchers have investigated the possibilities of using nanomaterials for hydrogen storage but have failed to produce practical results because of inefficient bonding energies between the materials involved.Within Ihm`s material the bonding between the titanium atoms and the polyacetylene molecules are stronger than that of titanium and hydrogen. Such characteristics give researchers the ability to cause the material to release the hydrogen at the required moment without affecting the structure of the material.""The new storage method made possible by Ihm`s new compound is a major breakthrough in hydrogen fuel technology,"" said Bae Joong-myeon, the head of Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology`s New Energy Conversion System Laboratory.Although the team`s research has resulted in improving dramatically on the current technological limits of hydrogen storage, it maybe a long time until every car in the world is running on hydrogen.The production cost of a fuel cell is several times higher than the cost of a complete conventional car, making hydrogen fuel cell cars too expensive for the general public.The problem of hydrogen production, the raw materials and the energy cost, is another problem that must be addressed before hydrogen cars can become a feasible replacements for fossil fuel powered vehicles.The material developed by Ihm and his team needs to undergo more research before it is used on an industrial scale.""We have made a scientific breakthrough but we are not saying that our research is the final solution, the material itself needs to be manufactured and tested,"" said Lee.""The question is to increase its hydrogen storage capacity; the next step for our research is to find the conditions and the materials that can provide the answers."" (cheesuk@heraldm.com)   "

If the five decide to follow tradition and resign, it will affect the efficiency and stability of the prosecution, as they are all important figures currently supervising investigations into big cases.Ahn Dai-hee, 50, chief prosecutor of the Supreme Prosecutors` Office, and Lee Jong-baek, 55, chief of Seoul Central Prosecutors` Office are both members of the 17th league with Choung.They have both decided not to resign for the time being, following government guidelines to ""minimize personnel shifts resulting from the chief prosecutor`s resignation"". However, legal experts say their decision to remain at their posts, may be temporary.At the Seoul Central Prosecutors` office, under Lee Jong-baek`s orders, several large cases are under investigation: `the X-file`-National Intelligence Service`s wiretapping of government officials, the Doosan slush funds scandal, the Samsung chairman`s alleged illegal transfer of Everland convertible bonds, and Lone Star Investment`s tax evasions, among others.Members of the 17th league are closely watching each other because if one resigns, the others will follow in a domino effect.Justice Minister Chun Sang-bae and the chief-prosecutor-designate held a private, emergency meeting at the Palace Hotel in Seocho-dong, Seoul, last Tuesday for two hours to discuss possible personnel outcomes. Their meeting was triggered by the resignations, on the same day, of two prosecutors who passed the 16th bar exam.During the meeting, they discussed measures to prevent the resignations of the 17th league.The only apparent alternative to a knock down series of resignations is to encourage the league members not to resign as a way of serving the best interests of the organization. However, this would entail breaking hierarchical tradition by attempting to divide authority among the six members of the 17th league including the Prosecutor-General.Korea?Ψs prosecution body has a strict hierachy. When someone at the top gives an order, the people ranked below them obey. This rule is applied to all decision-making within the prosecution and is intended to ensure a fluid, efficient, and fair process.The question is therefore whether it is realistically possible to convince prosecutors who are used to abiding to a strict order of hierachy to accept orders from colleagues of the same rank.Choung has implied there should be a shake-up of the hierarchical system altogether, a reform of traditions that some think could cause more harm than good to the body.""Should we keep the pyramid style or lead the prosecution body in democratic conversation?"" Choung asked.On the other hand, one prosecutor commented that resignations of senior prosecutors are necessary for juniors to be promoted.  ""I have to resign to make place for junior prosecutors to be promoted. Wouldn`t they think the same way too?"" he said.With the parliamentary hearing for the confirmation of Cheong scheduled on the 18th of this month, people are waiting to see what will follow after he is officially sworn in as Prosecutor-General.Meanwhile the nomination of three judges, Kim Ji-hyung, Kim Hwang-sik and Park Si-hwan, to justice positions in the Supreme Court, has resulted in five judges tendering their resignations. The parliamentary hearings for the three justice-designates will start tomorrow  and continue through Friday.(jkwon@heraldm.com)    "

Barret, therefore, advises companies to enjoy competition rather than pursuing the seemingly elusive market.""If there`s money to be made there (in blue ocean), you will not be alone,"" Barett said in a recent executive forum ""How Companies Win in Dynamic Competition.""  He compared the blue ocean with alchemy, a medieval ""science"" which attempted to turn base metals such as iron into gold.""People think that `Wouldn`t it be nice if we can turn red into gold?` and `Wouldn`t it be nice if we can find a place to be alone, called the blue ocean?`"" said the professor of business leadership, strategy and organization at the top business school.The Blue Ocean Strategy was written by W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne, professors at INSEAD, a renowned business school based in France.The book has gained popularity here in Korea because top business and government leaders including President Roo Moo-hyun, Samsung executive vice chairman Yun Jong-yong and Information and Communication Minister Chin Dae-je are known to be avid readers of the book.But, Barret said companies cannot avoid competition and should enjoy it. He said competition encourages companies to keep going, eventually benefiting them.""When firms survive a period of competing, they become in the long run much better off...You have this ongoing race, this dynamics where every time you innovate, this causes your rival to innovate...it`s an evolutionary race,"" Barret said.""It`s not comfortable. But it`s what generates progress."" He applied his finding to the Red Queen theory, an evolutionary theory which says that species co-evolve by racing against one another.The Red Queen refers to a moving chess piece in the book Through the Looking Glass, the second book of the Alice in Wonderland series. In the book, Alice has to run just to stay in the same place because the Red Queen is running as well. But eventually they go farther than they were before.""The point of the red queen competition is that competition is common; it is an engine that generates capabilities,"" Barret said.Barret earned his bachelor`s degree from the University of California, Berkeley in 1982 and a Ph.D in 1988.

It's time to normalize market functions: Government should give Bank of ...,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000013839?sid=101,"Wed, 08 Dec 1999 00:00:00 +0900","			Following is an article contributed by Choi Gong-pil, a senior economist at the Korea insitute of Finance. - Ed.By Choi Gong-pil The booming economy and scattered signs of opulence have convinced even the skeptics that the future is bright. These improving conditions belie the fact that only two years ago, Korea, as well as the rest of Asia, was in dire financial straits. The recent upturn should not sway us from the course of solving the fundamental problems of our economy. Yet, with improving economic conditions, we are now hearing about the desire to return to the ancien regime.Side effects of painless remedy The current pace of the no-nonsense inflation-free rebound is a common feature among Asian crisis countries. The strong recovery worldwide is a reminder that the imperative for massive restructuring is equally hard to sustain in good times as well as amid acute social and economic pains. Technically speaking, a strong cyclical rebound is not necessarily a symptom of recovery, since it is hard to distinguish how much of it is attributable to a sustainable improvement in each country's competitiveness. It is a reminder that real restructuring has not been achieved. To analyze the implications of painless remedies, we can think of the following:First, a sense of complacency and a lack of incentive to reform. Under favorable conditions, it is increasingly difficult to persuade the general public that we have to continue with our restructuring efforts to prevent further crisis. With the exception of reducing the debt ratio in the corporate sector and maintaining the capital adequacy ratio in the banking sector, restructuring objectives have been largely mitigated. Moreover, the upcoming political season will encourage us to indulge in complacency after the much-feared Daewoo-investment trust company (ITC) problems and the prevalent signs of improvement. But we should never forget that fixing structural problems, especially with a micro approach, requires a lengthy period of time and enormous costs. We currently fall far short of our objectives.Second, it poses a serious burden on the government in maintaining economic stability. When erroneous signals are issued or no early warning signs appear, economic agents tend to move in the wrong direction, turning the booming economy into an economic bubble with no serious improvement in the market infrastructure. This development requires an abrupt change in policy and huge subsequent economic costs for stabilization. In a sense, we overachieved in generating a strong rebound using a low interest and expansionary policy mix. However, our underachievements in restructuring could easily backfire due to over-extension in expansionary policy or various external shocks.Real signs of improvement The current talk about economic policy is about inflation and the need for preemptive policy efforts by the government, but the real concern should not be inflation per se but the aforementioned false sense of achievement. At the very moment when reform ought to be pushed even more strongly, all the indicators surrounding us unanimously confirm that the current heartbeat of the economy is perfectly healthy. Growth is robust, inflation remains a concern only for a small group of unrealistic economists and the current account balance is rapidly improving with even greater inflow of capital. Is this too much of a good thing or just temporary hype? Confusion naturally ensues.The real signs of improvement cannot be easily detected except through analysis of the trend changes in micro data. Macro data cannot possibly detect and monitor necessary changes that have to take place now for the government to continue sound economic management. It is reported that patients with terminal illnesses are likely to experience rapid improvement after a series of treatments, which are followed by equally abrupt bouts of deterioration. A similar pattern can be seen for an economy in the wake of a financial crisis. With scant presence of world class performers in this part of the world, we seem to lack true standards for measuring our progress and we should admit grudgingly that little progress is being made in terms of operational software. The crisis was complex, but our review procedure during the recovery phase has been simplistically based on a linearized criterion of growth, inflation and external account. An abundant money supply and fiscal support can easily heal the superficial wounds of the crisis, but this is not the same thing as curing problems that require systematically overhauling bad parts. Even though we reverted to pre-crisis levels in economic performance, our decision-making process remains largely unaffected since core members seem to be weathering the challenges of crisis successfully. This is what retards progress in real terms. Better recovery would rely on improved market functioning, yet there is a wide belief even now that public intervention has proved very effective. Unless the government retreats from massive intervention in dealing with market imperfections, we cannot really be sure whether we have graduated from the IMF-support program. In short, the real test of survivability of our reformed economy was not administered at all.Policy curfew needs to be lifted The first phase of recovery, which consists of getting rid of the bad parts and cleaning up operations, should be followed by a normal resumption of activities in the market. What appears sound and solid can easily go bad if the financial system is not normalized in a timely manner. It is time to divert our attention from seeking further improvement in macro indicators to a more balanced approach to achieve both structural efficiency and economic stability. For that, the government ought to announce the true state of the economy publicly, redirecting our attention from enjoying the fruit of our success to improving our international competitiveness. Rather than spurring the already overconfident market players, we need a cool head to criticize. More specifically, the economy is entering a treacherous zone of a possible econombic bubble or chronic depression with huge boom and bust cycles. Since all our attempts were concentrated on reviving the economy in 1998, the economy is now beginning to show signs of overheating, even though this is a limited phenomenon. What really concerns us is that our interest rate policy is immobilized or tied completely to preventing the aggravation of the ITC-Daewoo problems. Of course, lowering the interest rate was very instrumental in retarding the redemption drive by investors at ITCs, effectively aborting the November crisis. But if market function is not normalized in the short run, the side effects can easily swamp the beneficial effects, likely activating a vicious cycle of market confidence loss and financial imploding. At this stage, normalizing market functioning is far more important than preventing market instability. In essence, the authority resorted to a macro-oriented policy to placate micro disruptions, creating the danger of overusing the interest rate policy and paralyzing the bond market. It was feared that fixing the micro problems of Daewoo and the ITCs required hard decisions that might result in a massive and acute financial market panic. If this concern was real, then using a policy mix of macro and structural remedies would be appropriate. That is, a low interest rate policy could serve as anesthesia for a major operation. To sum up, current stability in the financial market is not sustainable because it accelerates the already booming economy, thus attracting more capital inflow and exerting upward pressure on the won. The result is an environment that cannot be sustained, with a fragile financial sector and untreated fundamental problems.Tackling future agenda If the 1997 crisis was not merely a painful cyclical downturn that can be addressed with temporary measures, the current pace of recovery needs to be examined carefully. In the wake of crises in the Asian region, many countries were put into IMF support programs that proved to be instrumental in rendering a sharp recovery after a drastic contraction. Since the initial compression was so severe and universal, the subsequent rebound was equally strong and synchronized among Asian crises countries. Now most of our attention is focused on marveling at the resiliency of the crisis economies rather than agonizing about fixing the system to enjoy enhanced competitiveness through restructuring. In essence, the rapid turnaround does not help us concentrate on our weak points, such as fixing and improving on the quality of growth in terms of structural issues, e.g., polarization of industries, worsening income distribution, etc. Instead of being dazzled by a remarkable recovery, we need to be conservative with our assessment of current conditions in order to better prepare for the future. It is unavoidable that side effects from policy measures and serious structural problems need to be resolved to envisage a brighter future. Above all, current efforts to stabilize short-term interest rates using a bond market stabilization fund should come to an end. The stabilization of the short-term interest rate has three major drawbacks: First, it accelerates the already booming economy and a bubble can develop as a result. Second, it brings in capital inflow to such an extent that both external and internal equilibria are sacrificed. The business cycle amplitude can increase as the capital account is inherently destabilizing. Third, the inflation cycle can start with an even steeper yield curve which will distort the financial market in favor of increasingly short-term and largely speculative use of money. Fourth, there is no legitimate reason for intervening in the market when the root cause of the problem is not properly attacked in one way or another. Further, even without invoking the worst case scenario of financial panic, the normalization of the bond market would start the self-corrective process immediately with a stabilizing effect on macro performance.Surely, delaying structural remedies in favor of stability is beginning to lose its initially desirable impact. A booming stock market with even greater participation by foreigners who can enjoy interest risk-free investments with the help of our government can lead to a rapid flow reversal later when interest rates cannot be stabilized further and a sharp appreciation begins to take a toll in the current account. For whom is the interest rate artificially maintained? To circumvent this, the government should at least give a free hand to the Bank of Korea on interest rate policy and let the market mechanism iron out imbalances. The remedy is to lift the curfew on interest rate policy and allow the authority to administer a diverse policy mix even against volatile environments. Unless the authority is given a degree of freedom to deal with future problems, we will always end up dealing with even bigger problems. The cooling effect of raising the interest rate gradually will bring us both stable output and price performance, even though the initial impact would largely fall on capital market performance. Interest rate targeting or smoothing at potential output is surely destabilizing rather than stabilizing, because we are replacing financial market stability with macro instability that requires even greater adjustment later. Raising the interest rate is feared to cause adjustment in the stock market but the adjustment ought to take place, since those sensitive parts need not be sustained at the expense of increased tax burden on most middle and lower income groups, which do not even have access to the stock market.Sequencing to moderate the boom and bust cycle Finally, overseas interest rates are on an upward trend. Thus, slowly adjusting the short-term interest rate is a first step toward securing the maneuverability of the government for the future. If the current stance is left unadjusted until the election, we cannot but resort to an emergency brake which will largely hurt those unprepared middle-lower income brackets once again. Raising short-term rates in a smooth manner, which is only possible when no visible signs of inflation exist, would accelerate restructuring, help stabilize capital flows and check inflationary pressures. We need to learn the basic market principle that price variables are expected to clear the market and the price-takers accept some chance of risks. Market players and special interest groups are just part of our electoral body and their aspirations should not be weighed too much in the disfavor of the silent public, lest the soundness of the economy be sacrificed. The government should not relegate the burden of risk-taking to the general public in the belief that financial turbulence is a menace to all. Before worrying about overheating, it is time to go back to our reform agenda and make real progress according to the standards of our future generation. It is a shame that we have to wait and see the development of a bubble economy when we can do something in advance to prevent it. If this is a truly democratic capitalist society, now is the right time to ask ourselves who should sit in the driver's seat now and in the future. Enhanced public awareness of future tax liabilities, a strengthened restructuring drive and a flexible policy mix are requisite armor for entering the turbulent second phase of the recovery and growth period in 2000."
[NEW ANALYSIS]Is Chung`s power stretch threatened in Uri Party?,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000043550?sid=108,"Wed, 28 Apr 2004 13:32:00 +0900","			  The following is the last in a series of articles about five groups in the Uri Party. - Ed.By Lee Joo-hee  Too many hands may try to control the pro-government Uri Party now that its many diverse groups managed to stick together just long enough to win a majority of seats in this month`s general elections.As factional splits begin to surface, the spotlight is on party Chairman Chung Dong-young to see whether he and his faction can focus the party`s various elements enough to keep them operating together throughout the next four years in the National Assembly.It is a highly challenging task, as Chung`s group alone comprises approximately 80 newly elected lawmakers with contrasting backgrounds, experts say. The group is recognized for its market-friendliness and greater emphasis on stability rather than radical changes.Another key will be the leadership`s future relationship with President Roh Moo-hyun, the experts say.""Chung`s faction will continue to be the central force in the party, but the question is whether Roh will help the leadership along by pushing policy lines in line with its positions,"" said political science Prof. Kim Yong-ho of Inha University.Roh`s stance with the party s crucial since he has to distance himself from party politics, as he promised, while wielding enough influence on parliament to get his policies working if his presidency is reinstated, Kim said.Roh was suspended by the old opposition-led Assembly March 12 for violating the Elections Law. The Constitutional Court is expected to take a final decision on Roh`s political fate in mid-May.Chung`s faction includes the former Millennium Democratic Party members and experts recruited from the fields of academic, journalism, law and business.His mainstream group is one of four different groupings in the Uri Party, along with the reformists led by Rhyu Shi-min, the ex-dissidents headed by party`s floor representative Kim Geun-tae and a collection of Roh`s former aides.Chung, whose leadership was underscored in the elections by Uri increasing its parliamentary seating to 152 from 49, is viewed as a potential future president.He has been enjoying powerful popularity unusual for a relatively young politician who has served just two terms in the legislature.A former TV journalist, Chung has successfully maintained a clean-cut and humble image, which earned him the chairman`s seat in the party`s January national caucus held two months after its official launch in November.Chung acted quickly to gather his allies, in collaboration with his colleagues from the MDP, despite boiling opposition from many within the party who felt threatened by his spreading power.With the general elections barely three months away, Chung used the time well to recruit as many prominent figures as possible and put them in the vanguard of the campaign committee.Among elected candidates closest to Chung are former Culture Minister Kim Han-kil and Rep. Chung Dong-chea, who shared the same policy lines with Chung Dong-young since their MDP days.According to party sources, they were the ones Chung Dong-young was able to confide in when he suffered a heavy backlash during the campaign for making remarks that disparaged older voters.Reps. Shin Ki-nam and Chun Jung-bae are also among Chung`s collaborators, but they pose a potential threat to his leadership.Among recruited members, former KyungHee University President Park Myung-kwang is viewed as one of Chung`s strongest supporters. Park headed Chung`s campaign team in the 2002 presidential election.Prof. Chae Su-chan of Rice University in the United States, has been serving as Chung`s aide since 2002, while former Hankook Ilbo editor-in-chief Choe Kyoo-sik went to high school with Chung. Both won in the elections in their respective constituencies of Jeolla Province and Gyeongsang Province.Former Environment Minister Han Myung-sook, former chairman of Hyundai Capital Co. Lee Kye-an and former Finance Minister Kim Jin-pyo are also part of the moderate group. All of them were lured enthusiastically into the party by Chung.The group, with such a varied background, shares a general consensus in policies in terms of taking a moderate approach to pending policy issues - contrast to the more radical positions taken by the reformist group.The most significant rift is over the government`s plan to send an additional 3,000 troops to Iraq.The recent parliament approved the troop deployment but controversy began brewing as the security condition worsened in the war-stricken country.While the moderate group places greater emphasis on keeping the Korea-U.S. military alliance, the reformist group is calling for the troop dispatch plan to be dropped on the grounds that sending the troops may hurt Korea`s national interest.Differences in the party among the factions took its toll during a seminar of elected members in Gangwon Province on Monday, with participants fiercely exchanging opposing voices regarding the party`s future policy lines and ideologies.Keeping the moderate position and highlighting their ""ruling"" party status, Chung and the leadership said, ""As the era in which ideological conflict has ended, we must position ourselves on grounds of realistic and reasonable democratic and reformative force."" But such members as Rhyu Shi-min strongly countered, saying the party must clearly define its ideology line.Rep. Jeong Jang-seon, who was elected in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, said, ""(The leadership) says we will encompass moderate reform and the lower and middle class of the society, but how is that different from the approach the Grand National Party is taking?"" Experts say the power structure among the factions in the Uri Party will begin to clarify if Roh recovers his presidency.""President Roh will begin to show his support towards one of the groups on the basis of which faction he wishes to prop up,"" said Prof. Kim Yong-ho.     Roh`s job would be to deftly persuade the other factions to follow suit, he said.According to Chung, Roh is to join the Uri Party once he is reinstated.(angiely@heraldm.com)   "
[번역][NEWS ANALYSIS]Generation divide seen defining voting patterns 선거...,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000043144?sid=101,"Fri, 09 Apr 2004 12:32:00 +0900","			 The 2002 presidential election was hijacked by young people in their 20s and 30s, with their unprecedented enthusiastic participation playing a major role in President Roh Moo-hyun`s victory.But it dismayed the older generation, as the customary voting patterns among the young, who tended to follow their parents` political positions, altered dramatically as they began to exercise their independence.To political analysts, it was a fascinating phenomenon, indicating a change in the previous wearisome voting pattern, from regional favoritism to a huge generational difference for the first time in more than 50 years of Korea`s party political history.This year, in the April 15 general elections, experts say the generational distinction will show up even more for various reasons, but chiefly because of Roh`s impeachment.A prominent share of the votes will also hinge on voters` social status, with the impressive rise of the non-parliamentary Democratic Labor Party that is devoted to equality and laborers` physical rights. The DLP showed support ratings of up to 8 percent in opinion polls taken before the official campaign started, above the former ruling Millennium Democratic Party`s 4 percent.The National Election Commission has banned any further releases of public opinion surveys during the election campaign.""The dissension among voters has changed to a structure cutting across different strata from the one dimensional split in the past,"" said political science Prof. Kim Yong-ho of Inha University. He added that, while regionalism was the sole voting pattern in the past, the patterns are now divided by generation and social status of voters as well.Since the establishment of the Constitution in 1948 and the introduction of party politics, the nation`s votes had been sharply divided between those who supported democracy and those who backed the military regimes.In 1987, when the last military regime ended with the election of President Roh Tae-woo, the votes largely hinged on which regions a party stemmed from. Past voting analyses show that 70 to 80 percent of the votes were determined by regions and the respective parties, according to Kim.""We political analysts were thus extremely excited in 2002, when progressive former human-rights lawyer Roh garnered extensive support from the young voters and was elected president,"" Kim said.Han Gwee-young, head researcher at the Korea Society Opinion Institute agreed and said, ""This year`s elections will be a transitional phase from a region-based voting pattern to a generation or policy-based prototype."" The support for a new and reform driven party has increased significantly  since the disclosure of a series of corruption and bribery cases involving incumbent lawmakers, Han said, adding that the final blow was the impeachment.Korea Research Center, a professional polling agency, had produced public surveys that put the Uri Party`s support ratings from voters in their 20s and 30s at between 70 and 80 percent.Of course, it would be jumping the gun to say the deep-rooted regionalism has faded completely, as social fissures and the political divide among the people do not die down easily, Prof. Kim added.""It also does not mean all 20 year-olds and 30 year-olds will vote for the pro-government Uri Party, and vice versa for the 50 year-olds and older,"" he said.But it is a common belief that the elections will be a ""battle ground"" of the generations.The generational tension has escalated further recently, due to Uri Party Chairman Chung Dong-young`s slip of the tongue during a recent campaign tour.Responding to a journalist`s request to urge younger voters to vote, Chung said the era of the 60 and 70-year-olds has ended and that they did not even need to vote. The remarks enraged the conservative community, particularly those in their 50s and above.""The elections will be a showdown between the 20s and 30s age group and those in their 50s and above,"" Han said.Voting styles among the two age groups also differ, as the younger group tends to be more easily influenced by immediate social issues, while the older people tend to lean toward stability, she explained.The casting vote therefore lies in the hands of the 40-year-olds, who have been raised in an era of rapid industrial growth, Han added.""People in their 40s tend to crave both reform and stability. They are stuck in the middle between the young and the older generation, meaning that they can either vote for the conservative parties, or the Uri Party, or the DLP."" Of about 35 million eligible voters nationwide, the 20s and 30s take up 47 percent, while the 40s come to 23 percent and the 50s and 60s represent 30 percent of voters.The results of the elections remain unforeseeable, as the outcome now depends on how many people in the new political force - the 20s and the 30s - will actually turn up at the voting booths, the experts said.In the 2002 presidential race, just over 56 percent of the 20s voted, while it was 67 percent among the 30s, 84 percent for the 50s and 79 percent of the 60-year-olds.Older people still tend to vote more enthusiastically, and with the impeachment crisis having subsided a little, it remains to be seen whether the young generation will stick to their resolution to vote in protest, the experts said.By Lee Joo-hee  (angiely@heraldm.com)   2002년 대통령 선거는 20-30대 젊은층의 사상 유례없이 높은 참가 열의로 노무현 대통령 당선에 결정적 역할을 하면서 이들에 의해 당락이 좌우되었다.그러나 젊은이들이 부모의 지지 정당이나 후보에 따르던 기존 관행을 뿌리치고 독립된 의사를 주장하면서 구세대들은 크게 실망하게 되었다.정치 분석가들은 50년이 넘는 한국 정치사에 있어 사상 처음으로 지역주의라는 과거 우려스런 투표 방식에서 벗어나 세대간 차이를 보이는 투표 방식으로 변화하고 있는 것을 멋진 현상으로 보고 있다.전문가들은 올 4월 총선에서 노 대통령 탄핵을 비롯한 여러 이유로 인해 세대간 차이가 더욱 두드러질 거라고 말한다.평등과 노동자의 권리를 옹호하고 있는 신생 민주노동당의 약진이 두드러지면서 상당한 비중의 표가 유권자의 사회적 신분에 따라 결정될 전망이다. 공식 선거전이 시작되기 전에 실시된 여론 조사에서 민노당의 지지율은 과거 여당이던 민주당의 지지율 4%를 넘어서는 8%인 것으로 나타났다.중앙선거위원회는 선거운동 기간 중 여론조사 결과 발표를 금지시켰다.김용호 인하대 정치학과 교수는 “유권자 사이의 분리가 과거 일차원적이었다면 이제는 다양한 사회 계층간 분리 구조로 변화되고 있습니다”라고 말했다. 그는 과거에는 지역주의가 유일한 투표 패턴이었지만 이제는 세대 및 사회적 신분에 따른 투표 패턴으로 변화하고 있다고 덧붙였다.1948년 헌법이 제정되고 정당제가 도입된 이래로 우리나라의 선거는 민주주의를 지지하는 세력과 군사정권을 옹호하는 세력간 첨예한 분열 양상을 보여왔다.1987년 노태우 후보가 대통령에 당선되면서 군사정권이 종식되었을 때 유권자들은 대개 정당이 속한 지역에 근거해서 투표를 했다. 김 교수에 따르면 과거 특표를 분석한 결과 70-80%의 표가 지역과 지역 정당에 의해 결정된 것으로 나타났다고 한다.“따라서 우리와 같은 정치학자들은 2002년 대선에서 진보 성향의 인권변호사 출신인 노 후보가 젊은 유권자의 열렬한 지지에 힘 입어 대통령에 당선되었을 때 열광한 것입니다”라고 김 교수는 말했다.한국사회여론연구소의 한기영 수석연구원은 “올해 총선은 지역주의 투표 관행에서 세대나 정책에 의거한 투표로 나아가기 위한 과도기적 단계가 될 겁니다”라고 동감의 뜻을 표명했다.한 연구원은 개혁성향 정당에 대한 지지도는 현직 국회의원들이 연루된 일련의 부패 비리 사건이 폭로된 이후 크게 높아지기 시작했는 데 대통령 탄핵이 결정타 역할을 했다고 덧붙였다.전문 여론조사 기관인 코리아리서치센터는 여론조사 결과 열린우리당에 대한 20-30대 유권자의 지지율이 70-80%인 것으로 나타났다고 발표했다.물론 사회적 분열과 국민 사이의 정치적 양분 현상이 쉽게 사라지지는 않기 때문에 뿌리 깊은 지역주의가 완전히 없어졌다고 말하는 건 성급한 일이라고 김 교수는 덧붙였다.“20-30대 젊은 층은 모두 열린우리당에 표를 던지고 50대 이상 노년층은 단 한표도 우리당을 찍지 않을 거라는 의미는 아닙니다”라고 그는 덧붙였다.그러나 이번 총선이 세대간 격전지가 될 거라는 인식이 널리 확산되어 있다.최근 유세전에서 발생한 정동영 우리당 의장의 실언으로 인해 세대간 긴장감은 더욱 고조되고 있다.청년층 유권자의 투표를 촉구한 한 기자의 말에 대한 답변으로 정 의장은 60대와 70대의 시대는 끝났으며 그들은 투표를 할 필요가 없다고 말했다. 이 발언은 보수진영 특히 50대 이상 연령층을 분노케 했다.“선거가 이삼십대와 오십대 이상의 대결양상이 될 것”이라고 한 연구원은 말했다.두 연령층의 투표방식 역시 서로 달라 청년층은 최근 일어나고 있는 사회적 문제에 쉽게 영향을 받는 경향이 있는 반면에 노년층은 안정을 지향한다고 그녀는 설명했다.그러므로 투표는 산업성장이 빠른 속도로 진행되던 시절에 성장한 40대의 손에 달려있다고 한 연구원은 덧붙였다.“40대 연령층은 성장과 안정 둘 다를 추구한다. 이들은 청년층과 노년층 중간에 봉착해 있는데 이는 보수정당에 투표하든지 아니면 우리당 또는 민노당에 투표할 수도 있다.”    약 3,500만 유권자 중에서 20대와 30대는 47퍼센트를 차지하며 40대는 23퍼센트 그리고 50대와 60대가 30퍼센트를 차지하고 있다.선거결과는 이제 새로운 정치세력으로 떠오른 이삼십대가 실제로 얼마만큼 투표장에 나타날 것인가에 달려있기 때문에 예측이 불가능한 상태라고 전문가들은 말했다.2002년 대선 당시에는 20대 중 투표한 사람은 56퍼센트에 불과했고 30대는 67퍼센트, 50대는 84퍼센트 그리고 60대 이상은 79퍼센트였다.노년층은 여전히 투표에 열의를 보이고 있고 탄핵 사태가 이제 누그러지고 있어 청년층이 과연 항의 시위로 투표에 참석하겠다는 결의를 지킬 지 여부는 두고 봐야 할 일이라고 전문가들은 말했다."
News Analysis: President Kim Dae-jung Declares Policy Shift from Reform ...,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000006152?sid=101,"Tue, 29 Sep 1998 00:00:00 +0900","			By Lee Kap-soo Staff reporter President Kim Dae-jung's remarks at his first ``economic press conference'' Monday indicates that the Seoul government will actively push ahead with a series of economic stimuli. ``The government's economic policy will be focused on boosting the economy by expanding money supply and increasing fiscal expenditures,'' he said at the press conference. Until recently, the government had pushed for corporate and financial restructuring programs to rectify careless and reckless management of enterprises and financial institutions, which resulted in Korea's acceptance of the $57 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). In the process of restructuring, however, the Korean economy is facing constant fears of collapse and the unemployment rate is soaring to record highs, threatening social stability. Alarmed by the unexpected side effects, President Kim appears to have decided to shift policy programs from initial restructuring to pump priming measures. While explaining the fruits of restructuring programs the government has implemented in the four sectors _ financing, corporate, labor, and public, President Kim said, ``The government will make a final touch on the restructuring and begin to seek strong economic boosting measures.'' As for the restructuring of large conglomerates, Kim said, ``I hope that tangible results of the ``big deals,'' a swap of business units among major conglomerates, will be revealed in the near future.'' Citing the recession and high unemployment rate as the most difficult problems now facing the country, he said that the government will try its hardest to solve these problems by employing powerful economic stimulus packages. The government is expected to lower market interest rates by expanding total money supply and to boost domestic consumption by pulling down related tax rates, analysts here said. In the financial sector, the government will spend a total of 50 trillion won ($37 billion) to purchase non-performing loans from financial institutions to increase their capital. Instead, the government will request financial institutions to expand their loans to domestic enterprises, especially technology-intensive small and medium-sized companies at lower lending rates, they said. In return for extending financial support to domestic financiers, the government will request they lower medium and long-term corporate bond yields and lending rates to below 10 percent, they said. At the same time, the implementation of the government's investment in infrastructure, including bridges and roads, is likely to be made in an attempt to increase employment and boost the sagging economy. President Kim has made it clear that high interest rates and severe retrenchment policy recommended by the IMF was not appropriate for the Korean economy. Accordingly, the Seoul government is expected to seek approval from the IMF at their quarterly consultation meeting next month for its change in policy from the past retrenchment-oriented one to a stimulus package, they said.

[New Neighbors] S. Korea needs anti-discrimination law to be an open com...,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000244397?sid=104,"Wed, 15 Mar 2023 14:45:00 +0900","Daegu mosque protest is reflection of Koreans' excessive fear about foreigners, says professorYoon In-jin, a sociology professor at Korea University and an immigration policy expert, speaks at an interview with The Korea Herald at Korea University in Seoul on Feb 14. (Lee Jaeeun/The Korea Herald)This is the second installment of a series of features, analysis and interviews exploring the challenges faced by Koreans and foreigners in creating a more diverse society in South Korea rapidly shifting away from its homogenous past. – Ed.Immigrants are the only solution for South Korea’s looming demographic cliff, as the country faces an ultra-low birth rate and a rapidly aging population. But to turn this homogeneous society into an open community for immigrants, there must first be a law that guarantees them protection from racial discrimination, a Seoul-based immigration policy expert said.There have been attempts to solve problems with (the falling) population, such as promoting policies to raise fertility rates, strengthening artificial intelligence or automation technologies, raising the retirement age, and getting the elderly back to work, according to Yoon In-jin, president of the Korean International Migration Studies Association, in an interview with The Korea Herald. But none of these methods have worked in other advanced countries, he said.“It is because when a country becomes developed, people tend not to work unless they are paid well enough. This is a global phenomenon,” he said. “This is why the demographic problem South Korea faces can only be solved through immigration.”As South Korea moves to open up more on immigration, the anti-discrimination law is a must, he said, citing local residents’ protest against a mosque construction plan in Daegu as a key reflection of how South Koreans have ""exaggerated fears"" about foreigners.Residents have been protesting the construction of a mosque in Daehyeon-dong, Daegu since 2021. The protests have involved pork feasts including the placement of a pig's head outside the mosque, along with various anti-Islamic signs against local Muslim residents.""In terms of ethnic population composition, Koreans still dominate, and no other minority has a large enough share to cause racial conflicts in South Korea,” he said. As Muslims account for only 0.4 percent of the total population and are geographically dispersed, the fears expressed by Korean residents in the Daegu mosque case are excessive, he added.South Korea and Japan are the only two countries that have no anti-discrimination law, unlike their peers at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. There has been a push to enact an anti-discrimination law since the early 2000s, with the first government-led bill proposed in 2007 under the Roh Moo-hyun administration. The latest attempt was made in June 2020, aiming to prevent discrimination based on nationality, race and religion -- in addition to other aspects such as gender, disability, age and sexual orientation. However, due to backlash from conservative religious groups who mainly took issue with protection for sexual minorities, the law has yet to be passed.If passed, those who feel discriminated against would have a process through which they can report their case to the National Human Rights Commission of Korea. Then the commission would listen to both sides and decide whether there was unreasonable discrimination. The law would give the commission the power to impose a fine of up to 30 million won ($23,000) on those who ignore corrective orders without a good reason after being found of engaging in discrimination.Prerequiste for a foreigner-friendly societyThe law is a prerequisite for a country that has set out to create a foreigner-friendly society through its policies.“This is for the future,” he said, referring to terrorist attacks by the second generation of immigrants in Madrid, London and Paris as lessons for Korea.Yoon referred to the phenomenon of ‘immigrant mentality,’ in which the first generation of immigrants take responsibility for whatever unfair treatment they encounter in their new home country, but the second generation does not and speaks out.Currently, there are a relatively small number of second-generation immigrants in South Korea, so discrimination has yet to become a major social problem. However, if unfair treatment continues as the number of second-generation immigrants increases, it can become a big social problem, he argued.“Change does not happen only through education. We need an anti-discrimination law to move toward a multiracial and multiethnic society.""Yoon is not only one calling for the enactment of the anti-discrimination act.The National Human Rights Commission of Korea has been also supportive of the equality law, saying it is a duty that South Korea, a member of the UN Human Rights Council, must fulfill.On the government’s plan to launch an agency in charge of immigration affairs sometime in the first half of this year, the professor said the plan comes relatively late, considering the number of immigrants and the level of the country’s economic development.""About four percent of the population is foreigners who reside in South Korea. Including naturalized citizens and permanent residents, the figure reaches five percent. Therefore, the Immigration Office must be established quickly so that unified immigration policies can be implemented,"" he said.The number of foreign nationals in South Korea exceeded 2 million for the first time in 2016 and is projected to surpass 3 million in 2030, according to Korea Immigration Service data. Of them, about 1.76 million were registered as long-term residents, meaning they had a visa that let them stay longer than 3 months.Yoon suggested that migrant workers should have the right to settle down and reunite with their families if they contribute to South Korea by working here for more than a decade. To prevent nonprofessional workers from settling down, the South Korean government strictly limits the length of stay for foreign workers who have entered through the ""employment permit system.""This system prohibits foreign workers from bringing their family members to South Korea to live together. Many human rights organizations have criticized the South Korean government’s treatment of migrant workers as machines without considering their human rights.""We need an advanced immigration policy that is not only efficient, but also respects human rights in line with national status,"" Yoon said.Yoon In-jin is also a sociology professor at Korea University. His research fields are international migration, multicultural society and overseas Koreans. He has served as a member of the Foreign Policy Committee under the Prime Minister, a policy advisor to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the president of the Association for the Studies of Koreans Abroad, the president of the Association of North Korean Defectors, and the president of the Korean International Migration Studies Association."

(Lee Jaeeun/ The Korea Herald)WANJU, North Jeolla Province -- Jossa Gomez Lobo, a 29-year-old from the Philippines came to Korea last month for a six-month seasonal working program at a strawberry farm in Wanju, North Jeolla Province.""I came here to earn money. I can only earn 450 Philippine pesos ($8.22) per day as a daily wage in the Philippines, but in Korea, I can earn the same amount of money in an hour. That's why I came to Korea,” she said while picking strawberries.Her wish to make money matched well with Wanju’s demand for workers, as the farming county has been struggling with a manpower shortage. Young Koreans left the town for cities, and the town has no future generation to carry on its farming business. According to the North Jeolla Office of Education, 23 elementary, middle and high schools in the province had zero first-year students this year. In addition, 27 schools also had fewer than 10 first-year students.Jossa is one of the 25 foreign seasonal workers who came to Wanju in February through agreements signed between the county and several Filipino cities.While in Wanju, she has agreed to live in the strawberry farm owner’s house by July with a monthly salary of 2 million won, in addition to accommodation and meals.The farm owner, Kwon Seung-hwan, said he is happy to get a foreign seasonal worker this time, because they are really difficult to hire -- at least through legitimate and state-backed channels.“Wanju has only old people now and young Koreans in the city do not want to work in rural areas. Without foreign seasonal workers, harvesting is almost impossible,” he said.According to the Justice Ministry, there were 3,612 foreign seasonal workers in 2019, but that skyrocketed to 19,718 in 2022. The Justice Ministry allocated 26,788 people in the first half of this year, which is 2.2 times more than last year's 12,330.Wanju plans to bring 131 additional seasonal workers in the first half of this year, including Jossa's group which had 25.Farmers in Wanju, want even more workers than that. But officials say it’s difficult to quickly increase the number of seasonal workers.The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the flow of workers to South Korea, and a lack of administrative capacity makes the job still harder. At municipalities in Korea, just one or two civil servants take responsibility for as many as hundreds of foreign seasonal workers.But the most serious problem is that even in the state-sponsored program, the involvement of brokers often results in the workers absconding, according to insiders.""Most of the municipalities have signed MOUs with local governments from sending countries overseas, but since they are developing countries, brokers are involved during the selection process due to corrupt civil servants (there),"" a municipality official said on condition of anonymity.He cited the example of a Filipino worker in his district who absconded last year. It turned out that he had to pay a broker about 10 million won as a down payment to come to Korea as a seasonal worker, he said.""Even if he worked as a seasonal worker for five months, he could barely make the down payment,"" he added, pointing out that by working illegally, he can stay longer and charge up to 4 million won per month -- double the wage farms have to pay in accordance with the local authority agreements.According to Rep. Cho Jung-hoon, 56.5 percent of foreign seasonal workers who entered South Korea last year absconded.A foreign resident in Seoul who has worked with migrants on immigration issues said he had seen firsthand brokers' involvement in seasonal workers. He said workers who abscond to pay brokers' down payment usually spend years in Korea.""They become illegal residents automatically, but can also seek refugee status, which also has brokers involved in the application process,"" he said.Therefore, experts point out that specialized centers dedicated to recruiting foreign seasonal workers is needed so that brokers cannot get involved.To tackle the rapid population decline in rural areas, the Justice Ministry launched another visa system to revitalize the countryside last year -- the Regional Specialized Visa. The new visa system supports foreigners' settlement in depopulated rural regions, but the visa holders can’t move around for the first five years.When they reside for more than five years, maintaining their jobs in the designated area, a resident visa can be issued. It allows them to continue living in South Korea. Currently, it is implemented in nine cities and provinces and 28 counties. North Jeolla is the most active province to issue.“It seems to be there is no alternative but to revitalize the rural regions with foreign immigrants in reality,"" an immigration officer spoke to the Korea Herald on condition of anonymity.The officer also added that those immigrants who entered South Korea with regional specialized visas are expected to eventually move to larger metropolitan cities after the mandatory residence period ends, to be replaced by other foreign workers.""Korea's agricultural, manufacturing, and service industries do not work well without immigrant workers. Korea is rapidly changing into an immigration state regardless Korean people want it or not.""This is the first installment of a series of features, analysis and interviews exploring the challenges faced by Koreans and foreigners in creating a more diverse society in South Korea rapidly shifting away from its homogenous past. The series will look into the experiences of growing immigrant communities, policy and private efforts being made to integrate them into Korean society. – Ed."

Korea's defense white paper(ATTN: UPDATES with more details in 8th para)By Song Sang-ho and Chae Yun-hwan   SEOUL, Feb. 16 (Yonhap) -- South Korea's defense ministry has referred to the North Korean regime and military as an ""enemy"" in its new white paper, for the first time in six years, according to officials Thursday, apparently in consideration of the North's evolving nuclear and missile threats.   In the 2022 Defense White Paper, the ministry also described Japan as a ""close neighbor"" in line with Seoul's move to improve bilateral security ties and offered a new assessment on Pyongyang's growing stockpile of plutonium, a fissile material used to build nuclear bombs.   It marks the first biennial defense policy document published under the conservative Yoon Suk Yeol administration launched in May last year. Yoon took office with a pledge to get tough on North Korean provocations and achieve ""peace through strength.""   ""As the North defined us as an 'undoubted enemy' at the plenary meeting of the ruling party's Central Committee in December 2022, and continues to pose a military threat without renouncing its nuclear program, the North Korean regime and military -- the executor of that (threat) -- are our enemy,"" it reads.This photo, released Feb. 9, 2023, by North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency, shows weapons being showcased at a major military parade in Pyongyang. (For Use Only in the Republic of Korea. No Redistribution) (Yonhap)The South called the North's military an ""enemy"" in the white paper in 1995 after a Pyongyang official threatened to turn Seoul into a ""sea of flames."" In the 2004 version, the expression was replaced by a ""direct military threat"" amid a conciliatory mood.   The labeling was reinstated in 2010 as the North torpedoed a South Korean corvette in March of that year, killing 46 sailors, and launched an artillery attack on a border island in November, killing two soldiers and two civilians. The expression stayed until the 2016 edition.   But the description disappeared in the 2018 and 2020 editions issued under the then liberal Moon Jae-in administration that tried notably to promote inter-Korean reconciliation.   In an apparent reflection of the strained cross-border ties, the latest document called the North Korean leader just by his name, Kim Jong-un. The previous edition referred to him as the State Affairs Commission chairman.   In its reference to Japan, the 2022 document used the expression ""close neighbor"" for the first time since the 2018 edition.   ""ROK and Japan share values, and Japan is a close neighboring country that (ROK should cooperate with to) build future cooperative relations that serve common interests,"" it reads. ROK stands for South Korea's official name, the Republic of Korea.This photo, taken on Nov. 13, 2022, shows President Yoon Suk Yeol (R) shaking hands with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida prior to their talks on the margins of regional gatherings in Cambodia. (Yonhap)In the previous version, Japan was described as a ""neighboring country that the ROK should cooperate not only for bilateral relations but also for peace and prosperity in Northeast Asia and the world.""   The 2018 edition referred to the two countries as ""geographically and culturally close neighbors as well as partners cooperating for global peace and prosperity.""   Touching on the North's nuclear activities, the 2022 document assessed the North possesses some 70 kilograms of plutonium, up from 50 kg estimated in the previous document. Around 6 kg of plutonium is required to build a single nuclear bomb.   The increase appears to be attributable to the operation of a key plutonium-producing nuclear reactor and other activities at the North's mainstay nuclear complex in Yongbyon, north of Pyongyang, according to observers.   A 2021 report from the International Atomic Energy Agency indicated the 5-megawatt reactor at the complex showed signs of being in operation since July 2021. It also said a steam plant, used to provide heat to a reprocessing facility, had been operated for around five months since February of the same year.   The white paper also described the amount of the North's highly enriched uranium (HEU) as ""considerable."" The production of one nuclear bomb requires 15 kg to 20 kg of HEU.   The white paper included a series of new North Korean missiles, including the Hwasong-17 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) and tactical short-range missiles, in an analysis of the country's growing arms list.   In particular, it highlighted the North's consistent push to develop solid-propellant ballistic missiles with greater accuracy and improved capabilities to avoid interception.   ""North Korea has continued the test-firing of solid-propellant ballistic missiles, which are more advantageous than liquid-fuel ballistic missiles in terms of their operational employment,"" the document said.   On the North's ICBM atmospheric reentry technology, the white paper stressed the need for further analysis, noting the country's past ICBM launches were conducted on a lofted trajectory rather than on a standard one.   Highlighting the South's deterrence efforts in multiple pages, the white paper detailed its push to secure capabilities for the ""three-axis"" military system.   The three-pronged system consists of the Korea Massive Punishment and Retaliation (KMPR), an operational plan to incapacitate the North Korean leadership in a major conflict; the Kill Chain preemptive strike platform; and the Korea Air and Missile Defense system.   The new document also compared the troop strengths of the two Koreas.    It put the number of South Korean active-duty personnel at around 500,000, down from 555,000 tallied two years ago. The figure for the North stood at 1.28 million, the same figure recorded in the 2018 and 2020 white papers.  The South has been pushing for a nimbler and smarter military based on cutting-edge technologies amid prospects of personnel shortages caused by the country's falling birthrate.    The document also said the South has about 2,200 tanks, 90 surface combatant ships and 10 submarines, while the corresponding figures for the North were around 4,300, 420 and 70, respectively.    The document stressed the numerical data was based only on ""quantitative"" comparisons, and that a more detailed analysis of assets' capabilities, their deterioration, the level of training and operational concepts would make a ""difference"" in the military strength assessment.   In an appendix, the ministry spelled out key North Korean violations of a 2018 inter-Korean military agreement aimed at reducing border tensions and preventing accidental clashes, while it stated in the 2020 edition that Pyongyang was ""generally"" complying with the agreement.    The ministry plans to publish the white paper in English, Japanese, Chinese and Russian in the first half of this year.

In the 2022 Defense White Paper, the ministry also described Japan as a ""close neighbor"" in line with Seoul's move to improve bilateral security ties and offered a new assessment on Pyongyang's growing stockpile of plutonium, a fissile material used to build nuclear bombs.

The labeling was reinstated in 2010 as the North torpedoed a South Korean corvette in March of that year, killing 46 sailors, and launched an artillery attack on a border island in November, killing two soldiers and two civilians. The expression stayed until the 2016 edition.   But the description disappeared in the 2018 and 2020 editions issued under the then liberal Moon Jae-in administration that tried notably to promote inter-Korean reconciliation.   In its reference to Japan, the latest document used the expression ""close neighbor"" for the first time since the 2018 edition.   ""ROK and Japan share values, and Japan is a close neighboring country that (ROK should cooperate with to) build future cooperative relations that serve common interests,"" it reads. ROK stands for South Korea's official name, the Republic of Korea.This photo, taken on Nov. 13, 2022, shows President Yoon Suk Yeol (R) shaking hands with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida prior to their talks on the margins of regional gatherings in Cambodia. (Yonhap)In the previous version, Japan was described as a ""neighboring country that the ROK should cooperate not only for bilateral relations but also for peace and prosperity in Northeast Asia and the world.""   The 2018 edition referred to the two countries as ""geographically and culturally close neighbors as well as partners cooperating for global peace and prosperity.""   Touching on the North's nuclear activities, the 2022 document assessed the North possesses some 70 kilograms of plutonium, up from 50 kg estimated in the previous document. Around 6 kg of plutonium is required to build a single nuclear bomb.   The increase appears to be attributable to the operation of a key plutonium-producing nuclear reactor and other activities at the North's mainstay nuclear complex in Yongbyon, north of Pyongyang, according to observers.   A 2021 report from the International Atomic Energy Agency indicated the 5-megawatt reactor at the complex showed signs of being in operation since July 2021. It also said a steam plant, used to provide heat to a reprocessing facility, had been operated for around five months since February of the same year.   The white paper also described the amount of the North's highly enriched uranium (HEU) as ""considerable."" The production of one nuclear bomb requires 15 kg to 20 kg of HEU.   The white paper included a series of new North Korean missiles, including the Hwasong-17 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) and tactical short-range missiles, in an analysis of the country's growing arms list.   In particular, it highlighted the North's consistent push to develop solid-propellant ballistic missiles with greater accuracy and improved capabilities to avoid interception.   ""North Korea has continued the test-firing of solid-propellant ballistic missiles, which are more advantageous than liquid-fuel ballistic missiles in terms of their operational employment,"" the document said.   On the North's ICBM atmospheric reentry technology, the white paper stressed the need for further analysis, noting the country's past ICBM launches were conducted on a lofted trajectory rather than on a standard one.   Highlighting the South's deterrence efforts in multiple pages, the white paper detailed its push to secure capabilities for the ""three-axis"" military system.   The three-pronged system consists of the Korea Massive Punishment and Retaliation (KMPR), an operational plan to incapacitate the North Korean leadership in a major conflict; the Kill Chain preemptive strike platform; and the Korea Air and Missile Defense system.   The new document also compared the troop strengths of the two Koreas.    It put the number of South Korean active-duty personnel at around 500,000, down from 555,000 tallied two years ago. The figure for the North stood at 1.28 million, the same figure recorded in the 2018 and 2020 white papers.  The South has been pushing for a nimbler and smarter military based on cutting-edge technologies amid prospects of personnel shortages caused by the country's falling birthrate.    The document also said the South has about 2,200 tanks, 90 surface combatant ships and 10 submarines, while the corresponding figures for the North were around 4,300, 420 and 70, respectively.    The document stressed the numerical data was based only on ""quantitative"" comparisons, and that a more detailed analysis of assets' capabilities, their deterioration, the level of training and operational concepts would make a ""difference"" in the military strength assessment.   In an appendix, the ministry spelled out key North Korean violations of a 2018 inter-Korean military agreement aimed at reducing border tensions and preventing accidental clashes, while it stated in the 2020 edition that Pyongyang was ""generally"" complying with the agreement.

Used car prices in Korea show signs of recovery this month,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/009/0005088142?sid=104,"Tue, 14 Feb 2023 14:10:00 +0900"," [Photo provided by HeyDealer]Second-hand car prices in South Korea is showing signs of recovery as pace of decline has slowed after falling sharply at the end of last year.According to HeyDealer, a price comparison platform for used cars, on Monday, the wholesale price of the Hyundai Motor Co.’s Grandeur IG fell 5.2 percent in January from the previous month and dropped 0.2 percent this month. During the same period, the price of Kia Corp.’s All-New K7 turned from a 2.4 percent drop to a 0.2 percent increase and BMW 5 Series (G30) rebounded from a 9.7 percent drop to a 1.6 percent increase.The analysis is based on vehicles with a cumulative mileage of less than 100,000 kilometers among 2018 used cars traded at HeyDealer, which is slightly different from the retail price for end consumers.In the used car market, wholesale prices usually act as a leading indicator of retail prices. This analysis suggests that used car prices may rise again by the time consumers actually buy them.In the retail market, used car prices are still on a downward trend. According to Enka.com, the average market price of major models of domestic and imported brands this month fell by an average 6.7 percent versus the previous month. The decrease is attributed to automakers and dealers lowering the price of new cars since the beginning of this year due to weak demand triggered by high interest rates.By vehicle type, the average price of the Hyundai Palisade 2.2 2WD Prestige fell 6.3 percent last month versus the previous month and the New Santa Fe 2.2 2WD Prestige fell 4.9 percent. The Kia K7 Premier 2.5 GDI Noblesse dropped 8.6 percent."
North Korea may have tested a solid-fuel rocket engine,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/640/0000034480?sid=100,"Tue, 31 Jan 2023 18:55:00 +0900","  A solid-fuel engine for a ""new-type strategic weapons system"" is tested on Dec. 15 in this footage broadcast by Pyongyang's state-controlled Korean Central News Television (KCTV). [YONHAP]     Pyongyang may have tested a solid-fuel missile engine earlier this week, according to an analysis of recent satellite images of a testing site in the North.      While the test was not reported by North Korea’s state-controlled media, it would mark the first weapons test by the regime since its short-range ballistic missile launch on Jan. 1.    Satellite images taken by Planet Labs that was released on Monday by the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the California-based Middlebury Institute of International Studies show a blackened field at the Magun-po missile engine testing site in Hamju County, South Hamgyong Province.    The center’s report concluded the test, likely to be that of a solid-fuel engine, took place between 10:53 a.m. on Sunday and 9:03 a.m. on Monday, based on the difference between photos taken at those times.    The photo taken on Monday shows a trail of charred earth that starts at the end of the engine test stand and extends in the shape of a long trumpet that reaches 120 meters (393 feet) in length.    The engine test stand at Magun-po is positioned horizontally, and not straight down into the ground.    The center’s report noted that the scorched, exposed ground stood in sharp contrast to its surrounding area, which remained covered in snow.    Pyongyang’s state-controlled Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) previously reported that “an important institute under the Academy of Defense Science succeeded in the static firing test of high-thrust solid-fuel motor” for a “new-type strategic weapons system” at the Sohae Satellite Launching Ground in North Pyongan Province on Dec. 15.    North Korea’s Hwasong-17 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), which has the longest range of all the known missiles in the regime’s arsenal, uses liquid fuel, which typically needs to be loaded into the missile at the launch site before it can be fired — a time-consuming process that makes the weapon easier to find and destroy.    Solid-fuel missiles can remain in storage for an extended period, allowing them to be deployed and launched in a shorter time frame.    Although the North has previously tested numerous solid-fuel missiles, including the short-range KN-23, KN-24 and Pukguksong series, it has yet to launch a solid-fuel ICBM.    At a Pyongyang military parade in April 2022, the North rolled out a new solid-fuel missile alongside the Hwasong-17.    The missile resembled the Pukguksong-5 and Pukguksong-4, two types within the Pukguksong series that have not yet been test-fired by North Korea.     "
[Newsmaker] Why are helicopter parents tailing school trips?,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000243300?sid=004,"Thu, 02 Feb 2023 14:40:00 +0900","Tragedies like Sewol, Itaewon play a part in breakdown of public trust, some sayStudents wearing face masks get off a school bus in Seoul on Jan. 30, 2023. (Yonhap)For many Koreans, their most treasured memories from their student days are often of multiday trips to renowned historic or natural sites around the country.These include the UNESCO-recognized historic city of Gyeongju; the country’s wartime capital and now second-biggest city Busan; and Jeju Island, the one and only Korean entry to the World’s Seven Wonders of Nature.However, an online post purportedly written by a teacher about a field trip to Jeju has gone viral, sparking some heated debate about the necessity of such trips.The anonymous post shared the writer’s firsthand experience as a teacher for a class of students whose “overprotective parents” made excessive demands for the comfort and safety of their children.According to the post, six parents – mostly moms -- followed their child to every stop in the two-night, three-day itinerary. Some stayed at the same hotel as the students did, while others who couldn’t almost “spent the night at the parking lot.”The writer said one of the parents demanded that his or her child be sent to the parent’s hotel room because the child doesn’t like getting changed with other students in the room. Another request was about the lunch menu. After learning that the class would be going to a black pork barbeque restaurant, a Jeju delicacy, the parent asked for beef as his or her child does not eat pork.“They’re driving me crazy,"" the purported teacher wrote. The writer did not disclose the students’ grade. A multiday school trip to Jeju is far more common for middle or high school students that it is for those in elementary school.“If they are so worried about their children, why don’t they just home-school them?” one Twitter user responded. “They are ruining their children’s chance to develop a sense of independence,” another tweet reads.While it is difficult to validate the anonymous online post, there are many teachers who can testify to the phenomenon of overly protective parents tagging along field trips – short or long.Elementary teacher Park Hye-soo had arranged a one-day field trip to an amusement park in October last year and felt she was “under surveillance” of parents who followed the class through the entire trip.“Five to six mothers came along. Some called or texted me, asking me not to let their kids into certain crowded spots,” said the 31-year-old teacher in Gangdong-gu, eastern Seoul.Some teachers said they are times when overly protective parents flout the educational authority of teachers.When Yang Soo-ji, a kindergarten teacher in Dongtan, Gyeonggi Province, held a baking class last month, one mother showed up in the middle of the event and insisted on taking her son to her car, as if she wanted to stop her kid from eating the cookies from the class.“I had planned a session where children show the cookies they made and share them with others. I felt like she didn’t respect me as a teacher,” Yang said.Breakdown in public trust of authoritiesExtreme cases aside, some parents said they understand where the overprotection is coming from.A series of recent public safety disasters -- from the 2014 Sewol ferry sinking to the 2022 Itaewon crowd crush -- have given parents the sense that the safety of their children should never be left solely to teachers, event organizers, police or whoever has authority and responsibility.“Most of the victims of the 2014 Sewol ferry disaster were high school students on a field trip,” pointed out Yang Ji-won, a mother of two sons living in Incheon. “Parents have lost trust that our system will keep their children safe. They are doing the best they can to protect their precious ones,” she said.The Sewol sinking killed over 300 people, mostly high school students on a field trip to Jeju. The tragedy left lasting scars on Korean society, one of them being risk-benefit analysis of school trips shared among parents.All multiday trips at Korean schools must be approved by more than 70 percent of parents in order to proceed under the Ministry of Education’s guidelines adopted shortly after the Since the 2014 disaster.The outbreak of COVID-19 has put a further brake on schools’ outdoor activities. It was only in the second half of last year that class outings resumed in earnest.Some teachers said public safety issues outweighed the educational benefits of school field trips in the past few years.“School-related accidents have been on the rise, and problems like COVID-19 cluster infections, which are sometimes inevitable despite teachers’ quarantine efforts, pose threats not only to the health and safety of young students but also to society as a whole,” said Kim Dan-bi, a 33-year-old school nurse in Yongin, Gyeonggi Province.The number of school-related accidents in the first half of 2022 came to 64,000, up 20,000 from a year earlier. The figure marked the highest since 2018 when it posted 57,000 accidents., according to the Education Ministry.Kim’s school had canceled its plan for a two-day trip to Gyeongju in October last year, as only 30 percent of parents agreed with it. The field trip was replaced with a one-day excursion to Everland, the nation’s largest outdoor amusement park.Are school trips educational?Some youth culture experts are skeptical about the “educational benefits” of field trips in the first place.“School trips offered an opportunity to experience new cultures and enjoy leisure activities for the older generation, who spent their school days at a time when leisure culture was not common in the country. But things are different now. Travel is part of everyday life,” said Lee Gwang-ho, a professor at Kyonggi University who specializes in youth psychology and culture.“In most school trips, a group of students visit historical sites or museums under the guidance of teachers. In the evening, they usually have talent shows or exercise at youth facilities or other accommodations. Students do the same things together during the whole trip,"" Lee said, questioning the educational component of such trips.However, there still appears to be a large number of students, former students and parents who see meaning in class trips and outdoor extracurricular activities. This is particularly the case after enduring years of online classes and indoor-only schooling under the pandemic.“Students can have unique experiences that they cannot have in the classroom. For example, my 16-year-old daughter recently went on a school trip to Gangneung, Gangwon Province, where she visited a famous media art exhibition and a coffee processing factory. I think being exposed to new environments and people could be an essential part of students' growth,” said Woo, an office worker in her 40s.“School field trips are not the main culprit of safety accidents. Some accidents are inevitable, while others are caused by a lack of public safety or people’s insensitivity toward safety,” she added."
A look back on three years of COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000242988?sid=104,"Thu, 19 Jan 2023 18:29:00 +0900","A temporary testing clinic is set up outside an expressway stop in Icheon, Gyeonggi Province, ahead of Seollal holiday falling Jan. 21-24. (Yonhap)Three years ago on Friday, South Korea detected its first case of COVID-19 or novel coronavirus disease as it was known then.Since then, the total count of cumulative cases here reached 29,927,958, as of midnight Wednesday. This means that about 58 percent of the population in South Korea have tested positive for the virus, public health authorities say.The country is now readying to move on from the pandemic. As the threat of a winter surge abates, public health authorities are now debating whether to lift the last of the COVID-19 measures -- the indoor mask mandate and the seven-day mandatory isolation period for confirmed patients.COVID-19 in South Korea (Graphic by The Korea Herald)The South Korean government is confident that after the omicron BA.1 and BA.2 wave that hit around March 2022, the country can endure the rest of the pandemic without policy interventions.The Ministry of Health and Welfare says the BA.5 wave that hit in August was an example of how the country could handle a future wave without special policies to mitigate the spread.“Over the BA.5 wave the highest one-day death count was 122, recorded Sept. 1, which is less than a quarter of the highest one-day death count of 469 recorded March 24 over the BA.1-BA.2 wave,” the ministry said in its September report assessing the two successive omicron waves.The caseloads did not lead to a hospital bed shortage either, the ministry said.“After the initial omicron wave, the number of COVID-19 beds has been cut by 85 percent. Hospitals are running smoothly with the bed occupancy rate standing at around 40 percent.”Under the omicron response plan that kicked off in late January last year, Korea ended most protective policies, ranging from free universal testing and treatment to contact tracing over the course of four months.Those first few months were South Korea’s deadliest phase in the pandemic.More than half of the country’s total 33,104 deaths took place during the BA.1 and BA.2 wave that lasted for about two months from February to mid-April. Days of over 300 deaths continued for weeks. This excluded people who died after the end of their hospital stay or isolation.7-day rolling average of new confirmed cases per million people (Graphic by The Korea Herald)The explosive omicron surge by comparison dwarfed any waves that came before. South Korea took more than two years to reach 1 million cumulative cases on Feb. 6, 2022. It took less than two months for the country to reach 10 million cumulative cases on March 23, 2022.The process of undoing policies and practices protecting against COVID-19 began long before omicron came around. “Return to normal” was announced as a policy agenda at multiple points over the pandemic, but it was in summer after the vaccine campaign launched in February 2021 that policies started to be undone one by one.As the vaccines, which were rolling out in an age-descending order, were just getting to people in their 50s in June 2021, then-President Moon Jae-in teased a mask-free Chuseok holiday in fall. At the time it was believed that with a high enough vaccination rate, the country could reach herd immunity.Even after the promise of herd immunity began to fade, South Korea pushed ahead with its “living with COVID-19” plan after 70 percent of the population became fully vaccinated on Oct. 23, 2021.One significant change was that the default approach for patients was to let them recover at home. Until then, all patients were taken to hospitals or special isolation facilities.The change resulted in patients dying before they could be admitted to hospitals. More than 1,500 patients, most of them clinically vulnerable, were waiting for a bed to become available at one point in December 2021.While access to hospital care, free testing and treatment were scrapped relatively early, some of the more controversial and intrusive policies were kept until much later.South Koreans were required to scan smartphone QR codes that give away personal information including their vaccination status to enter everyday places like restaurants until March 2022, only after courts found the mandate unconstitutional.Nursing homes weren’t allowed face-to-face visits until October 2022. Nursing homes and elderly care institutions underwent brutal lockdowns in the first pandemic winter from December 2021 to January 2022, barring residents and workers from leaving as cases spread among them.After a year of omicron, the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency says as many as 7 in 10 people here may have had COVID-19. In the KDCA’s Dec. 7-22 survey of antibody prevalence in 7,528 people, some 70 percent were positive for natural antibodies.BA.5 and other omicron subvariant-led cases bounced back in November and December 2022 before slowing down at the turn of new year.“Our case rates and hospitalization rates have fallen by 27.5 percent 12.2 percent, respectively, compared to the week before,” senior KDCA official Lim Sook-young told a briefing Wednesday.But the slowdown in spread is accompanied by a dawdling uptake in new vaccines tweaked to protect against omicron subvariants and Seollal holiday long weekend falling Jan. 21-24.“The winter COVID-19 wave appears to be past peak and stabilizing, but the majority of vulnerable people in their 60s and older still remain unvaccinated with the bivalent vaccines,” Dr. Jung Ki-suck, who is advising the government pandemic response team, told Monday’s briefing.South Koreans’ enthusiasm for vaccines appears to be fading, after a successful initial vaccination campaign. While 88.7 percent of eligible people completed their primary vaccine series, only 33.9 percent of people in their 60s and above have received the bivalent vaccine, which started rolling out in October.Oral antivirals, a shortage of which had prevented their wide distribution throughout the year, are still primarily offered to older people. In the final week of December 2022, 36.4 percent of patients aged over-60 were prescribed oral antivirals, according to the KDCA.Another uncertainty that clouds South Korea’s road ahead is the rise of yet another variant.Last week’s analysis showed the proportion of BA.5 was down to 28.3 percent from 34.4 percent the week prior, while the BN.1 proportion increased to 39.2 percent from prior week’s 32.4 percent. Since the discovery of a first case last month, 31 cases of XBB.1.5, which is quickly gaining ground in the US, have been identified here.“When a new variant comes around, we are forced to be cautious until we understand it better,” said Jung. “That possibility still remains a threat, and we ought to keep it in mind.”According to KDCA calculations, 0.11 percent of people with the virus have died. But a more complete picture of the pandemic's impact can be found in statistics on excess deaths -- the number of additional deaths compared to other years.According to monthly updates by Statistics Korea, 304,931 people died in the country between Jan. 2-Oct. 29, 2022. That figure is about 47,000 higher than the highest number of deaths seen during the same period in the three preceding years."
Is Korea bending rules in vaccine sprint?,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000230790?sid=104,"Wed, 15 Sep 2021 18:01:00 +0900","This photo of a COVID-19 vaccination clinic in Dongjak, a southern Seoul district, was taken Tuesday. (Yonhap)South Korea is close to reaching the COVID-19 vaccination milestone of a 70 percent first-dose rate sometime this week, more than six months since the campaign began on Feb. 26. By Tuesday’s end, 67 percent of the 51 million people here had been vaccinated with at least a single dose of a vaccine. But in the race to clear the vaccine target, some key recommendations are being loosely observed, experts point out, raising safety and other concerns.Going against age adviceAstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccinations, both of which are recommended for people aged over 50 years here, are being offered to people as young as 30 for the time being until Saturday -- when the Chuseok holiday begins. This is also when Korea’s deadline for reaching the 70 percent first-dose rate falls.The age cutoff for both adenoviral vector vaccines was raised from 30 to 50 years old over the risk of a rare but serious blood clotting side effect called thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, or TTS. According to the national advisory committee on immunization practices’ advice, the benefits of the two vaccines only begin to “far outweigh” their potential risks from the age of 50. Starting Aug. 13, however, people in their 30s and 40s have been allowed to take “leftover” doses -- extra doses resulting from “no-shows” or canceled appointments -- of the AstraZeneca vaccine to minimize vaccines going unused. So far, out of 732,324 people in their 30s who received at least one dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine, two have been confirmed with the vaccine-induced blood clotting disorder. Both of them were men, one of whom fell critically ill and the other of whom died. In an Aug. 25 phone call, a director within the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency’s COVID-19 vaccination council admitted that no risk assessment was carried out before letting people under 50 get the AstraZeneca vaccine again against current advice. He reaffirmed the AstraZeneca age cutoff would stay fixed at 50, as potential harms of the shot are greater in those who are younger. Johnson & Johnson vaccines have recently become available to people in their 30s and older at municipal public health offices as well. Kim Ki-nam, a senior KDCA official, explained in last week’s news briefing that around 350,000 doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine were distributed across municipalities last month with a due date of Sept. 18 “to be put into arms as quickly as possible.”One senior official leading Seoul’s COVID-19 vaccination support team said as of Monday midnight, some 10,206 people in the city have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine via the temporary program that opened Aug. 24, per the KDCA announcement. “Anyone 30 and above who wishes to get the Johnson & Johnson can while the program lasts,” she said. Earlier this month, Gyeonggi Province also set up vaccination centers throughout the region dedicated to providing the one-dose vaccine to run only before this weekend, except in two districts of Ansan. Dr. Kim Woo-joo, an infectious disease professor at Korea University, said vaccine decisions “must be based on evidence-based analysis.” “The KDCA did not provide a cost-benefit analysis to support the move to open up AstraZeneca or Johnson & Johnson vaccinations in younger age groups once again,” he said.“Safety is the utmost priority, more so than speeding up vaccinations or preventing vaccine wastage.”Deviating from standard dosing scheduleDue to a series of delays in summer vaccine deliveries, the gap between the first and second doses of the two mRNA-type vaccines, from Pfizer and Moderna, was spaced out to six weeks from Aug. 16. By standard, the two-dose series of the Pfizer vaccine is separated by three weeks and Moderna’s by four weeks, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the product information from the pharmaceutical companies. Kim of the KDCA said returning to a shorter dosing schedule would depend on vaccine supplies. “The deliveries for the rest of September and October are still being negotiated with pharmaceutical companies,” he said, adding that the agency would review shortening the time until the second dose once the amount of vaccines arriving in the country in the next few weeks is decided.As of the latest count, a combined 16.6 million doses of AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines were left in Korea’s stockpile. Hong Jeong-ik, another senior KDCA official overseeing the COVID-19 vaccination campaign, told reporters during an Aug. 25 closed-door briefing that the vaccines in stock were primarily being used up as first doses, without leaving supplies for people who will be due their second doses later. Son Young-rae, spokesperson for the Ministry of Health and Welfare, said in Wednesday’s televised news briefing that “completing the vaccination series with a second dose has become highly significant after the delta variant emerged.” In Korea, just 40 percent have been fully vaccinated. “Before the delta variant spread, I’ve said the first dose is approximately 80 percent effective, but now that has changed. You are not well-protected after a first dose,” he said. As for plans for reducing the lengthened interval between vaccine doses, Son said that “efforts are underway.” “At this rate, 70 percent of the population is expected to be fully vaccinated soon, presumably before the end of October.” To defend against variants, receiving the second dose in time is critical, according to Dr. Paik Soon-young, an emeritus professor of virology at Catholic University of Korea. Data out of the UK showed one dose of Pfizer or AstraZeneca’s vaccine was about 33 percent effective at preventing infection with delta. “If Korea has enough vaccines secured to cover both first-time and second-time recipients, there is no reason to put off going back to the standard dosing schedule so that people can benefit from the maximum protection of two full doses faster,” Paik said. Asked to comment on possible safety issues of a delayed second dose, he said, “That in itself should not cause side effects. But then again, I don’t think there is data on how the six-week spacing may affect antibody response or adverse event reactions.”Dr. Chun Byung-chul, an infectious disease epidemiologist and the vice president of the Korean Vaccine Society, said that adhering to the three-week or four-week dosing interval as tested in clinical trials would be “the best approach.”“It would be the job of the public health authorities to monitor and compare antibody levels when the doses are given six weeks apart, as opposed to three weeks or four weeks,” he said.By Kim Arin (arin@heraldcorp.com)		"
Game of mouse and cat: why war on NK hacking is still losing battle,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000242197?sid=104,"Mon, 19 Dec 2022 15:13:00 +0900","Combating NK hackers on decentralized, deregulated cyber space is mission impossible, but a few things can be done as deterrence, experts sayThis is the final installment of a three-part series shedding light on North Korea’s cryptocurrency thefts and their links to the hermit regime’s nuclear ambitions. -- Ed.The financially-isolated North Korean regime is behind one of the biggest cryptocurrency heists of all time. The North Korean state-run Lazarus Group, for instance, stealthily raked in hundreds of millions of dollars with only one cryptocurrency theft this year which appears to be directly linked to their astronomical spending on nuclear missile development.But are there ways to stop North Korean hackers? Experts remain gloomy.“Stopping cyberattacks is impossible. Every cyber threat actor is strongly motivated. They fully understand what kind of benefits they can acquire through cyberattacks,” Park Seong-su, lead security researcher of Kaspersky’s Global Research and Analysis Team, told The Korea Herald. “Although we can’t stop cyberattacks, we should do our best to slow down and minimize the cyber threat.”North Korean hackers will be persistent because they have a strong, shared goal.“North Korea has a clear goal: to generate funds and foreign currencies for the regime and missile and nuclear programs. North Korea leaves no stone unturned to that end,” said Moon Jong-hyun, director at South Korean cybersecurity firm EST Security. “As long as Kim Jong-un is alive and North Korea needs funds for the regime’s ruling, the country will continue to hack and steal cryptocurrencies routinely.”There are countries that conduct state-sponsored, systemic cyberattacks such as China and Russia. North Korea is known to be the only country in the world that supports cyber hacking against financial institutions to earn foreign currencies, Moon explained.“As long as cryptocurrency remains opaque and the survival of the regime rests on asymmetric capabilities, North Korea is likely to continue exploiting the murky regulatory landscape to make gains,” said Millie Kim, a researcher with the North Korea Cyber Working Group, an initiative of the Korea Project at Harvard University’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs.“North Korea has little to lose and much to gain from a loosely regulated market, especially as cryptocurrency can purchase increasingly more goods and services.”But Moon said that it would be almost impossible to “thoroughly block North Korea from earning foreign currency” through cryptocurrency theft in light of the decentralized nature of blockchain which enables the existence of cryptocurrency.“Blockchain is not supposed to be under control. Putting blockchain in control is such an oxymoron,” Moon said. “If we understand the system and structure of blockchain infrastructure, we can easily come to realize why North Korea has conducted cyber-enabled crimes, especially on blockchain platforms.”In a nutshell, North Korean hackers have exploited the decentralized structure of blockchain that ensures that cryptocurrency exists outside of the control of central governments and financial authorities and no single individual or entity has control of cryptocurrency.“Right now what we’re seeing is a cat-and-mouse game between US investigators and the North Korean hackers,” said Jean Lee, a fellow at the Wilson Center in Washington and a co-host of the “Lazarus Heist” podcast from the BBC World Service.“US Treasury sanctions are designed to stop and disrupt the North Koreans from stealing cryptocurrency and converting it into hard currency but authorities have acknowledged that the Lazarus Group of North Korean hackers has already made off with hundreds of millions of US dollars in cryptocurrency this year alone,” Lee added.Preemptive deterranceTo deter hacking attacks, experts underscored that cryptocurrency markets should improve cybersecurity maturity and cyber defenses.Erin Plante, vice president of investigations at New York-headquartered Chainalysis, said that “hackers are always looking for the newest and most vulnerable services to attack,” citing increasing attacks on DeFi protocols including cross-chain bridges as an example.“Cryptocurrency services – including but not limited to bridges – should invest in security measures and training,” Plante said. “For example, with North Korean-linked hackers in particular, sophisticated social engineering tactics that take advantage of the trusting and carelessness of human nature to gain access to corporate networks has long been a favored attack vector. Teams should be trained on these risks and warning signs.”Echoing this view, Nick Carlsen, a blockchain analyst at TRM Labs and a former FBI analyst, underlined the importance of preemptively deterring North Korea’s cryptocurrency theft rather than responding to it.Carlsen assessed that the US Treasury Department’s sanctioning of two cryptocurrency mixers was a “preemptive step.” A cryptocurrency mixer is a software tool that pools and scrambles cryptocurrencies from thousands of addresses to obfuscate and conceal the flow of transactions.The US Treasury Department sanctioned two decentralized, non-custodial cryptocurrency mixers, Blender.io and Tornado Cash, for providing mixer services to the North Korean state-sponsored Lazarus Group respectively in May and August. The Lazarus Group was notably accused of using Tornado Cash and Blender.io to respectively process over $455 million and $20.5 million illicit proceeds from the Ronin Bridge heist netting $625 million in March.(123rf)Claw backAfter two designations, the US also seized over $30 million worth of cryptocurrency stolen by the Lazarus Group from the Ronin Bridge, Chainalysis said in September, adding it marks the first such case.Carlsen underscored that the US and international regulators should focus on clawing back stolen cryptocurrency.“The big technique is to limit the ability to launder and cash out stolen funds. Cryptocurrency thefts are inevitable due to their nature, but if North Korea can’t extract (the money), it doesn’t do them any good,” said Dr. Nicholas Weaver, a senior researcher at the nonprofit International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley, California.“That is why the OFAC sanctions on Tornado Cash and other such systems are important, they don’t stop the theft but if you stop the ability to profit then North Korea won’t bother with the thieving anymore,” he added, referring to the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the US Treasury Department, which administers and enforces US economic and trade sanctions.Moon from EST Security pointed out that regulators and blockchain companies should take it a step further from blockchain and cryptocurrency forensics in tracking down cryptocurrency transactions and cryptocurrency criminals.Moon suggested the idea of the public and private sectors working together to track down North Korean agents and their fake identities used for cryptocurrency heists and build databases. The repository of personal information will enable investigators to unearth and track cryptocurrency wallets which North Korean hackers possessed with fake identities.Punitive stepsBruce Klingner, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, pointed out that “there have been very few United Nations or US sanctions imposed or legal actions taken against North Korean cyber groups.”“The US should fully enforce existing laws and assess whether additional legislative and executive actions are needed, including enhanced regulations of cryptocurrency exchanges,” Klingner said. “Washington should determine a range of punitive steps, both cyber and kinetic, for responding to attacks deemed detrimental to national security.”Eric Penton-Voak, a coordinator at the UN Security Council’s Panel of Experts which monitors the enforcement of sanctions on North Korea, also elucidated in April that UNSC sanctions resolutions have not established any provisions that forbid cryptocurrency theft.Annie Fixler, deputy director of the Center on Cyber and Technology Innovation at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, underscored that “preventing North Korea’s malicious cyber activity also requires escalating economic penalties against the financial and digital networks that help North Korean hackers launder stolen cryptocurrencies and other funds.”“To prevent, mitigate, and thwart North Korean crypto heists requires a combination of better cyber defense from companies themselves as well as better collaboration between the cryptocurrency ecosystem and law enforcement and financial regulators. These two steps will help strengthen security and block that ability of hackers to launch these attacks,” Fixler said.International collaborationIntergovernmental and cross-sector coordination is essential to map out strategies for stopping North Korea’s cryptocurrency robberies, according to experts. Coordination is also needed to outstrip hackers who seek to develop their techniques and tactics to outpace regulations and security in cryptocurrency markets.Joe Dobson, senior principal analyst at Mandiant based in Virginia, underscored that “tackling North Korea’s cyber crime activities will require a multi-pronged effort.”“Communication and collaboration between governments, cyber threat intelligence teams, and cryptocurrency communities/companies will go a long way at the strategic level.”For instance, South Korea and the US have stepped up efforts to deter and stop North Korea from exploiting cryptocurrency.“It may be a long time before we see international regulation of cryptocurrency, but in the meantime, governments such as South Korea and the United States need to work together by sharing information and pursuing a joint strategy on how to disrupt, slow and stop the Lazarus Group,” Lee from the Wilson Center said.South Korea and the US had the first and second working group meetings on North Korean cyber threats in August and November. The two countries discussed policy coordination and strategies to address North Korea’s malicious cyber activities, including cryptocurrency heists and laundering. They also held a joint symposium on countering North Korean threats to cryptocurrency exchanges in Seoul in November, where government officials from 16 countries and around 200 personnel from cryptocurrency exchanges, blockchain companies and think tanks.“Hackers will always be one step ahead when it comes to exploiting emerging blockchain technology,” Allison Owen, a research analyst at the London-based Royal United Services Institute, said. “To slow this process, it is up to public and private sectors to work together to identify gaps and adapt risk mitigation strategies.”Experts underscored that governments and cybersecurity and cryptocurrency-related companies should carry out long-term, multi-pronged strategies to address hidden and systemic risks inherent in cryptocurrency markets and blockchain platforms.“In the long run, North Korea may seek to leverage emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence to augment cyber operations targeting cryptocurrency exchanges. While distant and uncertain, this would further complicate the detection and mitigation of state-sponsored crypto heists,” Kim from Harvard University’s Belfer Center said.“It is critical for key actors in both the public and private sectors, including banks, crypto exchanges and intergovernmental organizations, to discuss and develop a security framework for crypto that can parallel the rigor and posture taken by traditional financial institutions.”"

Korea military(ATTN: UPDATES with phone talks between top nuclear envoys of S. Korea, U.S., Japan)   SEOUL, Dec. 18 (Yonhap) -- North Korea fired two medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBM) into the East Sea on Sunday, the South Korean military said, the latest in a series of launches that raised tensions on the Korean Peninsula.   The Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said that it detected the launches from the Tongchang-ri area, North Pyongan Province, between 11:13 a.m. and 12:05 p.m. The missiles, fired at steep angles, flew some 500 kilometers, it added.   The intelligence authorities of the South and the United States are conducting an analysis for other details in a comprehensive consideration of the North's recent missile activities, the JCS said.    Tongchang-ri is home to a major rocket launch site. There, the North conducted an ""important"" test on a ""high-thrust solid-fuel"" motor on Thursday to develop ""another new-type strategic weapon system,"" according to its official Korean Central News Agency.   The latest saber-rattling came a month after the North fired an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) thought to be capable of reaching the whole of the continental U.S.   The JCS denounced the launches as an act of ""significant provocation"" that undermines peace and stability not only on the Korean Peninsula but also in the international community, and a ""clear"" breach of U.N. Security Council resolutions.   ""We strongly condemned them and urge the North to immediately stop them,"" it said in a text message sent to reporters.   It added the South Korean military will maintain a solid readiness posture based on its capabilities to respond ""overwhelmingly"" to any North Korean provocations.   National Security Adviser Kim Sung-han presided over a National Security Council (NSC) meeting at the presidential office in Seoul.   ""NSC officials took note of North Korea's test of solid fuel,"" deputy presidential spokesperson Lee Jae-myoung said. ""They denounced the continued provocations by the Kim Jong-un regime in complete disregard of their people's suffering.""   The officials also said North Korea will pay the price for its action and South Korea, based on its strong alliance with the United States, will protect its own people while also bolstering security cooperation with the U.S. and Japan.    Seoul's chief nuclear negotiator, Kim Gunn, held phone talks with his U.S. and Japanese counterparts, Sung Kim and Takehiro Funakoshi, respectively, to discuss the latest launches and response measures, according to the foreign ministry.   The top nuclear envoys condemned the North's provocations and stressed the importance of a stern international response, pledging to bolster bilateral and trilateral cooperation over the issue.   Seoul and Washington's top nuclear envoys also agreed to prepare against the possibility of additional provocations by North Korea while firmly maintaining their combined defense posture, the ministry said.   Park Won-gon, professor of North Korean studies at Ewha Womans University, raised the possibility that the weekend firings could be in line with Pyongyang's drive to develop a wide range of solid-fuel missiles, including MRBMs and ICBMs.   The North has been pushing to secure solid-fuel delivery vehicles that can carry heavier warheads and require less launch preparation time than liquid-fuel ones that need more time for fuel injection and other procedures.    ""The technical motive aside, the North might also have a political purpose to highlight its presence and capabilities in a way that makes denuclearization an unrealistic goal,"" he said.   Sunday's launch followed the North's commemoration on the previous day of the 11th anniversary of the death of Kim Jong-il, the former leader and father of current leader Kim Jong-un.   The latest launch could be Pyongyang's reaction to last week's passage of a U.N. resolution calling for global efforts to improve human rights conditions in the North, some observers said.

Tale of North Korea’s cyberterrorists: How they break into ‘unhackable...,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000242050?sid=104,"Mon, 12 Dec 2022 18:20:00 +0900","Experts say traditional tactics of manipulation still employed, but methods in cyberspace evolving(123rf)This is the second installment of a three-part series shedding light on North Korea’s cryptocurrency thefts and their links to the hermit regime’s nuclear ambitions. -- Ed.Early this year, a senior engineer at Axie Infinity, a Vietnamese company that runs a popular blockchain-based play-to-earn game, was encouraged to apply for a lucrative job through LinkedIn.But after the engineer opened a document file with a job offer letter, the network of the Ronin bridge, a platform created by Axie Infinity to transfer cryptocurrencies, was suddenly compromised. Spyware planted in the file enabled hackers to infiltrate the Ronin network and steal cryptocurrencies valued at $625 million in March.While it may sound like fiction, that is just how the Lazarus Group penetrated Ronin bridge’s IT infrastructure and hacked validator private keys to steal cryptocurrencies. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation in April confirmed that the Lazarus Group is responsible for one of the biggest cryptocurrency heists of all time.Lazarus Group is an army of North Korean state-sponsored hackers trained for life to pilfer illegal assets to fund the heavily sanctioned regime’s nuclear ambitions that keep leader Kim Jong-un in power. The $625 million the hackers stole from the Ronin bridge was equivalent to how much it cost Pyongyang to launch 31 ballistic missiles in the first half of this year, according to Seoul.The Axie Infinity case is only the tip of the iceberg in regard to North Korea’s decadeslong history of financial crime. They no longer steal from banks, but now break into cyberspace by manipulating people and stealing money from online financial systems with sophisticated technological know-how.Millie Kim, a researcher with the North Korea Cyber Working Group, an initiative of the Korea Project at Harvard University’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, said, “North Korean state-sponsored hackers are adept at tracking developments in the crypto space, especially when it comes to identifying vulnerabilities in the latest blockchain technologies.”“Part of this has to do with open access to online information, and another part is the strategic placement of overseas workers in IT and cryptocurrency firms to transfer specialized knowledge to hackers,” Kim said.“Talent cultivation and training of cyber agents at state institutions and other foreign countries provide another crucial means through which North Korea can experience and obtain information about rapidly evolving blockchain technology.”North Korean state-sponsored cryptocurrency theft is generally categorized into three phases: illegally accessing a network or obtaining prohibited information, laundering ill-gotten cryptocurrencies, and cashing out ill-gotten crypto assets. (The Korea Herald)For instance, the BlueNoroff hacking group -- a subgroup of Lazarus Group -- “have sophisticated methodologies to infiltrate the victim’s machine and steal the cryptocurrency,” Park Seong-su, lead security researcher of Kaspersky’s Global Research and Analysis Team said, adding that “their tactics keep evolving.”Park said the “BlueNoroff group contacted the victim through social media to get trust” and then “deliver sophisticated malware with multistage infection stages.” Next, North Korean hackers “collect the victim’s general information and monitor how the victim handles cryptocurrency for a sufficient period.”In general, North Korean cybercriminals “gather organizational information, identify vulnerable individuals and weakness in infrastructure and analyze the behavior of their targets” before deploying advanced social engineering tactics, according to a Chainalysis report carried in the midterm report of the Panel of Experts issued this September.In addition, the Lazarus Group-affiliated cyberthreat actors have mastered and refined techniques of creating fake personas, establishing fictitious businesses and carefully curating digital identities to “communicate with and gain the trust of their targets.”North Korean threat actors have created “fake-yet-legitimate-looking accounts” on social media platforms such as LinkedIn and Twitter, regularly uploaded content and engaged in personal and curated conversions with their targets. Then, North Korean hackers launch a spear-phishing attack through various channels, including sending emails with malware-ridden attachments or malicious links, an invitation to collaborate through SharePoint and sharing Google Docs links.North Korea’s fake persona Kim Hyon-woo was used to attack Sony Pictures Entertainment, conduct cyberheists against financial institutions including Bangladesh Bank and target US defense contractors, according to the US criminal complaint unveiled in 2018.Chart 1 contains connections between (1) the Chosun Expo Accounts used by PARK, (2) accounts used by the alias “Kim Hyon Woo,” and (3) some of the accounts that were used as part of the subjects’ attack infrastructure. Not all of the attack infrastructure accounts discovered throughout the investigation are included, rather only those with certain connections to Chosun Expo Accounts tied to PARK. (US Justice Department)But how do they operate?North Korean state-sponsored hackers have mainly used two off-chain tactics: social engineering and malware. Hacking groups have generally used traditional espionage tactics such as advanced social engineering attacks to break into cryptocurrency systems by deceiving and luring victims into inadvertently providing access to their network and classified information or downloading malware-ridden files.Social engineering is a psychological manipulation technique that exploits human nature and tricks people into giving up confidential information and bypassing security procedures.One example could be a spear-phishing campaign that scams a specific person or group by sharing information known to be of interest to the target through legitimate-looking emails or electronic communications.In addition, North Korean cyber actors attacked individuals and organizations including cryptocurrency exchanges and financial services for cryptocurrency theft by disseminating malware-ridden cryptocurrency trading applications, according to the US Joint Cyber Security Advisory issued in 2021.North Korean cybercriminals “use phishing, social networking, and social engineering techniques to lure users into downloading the malware” dubbed by the US government as “AppleJeus.”In general, legitimate-looking companies advertise and distribute a modified, trojanized version of a cryptocurrency trading application on their website.In 2020, North Korean cyber actors targeted institutions in the fields of energy, finance, government, industry, technology and telecommunications for cryptocurrency theft with the AppleJeus malware in over 30 countries.“Going for cryptocurrencies plays to the strengths of North Korea’s cyber operators, as it leverages skills from across ‘traditional’ intrusion sets as well as those individuals that are doing IT/freelancer work online,” said Joe Dobson, a senior principal analyst at Mandiant, based in Virginia.Countries targeted with AppleJeus by North Korean state-sponsored advanced persistent threat (APT) actors since 2020. (The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency)Money launderingBut running off with cryptocurrency is only the start. North Korea has engaged in multistage and sophisticated laundering processes to cash out the ill-gotten cryptocurrencies.“The Kim regime has become proficient at mixing and laundering funds to try to obfuscate the origin of its stolen funds,” said Annie Fixler, deputy director of the Center on Cyber and Technology Innovation at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington.North Korean state-sponsored cyberthreat actors have used various tactics to conceal or obfuscate the source of ill-gotten cryptocurrencies and illicit transactions without providing identification or ""Know Your Customer"" information.“To launder the funds, they use obfuscation techniques such as mixing, using services like Tornado Cash to create a disconnect between the cryptocurrency they deposit and withdraw, and chain hopping, which is the process of swapping between several different kinds of cryptocurrency in a single transaction,” said Erin Plante, vice president of investigations at New York-headquartered Chainalysis.In general, North Korea launders stolen cryptocurrencies largely by chain hopping tools, mixers and peel chain techniques.Chain hopping is a tactic of moving between different types of cryptocurrencies often in rapid succession. A peel chain is a technique of laundering a large amount of cryptocurrency through a long series of small transactions.A cryptocurrency mixer is a software tool that pools and scrambles cryptocurrencies from thousands of addresses to obscure and conceal the flow of transactions.“North Korea tends to rely on mixers and blockchain hoping. However, they will always use the path of least resistance,” said Allison Owen, a research analyst at the London-based Royal United Services Institute. “It is critical to continue to look at the horizon to restrict any emerging areas that they can exploit.”Two Chinese nationals were charged with laundering over $100 million in cryptocurrency — stolen by Lazarus Group from cryptocurrency exchanges — between 2017 and 2019. (The US Treasury Department)Foreign collaboratorsCybersecurity experts and blockchain analysts also underscored that more attention should be paid to North Korea’s collaboration with foreign countries and nationals in each stage of cryptocurrency robbery.North Korea also has a history of conspiring with foreign nationals, including Canadian American and Nigerian partners to launder funds from North Korean-perpetrated cyber-enabled heists.Nick Carlsen, a blockchain analyst at TRM Labs and a former FBI analyst, said such collaboration with foreign nationals is more important in the phases of laundering and cashing out stolen funds.For instance, over-the-counter brokers “play a major role in each stage” of laundering stolen funds through layering schemes to move and transfer ill-gotten cryptocurrency into different wallets and currencies, according to a report issued in May by the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs.The OTC system allows parties to buy and sell securities outside of formal exchanges and through decentralized dealer networks.Two Chinese nationals were charged with laundering over $100 million in cryptocurrency — stolen by Lazarus Group from cryptocurrency exchanges — between 2017 and 2019, the US Treasury Department and Justice Department said in 2020. One Chinese national moved more than $34 million of ill-gotten cryptocurrency through a Chinese bank account and transferred around $1.4 million of bitcoin into Apple iTunes gift cards.Robert Potter, co-founder and co-CEO of Australian-US cybersecurity company Internet 2.0, also pointed out that “Russia and China have been content to turn a blind eye” to North Korea’s cryptocurrency theft.“North Korean-linked hackers have used services located in countries all over the world, including China and Russia, to attempt to cash out their ill-gotten gains,” Plante from Chainalysis said."

Personal color tests, the latest...",https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000242007?sid=004,"Sat, 10 Dec 2022 16:02:00 +0900","(Cocory Color Research Institute)Are you warm-toned or cool-toned?The current craze for South Koreans is to take personal color tests -- or consultations that provide recommendations for people's personal color types.The tests, largely held offline for accuracy, have professional analysts evaluate whether people fall under the category of ""warm-tone"" or ""cool-tone,"" by scrutinizing their skin tone.According to the tests, warm-toned people generally have a yellow-base skin undertone, while cool-toned people harbor a blue-base skin undertone.The South Korean personal color system breaks it down further into four color types: spring warm, summer cool, autumn warm and winter cool.Spring warm-toned people are generally suited for yellow undertone colors that are light and pastel-toned, while autumn warm-toned people are best styled with deep and darker yellow undertone colors.Meanwhile, summer cool-toned people are to be styled with color palettes which include cooling, soft and bright colors -- whereas deeper, striking colors with blue undertones like forest green, wine red and black are recommended for winter cool-toned people.A person tries on different colored fabric swatches during a personal color test. (Colorazit)Personal color types are determined for an individual after they go through consultation sessions such as draping and pouch analysis.During the draping portion of the testing sessions, fabrics of multiple colors are draped across the shoulders of the customer to see the effect of each color on a person's general style.The drapings discern the colors best suited for each customer and work as the evaluation tool for analysts to determine each person's personal color type.Next, customers' makeup pouches are analyzed, and the analysts look through the makeup items most often used by the customer to advise them on the type of cosmetics they should or should not use.Diagnosis reports which elaborate in detail about the person's general style are finally given to each customer after the session is over.Then, where did these personal color tests come from?The basis theory for warm and cool-tone differentiation stems from American artist Robert Dorr's color key system theory, which underscored that colors were most harmoniously used when using the same undertone of either blue or yellow.Fashion designer Suzanne Caygill applied Dorr's system to people's physical traits, determining a person's personal color after examining individual's color of skin, hair and pupil.Expanding on Caygill's idea, color consultant Carole Jackson classified human images by the four seasons in her bestseller ""Color me beautiful"" -- which became the origin of inspiration for multinational beauty consulting companies in the United States and Europe, to commercialize the process of personal color diagnosis for international consumers.The tests entered the South Korean market for the first time in 1993 and gradually became a hit.Tonework (Amorepacific)Continuing on the momentum of its popularity, a slew of South Korean beauty companies have too released personal color system-related goods as a part of its marketing tactic.South Korea's first personal color-related goods started with Espoir, a cosmetic brand under the nation’s beauty and cosmetics conglomerate Amorepacific.Named Real Eye Handy Palette, the eyeshadow palettes composed of selections of color centered around each personal color season.Releases of series of goods and services followed, such as AI-based personal color analysis applications and personalized cosmetics that analyze a person's skin tone prior to developing the product.For one, Amorepacific's cosmetic manufacture technology ""Tonework"" customizes makeup products based on colors most suited for consumers. It measures the color of a person's face using AI algorithms and has robots manufacture customized liquid foundations, cushion compacts and lip products based on a person's personal color type.The most popular Snapchat-like camera app in South Korea, Snow, operated by Naver, also offer diverse personal color type filters for its consumers to use.Then why did these personal color tests become such a hit?Experts pinpointed an increased interest in self as one of the factors.""Before, people were eager to follow what the celebrities had on as part of their makeup,"" said Yoon Jung-ha, CEO of Zamface, an AI-based app that allows users to take the personal color tests on their own. The virtual personal color test-dedicated app recorded 1.7 million users as of December.""People used famous makeup products whether or not it suited themselves, but now more focus is being spent on whether the makeup products suit their own style,"" she added.The comfort of belonging to a certain group had also contributed to its popularity.""People tend to seek for a certain sense of belonging during uncertain times. Personal color system, in that aspect, could have provided people with a category in which to fit into,"" said Lee Young-ae, a professor of consumer science at Incheon University.She cited South Koreans' affinity for MBTI tests and the tests which categorized individuals based on blood type, noting that people like to be ""classified"" into certain groups.She further mentioned that with increased online shopping, people needed to be certain if the color of the makeup products would suit themselves without trying them out in person, saying that a personal color system provided consumers with a standard upon which to fall back on.However, the results of the personal color system should not be trusted blindly, experts also added.""The personal color system itself is based on a sound scientific theory,"" said Shin Hyang-seon, the president of Korea Color Industry Specialist Association.She said people's skin undertones, which are determined by three elements including hemoglobin, carotene and melanin, are defined by genetics and will never change, emphasizing that, in that matter, there will always be colors best suited for an individual from the moment they are born.""However, skin overtones can change based upon factors such as sun exposure, the type of food a person eats, and natural aging -- leading to a more difficult assessment of a personal color system as a person ages,"" she added.Moreover, she stressed that the current personal color system market is filled with analysts who are not qualified enough to be giving out recommendations.""The personal colors are best diagnosed by colorists (specialists in color). But people of different occupations such as makeup specialists and stylists are currently giving out personal color tests, which could lead to a potentially inaccurate diagnosis of personal color types,"" said Shin.Moreover, with the test initially designed for foreigners, for higher accuracy, a separate uniform system for personal color needs to be established specifically for Asians, Shin added.""South Koreans have taken the personal color type theory and tests possibly the furthest out of all the countries in the world. The tests could become a foundation stone for the growth of the nation's beauty market,"" Shin said."
Female fans become driving force of K-pop girl groups,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/640/0000032452?sid=106,"Mon, 12 Dec 2022 15:20:00 +0900","   The JoongAng Ilbo, an affiliate of the JoongAng Daily, conducted in-depth surveys and interviews on 100 domestic K-pop fans in October. [AHN DA-YOUNG]     Fans are the heartbeat of the K-pop ecosystem. They do much more than simply enjoy artists' music; from merchandise to reality shows, they consume all the content that artists put out and voluntarily promote it to others. The number of fans is equal to an artist's power in the K-pop scene, which is why artists and their agencies pull out all the stops to secure a large and loyal fandom, both domestically and globally.    But who are these fans?    Without a census, there has been no way to pinpoint the gender ratio or age range of these fans, but the industry has generally come to assume that 70 to 90 percent of K-pop fans are female. This means that a K-pop artist's success virtually depends on support from women.    In the entertainment industry in general, female consumers are the core consumers. According to an analysis by Samsung Securities, female consumers share the following tendencies: They put an emphasis on their personal values and satisfaction, prefer two-way interactions, produce secondary content based on their fanhood and are willing to splurge on what holds personal meaning to them.    For decades, these yeodeok, Korean slang for female fans, have been mostly attracted to male artists, which is why girl groups relatively lagged behind in their number of loyal fans or commercial performances. This is still true to an extent; however, recently, women have gotten behind K-pop girl groups and have helped them skyrocket.     The JoongAng Ilbo, an affiliate of the JoongAng Daily, conducted in-depth surveys and interviews on 100 domestic K-pop fans in October.       Fans, mostly female, visit a themed cafe in central Seoul's Yongsan District in October, celebrating the birthday of NewJeans member Hanni. [PARK KUN]       Who are the yeodeok?   The survey outlined the average K-pop fan: women in their 20s who are employed and spend about one to two hours a day and around 100,000 won ($75) a month on fan activities for girl groups, for which they feel ""admiration"" and ""maternal love.""            These fans in their 20s were born between the mid-1990s and mid-2000s, meaning they grew up after K-pop idol groups had already established themselves a crucial part of mainstream Korean pop culture. They are ""K-pop natives"" who grew up dancing to idol groups' choreography routines since kindergarten. Among the female respondents, 46.5 percent responded that they started some kind of fan activity between fourth and sixth grade.    A female interviewee in her 20s, an office worker who wished to remain anonymous, told the JoongAng Ilbo that she spends on average 11 to 15 hours a day on fan activities. She is a loyal fan of the 13-member girl group WJSN. When the group released an EP this July, she said she spent a total of 3.5 million won to show support throughout its period of promotional activities by purchasing CDs, merchandise and more.       WJSN debuted in 2016. It is currently active as a 10-member group as three more Chinese members are active in China. [STARSHIP ENTERTAINMENT]     ""Friendship and love,"" she said when asked what emotions she feels toward WJSN.    ""The boy band that I liked in my teens was always riled with messy scandals,"" she said. ""That's when I felt skeptical toward supporting artists and took a break from K-pop. But I came across WJSN later in my high school days, when it was gaining popularity in Korea and abroad through cool concepts and stage performances.""  Why girl groups?   ""I was looking for a photo to motivate me to lose weight, and then I was mesmerized by how they dominated the stage,"" said a college student who is a fan of Blackpink.    ""Irene of Red Velvet was a model for a fried chicken advertisement when I was in the fourth grade,"" said a 17-year-old fan of the girl group. ""My first fangirl moment was when I told my younger sister, 'This pretty eonni's [affectionate term for an older female] name is Irene.'""       Red Velvet has seen long-lasting popularity since debuting in 2014. [SM ENTERTAINMENT]     ""I fell in love with how they always give their everything,"" said a woman in her 30s, a worker who identified herself as a fan of Le Sserafim, Girls' Generation and WJSN.    All of them are yeodeok of girl groups. Fans often remember the very moment they became a fan and have since formed a personal narrative within them; like watching a stage performance on one fateful day and falling into the fanhood rabbit hole, a process informally called ipdeok (entering the fandom) in Korean. Many shared that they admire their favorite girl groups because they are ""pretty, talented and hardworking.""    ""Watching them perform on stage makes me happy,"" said a 30-something female fan of girl groups NewJeans, IVE, ITZY, Twice and (G)I-DLE. ""When they do well on stage, I feel a sense of pride, too. At the end of the day, I'm a fan because they give me happiness like that.""       NewJeans debuted in August 2022 and quickly became one of the most popular girl groups today. [NEWS1]     Many fans are willing to go so far as to break the bank to show their love. The highest amount spent among the survey respondents was from a man in his 30s who spent 10 million won in a single month when girl group Nmixx released its sophomore EP in September. A female college student in her 20s, a fan of Apink and WJSN, replied that she spends a monthly average of 5 million won on her fan activities. She said she spends the majority of her day doing fan activities, often staying up all night. The driving forces behind her all-nighters were ""admiration and maternal love,"" she said.    During a one-on-one interview, a 28-year-old female fan of (G)I-DLE said ""there's no specific reason for falling in love,"" while explaining how she discovered the girl group.    ""I happened to come across its reality show on YouTube,"" she said, ""and before I knew it, I had become immersed.""  Girl crush   The way female fans viewed their favorite girl groups was multifaceted. They respected and admired them, while also wanting to protect and support them.    A fan of fromis_9 said that, for her, the girl group's members feel like ""romantic partners in the monitor, sometimes like the children I've never had, and sometimes like comrades in arms taking on the same journey.""    ""[Fanhood] has that special something, different from what real-life social relationships can offer,"" she said, when asked why she became a fan. ""Some people don't look at me favorably because I'm a fan of a girl group at my age, when society expects me to get married. But those people aren't going to be responsible for my happiness, so I don't care. As of now, I like fromis_9 more than the idea of dating or getting married.""       fromis_9 was formed through Mnet's audition show ""Idol School"" in 2017. [NEWS1]     ""You can't help but get mesmerized by a member who is a great singer and also has good looks,"" said an 18-year-old fan of numerous girl groups currently active. She majors in music and dreams of working with her favorite artist in the future.    ""But even if I try to take a liking to boy bands, I don't like their music style, their atmosphere or the members. Most of all, I'm not able to relate to them, which is why I keep coming back to girl groups.""    Overall, women entered girl group fandoms after becoming captivated by their performance skills, mannerisms, personality or backstory portrayed by the media. They also tend to remain loyal fans for a long period of time. Many also emphasized that they feel relieved as girl groups are less likely to become embroiled in scandals regarding misdemeanors or legal troubles.       Le Sserafim debuted in May 2022 and is known for its athletic performances. [SOURCE MUSIC]     Whatever the reason is, these fans spend a significant amount of time and money to show their support. They enjoy the sense of connection and interaction, regardless of how tangible it is, and are willing to pour unconditional love into it. In a way, they enjoy the ""agreed inequality"" of the relationship.    There have been many theories as to why women are more prone to becoming loyal fans of an artist compared to men. Some experts assert that back when women faced many limits on their social activities, being a fan was one of the few areas in which they could actively enjoy themselves with autonomy. While such an interpretation still leaves many questions, in general, women clearly show a tendency to assign high value to intangible experiences in other cultural fields as well. The live performance, publication and cinema industries all have women as their core consumer base.  Para-romance to para-parenthood   One key change from K-pop culture in the '90s till now is that the dominant sentiment among fans is no longer para-romantic. K-pop has often faced criticism that it is fundamentally based on selling virtual romance, while fans view singers as subjects of romantic feelings. Such preromantic sentiment was largely normalized, as seen in television shows depicting the era like ""Reply 1997"" (2012).       Blackpink was one of the first K-pop girl groups to become known for having a high ratio of female fans, as it focuses on an image of feminine confidence. [YG ENTERTAINMENT]     Nowadays, at least in the open, that culture has largely declined as more women became fans of female artists. Their positive feedback toward boy bands and girl groups alike is centered around their talent, good looks and personality. Comments that sexually objectify the members are highly frowned upon.    ""Ever since the days of first-generation idols [in the '90s], the relationship set between singers and fans shows how the industry has progressed,"" said pop music critic Mimyo.    ""First-generation idols were oppa [affectionate term for an older male] who came out of nowhere, and they were subjects of worship,"" he said. ""Afterwards, we started seeing more idol groups get formed through reality audition shows, which completely changed the relationship between the groups and fans. [Even before their official debut,] fans already knew the entire narrative of those members: Who they are, where they're from and how they've worked toward stardom. Think Mnet's audition show 'Produce 101' series [2016-19], which really strengthened this kind of dynamic. Fans now get to choose their own idols with their own hands. Fans, who used to be followers, are now consumers and supporters.""       Nmixx debuted in February 2022. [JYP ENTERTAINMENT]       One fan of Nmixx expresses joy on Twitter after receiving gifts, called yeokjogong in Korean slang, from the girl group. K-pop idol acts often present fans who attend their gigs with such gifts. In the post, the fan praises Nmixx members as ""daughters with filial piety."" [SCREEN CAPTURE]     Para-romantic feelings have transformed into parental feelings of essentially raising a virtual child. Fans call their favorite stars, often younger than them, juvenile nicknames like ""my child,"" ""my baby"" or ""godgi,"" a portmanteau of god and agi (baby).    ""Korea's younger generation, in their 20s and 30s, tend to care less about gender roles,"" said psychology professor Lim Myung-ho of Dankook University. ""In the past, the aspects fans felt attracted to were mostly based on fantasy, like unrealistic beauty or romance. Now, they are more drawn when they find the stars relatable with their reality in some way.""  "

At that point, 403 national time series became available instantaneously to anyone who had a personal computer with a Web browser. An additional 70 series for the Eighth Federal District were also available. The data series were in text format and had to be copied and pasted into the user’s PC. In July 2002, FRED became a true database and the user was offered a wider range of options. Data can be downloaded in either text or Excel format. Shortly thereafter user accounts were introduced so that multiple data series can be downloaded into a single Excel workbook, and data lists can be stored for repeated downloads of updated information. In the first six months after this version of FRED was released, 3.8 million hits were recorded to the website. In a recent six-month period, FRED received 21 million hits from over 109 countries around the world. FRED currently contains 1175 national time series and 1881 regional series. FREDdata are updated on a real-time basis as information is released from various statistical agencies.After 45 years, Homer Jones’s modest initiative to distribute data on three variables has developed into a broad-based data resource on the U.S. economy that is available at the click of a mouse around the globe. Through this resource, researchers, students, market participants and the general public can reachinformed decisions based on information that is comparable to the information policymakers have.In the past year we have introduced a number of additional data services. One of these, ALFRED, adds a vintage (or real-time) dimension to FRED. The ALFRED database stores revision histories of the FRED data series. Since 1996, we have maintained monthly or weekly archives of the FRED database. All the information in these archives has been populated to the ALFRED database, and the user can access point-in-time revisions of these data.(4) We have also extended therevision histories of many series back in time using data that were recorded in U.S. Financial Data, Monetary Trends and National Economic Trends. For selected quarterly National Income and Product data we have complete revision histories back to 1959 for real data and 1947 for nominal data. Revision histories are available on household and payroll employment data back to 1960. A similarhistory for industrial production is available back to 1927.Preserving such information is crucial to understanding historical monetary policy. For example, Orphanides shows “that real-time policy recommendations differ considerably from those obtained with ex-post revised data. Further, estimated policy reaction functions based on ex-post revised data provide misleading descriptions of historical policy and obscure the behavior suggested by information available to the Federal Reserve in real time.”(5) Orphanides concludes that “reliance on the information actually available to policymakers in real time is essential for the analysis of monetary policy rules.”(6)Such vintage information also is essential for analysis of conditions at subnational levels. For example, in January 2005 the BLS estimated that nonfarm employment in the St. Louis MSA had increased by 38.8 thousand between December 2003 and December 2004. This increase was widely cited as evidence that the MSAhad returned to strong employment growth after four years of negative job growth. However, these data from the Current Employment Statistics (CES) were not benchmarked to more comprehensive labor market information that is available only with a lag.(7) The current estimate of nonfarm employment growth in the St.Louis MSA for this period, after several revisions, is only 11.6 thousand, less than 30 percent of the increase originally reported.Another data initiative that we launched several years ago is FRASER ? the Federal Reserve Archival System for Economic Research. The objective of this initiative is to digitize and distribute the monetary and economic record of the U.S. economy. FRASER is a repository of image files of important historical documents and serial publications. At present we have posted the entire history ofThe Economic Report of the President, Economic Indicators and Business Conditions Digest. We have also posted images of most issues of the Survey of CurrentBusiness from 1925 through 1990 and are working on filling in images of the remaining volumes. The collection also includes Banking and Monetary Statistics and the Annual Statistical Digests published by the Board of Governors, as well as the Business Statistics supplements to the Survey of Current Business published by the Department of Commerce. We are currently working, in a joint project with the Board of Governors, to image the entire history of the Federal Reserve Bulletin. Finally, we are posting images of historical statistical releases that we have collected in the process of extending the vintage histories in ALFRED back in time. These images should allow scholars, analysts and students of economic history to reconstruct vintage data on many series in additionto those we are maintaining on ALFRED.Transparency, Accountability and Information DistributionAs just indicated, the scope of the archival information in FRASER extends beyond numeric data. Ready access to a wide variety of information is essential for transparency and accountability of monetary authorities and a full understanding of policy actions by the public. Since 1994 the Federal Reserve System and the FOMC have improved the scope and timeliness of information releases. I have discussed this progress in previous speeches.(8) Currently the FOMC releases a press statement at the conclusion of each scheduled meeting and three weeks later follows up with the release of minutes of the meeting. The press release and the minutes of the meetings record the vote on the policy action. Thepolicy statement and minutes give the public a clear understanding of the action taken and insight into the rationale for the action.Contrast the current situation with the one in 1979. At that time, actions by the Board of Governors on discount rate changes were reported promptly, but there was no press release subsequent to an FOMC policy action and FOMC meeting minutes were released with a 90-day delay. On Sept. 19, 1979, the Board of Governors voted by the narrow margin of 4-3 to approve a ½ percentage-point increase in the discount rate, with all three dissents against the increase. This information generated the public perception that the Fed officials were sharply divided and, therefore, that the Fed was not prepared to act decisively against inflation. John Berry, a knowledgeable reporter at the Washington Post, observed that “the split vote, with its clear signal that from the Fed’s own point of view interest rates are at or close to their peak for this business cycle, might forestall any more increases in market interest rates.”(9) However,the interpretation of the “clear signal” was erroneous. On that same day, the FOMC had voted 8 to 4 to raise the range for the intended funds rate to 11-1/4 to 11-3/4 percent. More importantly, three of the four dissents were in favor of a more forceful action to restrain inflation.(10) Neither the FOMC’s action, the dissents nor the rationale for the dissents were revealed to the public under the disclosure policies then in effect. The result was to destabilize markets, with commodity markets, in particular, exhibiting extreme volatility.ConclusionThe tradition of data services was well established when I arrived in St. Louis in 1998, and I must say that I am proud that leadership in the Bank’s Research division has extended that tradition. Data are the lifeblood of empirical research in economics and of policy analysis. Our rational expectations conception of how the macroeconomy works requires that the markets and general public understand what the Fed is doing and why. Of all the things on which we spend money in the Federal Reserve, surely the return on our data services is among the highest.(서울=연합인포맥스)(끝)<저작권자(c)연합인포맥스. 무단 전재-재배포 금지.>"
Global AI Project exposes participants to latest tech,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/640/0000032427?sid=101,"Sun, 11 Dec 2022 19:12:00 +0900","  Participants in the 2022 Global AI Project and its organizers pose at the end of the event at the Stanford Hotel Seoul in western Seoul on Sunday. [PARK SANG-MOON]     Dozens of future data scientists from different parts of Korea gathered in Sangam-dong, western Seoul on Sunday to show an array of ideas using artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technologies.    The participants showed their work on projects ranging from a lung nodule detecting system to an analysis of the digital divide hurting North Korean defectors in South Korea at the Stanford Hotel Seoul on Saturday. After the presentations, one team won the grand prize Sunday, one won second prize and three won third prizes, wrapping up a seven-week program.    The Global AI Project is part of the ICT ministry’s regional ICT Innovation Square Expansion Project, which is supposed to give insights into global technology trends to people who hope to work at data science businesses. The program was hosted by the Gangneung Science and Industry Promotion Agency and co-organized by the Korea JoongAng Daily and its U.S.-based affiliate the Korea Daily.    The grand prize went to a team of three people — Moon Kyoung-min, Shin Seung-heon and Han Chun-hee — who presented an AI- and Virtual Reality (VR)-aided system for the detection of lung nodules.    “I’d like to contribute to bridging the gap between medicine and engineering, and hopefully realize the democratization of digital technology,” said Moon, 44, an associate professor of pulmonary, allergy and critical care medicine at Gangneung Asan Hospital.      Moon started to take courses from an online college in 2018 and has been working with various startups on research related to medical artificial intelligence.    “People in remote areas like Uljin in Gangwon need to wait for three months to book a medical appointment at my hospital,” Moon said. “By expanding the medical field to virtual reality and artificial intelligence such as in the metaverse, I hope for a world where medically underserved populations can freely use the medical system.”    Kim Gil-jae, a 26-year-old graduate student majoring in education, took home the second prize. Kim analyzed data on problems and solutions for the digital alienation of the elderly.    “While I found out as digital skills decrease along with age, and life satisfaction is higher with higher digital skills — a lifelong education program and teaching the use of digital devices are necessary to enhance the digital capabilities of people in their 60s and older,” Kim said.    Based on the government's announcement of a revised curriculum, Kim said it is likely that short-answer and essay questions will be introduced in future Korean College Scholastic Ability Test (CSAT), raising the importance of writing skills.      “Using big data and new technology, I’d like to start a startup developing an AI model that can give objective feedback such as on vocabulary by looking at sentence structure,” Kim said.    From university students, doctors, soldiers and a B&B owner, a total of 80 participants from their 20s to their 50s from Gangwon, North Gyeongsang and Daegu took part in the program this year.    The participants were divided into two groups — one group consisted of 55 university students looking for a job, and another 25 people hoping to start a business in the field of IT and artificial intelligence. They participated in the Global AI project after taking a 120 to 160-hour AI and blockchain education course by the ICT Innovation Square.    Han, one of the three grand prize winners, said he was particularly impressed to learn how new technology can help solve problems.    “Once people can easily handle AI like Microsoft Word, AI will be a lot of help in solving problems in each specialized field,” said Han, a 42-year-old graduate student studying oriental medicine at South Baylo University.      “AI is like analyzing patterns,” he continued. “I could utilize AI to feel a patient’s pulse or diagnose diseases in oriental medicine. My dream is to become an oriental doctor who develops programs or a developer who can give an acupuncture treatment.”      Winners of 2022 Global AI Project pose at the end of the event at Standford Hotel Seoul in western Seoul on Sunday.  [PARK SANG-MOON]    This year, the program was geared to lectures from employees in artificial intelligence and related fields in the United States, including from prestigious companies like Tesla and Amazon, so students could grasp the latest global IT and industry trends and figure out an employment strategy.    Kim Seon-ho, an associate director at the Integrated Media Systems Center at the University of Southern California, led a course on an introduction to computing technology every Friday night through Zoom classes.      “At first I wasn’t sure if the project would come out well due to the tight schedule, but everyone worked hard during the whole process and I think the overall project was satisfactory,” Kim said.    Kevin Kim, CEO at metaverse game startup Brave Turtles, gave tips on starting a business. Working as a visual effects artist for the movie ""Hugo"" and TV series ""Game of Thrones"", which won an Oscar and Emmy for special visual effects, Kim delivered a lecture explaining differences between movies, computer games and the metaverse.    “I didn't know that the Global AI Project would grow this big and go smoothly, but I was surprised that everyone participated with passion until the end of the course even though they all live far away,” Kim said.      “The ICT course program had only had courses from domestic experts in Korea, and this year was the first time we invited mentors from overseas so that students can learn global trends,” said Cho Eun-jeong, a senior official at the Gangneung Science and Industry Promotion Agency.     “This year we only had an offline course for only two days, but we’re planning to expand it next year.”  "

Korea to hold key party meeting to unveil next year's policy direction(ATTN: CHANGES headline; UPDATES throughout with details; ADDS photo, byline)By Yi Wonju   SEOUL, Dec. 1 (Yonhap) -- North Korea will hold a key party meeting later this month to review this year's achievements and discuss plans for the new year, Pyongyang's state media reported Thursday.   The decision was made at a politburo session of the ruling Workers' Party, which leader Kim Jong-un presided over the previous day. He noted the internal and external circumstances of this year were an ""unprecedented adversity"" that tested its ""will and fighting efficiency,"" according to the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).   ""The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) decided to convene the 6th Plenary Meeting of the 8th Central Committee of the WPK in late December to review the execution of the Party and state policies for 2022 and discuss and decide on work plans for 2023 and a series of important issues arising in the development of the Party and the revolution at present,"" the KCNA said in an English-language report.North Korean leader Kim Jong-un (C) presides over a meeting of the committee's political bureau at the headquarters of the Central Committee in Pyongyang on Nov. 30, 2022, in this photo released by the North's official Korean Central News Agency the following day.

""He said that it is very important for all sectors to find innovative ways for solving the problems by tapping our potentiality and to properly confirm the next year's plan on the basis of the correct analysis of the experience and lessons accumulated in the course of a year's struggle in order to expand the affirmative changes made in the Party building and the overall work of the state this year and vigorously push forward the huge tasks of the new year,"" according to the KNCA.   During the upcoming session, North Korea could unveil key policy directions toward the U.S. and South Korea for next year, as well as its missile development plan or a possible nuclear test.   Kim could also use the upcoming meeting as a venue to deliver a major speech this year to replace his annual New Year's Day address, usually presented on Jan. 1.   Kim has refrained from giving his New Year's Day speech since 2019, when he delivered a speech at a plenary session of the party and skipped his annual address for the first time since taking office.   The recalcitrant state has sharply escalated tensions on the Korean Peninsula in recent weeks amid growing concerns it could soon carry out its seventh nuclear test.   julesyi@yna.co.kr(END)"

North brags of cruise missile flights South says didn't happen,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/640/0000030961?sid=100,"Mon, 07 Nov 2022 18:18:00 +0900","  The North Korean military conducts missile launches in drills held from Wednesday to Saturday in photos released by its official Rodong Sinmun on Monday. State media claimed that the “military operations” were in response to Seoul and Washington’s Vigilant Storm aerial exercise last month. [RODONG SINMUN]      North Korea said Monday that it launched two ""strategic"" cruise missiles into waters off South Korea's southeastern coast near Ulsan last week, which apparently were not detected by Seoul's military.      The North's official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) revealed in unusual detail a series of military drills it held during a four-day period from last Wednesday to Saturday, which included testing a new long-range missile design and mobilizing 500 warplanes.      Pyongyang claimed that its ""corresponding military operations"" were in response to the U.S.-South Korea Vigilant Storm drill that ran from Oct. 31 to Saturday.      Details offered by the North, however, differed from information released by South Korea's military last week, and military officials in Seoul Monday were skeptical of some of Pyongyang's claims.      In an English-language report attributed to the General Staff of the Korean People's Army (KPA), the KCNA said that the North's military fired two strategic cruise missiles from North Hamgyong Province with a range of 590.5 kilometers (366.9 miles) at the open sea around 80 kilometers off the coast of Ulsan on Wednesday afternoon.    It claimed that this was in response to the ""enemy"" firing an ""air-to-surface guided missiles and gliding guided bomb at the open sea of the DPRK side"" earlier that day, referring to the acronym for the North's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.    Also on Wednesday, the North's army was said to have fired ""four tactical ballistic missiles loaded with dispersion warheads and underground infiltration warheads at a desert island off the West Sea Barrage"" and later in the afternoon ""fired 23 ground-to-air missiles while staging an exercise to annihilate air targets at different altitudes and distances.""    On Wednesday, Seoul confirmed that Pyongyang fired a short-range ballistic missile (SRBM) south of the Northern Limit Line (NLL), the de facto maritime border for the first time since the ceasefire ending the 1950-53 Korean War. However, the KCNA report didn't make mention of this.      On Thursday, the KNCA report said its army, at the request of the Academy of Defense Science, ""conducted important test-fire of ballistic missile to verify the movement reliability of a special functional warhead paralyzing the operation command system of the enemy"" and fired five super-large multiple launch missiles and tactical ballistic missiles and 46 long-range multiple launch missiles into the East Sea.      On Friday, it said it conducted ""a large-scale all-out combat sortie operation of the air force with 500 fighters"" for three hours and 47 minutes ""in order to show the will to counter the combined air drill of the enemy.""      On Saturday, it simulated ""a strike on the enemy's air force base"" and again fired ""two tactical ballistic missiles loaded with dispersion warheads and two super-large multiple launch missiles at a desert island"" in the West Sea.      It also released photos of the various missile launches last week for the first time in state media.      Referring to the Vigilant Storm exercise, the KCNA report described it as ""an open provocation aimed at intentionally escalating the tension in the region and a dangerous war drill of very high aggressive nature directly targeting the DPRK.""    The report stressed that North Korean military drills are a ""clear answer"" that ""the more persistently the enemies' provocative military moves continue, the more thoroughly and mercilessly the KPA will counter them.""      Pyongyang's claims about the strategic cruise missiles landing in waters 80 kilometers off the coast of Ulsan raised concerns in Seoul, as it is near five metropolitan cities with a combined population of around 1.11 million people.    The South Korean military never said cruise missiles were fired into waters near Ulsan last week, leading to worries about Seoul's missile detection capabilities.    However, a South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) official said Monday said that Pyongyang's claims were not true and that such missile launches had not been detected through U.S. and South Korean military surveillance.      ""According to the results of analysis of South Korea-U.S. surveillance and reconnaissance assets, [North Korea's claims] are not true,"" said Col. Kim Jun-rak, a JCS spokesman, in a press briefing Monday. ""So far, nothing has been captured or detected by our military.""      He said the South's military collected on Sunday an object believed to be the remnants of a North Korean SRBM fired on Wednesday from waters south of the NLL in the East Sea.      Last Wednesday, Seoul's military confirmed that North Korea fired three SRBMs, one of which landed 26 kilometers south of the NLL, around 57 kilometers off the coast of Sokcho in the East Sea.      The South Korean military immediately scrambled F-15K and KF-16 fighters and fired precision-guided missiles into waters north of the NLL.      The KCNA report didn't acknowledge its SRBM falling into waters south of the NLL as the cause of the confrontation last Wednesday.      On Thursday, the South's military said that North Korea's launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), believed to be a Hwasong-17, apparently ended in failure.      The KCNA report on Monday didn't specifically mention the suspected failed launch of an ICBM, nor was the Hwasong-17 detailed in its launches last Thursday.      However, the JCS response doesn't completely rule out the possibility that Seoul and Washington may have missed detection of a cruise missile, according to experts.      Some analysts say that the North's reference to a ""special functional warhead paralyzing the operation command system"" could refer to a testing of a potential electromagnetic pulse, or EMP, attack, where a massive burst of electromagnetic energy decimates power grids.    This comes as South Korea and the U.S. militaries believe the North has completed preparations for a seventh nuclear test.   "

One of the missiles fired on Wednesday landed near South Korean waters south of the de facto maritime border NLL in the East Sea. One of the missiles fired on Thursday is thought to be an intercontinental ballistic missile. The ICBM, however, failed in midflight.On Friday, the North did not fire missiles but carried out a large scale air drill, prompting South Korea to scramble fighter jets in response.The JCS, meanwhile, said that the Seoul-Washington joint air drill Vigilant Storm was concluded on Saturday.

Korea evade sanctionsBy Byun Duk-kun   WASHINGTON, Nov. 3 (Yonhap) -- The United States on Thursday announced a reward of up to US$5 million for information that leads to the arrest of a Singaporean national who is suspected of engaging in illegal transfers of oil and luxury goods to North Korea.   The Singaporean, identified as Kwek Kee Seng, is the director of a Singapore-based shipping agency who is suspected of being engaged in an ""extensive scheme"" to evade U.S. and U.N. Security Council sanctions on North Korea, according to Paul Houston, deputy assistant secretary and assistant director of the Diplomatic Security Service for Threat Investigation and Analysis.Paul Houston, deputy assistant secretary and assistant director of the Diplomatic Security Service for Threat Investigation and Analysis, is seen holding a press conference at the Foreign Press Center in Washington on Nov. 3, 2022 in this captured image. (Yonhap)""As alleged, Kwek and his co-conspirators sought to obscure their activities by conducting financial transactions through a series of shell companies based in Panama, Singapore and other locations,"" Houston told a press briefing organized by the Washington Foreign Press Center.   He added that Kwek is alleged to be involved in illicit ship-to-ship and direct transfers of refined petroleum products to North Korea, noting the North has violated the 500,000 barrels-per-year limit under U.N. Security Council resolutions each year.   The deputy assistant secretary of state also noted the District Court of the Southern District of New York issued a warrant for Kwek's arrest in April 2021, but that he remains at large.   Gonzalo Suarez, deputy assistant secretary of state for international security and nonproliferation, highlighted the need to disrupt North Korea's illicit activities that help fund its illegal weapons programs.   ""North Korea employs a wide range of proliferation networks ... to collect revenue from overseas operations to support the WMD program, including a ballistic missile program,"" Suarez told the press briefing.

[Hwang’s China and the World] Seeking new Korea-China relations: Evalua...,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000239734?sid=004,"Thu, 08 Sep 2022 15:23:00 +0900","Min Kwi-sik (left) and Dong Xiangrong.Now is the time for Korea and China to look back on the past, face the present and talk about the future. Over the past 30 years, Korea-China relations have developed to the point that we may call it explosive in respective fields. The establishment of Korea-China diplomatic relations was an important turning point in advancing the new era of prosperity in Northeast Asia. And now both Korea and China have grown into the core countries in the international community. China, along with the United States, has grown into a major powerhouse in the international community, and Korea has become a globally charming country. Nevertheless, it is also true that there are some friction and conflicts due to the rapid growth and compressed development of the relationship. However, the two countries should endeavor to overcome the current growing pains and build a more mature partnership. Korea and China are neighbors that cannot move away from one another. This geographic condition makes us take an approach in a longer-term perspective, with a longer breath. Meeting the 30th anniversary of Korea-China diplomatic relations this year, we should take it as an opportunity to further strengthen the infrastructure of the relationship and establish a new type of Korea-China relationship that enables strategic communication.In this regard, we prepared a series on seeking new Korea-China relations for three weeks including today, from the perspectives of social culture, economic trade and diplomatic and security. This week’s interview invites two representative experts on social culture, the first theme of our series. First, we have Dong Xiangrong, the senior research fellow at the National Institute of International Strategy, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, and professor Min Kwi-sik from the Graduate School of International Studies in Hanyang University who also serves as the director of the Institute of Chinese Studies.Hwang: What is the scale of interpersonal communication between the two countries? Please analyze it from the perspective of quantity and quality.Dong: In terms of numbers, the number of people-to-people exchange is particularly valuable considering that South Korea has a population of only 52 million and the two countries are not connected by land, only by sea and air routes. However, as neighboring countries, although there have been over 100 million exchanges between China and South Korea in the past 30 years, the percentage of people who have visited each other’s country is not high. It is estimated that no more than 3 percent of China’s 1.4 billion population have visited South Korea, while a large proportion of South Korean visitors are business travelers who frequently travel between China and South Korea. What is the percentage of South Koreans who have direct experience of China? 30 percent? “Seeing is believing.” I hope more South Korean people come to China to experience the profound Chinese culture.Min: The people exchanges between Korea and China have grown rapidly. The peak was in 2016, with 8.26 million Chinese visitors to Korea and 4.76 million Koreans visiting China, exceeding 13 million in total. Since then, the number has decreased sharply due to the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-missile system and COVID-19, however, it will recover to a considerable level after a while. The number of long-term residents from each country is the criteria to identify the qualitative exchanges. Today we have 1 Chinese for every 50 Koreans living in Korea, and 1 Korean for every 80 Chinese in China, which shows that the two countries are deeply linked and engaged to each other.Hwang: What is the situation for South Koreans in China?Dong: According to statistics from South Korea’s Foreign Ministry, there were 256,875 South Koreans in China in 2021. The total number of South Koreans in China has stabilized at 250,000 in the past decade, and the number of South Korean students in China has fallen by nearly half compared with the number five years ago. Currently, the number of Chinese in South Korea is about 800,000, and there are about 60,000 Chinese students in South Korea. Sizable Korean-populated areas have been formed in Wangjing in Beijing, Chengyang in Qingdao, Gubei in Shanghai, and these places have become attractive sites for Chinese people to experience Korean culture.Hwang: How would you describe the current circumstances of Chinese people in Korea and what challenges are there?Min: The long-stay Chinese in Korea are actually the major resource that supports the basic areas of the Korean economy, but the evaluation on these people is quite low. Technically they are the reliable speakers in terms of delivering Korean images to China. In this sense, it is problematic to portray Chinatown in a negative angle in films. In particular, the attitude toward Korean countrypeople living as second-class citizens in both China and Korea should be changed. Prior to improving the immigration policy, social and legal support for ethnic Koreans in China should be strengthened.Hwang: What are the achievements of the Korean Wave in China?Min: The Korean Wave first started with dramas and expanded into music, films and culture. But the thing is that Hallyu fans are limited to only certain generations. We must understand that the Korean Wave can only be maintained when it is supported by steady economic growth and democratic politics. Since the true Korean Wave can bear fruit by having people relish ‘Korea’ itself beyond just a few cultural genres, a comprehensive perspective and approach are essential to enhance Korea's soft power.Dong: The Korean Wave is an important channel for Chinese people to learn about South Korea. It has prevailed in China since the 1990s. In the beginning, some TV drama series with the theme of family life attracted a large number of middle-aged and elderly women viewers. The common identity in a Confucian cultural sphere made Chinese audiences regard South Korean culture as “an old friend.” South Korean romance dramas have captivated many young Chinese. It is jokingly said that the popularity of the Korean Wave has greatly increased women’s requirements for their partners, which indirectly had an impact on the decline of their desire for marriage. In recent years, Chinese teenagers have become enamored with K-pop and other popular culture. Regardless of China’s security concerns, the deployment of the US THAAD system greatly dampened the enthusiasm for the Korean Wave fans in China. The Korean Wave’s fever has been reduced. Even so, the Chinese public’s appreciation for Korean pop culture is still palpable. I personally run a social media blog with more than 80,000 followers in China. I once asked which South Korean movie was their favorite and received thousands of comments. It had far more clout than similar questions related to other countries.Hwang: What are the achievements of Korean-language promotion in China?Dong: From a worldwide perspective, the place where Korean education has developed most rapidly in terms of either speed or scale over the past 30 years in the world is China. Before the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and South Korea, only five universities in China had a Korean language major, such as Peking University and Yanbian University. Since the establishment of diplomatic ties, there has been a boost in the number of universities offering Korean language as a major. At present, more than 200 universities in China offer Korean language as a major, which is unimaginable in any other country. The demand for Korean language talents from Korean enterprises in China, Chinese enterprises in Korea, universities, academic institutions and foreign affairs agencies in governments at all levels has promoted the widespread development of Korean language education in China. In recent years, as the expansion of market demand has dropped, the number of students majoring in Korean language has also declined. Nevertheless, some Chinese learn Korean simply to better understand Korean culture and listen to Korean songs.Hwang: Is there any particular stories on achievements or challenges of the Chinese language fever in Korea?Min: As can be seen from the fact that many private Chinese academies closed down, the current Chinese fever has cooled considerably. It may be in a sense of growing pain, however, actually not many people necessarily need to learn Chinese. With the advent of interpretation apps, those who are willing to travel or appreciate Chinese culture can easily and technically find the solution. In addition, as China's cultural capacity grows, the number of people who naturally learn Chinese will increase. Therefore, what we should do now is make more efforts to raise the level of graduates from related departments which are specializing in Chinese.Hwang: What is the scale of Koreans among international students in China?Dong: Before the pandemic, China was the top destination for overseas study in Asia. The biggest group of international students in China is South Korean students. According to statistics from China’s Ministry of Education, there were 492,200 international students in China in 2018, 50,600 students of whom were from South Korea. After the outbreak of the pandemic, the number of international students in China dropped. Statistics from South Korea’s Foreign Ministry show that 34,000 South Korean students studied in China in 2021. The number is significantly lower than the number of Chinese students in South Korea. When it comes to Korean students studying in China, it reminds me of Choe Chi-won from the Silla Dynasty (57 BC-AD 935), who came to study in the Tang Dynasty (AD 618-907) and spread Chinese culture far and wide. The large group of overseas students has made an important contribution to enhancing exchanges between China and South Korea. Many of them have become leading figures in South Korea.Hwang: How many Chinese students are in Korea? What kind of achievements have they made or what are the challenges are they facing?Min: Last year, about 67,000 students out of 152,000 international students were Chinese students and that makes up 44.2 percent. Although the ratio has decreased compared to 10 years ago, since the number of international students has been increasing slightly, we can say the number of Chinese students was not largely affected by the THAAD issue. However, the fact that Chinese students mostly choose to study liberal arts in Korea might mean that our level of science and engineering should grow further. On the other hand, the percentage of students who came to Korea because they liked Korea, but return to their country as an anti-Korean after studying here is recording a pretty high rate. This is a problematic phenomenon. Only when the academic management of international students become more active and cautious, Korea’s competitiveness of studying in Korea will be maintained.Hwang: What is the situation of Korea-related majors at Chinese universities?Dong: There are roughly over 100 research institutions related to the Korean Peninsula in China. Korean institutions such as the Korea Foundation for Advanced Studies, the Academy of Korean Studies, and the Korea Foundation have provided various support to Chinese Korean Peninsula research institutes. In the past 30 years, Chinese scholars have applied for more than 300 projects related to the Korean Peninsula supported by the National Social Science Fund of China, which has greatly promoted Chinese scholars’ all-round research on the Korean Peninsula in terms of politics, economy, society, history and culture.Hwang: There are a few Korean universities that have China studies departments. What are the current situations there and what challenges are they facing?Min: First of all, many of the Chinese departments in local universities have closed down, and overall admissions are falling. This is due to the result that reflects people’s perception toward China, however, the abolishment of the department mustn’t be a hasty decision. Chinese studies that aims to teach its social science should be remained, even if the department changes into East Asian studies. Looking at these changes from a distance, we need human resources who major in Chinese-related studies and have capacities that exceed what a university can teach them. Considering China's growth, its size and importance, we cannot say that the current number of majors in Chinese studies is excessive.Hwang: What is the status of media and public opinion exchanges between the two countries?Min: The media is usually a window to understand other countries, but the two countries' media have failed their roles in the sense of making the other countries understand objectively. This is due to the sensational reporting based on the commercial nature of media. In addition, the emergence of online media outlets is mostly focused on making certain targets unappealing, rather than extending the positive aspect of exchanging information. In particular, as the government cannot control such information, conflicts between the two countries’ private sectors are amplified. In the end, when it comes to the solution, we have no other choice but to count on improvement in civic awareness although it must take some time.Dong: The mainstream media of China and South Korea have correspondents stationed in each other’s countries. They send back a large amount of information to the people of the two countries for reference. A relatively stable exchange mechanism has been established between major media of the two countries, such as the China-ROK Media High-level Dialogue. The main problem is that the image of each other’s country in mainstream media is not symmetrical. The coverage of China in South Korean media is generally negative. It has to do with South Korea’s news predilection for grabbing attention and focusing on negative events. The coverage of South Korea in mainstream Chinese media is generally positive. However, a new phenomenon has emerged in recent years with social media flourishing. In pursuit of clout, some bloggers not only tend to report negative news about other countries, but also would like to hype up negative news about their country debated in other countries. Some harsh, extreme views end up rapidly spreading on the internet, which exerts a negative impact on China and South Korea’s public opinion field and heavily affects people’s mutual understanding between the two countries.Hwang: What are the social and cultural conflicts between Korea and China?Dong: China and South Korea are culturally homologous, geographically similar and historically intertwined. It is regrettable that the historical experience, which should have increased mutual recognition, has triggered conflicts in today’s international political context. The social and cultural contradictions between China and South Korea mainly focus on two areas. The first is about the perception and collective memory of the past, including the nature of the relationship between the two countries in history, the Korean War and other issues. The second is the attribution of traditional culture. Basic principles need to be noted here, that is, the concept of the modern nation-state should not be used to analyze international relations in ancient times, nor can the concept of intellectual property in the contemporary world be used to define the ownership of ancient cultural products.Min: The core causes of the conflict between Korea and China are the issues that are highly abstract, such as the matters of historical and cultural sovereignty. As these matters are directly connected to the national identity, it is terribly difficult to make any kind of concessions or resolutions. This is why these problems usually stay under the ground but detonate once conflict arises. The basis of this sentiment comes from the reality that that historical superiority and inferiority are contradictory to the current national income level. Each has this psychological aspect to compensate their inferiority with a sense of superiority, therefore, even a small conflict tends to be greatly amplified.Hwang: What is the reason for the spread of anti-Korea sentiment?Min: As Korea and China built a functionalist approach that emphasizes reciprocal economic necessity, their emotional trust is relatively weak compared to the volume of trade. The root of the public's anti-Chinese sentiment is quite specific, for instance the fine dust problem. This anti-Chinese sentiment has been strengthened as it has caused inconveniences for people in life and such feelings tend to accumulate. Moreover, fear of China's rise has prompted resistance against the Chinese political system, and the continued ideological offensive by the conservatives has also played a major role. On top of that, the individualistic characteristics of the young generation might have overlapped, so the anti-Chinese sentiment spread to a degree that far exceeded economic benefits.Dong: Personally, I do not agree with the term “anti-Korean sentiment in China.” It is not so much opposing Korea as disliking Korea, which is a negative perception and sentiment toward Korea. Two time points were vital in the spread of the sentiment of disliking Korea. The first was the deployment of THAAD, which made many Chinese people very disappointed in South Korea. Therefore, the sentiment of disliking South Korea rose in China. During the Moon Jae-in administration, after China and South Korea reached a basic consensus on the THAAD issue and properly handled it, bilateral relations saw a turnaround at a critical phase. In fact, negative sentiment toward South Korea in the Chinese public has eased somewhat in recent years. However, it is a pity that the Beijing Winter Olympics this year has brought about some controversies on hanbok, referee’s decisions, etc. South Korea’s arguments were shocks to the Chinese people. From the Chinese public’s perspective, as one of the 56 ethnic groups in China, there is no reason why the Korean minority should not be allowed to sing and dance in their traditional costume at the Winter Olympics. Besides, any dispute over a referee’s decision in sports should be settled through established procedures, and an important basis for participating in sports competition is to accept the referee’s decision. And, it was rare to see responsible Korean politicians, scholars and sports figures make a rational and objective analysis on these issues. Some of them would rather add to the disputes than calm them.Hwang: What is the best way to carry out social and cultural exchanges between the two countries for the next five years? What advice do you have for the two governments?Dong: We need to let history be history, and let culture be culture and sport be sport. The stable development of the relationship between China and South Korea should not be interfered or even hijacked by other factors. History, culture and sports should become an important bond for enhancing bilateral relations. Politicians and the people of both countries need to realize that developing bilateral relations is in the fundamental interests of the two countries and their peoples. The social and cultural exchanges between the two countries are not too much, but too little and too inadequate. The people of the two countries do not know each other well enough. Anyone who hypes up the so-called dispute between China and South Korea to pursue their own selfish interests will eventually be abandoned by history. As the theme song of the 1988 Seoul Olympics goes, “Hand in hand, we can start to understand, breaking down the walls that come between us for all time.”Min: First of all, we must acknowledge the serious emotional conflict between the peoples from the respective countries and share the necessity for countermeasures. Since the two countries' national sentiments are sensitive to political and diplomatic issues, the most important thing is to reduce strategic conflicts and to increase political trust. China should be aware that its soft power has greatly weakened and readjust its public diplomacy toward neighboring countries. South Korean officials should reduce unnecessary misstatements that provoke China. Lastly, it is necessary to jointly start global citizenship education activities to get rid of excessive nationalist sentiment and to operate them as a 1.5 track that involves private organizations.By Hwang Jae-hoHwang Jae-ho is a professor of the Division of International Studies at the Hankuk University of Foreign Studies.

[Hwang's China and the World] Seeking new Korea-China relations: Evaluat...,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000240204?sid=004,"Wed, 28 Sep 2022 18:10:00 +0900","Professor Yoo Dong-won (left), Col. Chen YueNow is the time for Korea and China to look back on the past, face the present and talk about the future. Over the past 30 years, Korea-China relations have developed explosively. The establishment of Korea-China diplomatic relations was an important turning point in advancing the new era of prosperity in Northeast Asia. And now both Korea and China have grown into the core countries in the international community. China has grown into a major powerhouse in the international community, and Korea has become a globally charming country. Nevertheless, it is also true that there is some friction and conflicts due to the rapid growth and compressed development of the relationship. However, the two countries should endeavor to overcome the current growing pains and build a more mature partnership. Korea and China are neighbors that cannot move away from one another. This geographic condition makes us take an approach in a longer-term perspective, with a longer breath. In honor of the 30th anniversary of Korea-China diplomatic relations this year, we should further strengthen the infrastructure of the relationship and establish a new type of Korea-China relationship that enables strategic communication.This week the series will be covering defense & military, following discussions on society & culture, economy & trade, and politics & diplomacy over the past three weeks. For this week's conversation, we have invited two experts from the field. Professor Yoo Dong-won from Korean National Defense University (KNDU), who served the director of US-China Research Center at KNDU, and Col. Chen Yue, associate research fellow at the War Studies Institute at The People’s Liberation Army’s Academy of Military Sciences and an expert on the Korean Peninsula, contributed to today’s discussion.Hwang: Looking back at the last 30 years of history, how was the military relationship between Korea and China?Yoo: For the past 30 years, military relations between Korea and China have developed under the influence of political, diplomatic, and economic conditions both at home and abroad. Around 1993-94, a military attache to each embassy was established, and in 1992 and 1994, the Korean Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff visited China to hold the first meeting between the military leaders of the two countries. In 1995, a working-level defense policy talk was first held to coordinate and cooperate in military exchanges between the two countries. Since 1999, Korea and China’s Minister of National Defense held mutual visits, and in 2002, the Foreign Policy and Security (2+2) Dialogue between Korea-China began, followed by the mutual exchange visits between cadets and naval fleets. Later in 2003, another mutual visit of the Minister of Defense was held, and the Korea-China Defense Dialogue became more active along with regularization of defense policy meetings in the director levels and military exchange programs beginning in 2004. The navies of the two countries conducted joint search and rescue drills also, which was basically a preliminary form of joint military drills. Additionally, in 2008, Korea and China installed an air-sea direct line and conducted another joint search and rescue drill.Chen: Since the establishment of diplomatic relations, Korea and China have strengthened cooperation under the spirit of ‘mutual respect, equal and mutual benefit, peace and coexistence, and good-neighborliness.’ We are deepening mutual political trust, amalgamating our interests, and maintaining unprecedented level of consultation and cooperation in international and regional affairs. Ever since the establishment of diplomatic relations, high-ranking military personnel from the two countries have visited each other quite frequently, and the number of delegations visiting each other annually is more than 20 on average. These factors have supported the development of bilateral relations across a wide-range and in multidimensional areas.Hwang: There must have been damage to Korea-China military relations because of the THAAD issue.Yoo: The military relations between Korea and China were halted for a while in the wake of North Korea's attack on the Cheonan corvette in 2010 and another one toward Yeonpyeong Island. Bilateral military relations were restarted through the talks between Korea-China Ministers of Defense in May 2011. Later on, the relations were severed following Korea’s decision to deploy THAAD in July 2016. In October 2017, the Moon Jae-in government tried to improve relations with China by mentioning '3NO (no additional THAAD deployments, no joining of a broader U.S. missile defense system, and no Korea-US-Japan military alliance)', however, relations have been minimized due to COVID-19. Until now, defense strategy dialogues, the Foreign Policy and Security (2+2) Dialogue, and most of the defense academic exchanges in search and rescue training have been suspended.Hwang: How would you assess the current military relations?Chen: The militaries of two countries established a close functional department exchange system, defense strategy dialogue, working-level meetings in defense policy, and regular exchanges systems and have signed a Memorandum of Understanding for defense exchange and cooperation. Also, since 2014, remains of Chinese soldiers have been returned to China nine separate times. In addition, the Minister of Defense's direct lines to the army, navy, and air force were opened, which led to several mutual visits of deck planes. Now, the Ministers of Defense have direct lines to each side’s army, navy, and air force, as well as lines to Korea’s Master Control and Report Center and to China’s Northern theater commands.Yoo: In general, we see military relations develop from military exchange, military cooperation, and to military alliance in an order, and the current Korea-China military relations could be said to be at the rudimentary military cooperation stage. Compared to other developments in economies or social and political areas, the process is going quite slow. In particular, the level of institutionalization is still low, despite the fact that the agreement on establishing military trust building measures (a hotline, search and rescue training, etc.) was signed recently, the internalized stage is insufficient.Hwang: What could be the reason that the military area is developing slower than any other part of Korea-China relations?Yoo: The reason for the conflicts in Korea-China military relations is not because of direct bilateral friction, but rather due to the impact of external factors such as North Korea and the Korea-US alliance, and lack of empathy in terms of strategic issues. In specific, it is largely influenced by North Korea's nuclear weapons, US-China relations, Korea-US and US-Japan alliance. In this sense, these issues constrain Korea-China military relations, and conflicts caused by external factors have accordingly become more complicated to resolve.Hwang: What do you think the future direction of military cooperation between Korea and China is?Chen: High-level military communication between the two armies should be sustained. Based on the principle of mutual respect and equality, we must work to exclude any interference from third-parties, resolve misunderstandings and deepen mutual trust through building close strategic communication. Moreover, high-level strategic communication between the two armies should be strengthened along with promoting high-level exchanges and dialogue mechanisms.We can also think of adding Northeast Asia and the Asia-Pacific region’s security issues in the bilateral strategic dialogue agendas to protect peace and stability, establishing a system between the two armies to notify and immediately communicate about serious situations, so that we can avoid strategic misjudgments and resolve various constraints. The development of military relations between the two countries should be promoted in all directions to become the joint pillar for peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula, regional cooperation, and further resolutions of global problems. Exchange and cooperation in bilateral, regional, and even global affairs should be further intensified, and the contents and measures of cooperation should be expanded. The Korea-China armies should continuously endeavor to broaden common interest and sustain cooperation in all dimensions by holding discussions on establishing a permanent cooperative system in areas such as disaster relief, maritime relief, public health, peacekeeping, navigation protection, and others.Yoo: For international cooperation, Korea and China should not be too immersed in either the international structure or the US-China competition, but should secure their respective security interests from a more flexible and open perspective. Under the current international structure, security and military interests between Korea and China overlap with each other, therefore, exclusive and independent claims of rights may eventually deteriorate the relations and might be misunderstood as interference in the domestic affairs of one another. This is why military and security issues must be pursued in a low key manner and carefully with responsibility.Hwang: What do you mean by excluding third-party interference?Chen: First of all, all the local issues and sensitive problems should be appropriately dealt with. As the THAAD issue has emerged as the most serious challenge since the establishment of diplomatic relations, joint efforts are required to manage it well. Recently, Korea and China’s ministers of foreign affairs held a meeting and the two sides agreed to value each other's security concerns and make efforts for leniency so as not to interfere with bilateral relations. Both countries should not provoke each other and strictly follow the consensus so that these problems do not come up to the surface again. Another notable thing is that the cooperation paradigm of the Korea-US military alliance stays under the intention to expand the siege and territory. Korea and the US are allies, and Korea and China are inseparable neighbors and close cooperative partners at the same time. The Korea-US alliance should not undermine regional peace and stability, nor should damage China's strategic security interests. China consistently respects Korea's grave concerns. Therefore, the Korean and Chinese militaries should also continue to implement the agreement between the two leaders, remember the initial commitment from back when we were establishing diplomatic relations, maintain an appropriate position on issues related to the other's core interests, and further develop Korea-China relations with good military connections.Hwang: What are the major challenges to Korea-China military relations?Yoo: Military relations between Korea and China in the future are still dependent on variables such as changes in international relations, strategic competition between the US and China, the domestic politics of the two countries, and North Korea. The US-China strategic competition at the global and regional level is likely to pose various risks to the development of military relations between Korea and China as well as Korea's foreign policy. It presents new tasks for Korea's foreign affairs and security, as the prolonged Russia-Ukraine war increases the possibility of negative effects on the international political and economic order, along with the Korea-China relations. Changes in the global strategic environment will provide an opportunity and a great challenge for Korea-China military relations.Hwang: What should we do if we seek to specify cooperation between the two armies?Chen: The two armies should further strengthen exchanges between functional departments and related fields, resume maritime rescue, and expand practical cooperation in non-traditional security areas including maritime rescue, counterterrorism, sanitation, and others. It is necessary to also tighten up the communication exchanges between young officers, and to expand inter-visit of young officers by arranging short-term education, exchange learning, and student exchanges at military schools in various forms to develop more ‘China Experts’ and ""Korea Experts’. Additionally we can think of increasing the number of mutual visits between ships and scale of direct naval and air phone line connections.Yoo: I guess we need to develop theories and logic development on ""peace and cooperation"" rather than ""confrontation and war"" at the global and regional level, and especially in terms of the Russian-Ukraine war, we must take a sober analysis at the academic level. In the end, exchanges between scholars are essential for the development of theories and logic related to ""peace and cooperation."" Efforts to expand communication with experts and strategists between Korea and China and to regularize or institutionalize low-level exchanges are highly suggested.Hwang: Do you have any other comments you would like to add?Yoo: The Korea-China military relationship has not fully recovered yet, but there are channels going on for dialogue and communication between the two countries' defense ministries and between the militaries. Also, the fact that the Korean and Chinese navies conducted three search and rescue drills as a coalition is meaningful in the aspect that it was a trial to realize the agreement into an action. If military relations between the two countries further develop in the future, it will basically provide an opportunity to promote military cooperation in non-traditional security areas such as PKO, disaster relief, anti-piracy, and so on.Chen: Both Korea and China have great influence in Northeast Asia and they play an important role in Asia-Pacific, Northeast Asia and the Korean Peninsula. Therefore, the Korea-China relationship is one of the most important bilateral relations in the Asia-Pacific region. There is no reason for the two countries to fail in establishing a firm bilateral relations, no reason not to consider each other's core security concerns, and no reason to alienate and even confront each other due to third-party factors. Korea and China should also take joint measures to cooperate in security challenges without missing historical opportunities.Hwang Jae-ho is a professor of international studies at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies.

[Newsmaker] Transport ministry offers increase of taxi-hailing fee to re...,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000240317?sid=104,"Tue, 04 Oct 2022 16:08:00 +0900","Overnight basic taxi fee in Seoul likely to surpass 10,000 won next yearPeople waiting in line at a taxi stand in Seoul Station during rush hour on Tuesday. (Yonhap)The government will raise late-night taxi-hailing fees to 5,000 won ($3.49) which will go into the pockets of taxi drivers, not platform companies, to bring back drivers who left the industry during the pandemic curfew, the transport ministry said Tuesday.According to the plan devised to resolve the nighttime taxi shortage, taxis operating from 10 p.m. to 3 a.m. will receive up to 5,000 won as hailing fee. When the midnight basic fare is added, passengers in Seoul are likely to pay more than 10,000 won for taking cabs late in the evening. The Seoul metropolitan government has been mulling a raise in the taxi basic fare to 4,800 won from the current 3,800 won starting next February. A 20 to 40 percent premium in fares is also being considered to taxis operating from 10 p.m to 4 a.m.The plan came after the government's analysis on the ongoing taxi shortage that found that an insufficient number of drivers to operate taxis as the main cause. Many taxi drivers left in the past three years when the country implemented a series of social distancing measures including a taxi curfew.The number of corporate taxi drivers has decreased to 74,000 from 102,000 before the pandemic, according to the ministry. In Seoul, the number of corporate taxi drivers has decreased to 21,000 from 31,000 making hailing a taxi extremely difficult at night, it added.Other measures includes abolishing the taxi operation day limiting system implemented in 1973 to control the taxi supply.In the case of Chuncheon, Gangwon Province, where the system was lifted in April, the number of taxis operating at night increased by 30 percent.To augment the number of corporate taxi drivers as fast as possible, the government is allowing people to start working once they provide a clean criminal record -- they can get a taxi driving license within three months of starting to work as a corporate taxi driver.Corporate taxi drivers will also be able to work part-time, including during Friday and Saturday nights only.They will also be allowed to park the cabs at their residence or directly hand over the cab to the next driver once their shift is over to relieve them from the burden of having to return the cabs back to the company’s parking lot after nighttime shifts.Transport minister Won Hee-ryong said that the government will consider allowing midnight operations of taxi hailing businesses such as Uber and Tada that have been banned for years amid strong resistance from taxi operators.“There has been disputes over the past few years regarding services provided by Tada and Uber but we will no longer compromise on the vested interests that stand in the way of innovation. We will allow new platform services that operate during nighttime or rush hours,” he said."
[Hwang’s China and the world] Seeking new Korea-China relations: Evalua...,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000239832?sid=004,"Wed, 14 Sep 2022 18:15:00 +0900","Yang Pyoung-seobTu XinquanNow is the time for Korea and China to look back on the past, face the present and talk about the future. Over the past 30 years, Korea-China relations have developed explosively.This week, as we continue the series on the New Korea-China relations, the second topic covers economy and trade, following the social and cultural dimensions. This week’s discussion invites two experts from home and abroad. Senior research fellow Yang Pyoung-seob at Korea Institute for International Economic Policy, who served as the director of its Beijing office, and professor Tu Xinquan at the University of International Business and Economics, who also is the dean of the China Institute for WTO Studies at the same university, have joined for the discussion.Hwang: What are the achievements of economic cooperation in the 30 years of diplomatic relations between Korea and China?Yang: For the last 30 years after the establishment of diplomatic relations between Korea and China in 1992, trade and investment between the two countries have grown dramatically through the process of coordination and expansion.In 2021, Korea-China trade rocketed 47 times (14.2 percent per year on average) compared to the period when diplomatic relations were just established, and at the end of 2021, the balance of direct investment between the two countries grew 472 times (23.7 percent per year on average) to $100.9 billion. The overall volume has expanded by establishing a complementary cooperative relationship in the manufacturing sector and by meeting the demands that the stages of mutual economic development require at the same time.Korea-China cooperation has grown both quantitatively and qualitatively by establishing complementary global production networks in major industries such as electronic devices, automobiles and petrochemicals. Then the economic cooperation has gone deeper from the vertical division of labor to the horizontal division of labor, and from interindustrial cooperation to within-industrial cooperation, as the two countries’ industrial developments reached a similar level.The two countries also have an institutional basis for further economic cooperation. In December 2015, the Korea-China FTA Product Agreement was put into effect in order to enhance the strategic cooperative partnership, and the second stage, service/investment negotiations, is currently underway.Tu: The strategic cooperative partnership between Korea and China is taking place not only in the economy and trade, but also in various fields such as politics, humanities, science and technology. However, economic and trade cooperation is indeed a bright spot for bilateral relations, and trade between Korea and China is a crucial factor in the development of the two countries' economies.Since the two countries established diplomatic ties 30 years ago, their trade volume has increased more than 50 times. China has become Korea's largest trading partner for the last 18 consecutive years. In 2021, the trade volume between Korea and China exceeded $360 billion, equivalent to the total trade volume between Korea and the US, Korea and Japan, and Korea and Europe. This record is similar to that of China and Japan also.In the first half of this year, trade between China and Korea was $184.25 billion, which was about a 9.4 percent increase from the same period of last year. Korea is expected to become China's second-biggest trading partner this year. Against the backdrop of the vulnerable recovery of the global economy, Korea-China trade maintained rapid growth. This fully shows that the economies of the two countries are highly complementary and fully shows the resilience and potential of bilateral economic and trade cooperation.Hwang: Would you explain the development process and flows of Korea-China economic relations?Yang: The process of economic cooperation development between Korea and China can be divided into 1) the stage of establishing the foundation for economic cooperation (1992-2001), 2) the stage of rapid growth based on a complementary cooperating system (2001-2014), which is the period from joining the WTO till the Korea-China FTA was enacted, and 3) the stage of maturity of economic cooperation from 2015 to the present.In particular, conflicts between South Korea and China over the deployment of THAAD (the US’ Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system) have continued since 2016, and economic cooperation between the two countries has been partially affected by the competition between the US and China since 2018. In addition, negative factors are reflected all over economic cooperation between Korea and China, for instance, the suspension of operations and human exchanges due to COVID-19 after 2020 and soaring global resources and energy prices after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.Hwang: From an economic point of view, what could be the nature of Korea-China economic and trade cooperation?Tu: It is the result of mutual benefit and win-win, not relying on either side. Although the industrial structure of the two countries, the factor endowment and the contents of cooperation and competition between the two countries have changed, cooperation between Korea and China still follows the principle of comparative advantage.Hwang: What could be the main problem of the bilateral economic relations between Korea and China?Tu: The reality that both sides must gradually accept and adapt to is the fact that the relative gap in volume between China and Korea will continue to widen and the industrial development gap will steadily narrow down.Indeed, the pace of China's economic development and industrial advancement exceeded our expectations. This is the fruit of our efforts in addition to a lot of internal and external favorable factors. China's economic volume has reached the second largest in the world, and the gap with Korea has widened from 1.4 times to nine times, compared to the early days of diplomatic relations.However, China's development has not reached very high levels and there is still room for sustainable expansion. We must therefore accept the growing gap in economic scale between China and Korea.Yang: There is a growing possibility that the scalability of the Korea-China trade will be limited. China's strategy to strengthen the domestic supply chain, the semiconductor-biased export structure, and the gap between China's import structure and Korea's export structure is likely to limit Korea's export expansion to China. These changes are leading to the trade deficit with China.In the case of 2021, it turns into a deficit if we exclude semiconductors (HS 8542), and in 2022, the overall trade with China was a deficit even when we include semiconductors. In specific, Korea reached a trade deficit with China (minus $1.68 billion) in the second quarter of 2022.The pressure on restructuring Korean companies in China is also escalating. The effect of inducing imports and exports by investment is decreasing due to sluggish local sales of Korean companies, those are invested in China. The share of Korean products in the Chinese import market fell from 10.4 percent in 2015 to 7.7 percent in the first half of 2022, as the competitiveness of Korean products in the Chinese import market, excluding semiconductors, declined.Hwang: From the perspective of the industrial structure, both Korea and China value the development of the manufacturing industry. Is Korea's competitiveness with China declining in bilateral trade?Yang: As China's role shifts from Korea's export market to intermediate goods suppliers, China's influence in Korea's supply chain and economic security is increasing. Korea's dependence on China for imports of intermediate goods (parts and materials) is also continuously rising. In Korea's imports, there are 1,275 items that record more than 90 percent of dependence on China, and 1,850 items with more than 80 percent (out of 12,586 items based on 10 HS units).Under this structure, the possibility of supply chain disruption (petrochemicals, steel, building materials, fertilizer, etc.) due to accidental supply chain interruption (wiring harness, urea water crisis) and policy change (China's 3060 strategy) is emerging.Tu: Once again, China relied on huge resource mobilization capabilities and the benefits of domestic market size to achieve sustained development in some industries and even caught up with Korea.A representative example is the new energy automobile. Regarding the area, China barely relies on the export market and bases on the pure domestic market, which in the end fostered enormous emerging industries and gradually gained international competitiveness.From China's point of view, just because its national power is getting stronger day by day, it cannot treat other countries with arrogance and abuse its power like how the US does. For Korea, it is meaningless to compare the absolute scale with China. On the other hand, it should pay attention to the opportunities that China's economic development has brought to Korea and form a complementary industrial partnership with China.Hwang: Is the competitiveness of Korean investment in China also declining?Yang: Actually we are going through the second phase of restructuring.According to the analysis of the Export-Import Bank of Korea, the sales ratio of Korean companies in China plunged from 7.3 times in 2013 to 2.7 times in 2020, the operating profit ratio from 4.9 percent to 2.2 percent. Also the sales and market share of Korean-brand automobiles in China decreased quite steeply.After the global financial crisis, the first restructuring (escape from China) was carried out mainly by labor-intensive small and medium-sized enterprises. Now, on the other hand, the second restructuring (business adjustment) is going on mostly in large companies such as the ones in automobiles, mobile phones, home appliances and steel since 2018.Hwang: What is the most significant risk that Korea and China are facing?Tu: It is a political factor in economic and trade relations. We know that there are differences in political systems between China and Korea. But the thing is Korea should not feel superior to China because of the difference in political systems, just as there should be no sense of superiority because China is larger than Korea.The political system is an independent choice between the two countries based on their respective history and culture, therefore, no one should interfere or evaluate one another. Both countries have suffered economic and trade friction due to differences in certain security areas, and in this regard, Korea and China should actively seek to establish more stable, transparent and enforceable mechanisms. They must also effectively control security interference or diplomatic differences involving in economic and trade cooperation.The Chinese government has always opposed politicizing the trade issue, and Korea did not want to be on either side under US pressure. In this sense, the two countries need to continuously strengthen their awareness of the separation of economic commerce and politics at various levels, including bilateral, regional and multilateral levels. Moreover, practical measures should be taken to maintain the stability of bilateral economic and trade relations.Yang: As the asymmetry of Korea-China economic power grows, the issue of mutual trust and respect is raised and various threats to Korea-China economic relations are rising in the process of reorganizing the global economic order (New Cold War, protectionism and blockization, reorganization of supply chain, the US-China decoupling and other unexpected variables). It is necessary to establish a direction for bilateral and regional economic cooperation that can wisely overcome these situations.Hwang: What should be the further direction of bilateral cooperation between Korea and China?Yang: First, in terms of the private-led Korea-China economic cooperation, it must be strengthened to enable the sustainable growth of mutual investment companies. When it comes to the fields of semiconductors, batteries and new energy automobiles, the companies should be able to make decisions through autonomous strategic judgments.Second, a practical use of the Korea-China FTA agreement should also be enhanced as a bilateral cooperation platform in responding to the US-China conflict. It is necessary to elevate the agreement to a comprehensive cooperation platform that encompasses cooperation in the field of new business and in stabilizing the supply chain.Third approach is the cooperation in supply chain stabilization, which responds to supply chain disruptions and cooperates in establishing stable supply chains. It will expand policy and information exchange cooperation for intermediate goods that are highly dependent on imports from China, and materials and parts (semiconductors, batteries, rare earths, etc.) that are involved in the US-China competition.Tu: In detail, first of all, both sides must continue to deepen their specific cooperation on trade and investment and strive to leverage more trade areas and potential. One way is to actively organize various economic and trade-promoting activities to establish more trade platforms for companies in both countries.We will support the two-way investment of strong and reputable companies in both countries and provide a fair and nondiscriminatory business environment for partner companies to invest and start their own businesses.Second, both sides should work together to accelerate industrial docking and cooperation and to promote trade and investment cooperation in various fields through industrial cooperation. We must foster new growth points for economic and trade cooperation between the two countries in this post-COVID-19 era.Third, both sides should continue to strengthen communication and coordination in regional and multilateral frameworks, secure the multilateral trading system and jointly promote the establishment of an open global economy.Hwang: Do you have any additional comments on Indo-Pacific Strategy, including IPEF?Yang: The regional cooperation which can minimize the impact of strategic competition in the Indo-Pacific region is necessary. It must seek cooperation in the Indo-Pacific area based on the principle of preventing supply chain disconnection and the open and inclusive cooperation.The Korea-China-Japan cooperation platform should also be promoted, with joint efforts to enact East Asian rules through the Korea-China-Japan FTA, while gradually raising its level of the open platform and moving toward advanced-country cooperation platforms including such as securing the supply chain, environment, digital, labor and competition policies.By Hwang Jae-hoHwang Jae-ho is a professor of the division of international studies at the Hankuk University of Foreign Studies.

Japanese Soldiers and Comfort Women are “Partners”... Whose Language i...,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/007/0000007174?sid=104,"Fri, 02 Sep 2022 22:06:00 +0900","A Controversial Point within the Issue of ‘Comfort Women’ in The Comparative History of War and RapeThe Comparative History of War and Rape, written by Ueno Sizko et al.  (Translated by Jaekil Suh, Eo Literary Publishing, 2020)    Problematizing Wartime Sexual Violence The testimony of Haksoon Kim, a victim-survivor of the Japanese military’s “comfort women” system, was instrumental in unleashing the research on war and sexual violence internationally. With more research, it has been revealed that wartime sexual violence is not a single soldier’s deviant action but rather a systematic sexual crime done by violently controlling and supervising women’s sexuality as part of the “soldier-making” process. Furthermore, the “comfort station” issue, that was publicized only after half a century, revealed to us two things: 1) that history consists of a “selective memory,” and 2) that oppressive sexual norms have been forcing rape victims to stay silent for a long period of time.  Translated and published in Korea in August this year, The Comparative History of War and Rape (translated by Jaekil Suh, Eo Literary Publishing, 2020) offers a historically comparative perspective on existing wartime sexual violence research by collecting various aspects of it including that on the Korean “comfort women” issue, the Japanese “comfort women” issue, Japanese soldiers’ perspective on “comfort” facilities, Japanese women who were left behind in Manchuria and their experiences of rape on their way back [to Japan], and brothel facilities that existed within the Nazi’s concentration camps.The book’s overall objective and methodology are shown well in Ueno Sizko’s introduction. The primary discussion that her previous book Nationalism and Gender (1999) dealt with—the criticism of the “victim model”—is extended in it. Ueno had criticized how a rape survivor’s testimony is often standardized to fit the society’s expectations and definitions of what a survivor should look like. The Comparative History of War and Rape demands the problematization of various sexual crimes by applying the idea of ‘the continuum of sexual violence,’ which arranges rape, prostitution, dating, and marriage on a continuum to examine “what is and what is not problematized within that series” (page 29). In particular, it develops more complex conditions for “what can or cannot be problematized” by placing the relationship between an assailant and a victim of the continuum of sexual violence in a war setting within the context of ally/enemy and hostile/occupied/gray-zone territories. Ueno Sizko’s “Female Agency” Furthermore, Ueno introduces the female victim’s “agency” as an important factor of intervention in the method of problematizing sexual violence. According to Ueno, agency refers to “an free activeness that is exercised even under constrained conditions by someone who is neither a completely free primary agent without any burdens nor an entirely passive object” (page 40). The concept seems to originate from understanding women as active entities that can enact a survival strategy even under systematic oppression, which is a departure from the [existing] method of understanding women only as passive, subordinate beings in a [man-made] structure. Borrowing Ueno’s expression, we can say that it is to overcome “the difficulty of structure and primary agent.” To put it roughly, there are two main questions to ask while tackling the issue of “comfort women.” The first question is “what is a ‘comfort station’?” and the second, “who are the ‘comfort women’?” Asking the first question reveals the face of the Japanese military, which managed and maintained the sexual exploitation system called “comfort stations.” However, this can leave out the other various agents that existed in the comfort stations. Asking the latter question clearly exposes the “daughters” who were driven out of their families due to poverty, the brokers who deceived them, and the lives lived in these “comfort stations”. This, however, can obscure the sexual violence system of “comfort stations” and the subject that is responsible for this system. This is the dilemma that Ueno suggests: “the difficulty of structure and primary agent.” But Ueno points out that an irony occurs by introducing the concept of agency: “Women were not only the victims of history but also perpetrators as well as accomplices” (page 40). Women can formulate survival strategies under an oppressive structure, but these can lead to recreating that very structure. Ueno argues that due to this dilemma, women’s survival strategies can be a stumbling block in problematizing sexual crimes as well as having the potential to strengthen the ‘victim model.’ Why Call a Sexual Exploiter and a Victim “Partners”? I agree with Ueno’s argument that women should not be regarded only as subordinate to the structure. However, the issue is whether ‘agency’ is functioning as it’s supposed to even in specific analytic situations. Let’s take a look at Ueno Sizko’s text below. “A similar case can be said of the ‘comfort women.’  The Korean ‘comfort women’ who were forced to take Japanese citizenships under Japanese colonization, as Yuha Park (2014) points out, dressed themselves in a Japanese way, used Japanese names, and spoke Japanese. It is unquestionable that they—being the Japanese army’s ‘partners’—also were the subject of hatred and abhorrence to the people whose land was being occupied by the Japanese army. However, the defeat of the Japanese army meant liberation to Korea. It must have been a complicated situation in Korea, after the enemy had been defeated, for Korean ‘comfort women’ or Korean forced laborers and soldiers who were considered ‘partners’ of the Japanese military, even though they were mobilized forcefully.” (page 53) By quoting Yuha Park, Ueno calls “comfort women” who “dressed themselves in a Japanese way, used Japanese names, and spoke Japanese language” the Japanese military’s “partners.” However, even if the survival strategies of the Korean “comfort women” actually took place as Ueno argues, can we see her prescription of calling them “partners” as an accurate analysis showing the “constrained conditions”? To put it simply—whether they’re Korean, Japanese or Chinese, no “comfort women” can be called “partners” of the Japanese military because the “comfort stations” were a sexual exploitation system. If the women are defined as partners, the idea of the sexual exploitation system disappears. This is not an issue of decolonized nationalism but an agenda of feminism. In a “comfort station”, a soldier is the perpetrator and a comfort woman the victim of a sexual exploitation. The Language of Yuha Park and Ueno Sizko and the Language of Japanese Soldiers and Nationalist [Korean] Men Additionally, let’s take a look at the following scene. Ilmyun Kim’s The Emperor’s Army and the Korean Comfort Women (三一書房, 1976) and Jongkuk Lim’s The Comfort Women Chronicles』 (Ilwolseogak, 1981)    [‘Korean ppi[old-fashioned slang for sex workers] are nice because they don’t get diseases. The superiors have Japanese prostitutes and we have Korean ppi. But the superior bastards have been secretly invading our areas.’ Just as it is written above, it is said that Korean comfort women were nice. There were two reasons. One was that some pompous Japanese ppi were cold to mere foot soldiers. The second was that whatever they did, Korean ppi tried their best to prove that they were better than Japanese women. Moreover, as young as they were, they were healthy, honest, and pure-hearted. (…) On the front lines, a mere soldier and a Korean ppi shared some things in common and were like friendly partners.]The text above is an extract from the famous nationalist journalist Jongkuk Lim’s The Comfort Women Chronicles (Ilwolseogak, 1981). Though Jongkuk Lim is listed as the compiler of The Comfort Women Chronicles, this book actually is a translated version of Ilmyun Kim’s The Emperor’s Army and the Korean Comfort Women (天皇の軍隊と朝鮮人慰安婦)(三一書房, 1976). Ilmyun Kim’s writing was an effort to prove the ‘comfort women’ issue by extracting and collecting from the soldiers’ recollections and from literature before the actual research on comfort women took place. (For a translation of the discussion and analysis of the flow of texts of nationalist men on ‘comfort women’, see “Korean ‘comfort women,’ a floating emblem—with a focus on Ilmyun Kim and Jongkuk Lim’s ‘comfort women’ texts pre-1991” by Jieun Lee, Manchuria Research, Manchuria Conference, 2018.) As it is pointed out in Hirai Gazko’s essay included in The Comparative History of War and Rape, the description of “comfort competition” as an attempt to guard the nation’s dignity is entirely from a soldier’s point of view. As it is shown in the scene above, in the midst of no distinction between the voices of a Japanese soldier and a nationalist man, it eroticizes Korean women as “comforting creatures” and calls them the “partners” of Japanese military. What is problematic is that these nationalist men, Ilmyun Kim and Jongkuk Lim, translated the Japanese soldiers’ point of view without a critical mind. The linguistic and ethnic translation of the recollection of the Japanese soldier took place but the gender translation did not. Then what does it mean when the language of Yuha Park and Ueno Sizko and the language of Japanese soldiers and nationalist men are identical? This can mean either the language of Yuha Park-Ueno Sizko has a perspective of empire-man that colonizes women or they failed in developing the language of explaining activeness that functions even under constrained conditions. In order to make a reason for a “gender beyond nationalism,” one must develop a language apart from nationalism.

'Script books' see major surge in sales with popularity of K-dramas,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/640/0000027570?sid=106,"Tue, 09 Aug 2022 16:37:00 +0900","   Script books for ""My Mister"" (2018) [SEGYESA]     Korean bookstores have a new section to add to their aisles — K-drama scripts.    “Script books” of Korean TV series and films are seeing a surge in sales. According to online book retailer Yes24, 58 K-drama scripts have been published as books between January and July this year; a noticeable increase from 14 during the same period in 2020 and 48 in 2021. Sales are also on the rise, seeing a 93.2 percent growth in 2020, 54.5 percent in 2021 and 121 percent in 2022 compared to the previous years. Currently, the best-sellers are parts 1 and 2 of the SBS series “Our Beloved Summer,” which ended in January. The scripts were published as books in February and have sold a combined total of more than 90,000 so far.         A scene from ""Our Beloved Summer"" (2021-22) [SBS]       Script books for ""Our Beloved Summer"" (2021-22) [GIMMYOUNG]     “I wanted to know what [lead actors] Choi Woo-shik and Kim Da-mi read on the script to make the expression they did on screen” and “I bought this to keep my favorite show in my memory,” read reviews on a bookstore website by customers who purchased the script books of “Our Beloved Summer.”     Script books sell for around 20,000 won ($15) per copy, and one show is often broken down into two or more parts.    The script for director Park Chan-wook’s “Decision to Leave,” which hit theaters in late June, is also seeing popularity. Its script book received over 6,000 pre-orders in a day and became Kyobo Bookstore’s overall No. 1 best-seller in the first week of August. Script books for Park’s previous films such as “Thirst” (2009) and “The Handmaiden” (2016) also saw their sales skyrocket four times last week compared to the previous week.         A scene from ""Decision to Leave"" (2022), starring Park Hae-il and Tang Wei. [CJ ENM]       Script book for ""Decision to Leave"" (2022) [EULYOO PUBLISHING CO.]     “One reason could be that more people are dreaming of becoming K-drama writers,” said Kim Min-kyung, senior editor of publishing company Gimmyoung, who planned and edited the script book for “Our Beloved Summer.”      “But most of all, the driving force behind the popularity of script books is fandom culture,” she continued. “Viewers in their teens and 20s love to support and invest in shows that feature their favorite actors or genre, regardless of how successful the series was in terms of ratings. They are willing to splurge. Streaming platform Watcha’s series ‘Semantic Error’ [2022] is a great example [of fandom support.] Fans of a certain actor also tend to think of the script book as part of the star’s merchandise.”      Following this trend, many script books of K-dramas and films from years ago were published this year, and are ranking high on the list of best-sellers. Screenwriter Park Hae-young of JTBC’s hit series “My Liberation Notes” (2022) had her previous work “My Mister,” which aired on tvN in 2018, published as a script book in March. Although it has been four years since the series ended, it is currently the fourth best-selling script book on Yes24.    A scene from ""My Mister"" (2018) starring Lee Sun-kyun and Lee Ji-eun (also known as IU). [TVN]     “It’s been quite sometime after the show, but many people remember ‘My Mister’ as the best K-drama of their lives and say it holds a lot of meaning,” said editor Kang Hyun-ji of Segyesa, which published the series’ script books. “We thought a story this good will be read by many, no matter how much time has passed.” Other “old but gold” examples on Yes24’s best-seller list are the 2001 film “Take Care of My Cat” and the JTBC series “Be Melodramatic’ (2019).      Publishers say they consider factors like the show’s quality, message and entertainment value when deciding which K-drama scripts to turn into books. For instance, SBS’s “Hot Stove League” (2019-20) was selected because it saw high ratings and also contained heartwarming messages for the younger generation. Meanwhile, KBS’s “Youth of May” (2021) did not have a large viewership, but was selected since it was deemed meaningful for dealing with the May 18 Gwangju Democratization of 1980, which saw many casualties and deaths in a fight for democracy against Korea’s military dictatorship at the time.       Script books for ""The Red Sleeve"" (2021-22) are currently the sixth best-selling in the category. [CHEONGEORAM]       A scene from ""The Red Sleeve"" (2021-22) [MBC]     Booklog Company’s CEO Kim Jung-min, who has been consistently publishing works by renowned screenwriter Noh Hee-kyung since 2009, received a commendation from the Minister of Culture, Sports and Tourism last year. She was recognized for pioneering a new field for the publishing industry with K-drama script books, as well as foreign markets by selling publication rights overseas.      CEO Kim was behind the 2009 script book for KBS’s “Worlds Within,” which starred Hyun Bin and Song Hye-kyo. It was the first K-drama script book to be published.      “Before starting a publishing company, I was a K-drama screenwriter hopeful myself,” she said. “I loved Noh’s works and would find her scripts online, then print out each page one by one to read.” However, even she did not expect script books to establish themselves as a popular genre like it has today. “When I first said I wanted to publish the ‘Worlds Within’ script as a book, everyone tried to talk me out of it,” she laughed. “They said, ‘Who would pay to read the script of a series that has already ended?’""    But to this day, the “Worlds Within” script book remains a steady seller, 13 years after the series aired its final episode. Afterward, Kim published script books like tvN’s “Stranger” (2017) and “Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha” (2021) and sold the publication rights to Indonesia, Taiwan, the Philippines and China.      “Korea is the only country where scripts for television series are published as books,” Kim added. “They’re leading the growth of Korean book sales in Japan, Southeast Asia and Russia.”         Script books for ""Our Blues"" (2022) [BOOKLOG COMPANY]       Poster for ""Our Blues"" (2022) [TVN]     On top of the script itself, script books include more features for collectible value, like an interview with writer Noh in the script book for tvN’s “Our Blues” (2022) — a great way for the show’s fans to get a deeper look into what the writer intended for each character and scene.      Booklong Company has been translating K-drama script books and publishing them in foreign countries for the past decade. However, that doesn't stop the popularity of the original Korean versions. The original script books are available for sale via online retailers outside of Korea, including Japan and many English-speaking countries.      It may be the case that those foreign purchasers can read Korean, but according Jeanie Yu-Gin Chang, a Korean-American licensed therapist and influencer specializing in K-dramas, the language barrier does not mean much to loyal fans of the show.    K-drama script books available on Japanese online retailers, in their original Korean versions [SCREEN CAPTURE]     “It [language] doesn’t matter because people will buy them as souvenirs,” said Chang, who is better known as Noona’s Noonchi and shares K-drama analysis with international viewers. “Like K-pop fans, loyal viewers are willing to buy anything related to K-dramas.” “Personally, I’ve seen people around the world ordering ‘Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha’ script books online after the show was a hit,” she continued. “So fans around the world do know about and buy the script books, whether they're available in translated versions or not. In fact, the Korean version is probably most appreciated as a souvenir, since it’s the original language.”  "
COVID-19 reinfections rising in South Korea,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000239098?sid=104,"Fri, 12 Aug 2022 18:08:00 +0900","Hospitalizations, deaths creep upPeople line up to take a COVID-19 test at a testing clinic in Songpa, southern Seoul, on Friday. (Yonhap)COVID-19 reinfections appear to be rising, and the average time until reinfection is getting shorter.According to the Korea Disease Control and Prevention, the number of suspected cases of reinfection in the third week of July recorded 28,966, accounting for 6.5 percent of the cases newly confirmed that week. In the second week of the same month, the share of suspected reinfections was 3.7 percent or 8,895 cases. Suspected reinfection means a positive test more than 90 days since the last infection, regardless of symptoms, or a positive test accompanied by symptoms or following exposure more than 45 days since the last infection.Lim Sook-young, a senior KDCA official, told reporters Tuesday that reinfections becoming more frequent was attributable to multiple factors such as BA.5 replacing earlier omicron subvariants as the dominant COVID-19 virus, waning immunity from prior infection or vaccination.“Our analysis indicates that the more doses you receive, the less likely you are to be reinfected,” she said. “Without vaccination, prior infection alone cannot cut your risk of reinfection.”She said that compared to people who aren’t vaccinated, the risk of reinfection was down by 48 percent for people who completed their primary vaccine series and by 74 percent for people who were boosted with a third dose.Last month South Korea expanded the eligibility for fourth doses to people in their 50s as well as people of all ages with certain clinical vulnerabilities. As of Thursday midnight, 40 percent of people aged 60 years and older have received their fourth doses.The time from one infection until the next infection has also become shorter. In June, the average time between the first infection and reinfection was 229 days. In July it was 154-165 days, according to the KDCA.The KDCA said reinfections were most commonly reported among young people under 18 years of age and people who have never been vaccinated. People younger than 18 comprised 49.2 percent of suspected reinfection cases in July. Of all the cases found here since the beginning of the pandemic, 23.1 percent are in the under-18 age group. Unvaccinated people, who are just 12 percent of the entire population, made up nearly half of July’s suspected reinfection cases.Reinfection with BA.2 following a first infection with BA.1 is suspected to be most common form of reinfection, based on the timing of the positive tests, the KDCA said.Out of all 142,513 suspected reinfection cases to date, 36.5 percent tested positive for the second time when BA.2 was dominating after testing positive initially when the dominant variant was BA.1. This was followed by 23 percent whose positive tests were during delta and BA.2, respectively, and 11.2 percent who had theirs during delta and BA.1.The KDCA warns that clinically vulnerable people face a higher risk of severe illness from reinfection.Infection with earlier omicron subvariants of BA.1 or BA.2 combined with vaccination may offer some protection against reinfection with the more recent BA.4 or BA.5, according to Dr. Jerome Kim, the director general of the International Vaccine Institute based in Seoul. “Infection with BA.1/2 appears to confer some, incomplete protection against BA.4/5 infection and mild disease. Hybrid immunity -- that is, vaccination plus infection -- confers protection against severe disease, hospitalization, and death,” Kim told The Korea Herald.But being hybrid immune will not prevent another infection.“Will prior vaccination plus BA.1 infection protect against the worst manifestations of BA.5? Yes,” he said. “Will it protect you against getting BA.5? No. Can a person infected with BA.5 be reinfected with BA.5? Yes.”The International Vaccine Institute chief added that the data are “very dirty at this point because in many places not all infections are being diagnosed and many are not being reported.”Dr. Kim Woo-joo, infectious disease professor of Korea University, agreed that while repeat infections with COVID-19 were becoming the “new norm,” lack of testing could be holding back surveillance.Over the seven-day period from Aug. 2-8, only 183,327 PCR tests were carried out per day on average. Access to PCR testing is limited to people aged 60 and above. Hospitalizations and deaths, considered “lagging indicators,” are once again on the rise about a month since BA.5’s share of new cases crossed 50 percent.In the first week of August, 324 patients were severely or critically ailing, up by 35.6 percent from the week before. By Thursday afternoon, 40.8 percent of all critical care beds and 60.6 percent of semi-critical care beds were occupied across the country. Over the same week 209 patients died, marking a week-on-week increase of 21.5 percent.By Kim Arin (arin@heraldcorp.com) 		"
[Newsmaker] Sadness overload: the tricky art of ‘sinpa’ tear-jerkers,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000239291?sid=104,"Mon, 22 Aug 2022 16:31:00 +0900","Korean films, dramas often employ overly emotional scenes, plots, which do not always workWhen Netflix‘s “Squid Game” became an international hit last year, Korean critics praised how the show’s emotional aspects helped its success among western audiences. Just a year later, the star-studded “Emergency Declaration,” one of the most anticipated films of 2022, went down in flames, obliterated by fans and critics alike, with criticism directed at its supposed tear-jerking moments. Comparing the differing responses these two received resurfaced a decades-old question: Is “sinpa,” the overly-emotional and dramatic scenes that Korean films and dramas employ, good or bad for the quality and success of a production? “Emergency Declaration” (Showbox)Sinpa sells The use of sinpa is often ridiculed, but box office scores indicate that it clearly sells. “Along with the Gods: The Two Worlds” (2017) and “Ode to My Father” (2014) were both heavily criticized for their sinpa moments, but they are the third and fourth most popular films in Korean box office history. “Miracle in Cell No.7” (2013) was widely bashed by the critics as a cheap comedy wrapped in cliché, a forced tear-jerker with an abundance of plot holes. Yet it is the 11th most successful film ever here. The third act of “Train to Busan” (2016) is notorious for its sinpa moments, particularly the flashback sequence, but the movie hit the 10 million ticket mark in just 19 days, notching the No.20 spot in the nation‘s all-time box-office. It was even more successful domestically than the critically-acclaimed “Parasite” by Bong Joon-ho, although the international success of the latter made it a more lucrative project overall. Despite complaints from some movie-goers for trying too hard to force the audience to cry, movies with sinpa scenes have consistently attracted fans.On the success of “Squid Game,” culture critic Kim Yeong-dae -- famous for his analysis of K-pop and BTS -- praised the show, calling it a classic “Korean drama.” “I think the distinct characteristic of a Korean drama is its description (of the characters and events) in a sinpa way, rather than the ’dry‘ approach in the US or the UK,” he said in a recent interview, explaining how Korean content tends to add color through dramatic and often emotional depictions.Cliche or classic? It dependsWhile sinpa has become the epitome of cliche for Korean films and dramas, the word somewhat ironically means the “new wave.” A century ago, this made sense, as the emotional and dramatic plays and novels during Japanese colonization were considered a new and fresh approach. The modern definition of sinpa is used more critically, often referring to forced plot devices that try to elicit an emotional response from the viewer. For example, the SBS drama “Temptation of Wife” (2008-09) abruptly changes directions at the end as the main antagonist suddenly gets cancer and becomes good. She and the protagonist reconcile, and the show ends with a series of tear-jerking moments around a character who had been nothing short of pure evil just a few episodes ago.Such forced plot points, which serve virtually no purpose to the story other than to make the viewers cry, have been branded as sinpa moments. A sudden incurable disease for the protagonist, the antagonist, family members, or even the comic relief is a go-to way to create sinpa moments. Critic Lee said the problem with sinpa is not that it is overly emotional but that it is excessively formulaic. He described “Train to Busan” as a “not particularly well-made, but attractive” movie, despite its sinpa moments.“The way the movie creates a division between people and depicts the emotions of its characters is too formulaic. It makes the entire movie feel shallow,” he said in his review of the zombie flick. “Miracle in Cell No.7,” is another example of the formulaic use of sinpa. Lee criticized the movie for abusing its characters to create the worst situation possible. “It’s like the character is being pinched over and over again. When you see them pinched, you cry as a knee-jerk reaction. Even though you are crying, you cannot help but wonder if the movie is actually moving you.”Culture critic Kim Heon-sik, who in 2012 published a book about diversity in movies, said that sinpa itself is not a bad thing but can be a problem when it is not used properly. He pointed out that while some may say that removing sinpa will improve movies, it can also help them to appeal to the public. ""Squid Game"" (Netflix)“The general public enjoys content that makes them feel and share their emotions. I wonder if it‘s appropriate to forcibly remove the flow of emotions from movies and dramas,” he wrote in his column.Kim pointed out that recently-popular shows on Netflix usually have some form of sinpa in them. “’Squid Game‘ moves the audience members by showing the desperation of people suffering from debt. The comradery, friendship, compassion and consideration for others are featured heavily,” he said. “Some may say the show will improve without it. But most of the viewing public ruminate on life and the world through these emotions.”Whether sinpa makes or breaks something depends on how you use it. Well-done sinpa moments will likely result in box office success. It goes too far, though, and it may bring the whole production down. By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)		"

What to see in Samcheong-dong galleries this week,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000238073?sid=104,"Sun, 03 Jul 2022 17:31:00 +0900","“Seeing Sensitivity Flare,” by Olafur Eliasson at the PKM Gallery in Seoul (Courtesy of the artist and PKM Gallery)If you want to see new art this week, visit the galleries of Samcheong-dong, a cozy and renowned neighborhood in central Seoul next to the main palace Gyeongbokgung. New works by conceptual artist Olafur Eliasson, who plays with light and color, are on display at PKM Gallery. The gallery has a restaurant where one can grab some coffee or a meal before or after enjoying works. Right next to PKM Gallery is Barakat Contemporary, where the first solo exhibition by Berlin-based Nevin Aladag, who has presented a series of sound sculptures, is being held. Walking downhill, an exhibition by Korean documentary photographer Noh Sun-tag at Hakgojae Gallery explores the concept of the silhouette. Icelandic and Danish artist Eliasson is best known for works that touch on human perception and explore the relationship between people and the environment. His newly created works this year at the solo exhibition at PKM Gallery “Olafur Eliasson: Inside the new blind spots” include watercolor paintings “Feeling Backward” and “Titles Are Desires in Slow Motion.” “(Color) does not exist in itself and only materializes when light bounces off a surface onto our retinas, which shows us that the analysis of colors is, in fact, about the ability to analyze ourselves,” the artist has said, according to PKM Gallery. “The artist did not make it to Seoul this time as he is practicing his own belief to reduce carbon dioxide produced by human activities. He is not traveling overseas this year,” said Park Kyung-mee, who heads the gallery. Running through July 30, the exhibition includes glass installations of “Your Polyamorous Sphere” and “Seeing Sensitivity Flare.” The gallery’s cafe and restaurant, PKM Garden, is located inside the same building. “Session,” at the “Motion Lines” exhibition of Barakat Contemporary in Seoul (Barakat Contemporary)Next to PKM Gallery is Barakat Contemporary where Berlin-based artist Aladag’s first solo exhibition in South Korea, “Motion Lines,” is being held until July 24. The artist, who is a native of Turkey and moved to Germany at a young age, interprets diverse cultural and political codes in a personal way.The three-channel video work “Session” focuses on movements and sounds created by objects. She created the work in 2013 as part of an invitation to the 2013 Sharjah Biennial. Aladag observed how much of the economic workforce and cultural heritage in that society rested on the foundation of Pakistani, Indian, Iraqi, and African migrant communities. The instruments in the video are all traditional instruments of those migrants’ respective cultures, appearing there as social entities representing the city.Aladag’s series of “Social Fabric,” “Jali” and “Pattern Kinship” reference and combine architectural styles, traditional patterns and animal footprints from different cultural origins across geographical boundaries, which are installed on the second floor of the gallery. An installation view of “Shades of Furs” at Hakgojae Gallery in Seoul (Hakgojae Gallery)Just a few minutes by foot from Barakat Contemporary is Hakgojae Gallery, which hosts the first solo exhibition by documentary photographer Noh Sun-tag in 10 years at the commercial gallery. Titled “Shades of Furs,” the photography series was taken against the light to create the vivid image of the silhouette. Noh is widely known for photographs that show contemporary Korean society, most famously the division of the Korean Peninsula. He won the Korean Artist Prize in 2014 hosted by The National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, Korea as the first photographer to win the award. Some 19 photographs by Noh are on display at the gallery while 21 works are available on the online exhibition space “OROOM.” The photographs taken from 2015 to 2022 includes crows and flies in Kigali, Rwanda. The exhibition runs through July 17.		"
‘Too late for vaccines to save North Korea’,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000236867?sid=104,"Tue, 17 May 2022 18:12:00 +0900","At least 34,000 omicron deaths possible in the unvaccinated country, says leading doctorNorth Korean leader Kim Jong-un visits to a local pharmacy in Pyongyang, in this undated photo released by the North's official Korean Central News Agency. (Yonhap)The ongoing wave of omicron infections in North Korea could cause tens of thousands of deaths in the unvaccinated country, according to Dr. Oh Myoung-don, who heads the National Medical Center’s committee for clinical management of emerging infectious diseases. Speaking at a virtual forum organized by Seoul National University’s Institute for Health and Unification Studies on Monday, Oh estimated that the omicron death toll in North Korea could reach around 34,000 at the end of the current wave. He said he arrived at the numbers based on his analysis of an April 15 US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report and other data out of Hong Kong. The US CDC report, which looked at cases that occurred over Hong Kong’s omicron outbreak from Jan. 6 to March 21 this year, noted that the high overall mortality there was mainly driven by deaths among unvaccinated people aged 60 and up.The report said the mortality rate was highest among people in their 80s and older who have never received a vaccine at 1.725 percent -- or 17,250 deaths per million population. Among unvaccinated people in their 60s and 70s, the rate was 0.278 percent and 0.584 percent, respectively. North Korea has 2,409,986 people in their 60s and older who make up 9 percent of its entire population, according to the United Nations’ 2019 statistics, all of whom are probably unvaccinated, Oh pointed out.“Considering that North Korea does not have the kind of advanced health care system that Hong Kong does, death rates could be even higher there,” he said. The outbreak in North Korea is growing rapidly, with about 5 percent of its 26 million population reported having experienced a fever between late April and now. The cumulative estimated count has climbed to 1,483,060 cases and 56 deaths in less than a week since admission of domestic cases on May 12. In the last 24 hours alone, 269,510 cases of “fever” and six associated deaths were newly registered, the North’s official Korean Central News Agency announced Monday. South Korean public health authorities say the official estimates of cases and deaths across North Korea are likely to be vastly undercounted.Lee Sang-won, who is leading the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency’s epidemiological analysis team, on Tuesday suggested a possible underreporting of deaths in North Korea.Speaking to reporters, he said, “Based on announcements so far, North Korea’s rate of deaths per cases is lower than that observed in South Korea, or elsewhere in the world despite a widespread outbreak that appears to be taking place.”Ministry of Health and Welfare spokesperson Son Young-rae pointed out that North Korea’s lack of diagnostics to confirm COVID-19 meant cases without symptoms were going unreported. Citing ministry data, he said “more than half of younger patients with omicron do not exhibit any symptoms.” Son said North Korea’s reliance on the presence of a fever to sift out suspected cases also “leaves large loopholes.” “Only about 1 in 10 omicron patients develop a fever,” he said.He said South Korea’s low case fatality rate of 0.13 percent was a result of “mass testing and high vaccine rate, without which even omicron can prove deadly.”Oh of the National Medical Center said at this point, vaccines “unfortunately, would make a little difference to the situation facing North Korea.” He said the omicron outbreak in North Korea likely began around April 15, weeks before the official announcement. “Even if the vaccines were to arrive now, it would take at least a month for both doses to get to the arms of people and for the full protective effects to kick in,” he said. “By that time, omicron will have already have peaked and done its damage.”Rather, what was more urgently needed were treatments including antivirals and anti-inflammatory drugs to stop people from becoming very sick as well as basic over-the-counter medications like fever reducers, he said.The lack of access to essential medicines may force North Koreans to resort to nonmedical alternatives.North Korea’s state-operated daily Rodong Sinmun on Sunday ran a story about home remedies for COVID-19 symptoms, recommending honey for cough, willow tea leaf for other mild symptoms and ventilating the room for breathlessness.Dr. Paik Soon-young, a virologist at Catholic University of Korea, agreed that the omicron outbreak in North Korea has grown past a size containable through vaccination.“The 300,000-something cases a day now being reported in North Korea is comparable to the 600,000 daily cases logged at the peak of South Korea’s omicron surge in March, seeing that our population is roughly double theirs,” he told The Korea Herald.Paik said North Korea would still need the vaccines to fend off possible second and third waves of infection coming their way. “Easily storable vaccines like Novavax might be better suited for use there than the mRNA types,” he said. Throughout the pandemic North Korea has refused international offers of vaccines and other assistance.In a phone call with The Korea Herald, North Korea-trained physician Dr. Choi Jung-hun said North Korea does not have the cold chain supply or the capacity to monitor adverse events that are necessary to carry out a population-wide vaccine campaign. Similarly, the ruling People Power Party Rep. Tae Young-ho, a former North Korean senior ambassador to the United Kingdom, said in a series of Facebook posts that COVID-19 support to North Korea should be provided in the form of a “full package” to be of meaningful help. “This means not only sufficient amount of vaccine doses to inoculate enough of the population, but the infrastructure to store and deliver them,” he said.

The North held the meeting in Pyongyang, with Kim in attendance wearing a light-blue mask, to discuss the country's ""most serious emergency"" in its antivirus system that had been ""firmly defended"" for over two years, according to the North's official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).  It marked the first time that Kim appeared in public with his face covered in the midst of the pandemic.  North Korean authorities conducted an analysis of samples collected from fever-ridden patients on Sunday in Pyongyang and concluded that they were identical to the omicron BA.2 variant, it reported.North Korean leader Kim Jong-un presides over a politburo meeting of the Workers' Party at the headquarters of the party's Central Committee in Pyongyang on May 12, 2022, on the North's first case of the omicron variant of COVID-19, in this photo taken from the website of the North's official Korean Central News Agency. (For Use Only in the Republic of Korea. No Redistribution) (Yonhap)The KCNA did not mention the number of cases, but multiple patients appear to have been confirmed.  During the session, Kim vowed to overcome the unexpected crisis and ordered officials to carry out the strict lockdown of all cities and counties across the country to completely block out all possibility of the spread of the virus.  Kim then called for tighter vigilance on all fronts along the borders, the sea and air to prevent a security vacuum in the country's national defense.  ""More dangerous enemy of us than the malicious virus are unscientific fear, lack of faith and weak will,"" he was quoted as saying.North Korean leader Kim Jong-un (C, rear) presides over a politburo meeting of the Workers' Party at the headquarters of the party's Central Committee in Pyongyang on May 12, 2022, over the discovery on May 8 of the North's first case of the omicron variant of COVID-19, in this photo taken from the website of the North's official Korean Central News Agency. (For Use Only in the Republic of Korea. No Redistribution) (Yonhap)He added the North will ""surely overcome the current sudden situation"" of the COVID-19 outbreak at all costs as his people have developed awareness and unity through the prolonged struggle against the virus.  Kim also urged officials to carry out the country's economic development plan and construction projects as scheduled despite switching to the maximum prevention system, in an apparent effort to prevent further worsening of its economy.  The North aims to stably manage and prevent the spread of the virus, as well as treat confirmed patients to ""block and terminate the source of the malicious epidemics spread,"" he added.  The political bureau decided to convene the fifth Plenary Meeting of the ruling Workers' Party's eighth Central Committee early next month to review state policies for this year and discuss a ""series of important issues,"" the KCNA said, without further elaboration.  The South Korean government expressed hope the North's virus crisis will be brought under control at an early date.  The unification ministry, which handles inter-Korean affairs, stated a position to push for the provision of support for North Korean people and related inter-Korean cooperation anytime from a humanitarian perspective.  Keen attention is being paid to the potential impact of the formally acknowledged virus outbreak in the impoverished nation with dilapidated health care infrastructure on the regime's reported preparations for another nuclear test.  Some observers here raise the possibility that it will stay away from nuclear testing and other provocations for the time being in order to focus on ramping up antivirus efforts while reaching out to the international community for relevant medical supplies and vaccine assistance.  Asked if the COVID-19 outbreak would affect the North's apparent preparations for a nuclear test, a military official here said, ""That's what we will have to pay close attention to.""  The infection in the North is presumed to be attributable to the movement of massive crowds during national events, like last month's military parade marking the 90th anniversary of the Korean People's Revolutionary Army, a source said.Officials disinfect a bus in Pyongyang amid the coronavirus pandemic, in this undated photo released by the North's official Korean Central News Agency on Feb. 19, 2021.

"As globalization ends, RCEP will help maintain trade order",https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/640/0000024650?sid=101,"Mon, 23 May 2022 19:28:00 +0900","  Export ships docked at a port in Busan. The global trade order has been changing rapidly, leaving Korea, which relies on trade, vulnerable. [YONHAP]     Korea is sailing into uncharted waters as three decades of globalization come to an end and a new era of trade blocs begins in the context of a new Cold War.    The Russia-Ukraine conflict has accelerated the geopolitical fragmentation and national-interest driven protectionist movements, which have fed inflation, which in turn further exacerbates protectionism.      Stuck between China and the United States — its two biggest trading partners — and dependent on exports for 70 percent of its GDP, Korea works to balance interests, hedge its bets and preserve its access to foreign markets. Already cut off from Russia — which was a small but growing opportunity for Korean companies — it is now making sure open economies remain open.      Korea has already been aggressive in its signing of free trade agreements (FTA). It continues to push for more FTAs to minimize disruptions that could occur as the global economy becomes more Balkanized. The next frontier is a series of agreements that are multilateral in nature and not strictly trade agreements.      The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) went into effect earlier this year, and Korea is now seeking to enter the smaller Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the U.S.-led Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF).    Multilaterally speaking    The RCEP went into effect in Korea on Feb. 1.      While the immediate effect of the RCEP is expected to be limited, it is seen cushioning the blow of global economic shifts and marginally increasing opportunities, especially with Asean countries.      The RCEP took eight years of negotiation and has a total of 15 countries signed on: Korea, China, Japan, the Asean 10 — Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam — Australia and New Zealand.      The underlying agreement kicks in over 20 years and will eventually end tariffs on 91.5 percent of products on average.      Asean markets have agreed to lower tariffs on between 91.9 and 94.5 percent of Korea's key export items, including automobiles, steel and petrochemical goods. The current Korea-Asean FTA reduces tariffs on 79 percent to 89 percent of products.        With 15 members, the RCEP is one of the world's biggest multilateral trade pacts.    According to the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the RCEP 15 generate 30.5 percent of the world's GDP, the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA) 28 percent and the EU 17.9 percent.      RCEP members have 2.3 billion people, one-third of the world's population, and intraregional trade between RCEP member countries as of 2019 was $2.3 trillion.      A study by the Korea Institute for International Economic Policy (KIEP) noted that the RCEP will contribute significantly to the region and the world's economy.      It estimated that by 2030, the deal will increase the income of members by 0.6 percent, adding $245 billion annually to regional incomes, and 2.8 million jobs to regional employment.      Trade is expected to grow at 2 to 3 times the rate of income growth.    This is not only because of its economic size but also the high degree of prior integration.      The research institute projects that there will be strong gains in trade and better integration of production lines and therefore increases in productivity.      Since the RCEP went into effect, the world has rapidly changed.      Russia's invasion of Ukraine has forced countries to start picking sides, and the sanctions and countermeasures applied are having a huge impact on the global trade order, already in shambles as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.      In April, the World Trade Organization (WTO) slashed this year's global growth outlook from 4.7 percent to 3 percent citing the Russia-Ukraine war, the pandemic and China's lockdown.      That impact is expected to hit Korea's economic growth.      The Korea Development Institute (KDI) last week revised its growth outlook from 3 percent to 2.8 percent.      While inflation is a major concern, state-run KDI cited the slowing growth of Korea's export, especially in the second half.      ""There is a need to utilize RCEP, which we are already a member of,"" said Kim Kyung-hoon, a Korea International Trade Association (KITA) researcher. ""We also need to join the IPEF and the CPTPP and actively lead in forming a new trade order.""      The researcher stressed that improving the resilience and stability of the supply chain network has become the goal of the government and private companies as risks related to the supply of goods and components have emerged and economic security becomes a top priority.    ""If the reorganization of supply network, especially of technology alliances centered on the U.S., becomes real, there will be a major change in the current supply routes of high-tech intermediate goods,"" Kim said.      Shift in global value chain   The sudden emergence of Covid-19 has sped up the end of globalization as we know it, where some countries have benefited from low cost labor in other countries.    Korea fell into panic when China tightened urea exports, after it banned imports of coal from Australia as ties between Beijing and Canberra deteriorated. China was the biggest importer of Australian coal.    Restrictions on urea, which is extracted from coal, in return disrupted the supply of urea solution, which is essential to diesel-powered vehicles.      Truck transportation was nearly brought to a standstill, while construction and farming were also affected.      ""As we have experienced through the urea solution crisis and the U.S. foreign-produced direct product rule, the role of commerce is becoming more important — the connections between different industrial products,"" said Chang Sang-sik, head of industrial analysis at KITA.      Countries not included in the bloc and left out of the regional value chain are expected to struggle to purchase a steady supply of commodities.      Resilience is now more important than efficiency, and national security is now ahead of corporate profit.      ""As China is changing its role to a major consumer, Vietnam, India and Taiwan are emerging as new centers of production,"" said Ha Keon-hyeong, Shinhan Investment analyst. ""Korea does not have a solid footing as a production center with greenfield investment shrinking and the regional value content less than 6 percent.    ""Korea is one of the top in technology in Asia, so it is likely that the division of labor structure with Asean and India, which has a strong workforce, will be strengthened.""          Strengthening ties with Asean    One of the key benefits of the RCEP is the strengthening of economic ties with Asean countries.        In 1990, the trade exchange between Korea and Asean was $8.2 billion. That trade was $176.6 billion last year. Asean, which only accounted for 8 percent of Korea's total trade now is around 15 percent.      Asean today is Korea's second-largest export market after China.      Last year Korea's exports to Asean totaled $108.9 billion, which is a 22.3 percent year-on-year increase. To China, they were $162.9 billion, up 22.9 percent.      Korea exported $95.8 billion to the United States, up 29.4 percent, and $646 billion to the EU, up 33.9 percent.      China takes 25 percent of all of Korea's exported goods, Asean 17 percent and the United States 15 percent.      Korea imported $138.6 billion of Chinese goods last year, up 27.3 percent, $73.2 billion of U.S. goods, up 27.3 percent, and $67.7 billion of Asean goods, up 23.4 percent.      Korea has been in pursuit of better ties with the Asean countries under the New Southern Policy.      The new policy paradigm, which is not only about economics but also diplomacy and culture, is targeted at increasing the relationship to the level of the neighboring powers — U.S. China, Japan and Russia.            Additional trade deals    Despite protests from Beijing, Korea formally joined the U.S.-led Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF). The IPEF is unlike other multilateral trade pacts.       Its purpose is not the free exchange of goods and services. Instead it is focused on forming a security alliance.      The IPEF has four pillars — fair and resilient trade; supply chain resilience, infrastructure and decarbonization; and tax and anti-corruption.      Keys to IPEF are the steady supply of computer chips and balancing the power of China.    Japan, Australia, New Zealand and Singapore have expressed interest in joining. Membership could expand to Asean countries.    The Korean government has noted that cooperative frameworks such as the IPEF will contribute to the national interest at a time when the global order is changing. It emphasized that the IPEF will help the country in purchasing key components.    It ""could further stimulate the establishment of an early warning system,"" the government noted.      The grouping's formal start is set for November 2023 during the APEC summit.    Korea also wants to join the 11-member CPTPP, which accounts for 12.9 percent of the world's GDP and 15.3 percent of global trade. It has 6.7 percent of the world's population.      Prime Minister Han Duk-soo stressed the need for Korea to join the CPTPP during his confirmation hearing last month.      ""We will be at a disadvantage if we are left out of the multilateral trade agreement,"" said Han, who was involved in the negotiations of the United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement.      ""Until now, the Korean economy has benefited from the global value chain,"" said KDI economist Kim Hyun-wook. ""It was an advantage for companies to expand into emerging countries that provided cheap labor and new markets.    ""We are now in a situation where we have to shift our supply chain to advanced countries with the United States at the center.""    Korea's dependency on trade    Despite efforts to shift to a more domestic-demand driven economy, trade is still vitally important to Korea.      This was clear during the pandemic, when a record $644.5 billion of exports were achieved. Imports were a record $615 billion. Trade contributed to the country's 4.0 percent economic growth in 2021.    Trade today accounts for roughly 70 percent of the nation's GDP, up from 50 percent in 1990, when Korea's market opened up and globalization started.     Korea has become especially dependent on China. Trade with that country grew from 0.9 percent in 1990 to 25 percent today.        Trade with the United States during that period fell to 14.5 percent from 30 percent. In 2011, before the free trade agreement went into effect, that number was 10.7 percent.      According to KITA, Korea's trade with the U.S. has grown from $100.8 billion in 2011, before the FTA was enacted, to $169.1 billion in 2021. Exports grew from $56.2 billion to $95.9 billion.      The U.S. free trade agreement ""led to an increase in the number of jobs in manufacturing and higher wages,"" said Kang Gu-sang, Korea Institute for International Economic Policy researcher,    Since its first FTA was signed in 2004 with Chile, Korea has ratified 17 bilateral and multilateral trade deals with 57 countries, including the one with China, which went into effect in 2015.      A full 78 percent of Korea's trade is with countries with which it has agreements.    "
Foreign capital ownership in Korean Inc. jump 36% to $40 bn over last fi...,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/009/0004958157?sid=004,"Mon, 02 May 2022 15:14:00 +0900"," The count of foreign capital owning 5 percent or more in Korean Inc. fell, while the value of their investment increased over the last five years to $40 billion. According to an analysis conducted by market analysis company Leaders Index on top 500 companies in Korea, the number of foreign asset managers and private equity funds with more than a 5 percent ownership fell 33 percent from 80 companies at the end of 2017 to 53 companies at the end of last year. Their investment value however rose 36.4 percent from 37.27 trillion won ($29.4 billion) to 50.83 trillion won during the same period. “After U.S. hedge fund Elliott’s merger fallout with the two Samsung affiliates in 2015, foreign investors place money in Korean companies for long term rather than for short-term returns,” said an official from Leaders Index. IT service and game names were favored by foreign capital companies with ownership of more than 5 percent in nine companies. Global private fund operator BlackRock Inc. currently holds a 5.05 percent stake in Naver Corp. Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund (PIF), acquired 6.69 percent, or 1,468,845 shares in NCSoft Corp., the label behind the global blockbuster Lineage series, for around 800 billion won this year, raising its stake in NCSoft to 9.3 percent. Tencent owns 17.52 percent of Netmarble Corp., via its subsidiary Han River Investment and 5.92 percent of Kakao through its other subsidiary firm Maximo. Tencent also holds a 13.56 percent stake in Krafton Inc., through Image Frame Investment, another investment holding company.IT and game companies were followed by insurers. Six insurance companies have foreign investment companies that hold more than 5 percent of their shares. Fidelity Investments Inc. currently holds a 10.24 percent stake in DB Insurance and a 7.46 percent stake in Hyundai Marine & Fire Insurance. BlackRock has the largest stake value in the top 500 domestic companies out of all the foreign investment firms, holding a stake value of 33.21 trillion won in six companies as of the end of last year. BlackRock has 5.03 percent stake in Samsung Electronics, 5.05 percent in Naver, 5.12 percent in Samsung SDI, 5.63 percent in Shinhan Financial Group, 6.02 percent in KB Financial Group, and 5.01 percent in Hyundai E&C. Affinity Equity reaped the most profits out of all the foreign investment firms, earning about 5.5 trillion won over the past decade. The firm made a profit of 4.25 trillion won from the sale of OB beer in 2014 and then around 1.2 trillion won for Loen Entertainment, later renamed Kakao M, in 2016. At the time, Affinity’s profit was a whopping 261.4 percent, 10 times higher than the average return of 25 percent for domestic private equity funds.[ⓒ Maeil Business Newspaper & mk.co.kr, All rights reserved]		"

She used to go to the movies once or twice a month before the pandemic. But now, she loves watching TV series, variety shows and films ranging from the latest releases to old favorites on online streaming platforms, like Netflix, at the click of a button from her sofa at home.   She often ends up staying up all night to binge-watch hit content, such as the global sensation ""Squid Game"" (2021), on the platforms. Even during her commute, she never stops watching TV shows from the previous night.   She chooses to wait until films become available on those services rather than visiting movie theaters to watch them. A teaser image of ""Squid Game"" by Netflix (PHOTO NOT FOR SALE) (Yonhap)But in recent weeks, she has dared to break the two-year-old habits, as the South Korean government scrapped most COVID-19 social distancing restrictions, including gathering limits and business hour curfews, from April 18.   ""During the pandemic, I was satisfied with things to do at home, like streaming online content or communicating through social media,"" she said. ""But after distancing rules were lifted and I got an immunity to the virus, I try to go out even for a walk in my spare time rather than turning on the TV.""   Lee is not alone in distancing herself from streaming services and turning her eyes to other enjoyments or returning to old routines.This illustration provided by Yonhap News TV highlights the online streaming market. (PHOTO NOT FOR SALE) (Yonhap)Streamers operating in South Korea, who had enjoyed an increase in the number of subscribers during the pandemic, suffered a decrease in their monthly active users (MAUs) last month from three months earlier upon the lifting of COVID-19 distancing rules.   Industry leader Netflix, which launched its Korean service in 2015, posted 11.5 million MAUs in April, down 7.1 percent from 12.4 million tallied in January, according to data by local market analysis firm IGA Works.   The MAUs of Wavve, the No. 2 homegrown streaming platform run by major broadcasters KBS, MBC and SBS, fell 11.9 percent to 4.3 million over the three-month period, while Tving, the online video-on-demand platform run by CJ ENM, saw its MAUs drop 7.7 percent to 3.9 million in April from three months earlier.   Disney+, the content streaming service from Walt Disney Co. that landed in South Korea in November last year, experienced a 23.7 percent drop in the number of users to 1.5 million from 2 million over the cited period.   Experts attributed the decrease to the ""out of the pandemic phase"" in Korea and said the wind is blowing the other way.   ""A growing number of people left their homes after the lifting of distancing rules,"" said culture critic Ha Jae-keun. ""People have suppressed their thirst for outdoor activities and in-person meetings for about two years.""This file photo taken May 17, 2022, shows a movie theater in central Seoul. (Yonhap)On the other hand, the cinema industry, regarded as one of the biggest victims of the coronavirus, seemed to benefit from the lifting of distancing rules, such as a food ban at indoor theaters and middle-seat vacancy rules.   The number of moviegoers in April rose 11.6 percent to 3.1 million from the previous month, and the combined revenues gained 12.6 percent on-month to 30.4 billion won (US$23.9 million). From a year earlier, April's total attendance jumped 29.2 percent and revenues expanded 21.7 percent.   ""Weeks after the lifting of distancing rules, a growing number of people became free from worrying about virus infection at public places, like movie theaters,"" said Hwang Jae-hyun from CGV, a leading multiplex operator in Korea. ""Theaters will return to normal soon, and people will enjoy the atmosphere of an audience and the smell of popcorn in the air again two years after the pandemic began.""   But experts pointed out that it is too early to say the fast-growing streaming service will be completely pushed out of the limelight after the pandemic comes to an end.   ""The end-of-pandemic will stir up pent-up demand for outdoor activities and bring people back to theaters,"" the culture critic said. ""But it's not easy for people to completely break their recent habits, because TV streaming has become one of the daily routines as the pandemic continued for two years.""In this file photo taken April 25, 2022, moviegoers buy a bucket of popcorn at a movie theater in Jeonju, south of Seoul.

The KCNA did not mention the number of cases, but multiple patients appear to have been confirmed.   During the session, Kim vowed to overcome the unexpected crisis and ordered officials to carry out the strict lockdown of all cities and counties across the country to completely block out all possibility of the spread of the virus.

[Newsmaker] ‘Fake geniuses’ highlight S. Korean elite’s obsession wit...,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000236734?sid=104,"Thu, 12 May 2022 15:15:00 +0900","Practice of equipping high school students with extremely high qualifications in hopes of entering top university is not just popular TV show theme but potential political scandal in KoreaJustice Minister nominee Han Dong-hoon during a National Assembly confirmation hearing on Monday. (Yonhap)How many high school students have their papers published in academic journals? The question has prompted headlines in the South Korean media in recent days, following a political scandal. At the center of the controversy is the daughter of Justice Minister nominee Han Dong-hoon who published five academic papers and four e-books within the space of two months as a high school student. Reminiscent of a case years ago involving the daughter of former Justice Minister Cho Kuk and the family’s efforts to fill her resume with impressive extracurricular activities for college admission, the latest case is provoking soul-searching in a country obsessed with getting a college diploma. What to make of children of influential parents racking up extracurricular credentials seemingly unattainable for ordinary students?“For high school students to so easily publish their papers in international journals like what has been seen in recent years used to be unfathomable,” economics professor Lee Joon-koo of Seoul National University posted on his Facebook on Friday. The post was titled “Where have all the geniuses gone?” in which he called the students “fake geniuses.”“As for me, I did not finish a single decent paper throughout my entire college (student) years.”Criminality has been found only in the case of Cho’s daughter. But questions remain over to what extent the achievements of Han’s daughter have been thanks to help from her parents rather than her own doing. Stellar resumes Professor Lee, who is the author of “Introduction to Economics” and has taught at many local universities, said it was in the early 2000s -- after the country’s college entrance examination system was revised -- that high schoolers who write academic papers while in high school suddenly started to emerge. Questioning why local academia has not made major advancements in the past 20 years and why he has not met anyone exceptionally smart at his university over the years, he branded these highly qualified students “fake geniuses,” a product of the country’s ill-advised education system and parents’ obsession with elite schools. Research led by Kang Tae-young, the head of media company Underscore, and Kang Dong-hyun, a Ph.D. student in the University of Chicago‘s Department of Sociology, seems to support his observation. According to their analysis, between 2001 and 2021, a total of 558 papers were written or co-written by 980 high school students. At least 70 percent of those who published an academic paper while in high school have not done any further research work after graduating from high school. It also found that many of the papers were in computer engineering and medicine, subjects not offered as part of regular secondary education. Critics says the competition to get into top university has produced near-perfect students boasting impeccable records in leadership skills, volunteer work and academic achievements.　South Korea took a major shift in direction to reduce the college entrance system’s reliance on one standardized written exam administered by the state educational authorities in 2001. This resulted in a greater emphasis on an applicant’s resume of extracurricular activities. It was against this backdrop that the business of college admission consulting came to thrive, offering programs designed to help clients get into prestigious universities. Those with an eye on universities in the United States or elsewhere sought the help of former admissions officers and professional consultants specialized in foreign schools. These businesses, some of whom charge hefty sums, have faced criticism that they are designed for the rich to pass on their education and disrupt efforts to achieve equal footing in education. Education authorities have introduced measures in the past to crack down on consulting firms offering ghost writing services.Some have drawn comparisons between this and the case involving the daughter of former Justice Minister Cho.In April, Pusan National University finalized its decision to cancel the admission of Cho’s daughter into its medical school because of forged documents used in her application.One of her first credentials to come into question was a pathology research paper published in an international medical journal. The paper listed Cho’s daughter as the first author despite the study needing ethical review board approval and her being a high school student at the time. The paper was later retracted after the corresponding author admitted the study did not have ethical approval and the co-authors did not make relevant contributions to the study.In a statement on Sunday, groups including Professors for Democracy, called on Han’s nomination as justice minister to be withdrawn over the issues regarding his daughter. It said that some of the papers written by Han’s daughter were published in “predatory journals.” ABC Research Alert and Asian Journal of Humanity, Art and Literature -- two of journals in which Han’s daughter have published papers -- have been flagged by Cabell’s Blacklist, a list of deceptive or predatory journals, according to reporting by local media outlet Newstapa.By publishing in predatory journals, Han’s family has contributed to disrupting the scholarly publishing ecosystem, the groups said in a joint statement. “For years, we saw many high-ranking nominees for public office forced out of their position over unethical research practices or stay in office despite controversies,” they said. Real-life ‘Sky Castle’ A 2019 TV series “Sky Castle” touched upon South Korea’s education craze. The award-winning hit show laid bare the dark side of the country’s obsession with elite schools, featuring wealthy tiger moms who are the wives of doctors and an ex-politician. A Poster for Sky Castle (JTBC)Han Seo-jin, played by actress Yum Jung-ah, is a woman desperate for her daughter to be accepted into Seoul National University’s School of Medicine in hopes of winning the approval of her own mother-in-law. In doing so, Han hires an elite university admissions coordinator whose cut-throat approach to education later backfires.In the show, another family learns that their daughter lied about attending Harvard University for a year and that she had faked admission to the Ivy League school. She confessed that she lied because of pressure from her father.The show entered the political debate over academic credentials this week as a pop culture reference.In a radio interview, Rep. Jang Kyung-tae of the ruling Democratic Party of Korea argued that if former Justice Minister Cho was a real-life Sky Castle case, Justice Minister nominee Han’s daughter was “Ivy Castle,” seemingly referring to Ivy League institutions. He suggested that Han’s daughter, who attends an international school in South Korea, may have written those papers to build her resume that would use when applying for US school admissions later on. 　Sky in the show’s title refers to Seoul National University, Korea University, and Yonsei University -- three of the country’s top universities."

"From no fun to a new beginning, the age 30 gets a facelift",https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/640/0000022289?sid=106,"Wed, 16 Mar 2022 16:14:00 +0900","   From left, female protagonists in their 30s from television series ""My Lovely Sam Soon"" (2005) on MBC, ""Sweet My City"" (2008) on SBS, ""Discovery of Love"" (2014) on KBS and ""Work Later, Drink Now"" (2021) on tvN [MBC, SBS, KBS, TVN]     “I want to be 30! Thirty and flirty and thriving.”    A 13-year-old girl named Jenna Rink sobs inside a closet wishing she would turn 30, firmly believing that she would have everything she had imagined for herself by then. Her wish comes true, and when she opens her eyes, everything she’d dreamed of seems to have magically come true: With a gorgeous body, glamorous boyfriend and a dream career, now 30-year-old Jenna has the world at her feet.    The narrative is from the beginning of the 2004 American romantic comedy film “13 Going on 30” starring Jennifer Garner as the adult Jenna. The film was released in local theaters in November that year.    The next year, a local television series titled “My Lovely Sam Soon” on MBC saw huge success — becoming one of the highest-rated Korean drama series of all time with an average viewership rate of 36.9 percent — with its story describing the romance between a 30-year-old talented pastry chef named Sam-soon and 27-year-old Jin-heon, the son of a wealthy hotelier. The catch here is that the character of Sam-soon is described as a spinster at the age of 30. Although passionate and talented at what she does, everyone around Sam-soon sees her as a plain old, fat woman who is unable to get married even at the age of 30. Even Jin-heon, before he becomes romantically involved with her, describes her as an ajumma [middle-aged woman] and makes fun of her “old” age.    The stark contrast between how the female protagonists of the two productions released within a similar time period feel about the age 30 shows the certain social stigmas attached to the specific demographic: The former describes it as a peak age with plenty of opportunities, while the latter considers it to be the end of their youth and an age at which one should be “settling down” to get married and raise a family of their own.    Of course, turning 30 is a significant milestone in one’s lifetime, and it is largely ubiquitous across the globe: a big transition from the youthful 20-somethings to an age range that society refers to as “adulthood.”    Korean content made in the early 2000s, however, attached a different meaning to the number, specifically in regards to their female characters.       A scene from KBS sitcom series ""Old Miss Diary"" (2004-05) [KBS]     KBS sitcom series “Old Miss Diary,” aired between 2004 and 2005, revolves around the romance of three couples. Like Sam-soon from “My Lovely Sam Soon,” the 30-year-old protagonist Mi-ja is initially described as a “spinster” being pressured to get married, and soon. The “Old Miss” from the title derives from the Konglish (or Korean English) “gold miss,” referring to a single woman in her 30s with a successful career. In another film “How To Keep My Love” from 2004, 29-year-old Hyun-joo awaits in half anticipation and half fear for a marriage proposal from her longtime boyfriend So-hoon, whom she’s dated for seven years. To Hyun-joo, marriage is the only escapeway from her boring and mundane life.    Fast forward to the 2020s, and the marriage bar for women in contemporary society seems to have been somewhat eased, and local content is reflecting the new social phenomenon. Women in female-centered narratives no longer fear the word 30 or dread approaching the age.    An insider from Duo, a top matchmaking agency in Korea, believes that contemporary society has become more lenient toward women’s age in marriage.    “Compared to the 1990s to early 2000s when the norm was for women to get married before 30, or at least within their early 30s, the [acceptable] age range for marriage has widened due to the diversification of social values, economic development and the advancement of technology that broadened the age during which women can give birth,” the Duo insider said. “Within our company, the average age at which one first gets married is 36.7 for men and 33.6 for women, based on our 2021 report.”    According to a 2001 survey done by the company on 1,038 members, when asked at which age they would like to get married, the average response was 28.6 for women and 30.6 for men.    “In our annual report for 2021 regarding the standards for a suitable marriage partner, 51.2 percent of our male users and 64.8 percent of our female users replied ‘there is no suitable age for marriage’ regarding the question of the proper age at which one should get married,” the insider added.    To say that Korean women are completely free of the social pressure to get married, however, is another matter completely.    “My older sister is 29 years old, but my mom thinks that she should at least meet someone this year so she can get married next year,” said a 26-year-old who wished to be only known by her surname Kang. “My mom doesn’t tell her that, though. She only keeps telling me. I think that the older generation still believes that there is a certain age at which women should settle down, but they no longer say it out loud like they did in the past. And my sister is feeling the pressure too.”    Jung, a 31-year-old who wished to only be known by her surname, says she doesn’t want to rush marriage and her parents support her decision.    “My parents want me to get married as late as possible because they believe that there are still social barriers that women face when they get married,” she said. “It’s not that I don’t ever want to get married, but I want to do it when I feel that my situation is stable, when both my mind and body are at peace. And I believe that I don’t necessarily have to get married, because nowadays, there is so much to do in my senior years even if I don’t get married and raise a family of my own. There are so much [recreational activities] that I can do by myself to enjoy my time alone. Once you have your own family, it’s hard to do that because you have to take care of and provide for them.”    In the now-airing “Thirty-Nine” on JTBC starring Son Ye-jin, Jeon Mi-do and Kim Ji-hyun, the three women who are the best of friends, all aged 39, all are single. Romance is still a part of their lives, and their parents might occasionally nudge them to meet someone and get married, but no longer are they stigmatized or branded as a spinster or a gold miss.       A scene from JTBC drama series ""Melodramatic"" (2019) [JTBC]       A scene from tvN drama series ""Search WWW"" (2019) [TVN]     The same goes for other, more recent female-centered narratives such as JTBC’s “Melodramatic” (2019), tvN’s “Search WWW” (2019) and “Work Later, Drink Now” (2021-). The age range of the women appearing in the programs ranges from 30 to 39. The content includes romance, but it does not focus solely on romance; the arena of what the women go through has expanded to the sometimes haphazard areas of their professional life, family and friendships.    Even programs that do specifically target romance — such as television series “Discovery of Love” (2014) on KBS and the film “Nothing Serious” (2021) — no longer portray women whose life goal is to don a white dress and arrive at the marriage alter to say “I do.”       The cast of KBS drama series ""Discovery of Love"" [KBS]       A scene from the film ""Nothing Serious"" [CJ ENM]     “I believe the expansion in these narratives came from the increase in the analysis and the consumption trend of ‘single economy’ — basically, the increase in one-person households,” culture critic Kim Heon-sik said. “The social phenomenon is reflected in cultural content saying that it is not necessary for women, particularly those in their 30s, to get married [merely] because of the social stigma.”    Kim believes that the shift in the social atmosphere was reflected in local content after the “My Lovely Sam Soon” phase ended, such as in SBS drama series “Sweet My City” (2008) and tvN sitcom series “Rude Miss Young Ae” (2007-19). Both series have women crossing over the 30-year threshold, gradually learning to accept their age instead of just conforming to the social norm.       A scene from tvN sitcom series ""Rude Miss Young Ae"" [TVN]     “For instance, in ‘Rude Miss Young Ae,’ the narrative is focused more on her work life, and from then on there were more productions that deal with struggles females deal with in their work. If content used to be dichotomous in the past — solely focused on their work and love — now the diversity in single person’s lifestyle is also reflected in the local content.”  "
Korean Rom-Com Dominates Netflix's Non-English Ratings,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/023/0003682282?sid=104,"Thu, 31 Mar 2022 12:00:00 +0900","Korean series ""A Business Proposal"" claimed the top spot in Netflix's latest weekly viewership chart of non-English TV shows.The romantic comedy, which is based on a web novel of the same name, logged a combined 30.9 million hours of viewing around the world for the week of March 21-27.Six out of the 10 top Netflix shows during the week were Korean dramas, with the other five being ""Twenty-Five Twenty-One"" starring Kim Tae-ri in second place, ""Forecasting Love and Weather"" in fourth place, ""Juvenile Justice"" in seventh place, ""All of Us Are Dead"" in ninth place and ""Thirty-Nine"" in 10th.The global streaming platform compiles viewership data from each country to list the weekly rankings.Bloomberg earlier this month analyzed the Netflix data since June last year to assess viewing trends on the world's leading platform.Korean dramas logged a total of 4.3 billion hours of viewership around the world to rank second after the U.S. with 16.3 billion hours of viewership.

Samsung Electronics amps up marketing for budget devices,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/640/0000022259?sid=105,"Tue, 15 Mar 2022 18:51:00 +0900","  Samsung Electronics is holding an online event on March 17, where the new Galaxy A series will probably be marketed. [SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS]     Samsung Electronics is heavily marketing its lower-end phones as it continues to battle for market share with Apple and the Chinese manufacturers.      The smartphone maker will hold an event for its latest Galaxy A models on Thursday.      This is the second time budget models are being introduced in this way, as ""Unpacked"" events are normally for the company's high-end models, such as Galaxy Notes and Galaxy Flips.    In March 2021, the company introduced the Galaxy A72 and A52, priced at 449 euros ($493) and 429 euros, respectively.      This year, the event ""will center around the Galaxy A33 and Galaxy A53,"" according to a spokesperson for Samsung Electronics.    The Galaxy A33 model will be priced at about 300,000 won ($241), with the A53 model in the 500,000-won range.    The Galaxy A13 and A23, which are already being marketed in the United States, and the Galaxy A73 will also be pitched by the company at the event.    Samsung Electronics offers smartphones in three different price ranges: high-end models, such as Galaxy S and Z devices; mid-range models that appeal to the mass-market; and entry-level models with affordable prices. Among the company's A series devices, those that fall in the higher price range, such as the A53 and A73, are categorized as mid-range models, while the cheaper A13 and Galaxy F models are marketed as entry-level.    In unit volume, the entry-level and mid-range models were 80 percent of the company's phone sales last year, according to analysts.    Counterpoint Research found that 40 percent of smartphones sold in 2021 were 5G, up by 32 percentage points from 2020. The market share is expected to reach 50 percent — 870 million units — this year.    As 5G devices have taken the center stage, major smartphone makers rolled out a number of 5G smartphones at CES 2022 and MWC 2022.    According to Strategic Analysis, Samsung Electronics ranked third in the global 5G smartphone market, with a market share of 14.7 percent, while Apple took the lead with 25.4 percent.    Samsung is in fierce competition with Chinese manufacturers, as Xiaomi ranked second with a 15.6 percent market share. Oppo and Vivo are closely behind Samsung Electronics with 14.4 percent and 11.1 percent, respectively.      ""We will establish a product line-up of 5G smartphones encompassing both mass-market and entry-level models,"" said Kim Sung-koo, vice president of the Samsung Electronics mobile business.    The soon-to-be-introduced mid-range A series could be more important for Samsung Electronics, especially since the company is facing a possible class action suit over an app users claim slowed other apps running in Galaxy S22s.       Leaked Samsung Galaxy A53 designs [PHONEARENA]     While the Galaxy S series and the foldable devices are the most well-known to customers, the mid-range models are what help the company maintain its market presence.    The annual sales target for mid-range Galaxy A53s and A33s is 28 million units and 23 million units, respectively. It is more than the total sales estimate for the Galaxy S22 series (33 million units) and the foldable Galaxy Z series (9.8 million units).    The company plans to sell over 20 million Galaxy A13s.      Samsung Electronics is planning to ramp up affordable 5G options with the goal of expanding its market presence in the mid-range smartphone market.    ""Though Samsung Electronics used to struggle in the mid-to-low tier 5G phone market, it recovered the market share since the second half of last year,"" said an anonymous industry analyst. ""The company will try to expand the market share this year as well, but the competition with Apple's latest iPhone SE and Chinese models is going to get even tougher.""    "

Korea slams EU criticism of missile launches   SEOUL -- North Korea has condemned the European Union's criticism of its series of missile launches last month, calling it an ""intolerable"" act of interfering in its internal affairs.   In a message posted Thursday on the foreign ministry's website, Ri Sang-rim, chairman of the North's Korea-Europe Association, took issue with the EU's recent statement denouncing its missile tests as a threat to international and regional peace and security.  ------------N. Korea in festive mood ahead of late leader's birthday   SEOUL -- North Korea is revving up a festive mood ahead of late leader Kim Jong-il's 80th birthday next week, opening a series of commemorative events, according to Pyongyang's state media Thursday.   Kim, father of current leader Kim Jong-un, led the reclusive regime from 1994 until his death in 2011. His birthday, which falls on Feb. 16, is marked as a major national holiday in the North.  ------------N. Korean leader calls for development of construction sector    SEOUL -- North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has ordered officials to address urgent defects in the field of construction, stressing its importance in building a strong country and improving people's lives, according to Pyongyang's state media Wednesday.    In a letter sent to participants of a construction workshop held in Pyongyang the previous day, Kim pointed out mistakes made in the field, and said it was the right time for them to ""rearm"" with the ruling party's ideologies and policies, the North's official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported.   ------------Senior N. Korean diplomat holds talks with Russian ambassador   SEOUL -- A senior North Korean diplomat met with the Russian ambassador to Pyongyang earlier this week to discuss bilateral ties and regional and global issues, according to the North's foreign ministry, amid speculation that the two countries may be seeking to restart cross-border exchange.   Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Im Chon-il held talks with Ambassador Alexander Matsegora on Monday, the North's foreign ministry said in a post Tuesday on its website.  ------------(LEAD) N.K. official, known for 2018 cross-border thaw, appears to be leading overseas Korean issues   SEOUL -- A North Korean official, known for his role in inter-Korean engagement years ago, has emerged as an apparent policymaker on overseas ethnic Korean affairs, Pyongyang's state media showed Tuesday, raising questions over a potential shift in his job.   Maeng Kyong-il led a debate on legislating an act aimed at enhancing rights of ethnic Koreans abroad during a session of the Supreme People's Assembly (SPA), the North's rubber-stamp parliament, earlier this week, according to the North's main newspaper, Rodong Sinmun.  ------------(3rd LD) N. Korea convenes key parliamentary meeting without leader Kim's attendance  SEOUL -- North Korea had a two-day session of its rubber-stamp legislature earlier this week to discuss budgetary and other pending issues, with the country's leader Kim Jong-un not present, according to its state media Tuesday.  The sixth session of the 14th Supreme People's Assembly (SPA) was held in Pyongyang on Sunday and Monday, attended by senior ruling party and Cabinet officials, the North's official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported.  ------------N. Korea calls for party loyalty on military founding anniversary   SEOUL -- North Korea on Tuesday urged absolute loyalty to the ruling party, calling its leadership a ""lifeline"" for the country's armed forces in a public message issued to mark the 74th anniversary of the military's founding.   In an editorial, the North's main newspaper, the Rodong Sinmun, stressed that the Korean People's Army (KPA) should serve as the ""first death-defying force"" to defend the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea headed by leader Kim Jong-un.  ------------N. Korea denies cyberattack allegations, slams U.S. as 'hacking empire'   SEOUL -- North Korea has denied allegations it has carried out a series of cryptocurrency thefts and cyberattacks on other countries, calling them a ""creation"" by the United States. It also denounced the U.S. as a ""hacking empire and country of intelligence theft.""   The North made the claim in a piece posted on the country's foreign ministry website Monday, following a recent report by U.S. blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis that said North Korean hackers stole around US$400 million worth of cryptocurrency through cyberattacks in 2021.  ------------N. Korea marks 6th anniv. of Kwangmyongsong-4 satellite launch   SEOUL -- North Korea on Monday celebrated the sixth anniversary of what it claims to be a major satellite launch, its state media said, highlighting Pyongyang's resolve for the ""conquest of space.""   The commemoration of the 2016 Kwangmyongsong-4 satellite launch came amid concerns that the North could conduct provocative acts, such as a long-range rocket test disguised as a satellite launch, following its veiled threat last month to lift a moratorium on nuclear and long-range missile tests.(END)"
"[INTERVIEW] Rsquare's data will not only find you an office, but decorat...",https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/640/0000021353?sid=101,"Wed, 16 Feb 2022 18:34:00 +0900","  Lee Johnwoo, CEO of Rsquare [PARK SANG-MOON]    From BTS agency HYBE to IT giant Naver, some 30,000 small and large size companies in Korea have found their office spaces through Rsquare, a proptech service which specializes in commercial real estate brokerage.    Its service relies on more than 150,000 commercial property data entries that it has collected in Korea, including from Jeju Island, and through data analysis not only on the properties themselves but also on the neighborhoods they are located in as well as other factors, Rsquare finds the perfect spot for its clients.     Rsquare started its business in 2014 brokering office spaces, but now it handles logistics centers, retail stores, hotels and more.    Its business scope has also expanded from brokerage services to consulting for sales and purchases, interiors and furnishing.      The company turned to profit in 2017 with sales reaching 16.5 billion won ($13.8 million). Within less than five years, sales have increased by nearly eightfold. Last year, its sales reached 120 billion won despite depressed market conditions due to Covid-19.    “The utmost important asset of Rsquare is the amount and the quality of data on commercial property,” said Lee Johnwoo, CEO of Rsquare in a recent interview with the Korea JoongAng Daily.      “Before, information about commercial properties was scattered all around and was unorganized. There was serious asymmetry in information. Rsquare’s service ultimately aims to provide solutions to that with transparent and digitized data.”    Lee, a Sogang University graduate, started his career at U.S.-based consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton in 2006 and worked there for six years.      He joined Real Estate Direct, a company behind Rsquare, in 2009 and pivoted it in 2012 after taking it over.      Lee launched the Rsquare service in 2014.      So far, Rsquare has attracted 114 billion won from a number of investors including SoftBank Ventures Asia and Z Venture Capital.       Below is an edited excerpt of the interview.      Rsquare’s map-based database showing more than 1,900 vacant offices in Vietnam. [RSQUARE]            Q : Even though Rsquare is a proptech company, the initial stage of the preparation process seems very analogue. Can you explain more about it?     A : When we first jumped into the market, there wasn’t organized information about commercial properties. Collecting data and putting it on the platform was the first thing we did. We formed a group of 10 or so during the weekend to take tours of a certain area. We took a KTX to a suburban area and did a lot of leg work to check each building and its vacancies and what kind of facilities were around it. At the time, even maps provided different information. We put together 10 maps and checked if there were any buildings we had missed. Now, our database covers every nook and cranny of the country including Jeju Island. The data collecting process has become somewhat easier now since updating and fixing information on existing buildings recorded on the database is much simpler.      Q : What brought to you into the commercial real estate brokerage industry?   A : It all started from a simple thought that I should start a business since people’s lives have grown longer and the concept of a lifetime job has become obsolete. I stepped into this market because real estate is something that will not disappear even after a long time. In particular, the commercial property market, which mostly focuses on the B2B format, doesn’t have that much volatility compared to the B2C market. There is no one-hit-wonder type of trend, rather it is constant.       Q : What is the most important technology Rsquare uses?   A : There are two types that we consider the most important. The first is to collect data and transfer it to online. Real estate has long been focused on the offline market. There is qualitative information that was exclusive to the offline market such as the topographical information that such location is ill-fated or good-fated, or what kind of personality the building owner has, the property’s context and its history and all that stuff. Putting all this sporadic information onto the database is one thing. The second thing is factoring out meaningful information and value from that database. Through machine learning, we sort out information that could be useful to the clients in making their decisions. We are also trying to upgrade the visuals of our data such as the quality of the maps and the available office spaces.     Q : Have you seen any trends in clients’ search for office spaces?   A : For IT-related companies, they definitely want to have their offices in the Gangnam area and I think it is because of the infrastructure and supply of human resources. Even traditional retail companies, which used to prefer areas nearby Myeong-dong, as seen in Lotte Department Store and Shinsegae Department Store, now want to find a new office in Gangnam if there is an ‘e-commerce’ factor added to it. Car companies or startups that specialize in self-driving technology also prefer the Gangnam area. For fashion and trend-related companies, they prefer neighborhoods like Seongsu-dong in eastern Seoul.     Q : Rsquare started with office space rental brokerage service but has now formed a comprehensive platform where it takes charge of the spaces’ interior, furnishing and even mediating sales and purchases of the building. How was that possible?   A : Business ideas started from the demands of the clients. They were satisfied with the initial service and then inquired whether we knew or could connect to interior companies or furnishing companies that they can trust. We concluded it would be more efficient for us to start the business and it all started organically. We were able to benefit from the client base we collected from the brokerage service because for the interior business, for example, it is hard to find which company is in need of a new interior. There is demand but it’s hard to find them. We have that database so it’s easier for us to find the customers. For interior, we have our in-house team. More than 50 percent of the interior customers end up coming back to us.       Q : Do you have plans for a separate business model for the data exclusively?   A : We do. We plan on offering data analytics business to the clients, although it should take some time. We acknowledged that an objective set of data is needed when making decisions for commercial buildings, such as sales or purchases, because often, a lot of stakeholders are involved. At the moment, there is no such organized set of data that analyzes the information they need at once. It is scattered around. We plan on offering analyzed data that is valuable enough to aid their decision making process. It is like an advanced version of real estate consulting.       Q : Rsquare established its Vietnam office last year and Singapore office this year. Why did you decide to advance into Southeast Asian countries?   A : The Southeast Asian region was attractive because first the market was big but there was no transparent system for commercial property transactions whereas most Western countries have already set up systems and there is a lot of competition. Southeast Asian countries still lack infrastructure and we wanted to resolve that. Also, there were already a lot of Korean companies doing business in Vietnam so it was easier for us to secure the initial clients. We want to focus on five Southeast Asian countries first and maybe advance into Australia in later.       Q : Rsquare raised $72 million last year in its Series C funding from Stic Investments. How do you plan on using the new fund?   A : We are planning on putting a lot of the new fund into hiring qualified developers. There are about 60 developers at the company and we plan to expand that to 120 this year. We already hired 100 new employees this year. It is our priority. They will be at the forefront of upgrading our services and finding solutions that can make our data profitable.       Q : How do you evaluate Korea’s proptech market?   A : I think it has competitiveness and is developing at a fast pace. No other countries have enthusiasm about the real estate market like Korea. If there is interest, new business models are destined to be formed. And also, Korea already has enough internet technology to realize such businesses. If one should think that Korea’s proptech market is still slow-paced, I think it is because there is less demand for certain types of technology that is only needed in big countries like the United States. If it takes hours to go from one property to another, virtual reality-based visuals of the property would come in handy. But in Korea, everything is so near that such service is not needed as much.    "
Moon interview-full text-1,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/001/0012972898?sid=104,"Thu, 10 Feb 2022 10:31:00 +0900","Full text of interview with Moon   SEOUL, Feb. 10 (Yonhap) -- The following is the first part of an unofficial translation of President Moon Jae-in's joint written interview with Yonhap News Agency and seven other global news agencies: AFP, AP, EFE, Kyodo, Reuters, Tass and Xinhua. QUESTION 1: Your approval ratings remain higher than your predecessors' in the last months in office. What do you attribute this to? What are the most significant achievements or accomplishments that you feel deserve praise? Is there any particular policy in your mind that you'd like an incoming President to carry on and further develop? Conversely, with what area are you the least satisfied? Would you tell us your most memorable experience? (Yonhap, TASS)ANSWER: I am deeply grateful to the people for their support. Having started without the benefit of a transition period amid the confusion caused by a presidential impeachment, my Administration has come this far after having weathered a myriad of crises, including the North Korean nuclear crisis, Japan's export restrictions, rapid changes to the global economic order and the COVID-19 pandemic. Our people tend to band together more closely in the face of adversity. Thanks to them, the Republic of Korea has emerged as an exemplary country for overcoming crises and has actually moved toward becoming a pacesetting nation by turning crises into opportunities.   My Administration has been doing everything possible to surmount crises and has never stopped taking on challenges for the country's future. We have put personal interests aside and given our undivided attention to running state affairs, and I believe the people have seen this in a positive light. I am grateful to our people.   Amid crises, our national power and international standing have been significantly elevated, and I hope these facts are recognized as our achievements. The Republic of Korea has become one of the world's top 10 nations based on comprehensive considerations, including the economy, national defense, foreign affairs, culture, healthcare and medical services. Korea has become the only country to be raised from the status of a developing to advanced nation since the end of World War II. My Administration ushered in the era of US$30,000 in per capita income, which exceeded US$35,000 last year. As a post-World War II newly independent country, Korea rose from the ruins of war and has successfully achieved industrialization, democratization and informatization. Subsequently, we have become a country at the very forefront of innovation and culture as well. Korea has come to be hailed by the international community as one of the most successful nations over the past 70 years. I take immense pride in the astounding national accomplishments achieved together with our people.    National tasks that will determine the future of the country should be carried on by the next administration regardless of its governing philosophy.   First, the national development strategy to achieve a great digital and green transformation as well as balanced regional development through the Korean New Deal is the way to move closer to becoming a leading nation in the post-COVID-19 era.   Second, we have to take the initiative in pioneering the age of carbon neutrality. It constitutes the fulfillment of responsibility for a sustainable human community and also an unavoidable path to actively respond to changes in the international trade order. We have to identify opportunities for new growth and leap forward in that cause.   Third, efforts to bring the Korean Peninsula situation under control and institutionalize peace should never cease. To us, peace equals the economy. It's a way of expanding the scope of our economy to embrace the continent. It can also instill our young people with the dream of our ancient Goguryeo Kingdom.    Since the COVID-19 crisis has occupied nearly half of my term, many people have been struggling for an extended period. This is more regrettable than anything else.     When it comes to government policies, having been unable to stabilize housing prices remains the most painful part. Regarding individual events, what is truly regrettable is the fact that the second North Korea-U.S. summit in Hanoi bore no fruit. Had the Hanoi summit succeeded, North Korea-U.S. and inter-Korean relations would have seen a sea change along with the denuclearization of North Korea.QUESTION 2: Talks among the two Koreas and the United States have reached an impasse toward the end of your term and have made hardly any progress. What do you see as the reason? The ""Hanoi No Deal"" seems to have been the critical moment. In hindsight, what do you think you could have done differently to improve the chances of a nuclear settlement at that time? (Yonhap, Reuters)ANSWER: The ""Hanoi No Deal"" brought North Korea-U.S. talks and inter-Korean dialogue – both of which had been on an upswing until then – to a halt and caused a long stalemate. This is truly a lasting regret. It is a herculean task to put an end to a hostile and confrontational relationship that has formed over a long period of more than 70 years and establish a new order of peace.   However, we cannot afford to give up this task. Complete denuclearization and the establishment of a peace regime on the Korean Peninsula as well as security guarantees for North Korea and the normalization of North Korea-U.S. relations were agreed to in the Singapore Statement, the result of the first-ever North Korea-U.S. summit. We have to continue to work together to achieve these common goals.   It would have been best if a ""big deal"" had been reached at the Hanoi Summit. If that was too hard, however, I think a ""small deal"" should have been sought to take a phased approach. It is very regrettable that the summit ended in ""no deal"" when the continuation of dialogue should have been ensured at least. Still now, if they learn from that experience and put their heads together to discuss mutually acceptable, realistic measures anchored in the Singapore Statement, I believe there will be ample opportunities to find a solution.   At the ROK-U.S. summit last year, President Biden and I reached agreement on the direction of North Korea policy – a phased and practical approach and a solution through dialogue and diplomacy. I suggested the discussion of an end-of-war declaration as part of the process to end hostile relations, build a more solid trust and move toward denuclearization and a peace treaty. If North Korea and the United States come to the table for talks and negotiations again, I expect that a more advanced result will be produced.QUESTION 3: North Korea has recently renewed armed provocations. Many say that inter-Korean relations have regressed back to where they were five years ago. Mr. President, do you also see this as a policy failure? If not, how would you refute such analysis? Conversely, what would you say is your greatest legacy in terms of diplomatic initiatives for peace on the Korean Peninsula? (EFE, AP, AFP)ANSWER: The Korean people and the international community are very concerned about North Korea's recent military action. I, too, am taking the current situation on the Korean Peninsula seriously. However, I'd like you to reflect on the touch-and-go crisis that could have escalated into war on the Korean Peninsula five years ago when the North conducted a nuclear test and launched intercontinental ballistic missiles. The dramatic beginning of inter-Korean and North Korea-U.S. talks amid such a crisis drove away the dark clouds of war cast over the Peninsula in one fell swoop, helping to maintain peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula up to the present. I think such talks, in themselves, are big achievements. Arranging the first historic North Korea-U.S. summit as well as the three rounds of inter-Korean summits are also great accomplishments. Moreover, I became the first Republic of Korea president to address 150,000 Pyeongyang citizens gathered at the Rungrado Stadium in the North Korean capital. I'd like this to be considered the most impressive scene so far in inter-Korean relations.     During my five-year term, I have been looking for a way to overcome the escalating crisis of war and move toward peace. What I regard as most rewarding is that I have helped shift the direction toward dialogue and diplomacy rather than military confrontation. If the dialogue and diplomatic efforts that the two Koreas and the United States have jointly engaged come to fruition in the form of denuclearization and the establishment of permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula, that will become an undeniably historic feat for all parties – the governments of South and North Korea as well as the United States.   If North Korea's series of missile launches goes as far as scrapping a moratorium on long-range missile tests, the Korean Peninsula may instantly fall back into the state of crisis we faced five years ago. Preventing such a crisis through persistent dialogue and diplomacy will be the task that political leaders in the countries concerned must fulfill together.QUESTION 4: Do you expect that an inter-Korean summit is likely to be held before the end of your term? If a face-to-face meeting is too difficult, is there a chance of pursuing a virtual summit instead? What do you see as a prerequisite for inter-Korean talks to resume? (Yonhap)ANSWER: As long as there is willingness to engage in dialogue, whether the summit will be held face-to-face or virtual does not matter. Whatever method North Korea wants will be acceptable. Also, it is not desirable to place prerequisites for dialogue. I believe that it would be beneficial to discuss even such prerequisites at a negotiating table.    I don't think there should be prerequisites for a summit. However, my time will run out shortly, and the timing of the incoming presidential election and its result may make it inappropriate to hold an inter-Korean summit.QUESTION 5: It is believed but not confirmed that a hotline connecting you and Kim Jong Un is in operation. Has it ever been used? If not, have exchanges of personal letters and other forms of communication frequently occurred? Will it be possible to see any progress with an end-of-war declaration? What cards do you think can be used to elicit a declaration to end the Korean War? Recently, there has been an attempt to start a conversation with North Korea by providing more than 60 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines. Do you think such an effort has potential? (Yonhap)ANSWER: Chairman Kim Jong Un and I met several times and have spoken together at great length, thereby building mutual trust through close communication. Even when we have not been able to meet, necessary communication has continued. I hope the extensive efforts that Chairman Kim and I have made together will be brought to a successful conclusion. I look forward to the endeavors made thus far leading to the greatest possible outcome and efforts for dialogue continuing under the next administration.    An end-of-war declaration is useful since it signifies a process to promote mutual trust and a move toward denuclearization and the institutionalization of peace on the Korean Peninsula while putting an end to hostile relations. As a matter of fact, the two Koreas have agreed to ""end the war"" on several occasions, and North Korea and the United States also agreed to build a lasting and stable peace regime on the Korean Peninsula in the Singapore Joint Statement. In addition, the Republic of Korea and the United States have now concurred on the wording of an end-of-war declaration to be presented to North Korea. Even China supports this declaration. It would be too physically demanding to reach a declaration to end the Korean War before the end of my term. However, I would at least like to make conditions ripe for an end-of-war declaration and pass that on to the next administration. QUESTION 6: What kind of relations do you think the next Korean administration should establish with the United States and neighboring countries like Japan, Russia and China? What is your take on reviving the format of the six-party talks? (AP, TASS, AFP) Under what conditions would it be possible for Korea and Russia to reach an agreement to mutually recognize vaccine certificates? Given that some Russian-developed vaccines are already being manufactured in Korea, can we expect that the Korean Government will approve Russian vaccines in 2022? (TASS)ANSWER: My Administration has been doing everything possible in its capacity to contribute to peace, stability and prosperity in Northeast Asia by implementing a peace process on the Korean Peninsula. Cooperation with neighboring countries, based on the ROK-U.S. alliance, has also been strengthened. I expect the next administration will continue such efforts as well. Moreover, I believe that strategic cooperation should be further developed while working more closely together with those countries concerned from the perspective of national interests and reciprocity.   Since last May when U.S. President Biden and I held a summit, the ROK-U.S. alliance has been evolving into a comprehensive global alliance that encompasses economic issues, going beyond a security alliance. In anticipation of the next administration further advancing the ROK-U.S. alliance on the foundation of shared values between the two countries, I am confident that the Biden Administration will become our unwavering partner.   In the early days of my Administration, fraught relations with China were put back on the right track, and bilateral ties have since been advanced. In particular, this year marks the 30th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries. I think communication plays a crucial role in bilateral relations. We should continue to push for a forward-looking, mature strategic partnership while further revitalizing exchanges and cooperation in wide-ranging areas.   Japan is Korea's close neighbor. My Administration has been working hard to carry Korea-Japan relations forward in a stable manner by taking an approach that separates history-related issues between the two countries from substantive bilateral cooperation. This will also remain as a difficult task under the next administration, but I believe diplomatic efforts to solve pending issues should continue on the basis of a public consensus while steadily advancing future-oriented bilateral cooperation.   Russia is Korea's partner in promoting peace and prosperity in Eurasia and, at the same time, a key partner cooperating in Korea's New Northern Policy. In 2020, on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the establishment of our diplomatic relations, Korea and Russia agreed to give concrete substance to our bilateral cooperative partnership. This partnership should be advanced further and stable cooperation and exchanges continuously bolstered with the objective of opening an era when annual trade breaks US$30 billion and people-to-people exchanges top one million.   In order to resolve Korean Peninsula issues, the Korean Government has worked closely with the United States and is cooperating with neighboring countries like China, Russia and Japan through close communication. While focusing on ROK-U.S. coordination and diplomatic efforts for the resumption of talks between the United States and North Korea – if dialogue resumes and makes progress – it will also be possible to envision ways to conduct multilateral consultations.   When it comes to Korea and Russia mutually recognizing COVID-19 vaccination certificates, we are reviewing it by comprehensively considering – for example – the need for exchanges, COVID-19 risk assessments, the impact on domestic epidemic prevention and control and the ease of mutual recognition of each nation's vaccines. Currently, no application for the approval of a Russian vaccine has been filed with the relevant drug agency in Korea. Once such an application is received, the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety will carefully review the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine and decide whether to approve it.(END)"
[Subway Stories] Apgujeong is making a comeback,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000234982?sid=104,"Thu, 03 Mar 2022 10:31:00 +0900","Seoul’s own Beverly Hills had once lost its luster, then the pandemic brought luxury backThe following is part of Seoul Subway Stories, a newly launched Korea Herald series exploring the subway stations and surrounding areas across the city. – Ed. The offline store of online-based luxury goods platform Must It, which opened in December last year, in Apgujeong-dong, Seoul. (Must It)(The Korea Herald)For the past 40 years, Apgujeong, the Beverly Hills of Seoul, has seen the rise and fall of its commercial corridors that have been leading trends in high fashion, fine dining and even plastic surgery in the country. Changes in consumer behavior caused by the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic is giving fresh impetus to the district, which enjoyed its status as the unrivaled hub of fashion and trends from the early 1990s to mid-2000s until shopping moved online. As the pandemic gloom sparks a craving for luxury goods in what many experts describe as “revenge consumption,” the commercial district near Apgujeong Station on Subway Line No. 3 is making a comeback as a mecca of luxury in South Korea. Last year, the area recorded the country’s highest daily sales average of 13.6 billion won ($11.3 million), according to an analysis by Geovision, a big data platform backed by SK Telecom. “Luxury stores, high-end restaurants, beauty stores and hospitals are concentrated in the commercial district around Apgujeong Station. It has become a beneficiary area of the phenomenon of advanced domestic consumption due to the coronavirus,” the Geovision research team said.It was the first time that the area came in first place in nearly 10 years since 2012 when the telecom firm began to collect and release the data. Real estate agents in the area also feel that rejuvenation is underway. “We are running out of real estate inventories to meet demand for new restaurants,” said a realtor at Hansung Real Estate Agency located on Apgujeong Rodeo Street.Because of the recent emerging demand, tenants are now required to pay a premium -- amounting to some 200 million won or more -- to landlords, said the realtor who declined to be named. This is in stark contrast to the mass exodus of shops, especially fashion brands, from the street several years earlier, due to huge store operating costs and explosive growth of online shopping. Banking on the symbolism that Apgujeong holds as a high-end fashion mecca, online-based luxury goods platforms like Must It and fashion shopping site Musinsa have opened their offline stores in the area. The offline store of online-based luxury goods platform Must It, which opened in December last year, in Apgujeong-dong, Seoul. (Must It)“Apgujeong is the area that pops up in everyone’s mind when they think of luxury brand items,” said Park Ju-won, a brand marketing manager at Must It. “We tried to maximize the strengths of Must It’s online platform by opening a store that pushes the boundary of traditional distribution channels,” she said, adding that the offline store offers a one-stop service to customers with a wide range of products from various brands. To be correct, the commercial area widely referred to as Apgujeong is spread out across multiple subway stations, including Apgujeong on Line No. 3, Cheongdam on Line No. 7 and Apgujeong Rodeo on the relatively new Suin-Bundang line. Unlike other shopping districts which were typically formed within walking distance of subway stations, Apgujeong’s commercial corridors are split into three distinct clusters where most people get around by car. Small retail shops and plastic surgery hospitals are gathered around Apgujeong Station. The area nearby Apgujeong Rodeo Station is lined with famous restaurants and coffee shops. Cheongdam-dong luxury fashion street is lined with flagship stores of prestigious fashion brands such as Saint Laurent, Dolce & Gabbana, Louis Vuitton, Fendi, Gucci and Prada.Apgujeong’s commercial corridors encompass not only those around Apgujeong Station but retail shops near Apgujeong Rodeo Station, which was opened in 2012, that stretches out from the iconic Galleria Department Store building. (The Korea Herald)(The Korea Herald)The links between Apgujeong and luxury fashion dates back to the 1980s. Apgujeong Station commenced operation in 1985 on the heels of the rapid property development in Apgujeong-dong and Cheongdam-dong, now the richest neighborhoods in Gangnam-gu.In search for new wealthy customers, fashion designers flocked to the district to open their boutiques, leaving the former mecca of fashion Myeong-dong. Apgujeong’s distinct identity was formed in the early 1990s as a birth place of the youth cultural phenomenon known as the “orange tribe,” named after the color of the subway line that leads to the district. The orange tribe refers to 20-somethings who enjoyed an extravagant lifestyle and studied abroad thanks to their affluent parents. Flaunting their posh foreign cars and high-end fashion labels, the group, and the area, came as a culture shock for many of the older generation who were taught that frugality is a virtue. Lee Eun-doe, 49, remembers Apgujeong Station as a meeting spot with her friends before heading to a cafe in Apgujeong Rodeo Street for a cup of coffee that cost over 10,000 won, more than double the average price in 2021. “Price didn’t matter much. That was the hippest place ever back in the 90s,” she said.		"
USFK chief-base visit,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/001/0012967654?sid=104,"Tue, 08 Feb 2022 15:54:00 +0900","USFK chief LaCamera visits air base with precision bombs By Song Sang-ho and Kang Yoon-seung   SEOUL, Feb. 8 (Yonhap) -- U.S. Forces Korea (USFK) chief Gen. Paul LaCamera visited an American air unit equipped with high-end guided bombs last week to ensure ""fight-tonight"" readiness, his office said Tuesday, amid tensions caused by recent North Korean missile launches.   In a Facebook post, the USFK showed a series of photos depicting him looking at a set of formidable weapons systems, like the Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs), during his visit to the 8th Fighter Wing at Kunsan Air Base in the western city of Gunsan on Friday.   The apparent show of American military heft came as Pyongyang has carried out a series of missile launches, including the test-firing of what it called an intermediate- and long-range ballistic missile on Jan. 30.   ""They visit (the unit) to ensure our formations remain disciplined, focused and maintain a high level of 'fight tonight' readiness so we can fulfill our obligation to protect and defend the Republic of Korea against any threat or adversary,"" the USFK wrote on Facebook.U.S. Forces Korea (USFK) chief Gen.

(PHOTO NOT FOR SALE) (Yonhap)Though the USFK said the commander ""routinely"" visits such U.S. installations in South Korea, his trip apparently served as a message of deterrence against potential North Korean provocations, observers said.   In yet another display of American airpower, a U.S. Air Force photo, posted on the Defense Visual Information Distribution Service, showed a KC-135 aerial refueling plane engaging in a training session near Osan Air Base in Pyeongtaek, 70 kilometers south of Seoul, last Wednesday.   An aerial tanker is required for longer-distance military operations in a potential contingency on the Korean Peninsula.   Speculation has lingered that the North could stage yet another show of force, including an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) launch, particularly in time for its key political events -- the 80th birthday of current North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's late father, Kim Jong-il, on Feb. 16 and the 110th birthday of his late grandfather Kim Il-sung on April 15.   On Monday, Beyond Parallel, a project of the U.S.-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, issued an analysis report on a North Korean missile base close to the border with China, which it said could house a regiment-sized unit equipped with ICBMs.   Citing recent satellite imagery, the report said that should operational ICBMs not become available in the near term, the North is likely to deploy intermediate-range ballistic missiles to the site in Hoejung-ri in the northwestern province of Jagang.   sshluck@yna.co.kr(END)"
"Joint Chiefs of Staff Announced, “North Korea Launched Ballistic Missil...",https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/032/0003121837?sid=104,"Tue, 11 Jan 2022 13:04:00 +0900","			[경향신문] The test launch of a hypersonic missile, which North Korea claimed was successful on January 5. Yonhap NewsOn January 11, the Joint Chiefs of Staff announced, “North Korea launched an unidentified projectile into the East Sea.” At around 7:30 this morning, the Joint Chiefs of Staff sent a text message with these details to the journalists assigned to the military headquarters.The Joint Chiefs of Staff sent another text at 8:38 this morning and explained, “At around 7:27 this morning, we detected the launch of one projectile presumed to be a ballistic missile from the North Korean inland to the East Sea,” and added, “As for additional information, the intelligence authorities of South Korea and the United States are currently conducting a close analysis.” This day’s launch was the second demonstration of military power this year, following North Korea’s claim to have successfully test launched a hypersonic missile from Chagang Province into the East Sea six days ago on January 5.Reportedly, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un did not observe the missile launch this day. Usually, North Korea often launches missiles as part of its joint strike exercises conducted towards the end of their winter exercises in February-March. A series of demonstrations of military power from the start of the year is unusual.This day, Japanese media outlets including the NHK and Kyodo News reported a Japanese government announcement on North Korea launching a projectile that could be a ballistic missile.At around 7:29 this morning, the Japan Coast Guard announced that a projectile that could be a ballistic missile was launched from North Korea and asked ships at sea to take caution. An emergency response team of officials from relevant ministries was called to the Emergency Response Office under the Prime Minister’s Office Crisis Management Center.North Korea conducted the latest launch on the day that the international community including the U.S., Japan, and Europe held a private UN Security Council meeting to discuss North Korea’s missile launch on January 5. The Security Council meeting began at around five this morning (Korean time).Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the UN, released a statement shortly before the private meeting on January 10 (local time) and said, “The DPRK’s continued pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs is a treat to international peace and security,” and urged North Korea to come to the table for talks on denuclearization.Due to the series of missile launches by North Korea, which is paying no attention to movements by the international community, the deadlock on the Korean Peninsula is expected to continue for the time being. North Korea has argued that the missile launch was part of its effort to strengthen national defense, which it had emphasized from last year.		"
N. Korea claims it tests ‘hypersonic missile.’ Why does it matter?,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000233639?sid=104,"Thu, 06 Jan 2022 17:41:00 +0900","Pyongyang‘s goal to penetrate missile defenses with limited resourcesThis photo, released by North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency on Jan. 6, 2022, shows what the North claims to be a new hypersonic missile being launched the previous day. (Yonhap)North Korea on Thursday claimed that it test-fired another type of “hypersonic missile,” around 100 days after the test launch of the Hwasong-8 “hypersonic missile,” although South Korean authorities did not confirm the validity of the announcement. The test-launch on Wednesdasy “reconfirmed the flight control and stability of the missile in the active-flight stage and assessed the performance of the new lateral movement technique applied to the detached hypersonic gliding warhead,” Korean Central News Agency reported. The missile also made a “120 km lateral movement in the flight distance of the hypersonic gliding warhead from the initial launch azimuth to the target azimuth and precisely hit a set target 700 km away.” KCNA reported the latest test-firing also confirmed the “reliability of the fuel ampoule system under the winter weather conditions.“ Notably, Seoul has pointed out discrepancies between the joint analysis of South Korea and US intelligence authorities and North Korea‘s media report on missile specifications including apogee and travel distances. “Calling it ’hypersonic‘ is a matter of marketing, I guess. Virtually any ballistic missile could bear that label,” Joshua Pollack, a senior research associate at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies told The Korea Herald. Performs better than Hwasong-8A photo released by state media suggested that North Korea test-launched a liquid-fueled ballistic missile with a Maneuverable Reentry Vehicle first unveiled at a first defense exhibition last October, missile experts saidThis is not the first time that North Korea test-launched a MaRV payload, but a state media report suggested that the new-type ballistic missile with a MaRV would perform better compared to the Hwasong-8 “hypersonic missile” test-fired last September, missile experts pointed out. 　“It’s not a long-range glider in the same sense as the type they tested last year. Rather, it enters the atmosphere like any other RV (reentry vehicle) on a ballistic missile would, but then uses control surfaces to perform limited maneuvers,” Pollack said. “This permits greater accuracy and provides some advantages against missile defense.”If the state media report is accurate, North Korea tested another ballistic missile equipped with a detachable hypersonic glide vehicle, which is an advanced MaRV. North Korea, therefore, has now tested two separate types of HGVs, including the “Hwasong-8 hypersonic missile” launched in September last year.This combined file photo, taken by North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency on Jan. 6, 2022, shows what the North claims to be a new hypersonic missile (L) being launched the previous day and the ""hypersonic"" missile Hwasong-8 the North test-fired in September last year. (Yonhap)Advantages? Speed, maneuverability North Korea’s series of testing hypersonic boost-glide vehicles matters in light of their accuracy, speed, maneuverability and unpredictable trajectory. The tests appear to aim to seek ways to penetrate the US, South Korean, and regional missile defenses. The speed is not the key difference between HGVs and ballistic reentry vehicles. But missile-launched HGVs can carry out evasive maneuvers and change course after they are detached from their rocket booster so as to reach their target by penetrating missile defenses. Notably, North Korean state media Thursday said the test launch verified the “control and stability of the hypersonic gliding warhead which combined the multi-stage gliding jump flight and the strong lateral movement.” Eric Gomez, director of defense policy studies at the Cato Institute, noted the strong lateral movement means the “missile can have an unpredictable trajectory.”Gomez pointed out the state media suggested the reentry vehicle performs maneuvers within the Earth’s atmosphere as it approaches and glides to its target while traveling at hypersonic speed, which is at least five times the speed of sound.“Given the speeds of both the attacking and defending missiles, the sooner the defense can get a sense of a missile’s flight path the sooner it can send up an interceptor,” Gomez said. “However, if the reentry vehicle can maneuver then it becomes much harder to predict where it will land.” Aim at penetrating missile defensesAgainst such a backdrop, the new kind of hypersonic or boost glide vehicle “has a few advantages for the attacker” in view of its maneuverability and stealth features, said Melissa Hanham, an affiliate of the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University. “First, it can stay below the visibility of long-range ground-based radar for a longer period of time. Second, it can move laterally and longitudinally in a way that is hard to intercept,” Hanham told The Korea Herald. “This becomes attractive to a country like North Korea that has a small nuclear arsenal and wants to increase the chances of its low number of nuclear warheads penetrating ballistic missile defense.”Given that some analysts view that hypersonic boost-glide weapons could be a game changer for future warfare, North Korea’s plans to continue pushing forward the development of the weapons as the key national project are worrying.The KCNA highlighted that a series of hypersonic missile tests have “strategic significance in pushing ahead with the modernization of strategic armed forces,” which Kim Jong-un suggested as an important task at the Eighth Party Congress. Another importance of the “successful test launches” was to complete the “most important core task among the five top priority tasks in the strategic arms sector of the five-year plan,” KCNA added.When to deploy? While there are mixed views on North Korea’s missile technical capabilities and actual deployment time, missile experts see more tests to come.“They’ve tested two separate hypersonic glider designs now. My read of this statement suggests that this glider performed better overall than the Hwasong-8,” said Ankit Panda, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “I wouldn’t think North Korea is close to deploying these systems; I would expect additional testing throughout 2022 and perhaps 2023 before they near a decision to operationally field these capabilities.” But Gomez said North Korea could deploy the HGVs “soon” in view of multifaceted factors including North Korea’s priority on the project, different testing requirements and limited resources.“This is likely due to a mix of resource constraints and the idea that it is better for deterrence to deploy fast rather than wait for the system to be perfected,“ Gomez said. “Even if that assumption is wrong, it is safer to be wrong in that way than the other way around where we assume the weapons don’t work/exist but they are real.”		"
N.Korea seeks ‘powerful physical means’ to overpower US,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000234002?sid=104,"Thu, 20 Jan 2022 17:53:00 +0900","Pyongyang simultaneously aims to rally public support for military and nuclear buildupNorth Korean leader Kim Jong-un presides over a politburo meeting of the Workers‘ Party of Korea at the headquarters of the Party Central Committee in Pyongyang on Wednesday. (Yonhap)North Korea said Thursday it would seek to immediately develop more “powerful physical means” to overpower the US in preparation for “long-term confrontation,” expressing its potential intent to abandon the self-imposed moratorium on testing nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles. Pyongyang made the decision at a Politburo meeting of the Workers’ Party of Korea on Wednesday, with the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in attendance, the state-run media reported the following day. Politburo members assessed the “US hostile policy and military threat have reached a line of danger that can no longer be ignored,” accusing the US of “unreasonably making an issue out of the country’s legitimate exercise of sovereignty.”The Political Bureau of the Party Central Committee “unanimously recognized” that North Korea should “make more thorough preparations for a long-term confrontation with the US imperialists.” “(The Politburo) concluded it would take practical action to more reliably and certainly strengthen our physical strength to defend the state’s dignity, sovereign rights, and national interest,” the party organ Rodong Sinmun said in a Korean-language report. 　Pyongyang pointedly announced its plans to promptly enhance military strength in line with the country’s five-year defense development plan.“The Politburo meeting reassigned the tasks of national defense policy to strengthen and develop more powerful physical means without delay, which can firmly suppress the US hostile acts against the DPRK,” the Rodong Sinmun said. More importantly, North Korea implied that it could lift the self-imposed moratorium on nuclear and ICBM tests, which Kim Jong-un announced at a party plenary in April 2018 prior to the first Trump-Kim summit.“Instructions were given to a relevant sector to completely reconsider trust-building measures that we took proactively and on our own initiative and to swiftly examine the issue of resuming the entire activities that have been temporarily suspended,” the Rodong Sinmun reported, without further details. But this is not the first time that Pyongyang made a menace. In July 2019, North Korea warned that it could break the nuclear and ICBM testing moratorium, denouncing South Korea and the US for conducting the scaled-back military exercise. Kim Jong-un’s strategic patience coming to an end Experts say the decision at the Politburo meeting shows adjustment in North Korea’s approach to the US and its little remaining patience with the Biden administration. “What some analysts have described as the North Korean version of ‘strategic patience’ appears to be coming to an end,” Rachel Minyoung Lee, a nonresident fellow with the 38 North Program at the Stimson Center, told The Korea Herald. “North Korea seems to have shifted to a hard line in response to what it views as the Biden administration’s increasing pressure on North Korea.” But Lee pointed out that North Korea still left room for maneuver, given that the Politburo itself “did not reach a decision at the meeting to reconsider the ‘trust-building measures’ or examine the resumption of ‘suspended activities.’”“That seems to suggest that North Korea is leaving some flexibility for its next course of action depending on Washington’s response and key international developments,” Lee said, noting the media report.The state media notably revealed Politburo members discussed plans on countermeasures to the US “hostile policy” after being debriefed of the analysis on the situation surrounding the Korean peninsula and a series of international affairs. 38 North’s Lee said North Korea appeared to capitalize on external situations, including South Korea’s transition period in the runup to the March 9 presidential election and the US attention to Russia’s potential invasion of Ukraine. “Pyongyang seems to be taking advantage of the fluid international situation to step up weapons tests as part of its five-year defense development plan.”Serve multiple purposes Experts also point out the Kim Jong-un regime aims to accomplish manifold domestic and foreign policy purposes by pronouncing the decision to bolster its military strength against the US. Multifaceted internal and external factors would have affected Pyongyang’s calculations.Jean Lee, a senior fellow at the Wilson Center, noted that the announcement came at a critical juncture when Politburo members discussed the issue of “splendidly celebrating” the 80th anniversary of Kim Jong-il’s birth in February and the 110th anniversary of the birth of Kim Il-sung as one of the two major topics for the meeting. “I believe Kim Jong-un is on a mission to add new weapons to his arsenal, perhaps in time for upcoming 2022 celebrations aimed at glorifying the Kim family’s rule and his 10th year in power,” Lee said. “And of course, he believes an expanded arsenal will strengthen his position and leverage in any future nuclear negotiations.”The Politburo’s decision reflects Pyongyang’s strategic calculation and shows its recalibrated approach to the US. What is the Kim Jong-un regime’s message to the US? “Don’t expect us to change. If you want to see our relationship make progress – a la Kim regime – surrender and let us go our way,” Soo Kim, a policy analyst at Rand Corp., said. “Plus, the recent string of missile tests were probably geared towards priming the circumstances for this announcement today. Essentially, preparing his external audience for what’s to come.” Domestic unity and support The Kim Jong-un regime also appears to use tried-and-true techniques to divert the public attention from economic difficulties aggravated by the country’s stringent COVID-19 lockdown measures and to boost the people’s morale by demonstrating the country’s military strength. “For the purposes of domestic unity, it may be in the Kim regime’s interest to escalate tensions,” 38 North’s Lee said, pointing to Pyongyang’s three-week anti-South Korean campaign in June 2020 as an analogous precedent.North Korea still seems to seek to reinforce the people’s threat perception of the US. The state media on Thursday notably underscored that the US “hostile policy” would continue “as long as the hostile entity, which is US imperialism, exists.”North Korea underscored the US “hostile acts against the DPRK have been getting more severe day by day.” As examples, Pyongyang cited the US unilateral economic sanctions, South-Korea joint military exercises, the US acts of conducting “strategic weapons tests,” bringing “high-tech military attack means” into South Korea, and deploying “nuclear strategic weapons” on and near the Korean peninsula. “(Last time I checked), the US has not had a Carrier Strike Group, a Strategic Bomber, or 5th Gen fighter in ROK waters or air space since May 2018,” former USFK commander Gen. Robert Abrams said on Twitter, in response to the media report.At the same time, the Kim Jong-un regime appears to be seeking a rationale for continuing military and nuclear buildup.“To the internal audience, it’s a call to rally continued support for the country’s military and weapons development. So the DPRK will never cease to stray from its time-honored position of nuclear and missile development and testing,” Soo Kim said. The pronouncement is noteworthy, as Kim Jong-un publicly said that nuclear and ICBM tests were no longer needed in April 2018. Kim also declared the victory of the Byungjin line and proposed a “new strategic line” of focusing on economic development at the identical party plenary.“Right now, Kim is seeking to raise tensions, create a warlike scenario and deepen his people’s fear of attack from the United States in order to justify further testing. It’s a vicious cycle,” Jean Lee said. “I expect to see North Korea use every opportunity to turn the Biden Administration’s words and actions into confrontation in the coming weeks.”By Ji Da-gyum (dagyumji@heraldcorp.com)"

Kim’s own timetable,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/640/0000020673?sid=110,"Tue, 25 Jan 2022 19:46:00 +0900","          Yeh Young-june   The author is an editorial writer of the JoongAng Ilbo. After conducting four series of ballistic missile tests at the beginning of this year, North Korea has hinted that it will resume nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests. It is a warning that Pyongyang will end its quietness, which continued since the breakdown of the Hanoi summit in February 2019, and change its attitude to aggressiveness. Depending on the North’s moves, tension on the Korean Peninsula will likely deepen again.  The Moon Jae-in administration’s attitude toward North Korea issues is astonishingly consistent. Senior government officials and ruling party leaders said Pyongyang’s latest moves are aimed at attracting Washington’s attention or are simply a negotiation strategy to take the higher ground in anticipation of talks. Experts close to the administration are issuing similar analyses. Top officials frequently make absurd remarks that an end-of-war declaration is more necessary than ever because the North fires missiles repeatedly.  Such views are as deeply rooted as the history of the North Korean nuclear problem. According to government officials and North Korea experts, the North’s provocations are Pyongyang’s unique way of asking for talks. The interpretation seems valid based on the North’s pattern of behavior over the past decades.  The extreme confrontation in 2017 was a prelude to the North’s participation in the PyeongChang Winter Olympics and its Singapore summit with the United States. After its first nuclear test, North Korea quickly joined negotiations and reached the Sept. 19, 2005 joint declaration in six-party talks.            In a meeting with members of the Workers’ Party on January 19, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un threatens to end his self-imposed moratorium on nuclear and ICBM tests. [NEWS1]  North Korea has repeated a cycle of staging a provocation, brinkmanship, signaling its intention to talk, participating in a negotiation (and buying time), abandoning an agreement and resuming provocations. At a particular point, it could be a useful analysis method to understand the North’s intention or predicting its short-term movement.  But when we look at the situation from a long-term perspective, it is a different story. The most crucial fact is that North Korea has become a de facto nuclear state while repeating those cycles. Whether it was acting aggressively or extending an olive branch, the country has never given up its goal of becoming a nuclear power. Even at the moment of signing an agreement at an international negotiation, North Korea was secretly developing nuclear weapons.  The North’s behavior appears to us as a brinkmanship, but it has its own mid-term and long-term strategy. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is acting on this timetable. Without the timetable, there is no way to explain the four nuclear tests and 120 missile tests North Korea conducted during Kim’s 10-year rule. From the North Korean point of view, the inter-Korean and North-U.S. talks in 2018 were just a peace offensive following its successful completion of its nuclear arms program in 2017.  South Korea will lose all negotiations with North Korea if it fails to understand Pyongyang’s long-term strategy. There are many pieces of evidence that our grasp of the situation over the past 30 years has been extremely naïve. Over the years, South Korean leaders changed their stances from one that North Korea has no ability or intention to develop nuclear programs to another that North Korea’s nuclear development is a way of self-defense. It is now changed to a stance that Kim Jong-un has a strong intention to denuclearize.  Did the North’s goal and intention really change over the years and did its intention to give up nuclear weapons program suddenly appear and then disappear?  After North Korea successfully tested the engine for an intercontinental ballistic missile in 2017, Kim abandoned his dignity as supreme leader and danced while piggybacking a military engineer. Kim’s facial expression captured in that photo is his true intention.  Now, the North’s next agenda will become an Israel or Pakistan in Northeast Asia by winning tacit approval as a nuclear power. The decision by the Politburo of the Workers’ Party on Jan. 19 to review its self-imposed moratorium on nuclear and ICBM tests can be a strategic resolution to start the final stretch to realize this goal. Although it is still flexible, we must never flatly conclude that the North’s latest stance is just bluffing.  There is no need for North Korea to practice brinkmanship again, as it is no longer the country it once was. We must abandon the naïve belief that the North’s actions are to win food aid and that it will return to talks when the time comes.  "

Korea fires intermediate-range ballistic missile toward East Sea: S. Korean military(ATTN: UPDATES throughout with S. Korean official's explanation, details)By Song Sang-ho and Kang Yoon-seung  SEOUL, Jan. 30 (Yonhap) -- North Korea fired an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) into the East Sea on Sunday, South Korea's military said, raising fears that Pyongyang has inched toward its threatened suspension of a self-imposed moratorium on nuclear and long-range missile tests.  The Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said it detected the missile, fired at a steep angle from Mupyong-ri in the northern province of Jagang, at 7:52 a.m., and it flew about 800 kilometers at a top altitude of 2,000 km.  The missile hit a top speed of Mach 16, 16 times the speed of sound, and appears to be similar to the Hwasong-12 missile that the North tested in 2017, a military official told reporters, requesting anonymity.  Sunday's launch marks the North's seventh show of force this year and by far its biggest weapons test since the test-firing of its self-proclaimed intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) in November 2017.  Fears of the recalcitrant engaging in more provocative actions have lingered as Pyongyang issued a thinly veiled threat on Jan. 20 to lift its moratorium on strategic weapons tests declared in April 2018.  Shortly after the latest launch, JCS Chairman Gen. Won In-choul and Gen. Paul LaCamera, the commander of the South Korea-U.S. Combined Forces Korea, held phone talks and reaffirmed the allies' ""firm"" defense posture, according to the JCS.  ""Our military is tracking and monitoring related North Korean movements and maintaining a readiness posture,"" the JCS said in a text message sent to reporters.  The military authorities here are conducting a detailed analysis on Sunday's launch, including whether it used a solid-fuel or liquid-fuel rocket.  Some analysts said the latest launch could be part of a long-running effort to ultimately deploy a credible longer-range ballistic missile capable of striking the U.S. territory of Guam and its mainland.  Particularly, the North's quest to develop ICBMs has been a major source of concern here as the missiles could strike the continental U.S., keep American forces at bay and thus call into doubt the U.S. security commitment to South Korea.  President Moon Jae-in presided over a plenary session of the National Security Council (NSC) for the first time in about a year and called the latest launch a violation of U.N. Security Council (UNSC) sanctions. But he stopped short of calling it a ""provocation.""  The U.S. Indo-Pacific Command condemned the launch and called on the North to refrain from ""further destabilizing acts.""  ""While we have assessed that this event does not pose an immediate threat to U.S. personnel, territory or that of our allies, we will continue to monitor the situation,"" the command said.  ""The U.S. commitment to the defense of the ROK and Japan remains ironclad,"" it added, referring to South Korea by its official name, Republic of Korea.  Pyongyang has been ratcheting up tensions with a series of missile launches since the start of this year as Washington has stepped up sanctions pressure amid a protracted deadlock in nuclear talks between the two countries.  The North launched the largest monthly number of projectiles in January since North Korean leader Kim Jong-un took power in late 2011. It conducted six projectile launches in both March and July 2014.  The North fired what it claims to be surface-to-surface tactical guided missiles Thursday, just two days after its apparent long-range cruise missile test.  It conducted four other launches earlier this month, including those of what it claimed to be hypersonic missiles.  The recent bouts of the North's saber-rattling also came as it seeks to tighten internal unity amid the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic and persistent economic woes stemming from debilitating sanctions.This composite photo, released by North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency, shows a long-range cruise missile being test-fired on Jan. 25, 2022.

"Relaxing of rules, 'breakthrough' infections drive spike",https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/640/0000019088?sid=102,"Thu, 09 Dec 2021 19:09:00 +0900","  A staffer at a virus screening center in Mapo District, western Seoul, holds a sign saying applications for Covid-19 tests for the morning were closed on Thursday. [YONHAP]     Even with more than 80 percent of its people fully vaccinated, Korea's Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations continue to spike, driven by relaxed restrictions and waning immunity among the elderly.    On Thursday, the country reported its second-highest daily number of new infections, 7,102, of which all but 20 were locally transmitted, according to the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA).     The highest daily infection count, 7,175, was reported the previous day. The country’s virus caseload now stands at 496,584.    The number of Covid-19 patients in critical condition — referring to those who require oxygen treatment (such as high-flow oxygen therapy), mechanical ventilation (being put on a respirator), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) — hit another all-time high of 857, breaking the previous day’s record by 17 patients.    One in four virus fatalities in Korea have occurred since November 1, when the country switched its strategies to “living with Covid.”    Fifty-seven more people died of the virus, marking the 38th day since fatalities stayed in double-digits since Nov. 2, bringing the death toll to 4,077.    Korea is facing its worst time with the disease despite having more than 80 percent of its population fully vaccinated (80.8 percent as of Wednesday midnight) — leaving many people wondering why the situation only gets worse.      Protestors stage a rally at the government complex in Sejong on Thursday to demand the government withdraw its plan to expand the Covid-19 vaccine pass system to teenagers. [NEWS1]     Health experts point to the government’s wrong signals to the public through eased public health measures as well as reduced vaccine efficacy among the elderly as the main factors behind the surge.    “The ‘living with Covid’ plans should have been applied gradually but the restrictions were relaxed too much, making people think the pandemic was over,” Dr. Chun Eun-mi, a professor of respiratory medicine at Ewha Womans University Mokdong Hospital, told the Korea JoongAng Daily.     “People traveled more and the amount of contact between individuals increased, infecting more people driven by the more transmissible Delta variant.”    Jeong Eun-kyeong, commissioner of the KDCA, earlier mentioned a phased return to normalcy could start from Nov. 9 under the “Living with Covid” scheme during an audit of the National Assembly’s Health and Welfare Committee held on Oct. 7. The date was set for some two weeks after 70 percent of the population was expected to be fully vaccinated by the end of October. It takes two weeks for antibodies to develop after a jab.    But the transition was advanced to Nov. 1. Prime Minister Kim Boo-kyum announced a set of social distancing rules on Oct. 15 to be applied for the following two weeks, hinting that they would be the “last social distancing rules.”    “The country was teetering on the brink during the fourth wave of pandemic, and it was already seeing 2,000 daily new cases back then,” Chun said.    “The rate of progression into critical illness was increasing significantly, but the government still declared the ‘living with Covid’ scheme,” said Dr. Jung Ki-suck, a professor of pulmonology at Hallym University Sacred Heart Hospital and former director of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC).    That rate, which had fallen to 1.5 percent in September, started climbing to 2 percent in October and rose to 2.5 percent in November. This means at least 175 out of the recent 7,000 new infected patients will be hospitalized in intensive care units, even with a shortage of hospital beds.      “The government knew the rate was increasing but ignored and implemented eased restrictions,” Jung said. “It’s like a bridge that was already weak but [the construction] was pushed ahead, making it collapse.”    Another big factor in the latest wave in infections is breakthrough infections, or infections of people who have been vaccinated. This is mostly being seen in people 60 or older due to weakened vaccine efficacy — because so many months have transpired since the jabs.    This seems to be particularly true of people who received AstraZeneca vaccines, which were the first vaccines given to people between the ages of 60 and 74.     According to the KDCA, people who completed their initial series of vaccinations accounted for 56.1 percent of new infections in the first week of November, which increased to 70.1 percent in the fourth week of that month.    Another analysis from the KDCA showed that people aged 80 or older accounted for the most domestic breakthrough infections, with 333.6 per 100,000 people (0.333 percent). It was followed by people in their 70s (300 per 100,000) and in their 60s (299.1 per 100,000).    “The government promotes its vaccination rate, but in that rate, the whole is compromised by the elderly who were inoculated too long ago,” Jung said.    “The country started giving vaccines at the end of February and continued until November, but in the meantime stopped and resumed and stopped and resumed again [due to shortages of vaccine supplies], so it took nine months to achieve the 70 percent-milestone. During that period, many people lost their immunity, but the government was too proud of the 70 percent number and overlooked that reality.”    Chun also said, “Israel initiated booster inoculations from July, and Korea should have started its own at least in August but I believe they didn’t pay enough attention as they were concentrated on vaccinating the general public at that time.    “Since the country started its ‘living with Covid’ strategies without giving booster shots in nursing homes and hospitals, it led to breakthrough infections and severe cases.”    Experts said stronger social distancing measures are needed.          “As we have the Omicron variant, infections could grow out of control,” Chun said. “The government should implement stronger virus curbs now, which will show their effects in a month.”    “If the country doesn’t adopt measures close to a lockdown, we won't be able to stop the spread,” Jung said. “Most companies should start remote working, and all restaurants and bars should close except for take-out.”  "
"Health officials, court clash over vaccine pass mandates",https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000233612?sid=104,"Wed, 05 Jan 2022 18:13:00 +0900","The court decided on Tuesday to temporarily block the use of vaccine passes at educational establishments. At this study venue in Suwon, the machine scanning QR-coded passes was stopped from use on Wednesday morning. (Yonhap)The mandatory vaccine pass continues to fan controversy, with legal and health authorities clashing over its necessity at some places and possible rights violations. Legal experts say the mandatory vaccine pass, among other disease control policies, raises points of constitutional contention that stretch beyond the realm of public health and science. Health authorities on the other hand say the pass is necessary to contain the spread and allow the country to return to normal. A Seoul administrative court on Tuesday afternoon temporarily blocked the vaccine pass mandate at educational facilities such as cram schools, saying the policy “seriously disadvantages people who are not vaccinated.”The Ministry of Health and Welfare mandate, which came into effect about a month ago, requires people to present proof of being fully vaccinated no longer than six months ago or a negative PCR test result issued within the last 48 hours to enter a wide array of public places.The court, citing government statistics, said that “the risk of spreading COVID-19 could not be said to be significantly greater in people who are not vaccinated so as to justify restricting their visits to these facilities.” The court found that although the vaccines are highly effective in preventing hospitalizations and deaths, there wasn’t enough evidence to justify the use of passes at educational establishments at the expense of constitutional rights. Government: ‘Vaccine pass instrumental to return to normal’Son Young-rae, spokesperson for the Ministry of Health and Welfare, said at Wednesday’s news briefing the vaccine pass is “instrumental to continue progress toward the return to normal.”Amid a growing surge and strained medical systems, minimizing cases among the unvaccinated was “the top policy priority,” he said. He said the ministry analysis showed unvaccinated people were four to five times more likely to fall severely -- even fatally -- ill from COVID-19.“Only 6 percent of adults 18 and up remain unvaccinated in Korea. And yet they have made up 30 percent of all cases found in people 12 and older for the past two months, and 53 percent of all ICU admissions and deaths,” he said.“That means about half of our critical care resources are devoted to treating unvaccinated patients.”He said the vaccine pass policy is “intended to reduce infections of unvaccinated people, which will consequently lead to a decline in hospitalizations and deaths and ease the burden on hospitals.” In response to press inquiries asking how effective the passes have proven to be so far in controlling the recent surge, Son said that “could not be quantified.” “As the vaccine pass system was implemented, more intensive social distancing was restored. It’s hard to weigh the impact of one policy separately,” he said.At the request of the Health Ministry, the government will be filing an appeal “immediately,” Justice Minister Park Beom-kye told reporters Wednesday morning. He added that he found the court’s reasoning related to the risk unvaccinated people pose to be “rather questionable.” Health experts: ‘Understandable, but worrying precedent’Dr. Jung Jae-hun, who is advising the prime minister on COVID-19 response, hit back at the court decision in a Facebook statement, saying it “appears to lack medical, scientific understanding.”He said that the court was “evidently wrong” to say that unvaccinated people “do not pose significantly higher risk of spreading COVID-19.” The vaccines are still highly protective against infections, especially in younger people, he explained.The spirit of a vaccine pass is “to lower the risk of an infected person coming into contact with others in public places. The presence of an infected person does raise the risk of a spread,” he said, echoing the Health Ministry’s assessments. The pass also served a purpose of “shielding unvaccinated people” from possible exposure, as they are at a higher risk of severe disease, he said.“At the end of the day, we have to respect what the court has decided. But the judicial branch, too, must listen to the opinions of medical experts and public health authorities as its decisions would greatly affect the direction of COVID-19 response,” he said. “I understand where these concerns are coming from. Public health authorities should address them and be prepared to provide acceptable explanations.”Dr. Kim Woo-joo, an infectious disease specialist at Korea University Medical Center, said such restrictive measures should be adopted based on risk assessment, rather than applying them indiscriminately across the board.“Outdoor parks, book cafes where you don’t take off masks are not that dangerous and yet you still need passes to visit them,” he pointed out. The government should be able to prove “to what extent the use of vaccine passes at these relatively low-risk places can contribute to slowing the spread,” he said.Another infectious disease specialist, Dr. Eom Joong-sik of Gachon University Medical Center, worried that with the suspension of vaccine passes, a dangerous precedent might have been set for the country’s COVID-19 control measures moving forward.“I see how extending the pass system to essential places like food stores might be problematic,” he said. “But what if people started bringing other necessary restrictions to stem the spread, like social distancing and mask wearing, to the court and the court decides to halt them at important junctures?”Legal experts: ‘Some things go beyond science’Physician-turned-lawyer Park Ho-kyun said the court’s questioning of vaccine pass mandates Tuesday would be the first concerning the possible rights violations of a series of disease control restrictions put forth over the last two years.“Disease control measures are government decisions, but in a large part they work by way of mobilizing private resources like business hours and individual participation,” he said. “How far we can accept them as a society is a question that stretches beyond the realm of science.”He said not all of the pandemic policy decisions could strictly be science-based. “You could argue classrooms are a dangerous place for the virus to spread, for example. But we can’t keep kids out of in-person learning forever.”As for concerns that the latest action from the court might give rise to future interferences with COVID-19 response, he said that a court’s ruling on pandemic-related restrictions “cannot be considered a final verdict.” “As our outbreak situation evolves, so too will the court’s decisions. Lockdowns could not be tolerated when cases are scant and hospitals have enough beds. But when hospital admissions are soaring, tougher measures may be acceptable from a health rights perspective,” he explained.“Even if the court decides to stop the mandate this time, that wouldn’t mean that will be the final call on the matter through the rest of the pandemic. It’s all relative, like how the science on COVID-19 is constantly changing and being updated.”“People are free to challenge decisions made by government bodies,” he said. As court judgments pile up, it “would give us opportunities to better our guidance on pandemic response in a way that is more considerate of these rights violation concerns.”Public defense lawyer Shin Min-young said that justifying restrictions that sprung up during the pandemic were a “tug-of-war of rights -- those of individual versus public.” “But protecting rights and protecting public health are not mutually exclusive. A lot fall into a gray zone, which is why it’s meaningful to have them contested at the court,” he said. Shin added that it was important to have “some channels through which expert groups can give the court their opinions on cases with potentially far-reaching impacts.”　Kim Jin-hyun, a former judge now practicing law, said a key point of contention would be whether to permit restricting access to essential services like education in the name of pandemic response. In stopping the pass, the court said no group of people should face discrimination “across all aspects of daily life” because of their status, whether it be cultural or medical. While in the first month the passes were limited to risky places like bars, which are “arguably less essential,” its scope has been widened to include grocery stores, libraries and other everyday places, he said. “It would be up to the court to decide which services would count as essential,” he said.

[Us and Them] Korea’s division runs deeper than South and North,https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/044/0000232270?sid=104,"Mon, 15 Nov 2021 13:53:00 +0900","Regional discrimination found in rift between Jeolla and Gyeongsang provinces, rupture between Seoul and rest of the country(123rf)""When I met a new friend in Busan, he asked me where I was from. I said Gwangju and he called me a ‘Jeolladian.’ I did not know what it meant at first."" A 20-something cellphone seller in Busan, S has lied about his hometown to his customers, not wanting to cause any unnecessary trouble.""My customers would ask me where I was from,"" he said. ""I did not say that I was from Gwangju because I thought it would not benefit me in any way if I told them the truth. So it was a white lie for me."" Jeolladian is a derogatory term against people from the Jeolla provinces, often used on the far-right website Ilbe.Korea is mostly known for the division between the South and North on the global stage. But the cracks extend all the way to the bottom of the peninsula, where deep-rooted regionalism prevails. The regional rivalry goes both ways – between the southwestern Honam region that includes the Jeolla provinces and Gwangju, and Yeongnam, which comprises the Gyeongsang provinces and the cities of Busan, Daegu and Ulsan. A woman in her early 30s told The Korea Herald of her struggles at the Seoul branch of a company based in Gwangju. ""As my company was established in (South Jeolla Province), most of the employees are from Honam. There is one supervisor in his 40s who obviously treats me badly just because I’m from Daegu,"" she said. ""Another senior employee says 'Hey, Daegu' whenever he calls me."" A recent survey shows how hatred based on regionalism is a common problem. Conducted by Realmeter on behalf of the National Human Rights Commission of Korea in May, the survey asked people who were the most targeted group for hate speech both online and offline. With the option to select multiple answers, people who were born in certain regions were the second-most picked group for both online and offline.About 3 in 4 respondents said they have seen hate speech based on regionalism on the internet while a little less than 70 percent said they have witnessed the same type of hatred in their daily life.Although a newer rupture has emerged between Seoul and the rest of the country, the most well-known regional enmity in Korea is between Honam and Yeongnam.The beginning of the decadeslong rivalry between the two regions, dates back to the days of former President Park Chung-hee, who came to power after leading a military coup in 1961. ""Regional sentiment deteriorated dramatically with the regionally unequal economic development carried out under the Park Chung-hee administration on top of the tragic disaster in Gwangju in May 1980,"" Han Hong-koo, a professor at SungKongHoe University, wrote in the Journal of History in 2019. ""Regional enmity exploded in the direct presidential election, which was revived after 16 years in 1987. The country’s regional enmity worsened extremely because Korea’s political forces actively manipulated it.""Most countries have some level of regional enmity, but South Korea may be the only country that has had its politics dominated by regional conflicts and disputes for 30 years without other major divisions, such as racial, religious or linguistic ones, Han added. In the history of politics, Honam has been a progressive stronghold while Yeongnam voters have traditionally backed conservatives. Studies have shown, however, that the regionalism and the hatred that stems from it has waned in recent years. A study published by the 21st Century Political Science Association in 2018 showed that voters did not show negative feelings toward candidates from other regions. According to the researchers’ analysis, voters in Yeongnam and Honam expressed favoritism toward candidates from their own regions, but did not rule out others from different regions. The study concluded that regional emotions are more about favoritism for one’s own group rather than excluding other regions. ""Regionalism will not go away easily. Because it is old and has become a complex conflict in terms of economy, culture and social structure. But is it something that has to be removed?"" said Lee Jun-han, a professor of political science and international studies at Incheon National University. ""In the past, there was a saying that if a stick ran for an election on behalf of a certain party, some regions would cast votes for that stick. But such extreme choices are becoming weaker. It will be hard to expect Korea’s regionalism to change much from that because taking out the concept of region altogether is difficult."" The Science and Technology Policy Institute wrote in a social conflict analysis that people often manipulate media, especially in the run-up to an election to drum up support. ""In particular, the conflict between Yeongnam and Honam seems the most severe. This indicates that candidates are using provocative news reports to further instigate regional enmity so they can receive more votes,"" it said. ""We must break away from the chronic disease of regional enmity. It’s time to come up with ways to create a society where politicians, media and citizens can grow together to make politics, media and Korea more developed.""Seoul vs. the rest There is a saying here that goes, ""South Korea is the Republic of Seoul."" It takes a shot at the reality that everything in the country is focused on the capital. Data shows how lopsided the situation is. According to Statistics Korea, half of the country’s population live in the Greater Seoul area of Gyeonggi Province, Incheon and Seoul, while the region accounts for half of the country’s gross domestic product. ""We were talking about meeting up in front of the Daegu train station for our project. A graduate student asked me how I was going to get there. I said I will take the subway. She asked me if Daegu has its own subway,"" Kim Jeong-hyun, a 27-year-old graduate student, told The Korea Herald. The graduate student who had questioned Kim is in her 30s and was born in Seoul. Another interviewee who wished to remain unnamed said his boss was surprised that he came from Chungju, North Chungcheong Province. Chungju has a population of over 200,000. ""He said he didn't expect me to have come from a region other than Seoul because I looked 'stylish,' which was very offensive and thoughtless,"" he said. According to a survey conducted by the Hope Institute, a private policy studies think tank in Seoul, 92 percent of 450 respondents said they have experienced discriminatory language or expressions based on region. ""Despite the growing social perception that people should not discriminate, regional discrimination and discriminatory language have existed deeply throughout Korean society and have existed in different forms according to the trend of the times,"" said Yoo Da-in, a campaign planner at the Hope Institute. ""Language is said to reflect society. Of course, there may be complex reasons, but social conflicts have happened due to the regional gap called 'the Republic of Seoul' and some of them have been reflected in regional discriminatory language.""The Hope Institute categorized the respondents’ experiences based on the characteristics of the discriminatory language used. Expressions of regional prejudice and stereotypes took up the largest portion, followed by comments that were based on the premise that everything is centered around Seoul. Yoo said such terms constitute ""microaggressions,"" trivial and subtle interactions or behaviors -- sometimes unintentional -- that express a bias toward a group.Some examples of microaggression she mentioned include “Do you have Starbucks (in your hometown)?"" ""Don’t fix your dialect. It’s cute,"" and ""You are from Chungcheong province, but your action or speaking is not slow?"" In order to uproot microaggression, awareness and sensitivity needs to be raised in order to create an atmosphere of respect and understanding of others, she added. On why regionally discriminatory language does not seem to be emphasized as much as other types of discrimination, Yoo pointed to the perception that people think it is fading away. Discriminatory expressions used before the 1990s are not being used anymore, but the problem is that new discriminatory expressions are continuously created, she said.""Discriminatory expressions come from conflicts and disputes between people. But once they are created, they are used as tools to further incite conflicts and disputes,"" Lee Jeong-bok, professor of Korean Language and Literature at Daegu University, wrote in a journal published by the National Institute of Korean Language in 2017.""Speakers often do not realize such expressions are discriminatory and some people think it is not a problem to use them figuratively. In fact, this is where the education for acknowledging discriminatory expressions is important.""----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The concept of “us” is a strong force in Korean culture, and to be counted as “one of us” in any group comes with privileges big and small within its boundaries. However, for those who fall outside the boundaries of “normal,” life in Korea is riddled with hurdles and sometimes open hatred. In a series of articles, we take a closer look at the biases that exist in Korea, and the lives of those branded as “them” by mainstream society. -- Ed."
"If you can't beat them, coin a misogynistic term and harass them online",https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/640/0000017771?sid=103,"Tue, 02 Nov 2021 17:02:00 +0900","  A new term stirring up the Korean online sphere is now sparking debates in the real world: the “dishwashing theory"" which degrades women and married men. [AHN DA-YOUNG]     A new term stirring up the Korean online sphere is now sparking debates among pundits and the public alike.     The “dishwashing theory,” which sounds like a benign debate on household chores, arose late October on a predominantly male online community, and may suggest an evolution of hate in Korean society.    The dishwashing theory posits that young women promiscuously date men based on physical attraction, but later wed a financially stable man purely for money. The “theory” likens women who have a sexual history to leftovers that others have already eaten and claims the men who marry them are the ones who have to “do the dishes” — supporting their wives who don’t really love them.     Proponents of the theory mockingly refer to married men as “Pongpong men,” a term based on one of Korea’s dish detergent brands.      It’s no news that the Korean online sphere has long been a battleground between the sexes, and the internet constantly produces new slang and slurs. But this time, experts are focusing on an interesting aspect of the dishwashing theory — Men have now become targets of misogynistic ridicule by other men.  Marriage is a luxury     Why are unmarried men suddenly insulting married men? The current perception of marriage in Korea offers an explanation.    “Marriage is perceived as a difficult milestone to reach because it really is harder for ordinary men to get married these days,” said Park Jung-won, who has worked as a professional matchmaker for 12 years.    “Due to the bad economy, most women today know it’s too difficult to start from scratch and prefer to marry someone who is already financially stable. Also, now that more women can make money themselves, they don’t feel the need to get married unless the man has something to offer. So the bar has become quite high.”    Park runs the YouTube channel “Hanbang Sister” to share stories from her matchmaking career, and one video about some women expecting too much wealth from their potential husbands recently went viral. The video was met with passionate responses from male viewers, complaining that women nowadays have unrealistically high standards. A poll on her channel last week revealed that 70 percent of respondents, predominantly men, agreed with the dishwashing theory.      Professional matchmaker Park Jung-won shares stories from her 12-year career on her YouTube channel. One of her videos about some women expecting too much wealth from their potential husbands recently went viral. [SCREEN CAPTURE]     While Park criticized the demeaning nature of the term, she offered her analysis on where the theory may come from.    “Men tend to perceive marriage as a higher hurdle since they are conventionally expected to pay the majority of the cost,” she said. “It’s still most common for the husband to buy the house or pay for most of it. As house prices have skyrocketed in recent years, a smaller number of highly educated and financially successful men can afford to get married now.”    According to a survey from matchmaking company Duo this February conducted on 500 couples who wed over the past two years, men paid 61 percent of the total marriage cost on average, which in Korea typically includes the wedding ceremony, family gifts, major household electronics and first home.    Nonetheless, Park believes the dishwashing theory is largely groundless.     “I can’t deny that some women marry solely for wealth,” said Park. “But some men only focus on a woman’s looks; neither is wrong. I think the dishwashing theory comes from men who in fact want to get married but can’t afford to. Since marriage became a luxury few can afford, financially unsuccessful men are envious and making themselves feel better by claiming that well-off married men are actually unhappy.”    “Considering that ‘dishwashing’ stems from comparing women to leftover food, it’s an extremely vulgar term,” said Lim Myung-ho, a psychology professor at Dankook University. “Degrading others is a way to cope with one’s sense of inferiority. Financially unstable men are rationalizing that they’re unmarried by choice to avoid being used by a promiscuous woman; it’s easier than accepting that they’re in fact unable to.”  Friendly fire   Meanwhile, experts are focusing on an aspect of the dishwashing theory that goes beyond just another derogatory term. While the theory is based on misogyny, the new term ""Pongpong men"" targets men, in particular those who are well-off enough to start a family.    “I’m surprised by this new phenomenon because deriding someone higher up in the social hierarchy is practically unheard of,” said Lim. “Hate is usually projected on people who are perceived as weaker, such as women, the disabled, the elderly and children. That’s why so far, men only criticized women as gold diggers when complaining about marriage costs. But now, men are also degrading fellow men in similar age groups. It’s like turning the gun around and shooting at your allies.”      Posts about the dishwashing theory on a predominantly male online community [SCREEN CAPTURE]     Lee Hyun-jae, a feminist philosopher and professor at the University of Seoul’s Institute for Urban Humanities, attributes this internal divide to a shift in economic dynamics.      “Proponents of the dishwashing theory criticize women who seek financially stable men because they’re unable to provide such stability,” she said, “and they feel anxious about their lack of stability too.”    “A couple of decades ago, most men were able to support a standard four-person family with a single income. Most of the time, being a man guaranteed a certain level of social status. But that era has passed. Today, only a limited number of men in their 20s and 30s can secure high-paying, stable jobs. The social hierarchy among men grew more rigid as a result, and those who lost in the competition are projecting their anxiety on both women and men. In a way, the dishwashing theory shows that hate in Korean society has evolved and expanded.”    According to Lim, such expansion indicates that the “level of aggression has escalated.”    “Due to the difficult economy, youths are struggling to find jobs and housing, which are considered prerequisites for marriage,” he said. “The steep competition created ranks among men based on financial abilities, and the insecurity from this gap leads to anger so strong that less successful men are now shooting at anyone, figuratively speaking. You have to be extremely angry to attack someone ‘socially stronger’ than you.”      Lim added that the quick spread of the dishwashing theory in the offline world suggests that a large number of men were already feeling like they were “losers” in society and ready to jump on board with a theory that soothes their frustration.      “I wondered what those men gain by attacking other men and spreading such elaborate claims,” said 27-year-old Lee, an unmarried pharmacist. “I concluded, to people who can’t marry or simply hate women, the idea of a happily married man threatens their rationalization of why they're not married. So they must make married men look pathetic and portray marriage as a loss — almost like brainwashing, since actual married men aren’t even complaining about ‘dishwashing.'”    “Marriage is about supplementing each other in many ways, including financially,” Lee added. “If they think supporting one’s family means being used and are so paranoid about that, I wonder what they think marriage is in the first place.        Political commentator Chin Jung-kwon asked about the dishwashing theory on Twitter, initially confused what the term means. [SCREEN CAPTURE]      Theory or lament?   Many point out that the dishwashing theory is innately based on anachronistic “slut-shaming,” as it originates from comparing women to leftover food for having a sexual history. The theory says that women having premarital sex is problematic, and their husbands are victimized by such immoral conduct. Professor Lee said the theory exposes a double standard.      “It has been socially acceptable for men to desire physically attractive women, then seek ‘chaste’ women when it’s time to choose a wife,” she said. “But when women do the same — date physically attractive men and later marry a stable partner — it’s suddenly unethical, and men are some sort of victims who are ‘forced to do the dishes.’”    At the same time, Lee believes the theory goes much deeper than the issue of virginity.      “The idea that women now freely follow their desires makes some men uneasy,” said Lee. “Under the traditional ideal of femininity, women are not supposed to make decisions based on desires or benefits. They’re supposed to be devoted to their husbands unconditionally and take care of them like a mother. It’s actually a very romantic expectation of love, but it’s unrealistic and one-sided. To me, the dishwashing theory is more of a lament that the ideal femininity which many men expected no longer exists in the 21st century. Slut-shaming is just another pretext to degrade women who don’t fit their idea of femininity.”  All about anxiety   Experts concurred that the dishwashing theory boils down to one dominant emotion: Anxiety. The worsening economy on top of pre-existing misogyny concocted a theory that attempts to rationalize why less financially stable men are unmarried and better off that way.        One online post claims that proponents of the dishwashing theory are ""losers"" in society who are jealous of good-looking women and financially successful men. [SCREEN CAPTURE]      “Koreans live through an endless series of competitions, most notably entering college and getting a job,” said matchmaker Park. “Now that even marriage has become a competition, I’d summarize this whole controversy as jealousy and sorrow. Those who lost in the competition are trying to find flaws in happily married, financially stable men and women.”    “Similar to how misogyny is rooted in men’s insecurities, the same goes for the dishwashing theory,” said Professor Lee. “The theory’s proponents make it seem like they’re looking down upon married men as ‘Pongpong men,’ but they’re actually projecting their anxiety that they will never be able to secure a stable position like those married men.”     Professor Lim emphasized that the target of hate did not shift, but merely expanded.    “It doesn’t mean those men stopped attacking women and moved on to other men,” he said. “It’s just that men are no longer free from verbal attacks from men either. Since people are extremely anxious in these difficult economic times, hate is manifesting in more severe, various forms. Not only is the target expanding, but the wording of hate is also becoming more explicit and aggressive. It’s depressing, but I believe this phenomenon will continue to grow worse.”  "
