Weakly-Supervised Speech Pre-training: A Case Study on Target Speech Recognition,"Self-supervised learning (SSL) based speech pre-training has attracted much attention for its capability of extracting rich representations learned from massive unlabeled data. On the other hand, the use of weakly-supervised data is less explored for speech pre-training. To fill this gap, we propose a weakly-supervised speech pre-training method based on speaker-aware speech data. It adopts a similar training procedure to the widely-used masked speech prediction based SSL framework, while incorporating additional target-speaker enrollment information as an auxiliary input. In this way, the learned representation is steered towards the target speaker even in the presence of highly overlapping interference, allowing potential applications to tasks such as target speech recognition. Our experiments on Libri2Mix and WSJ0-2mix datasets show that the proposed model achieves significantly better ASR performance compared to WavLM, the state-of-the-art SSL model with denoising capability."
Unified Modeling of Multi-Talker Overlapped Speech Recognition and Diarization with a Sidecar Separator,"Multi-talker overlapped speech poses a significant challenge for speech recognition and diarization. Recent research indicated that these two tasks are inter-dependent and complementary, motivating us to explore a unified modeling method to address them in the context of overlapped speech. A recent study proposed a cost-effective method to convert a single-talker automatic speech recognition (ASR) system into a multi-talker one, by inserting a Sidecar separator into the frozen well-trained ASR model. Extending on this, we incorporate a diarization branch into the Sidecar, allowing for unified modeling of both ASR and diarization with a negligible overhead of only 768 parameters. The proposed method yields better ASR results compared to the baseline on LibriMix and LibriSpeechMix datasets. Moreover, without sophisticated customization on the diarization task, our method achieves acceptable diarization results on the two-speaker subset of CALLHOME with only a few adaptation steps."
"VioLA: Unified Codec Language Models for Speech Recognition, Synthesis, and Translation","Recent research shows a big convergence in model architecture, training objectives, and inference methods across various tasks for different modalities. In this paper, we propose VioLA, a single auto-regressive Transformer decoder-only network that unifies various cross-modal tasks involving speech and text, such as speech-to-text, text-to-text, text-to-speech, and speech-to-speech tasks, as a conditional codec language model task via multi-task learning framework. To accomplish this, we first convert all the speech utterances to discrete tokens (similar to the textual data) using an offline neural codec encoder. In such a way, all these tasks are converted to token-based sequence conversion problems, which can be naturally handled with one conditional language model. We further integrate task IDs (TID) and language IDs (LID) into the proposed model to enhance the modeling capability of handling different languages and tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed VioLA model can support both single-modal and cross-modal tasks well, and the decoder-only model achieves a comparable and even better performance than the strong baselines."
Transfer Learning for Personality Perception via Speech Emotion Recognition,"Holistic perception of affective attributes is an important human perceptual ability. However, this ability is far from being realized in current affective computing, as not all of the attributes are well studied and their interrelationships are poorly understood. In this work, we investigate the relationship between two affective attributes: personality and emotion, from a transfer learning perspective. Specifically, we transfer Transformer-based and wav2vec-based emotion recognition models to perceive personality from speech across corpora. Compared with previous studies, our results show that transferring emotion recognition is effective for personality perception. Moreoever, this allows for better use and exploration of small personality corpora. We also provide novel findings on the relationship between personality and emotion that will aid future research on holistic affect recognition."
ASR and Emotional Speech: A Word-Level Investigation of the Mutual Impact of Speech and Emotion Recognition,"In Speech Emotion Recognition (SER), textual data is often used alongside audio signals to address their inherent variability. However, the reliance on human annotated text in most research hinders the development of practical SER systems. To overcome this challenge, we investigate how Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) performs on emotional speech by analyzing the ASR performance on emotion corpora and examining the distribution of word errors and confidence scores in ASR transcripts to gain insight into how emotion affects ASR. We utilize four ASR systems, namely Kaldi ASR, wav2vec, Conformer, and Whisper, and three corpora: IEMOCAP, MOSI, and MELD to ensure generalizability. Additionally, we conduct text-based SER on ASR transcripts with increasing word error rates to investigate how ASR affects SER. The objective of this study is to uncover the relationship and mutual impact of ASR and SER, in order to facilitate ASR adaptation to emotional speech and the use of SER in real world."
PoCaPNet: A Novel Approach for Surgical Phase Recognition Using Speech and X-Ray Images,"Surgical phase recognition is a challenging and necessary task for the development of context-aware intelligent systems that can support medical personnel for better patient care and effective operating room management. In this paper, we present a surgical phase recognition framework that employs a Multi-Stage Temporal Convolution Network using speech and X-Ray images for the first time. We evaluate our proposed approach using our dataset that comprises 31 port-catheter placement operations and report 82.56 \% frame-wise accuracy with eight surgical phases. Additionally, we investigate the design choices in the temporal model and solutions for the class-imbalance problem. Our experiments demonstrate that speech and X-Ray data can be effectively utilized for surgical phase recognition, providing a foundation for the development of speech assistants in operating rooms of the future."
Iteratively Improving Speech Recognition and Voice Conversion,"Many existing works on voice conversion (VC) tasks use automatic speech recognition (ASR) models for ensuring linguistic consistency between source and converted samples. However, for the low-data resource domains, training a high-quality ASR remains to be a challenging task. In this work, we propose a novel iterative way of improving both the ASR and VC models. We first train an ASR model which is used to ensure content preservation while training a VC model. In the next iteration, the VC model is used as a data augmentation method to further fine-tune the ASR model and generalize it to diverse speakers. By iteratively leveraging the improved ASR model to train VC model and vice-versa, we experimentally show improvement in both the models. Our proposed framework outperforms the ASR and one-shot VC baseline models on English singing and Hindi speech domains in subjective and objective evaluations in low-data resource settings."
Improving Speech Emotion Recognition Performance using Differentiable Architecture Search,"Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is a critical enabler of emotion-aware communication in human-computer interactions. Deep Learning (DL) has improved the performance of SER models by improving model complexity. However, designing DL architectures requires prior experience and experimental evaluations. Encouragingly, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) allows automatic search for an optimum DL model. In particular, Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) is an efficient method of using NAS to search for optimised models. In this paper, we propose DARTS for a joint CNN and LSTM architecture for improving SER performance. Our choice of the CNN LSTM coupling is inspired by results showing that similar models offer improved performance. While SER researchers have considered CNNs and RNNs separately, the viability of using DARTs jointly for CNN and LSTM still needs exploration. Experimenting with the IEMOCAP dataset, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms best-reported results using DARTS for SER."
Improving the Gap in Visual Speech Recognition Between Normal and Silent Speech Based on Metric Learning,"This paper presents a novel metric learning approach to address the performance gap between normal and silent speech in visual speech recognition (VSR). The difference in lip movements between the two poses a challenge for existing VSR models, which exhibit degraded accuracy when applied to silent speech. To solve this issue and tackle the scarcity of training data for silent speech, we propose to leverage the shared literal content between normal and silent speech and present a metric learning approach based on visemes. Specifically, we aim to map the input of two speech types close to each other in a latent space if they have similar viseme representations. By minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence of the predicted viseme probability distributions between and within the two speech types, our model effectively learns and predicts viseme identities. Our evaluation demonstrates that our method improves the accuracy of silent VSR, even when limited training data is available."
Rethinking Speech Recognition with A Multimodal Perspective via Acoustic and Semantic Cooperative Decoding,"Attention-based encoder-decoder (AED) models have shown impressive performance in ASR. However, most existing AED methods neglect to simultaneously leverage both acoustic and semantic features in decoder, which is crucial for generating more accurate and informative semantic states. In this paper, we propose an Acoustic and Semantic Cooperative Decoder (ASCD) for ASR. In particular, unlike vanilla decoders that process acoustic and semantic features in two separate stages, ASCD integrates them cooperatively. To prevent information leakage during training, we design a Causal Multimodal Mask. Moreover, a variant Semi-ASCD is proposed to balance accuracy and computational cost. Our proposal is evaluated on the publicly available AISHELL-1 and aidatatang_200zh datasets using Transformer, Conformer, and Branchformer as encoders, respectively. The experimental results show that ASCD significantly improves the performance by leveraging both the acoustic and semantic information cooperatively."
Cross-lingual Knowledge Transfer and Iterative Pseudo-labeling for Low-Resource Speech Recognition with Transducers,"Voice technology has become ubiquitous recently. However, the accuracy, and hence experience, in different languages varies significantly, which makes the technology not equally inclusive. The availability of data for different languages is one of the key factors affecting accuracy, especially in training of all-neural end-to-end automatic speech recognition systems.  Cross-lingual knowledge transfer and iterative pseudo-labeling are two techniques that have been shown to be successful for improving the accuracy of ASR systems, in particular for low-resource languages, like Ukrainian.  Our goal is to train an all-neural Transducer-based ASR system to replace a DNN-HMM hybrid system with no manually annotated training data. We show that the Transducer system trained using transcripts produced by the hybrid system achieves 18% reduction in terms of word error rate. However, using a combination of cross-lingual knowledge transfer from related languages and iterative pseudo-labeling, we are able to achieve 35% reduction of the error rate."
A New Benchmark of Aphasia Speech Recognition and Detection Based on E-Branchformer and Multi-task Learning,"Aphasia is a language disorder that affects the speaking ability of millions of patients. This paper presents a new benchmark for Aphasia speech recognition and detection tasks using state-of-the-art speech recognition techniques with the AphsiaBank dataset. Specifically, we introduce two multi-task learning methods based on the CTC/Attention architecture to perform both tasks simultaneously. Our system achieves state-of-the-art speaker-level detection accuracy (97.3%), and a relative WER reduction of 11% for moderate Aphasia patients. In addition, we demonstrate the generalizability of our approach by applying it to another disordered speech database, the DementiaBank Pitt corpus. We will make our all-in-one recipes and pre-trained model publicly available to facilitate reproducibility. Our standardized data preprocessing pipeline and open-source recipes enable researchers to compare results directly, promoting progress in disordered speech processing."
Debiased Automatic Speech Recognition for Dysarthric Speech via Sample Reweighting with Sample Affinity Test,"Automatic speech recognition systems based on deep learning are mainly trained under empirical risk minimization (ERM). Since ERM utilizes the averaged performance on the data samples regardless of a group such as healthy or dysarthric speakers, ASR systems are unaware of the performance disparities across the groups. This results in biased ASR systems whose performance differences among groups are severe. In this study, we aim to improve the ASR system in terms of group robustness for dysarthric speakers. To achieve our goal, we present a novel approach, sample reweighting with sample affinity test (Re-SAT). Re-SAT systematically measures the debiasing helpfulness of the given data sample and then mitigates the bias by debiasing helpfulness-based sample reweighting. Experimental results demonstrate that Re-SAT contributes to improved ASR performance on dysarthric speech without performance degradation on healthy speech."
GNCformer Enhanced Self-attention for Automatic Speech Recognition,"In this paper,an Enhanced Self-Attention (ESA) mechanism has been put forward for robust feature extraction.The proposed ESA is integrated with the recursive gated convolution and self-attention mechanism.In particular, the former is used to capture multi-order feature interaction and the latter is for global feature extraction.In addition, the location of interest that is suitable for inserting the ESA is also worth being explored.In this paper, the ESA is embedded into the encoder layer of the Transformer network for automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks, and this newly proposed model is named GNCformer. The effectiveness of the GNCformer has been validated using two datasets, that are Aishell-1 and HKUST.Experimental results show that, compared with the Transformer network,0.8%CER,and 1.2%CER improvement for these two mentioned datasets, respectively, can be achieved.It is worth mentioning that only 1.4M additional parameters have been involved in our proposed GNCformer."
Exploring Energy-based Language Models with Different Architectures and Training Methods for Speech Recognition,"Energy-based language models (ELMs) parameterize an unnormalized distribution for natural sentences and are radically different from popular autoregressive language models (ALMs). As an important application, ELMs have been successfully used as a means for calculating sentence scores in speech recognition, but they all use less-modern CNN or LSTM networks. The recent progress in Transformer networks and large pretrained models such as BERT and GPT2 opens new possibility to further advancing ELMs. In this paper, we explore different architectures of energy functions and different training methods to investigate the capabilities of ELMs in rescoring for speech recognition, all using large pretrained models as backbones."
On the Efficacy and Noise-Robustness of Jointly Learned Speech Emotion and Automatic Speech Recognition,"New-age conversational agent systems perform both speech emotion recognition (SER) and automatic speech recognition (ASR) using two separate and often independent approaches for real-world application in noisy environments. In this paper, we investigate a joint ASR-SER multitask learning approach in a low-resource setting and show that improvements are observed not only in SER, but also in ASR. We also investigate the robustness of such jointly trained models to the presence of background noise, babble, and music. Experimental results on the IEMOCAP dataset show that joint learning can improve ASR word error rate (WER) and SER classification accuracy by 10.7% and 2.3% respectively in clean scenarios. In noisy scenarios, results on data augmented with MUSAN show that the joint approach outperforms the independent ASR and SER approaches across many noisy conditions. Overall, the joint ASR-SER approach yielded more noise-resistant models than the independent ASR and SER approaches."
Multi-Head State Space Model for Speech Recognition,"State space models (SSMs) have recently shown promising results on small-scale sequence and language modelling tasks, rivalling and outperforming many attention-based approaches. In this paper, we propose a multi-head state space (MH-SSM) architecture equipped with special gating mechanisms, where parallel heads are taught to learn local and global temporal dynamics on sequence data. As a drop-in replacement for multi-head attention in transformer encoders, this new model significantly outperforms the transformer transducer on the LibriSpeech speech recognition corpus. Furthermore, we augment the transformer block with MH-SSMs layers, referred to as the Stateformer, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the LibriSpeech task, with word error rates of 1.76\%/4.37\% on the development and 1.91\%/4.36\% on the test sets without using an external language model."
Contextualized End-to-End Speech Recognition with Contextual Phrase Prediction Network,"Contextual information plays a crucial role in speech recognition technologies and incorporating it into the end-to-end speech recognition models has drawn immense interest recently. However, previous deep bias methods lacked explicit supervision for bias tasks. In this study, we introduce a contextual phrase prediction network for an attention-based deep bias method. This network predicts context phrases in utterances using contextual embeddings and calculates bias loss to assist in the training of the contextualized model. Our method achieved a significant word error rate (WER) reduction across various end-to-end speech recognition models. Experiments on the LibriSpeech corpus show that our proposed model obtains a 12.1% relative WER improvement over the baseline model, and the WER of the context phrases decreases relatively by 40.5%. Moreover, by applying a context phrase filtering strategy, we also effectively eliminate the WER degradation when using a larger biasing list."
Language-universal phonetic encoder for low-resource speech recognition,"Multilingual training is effective in improving low-resource ASR, which may partially be explained by phonetic representation sharing between languages. In end-to-end (E2E) ASR systems, graphemes are often used as basic modeling units, however graphemes may not be ideal for multilingual phonetic sharing. In this paper, we leverage International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) based language-universal phonetic model to improve low-resource ASR performances, for the first time within the attention encoder-decoder architecture. We propose an adaptation method on the phonetic IPA model to further improve the proposed approach on extreme low-resource languages. Experiments carried out on the open-source MLS corpus and our internal databases show our approach outperforms baseline monolingual models and most state-of-the-art works. Our main approach and adaptation are effective on extremely low-resource languages, even within domain- and language-mismatched scenarios."
Language-Universal Phonetic Representation in Multilingual Speech Pretraining for Low-Resource Speech Recognition,"We improve low-resource ASR by integrating the ideas of multilingual training and self-supervised learning. Concretely, we leverage an International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) multilingual model to create frame-level pseudo labels for unlabeled speech, and use these pseudo labels to guide hidden-unit BERT (HuBERT) based speech pretraining in a phonetically-informed manner. The experiments on the Multilingual Speech (MLS) Corpus show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms the standard HuBERT on all the target languages. Moreover, on 3 of the 4 languages, comparing to the standard HuBERT, the approach performs better, meanwhile is able to save supervised training data by 1.5k hours (75%) at most. Our approach outperforms most of the state of the arts, with much less pretraining data in terms of hours and language diversity. Compared to XLSR-53 and a retraining based multilingual method, our approach performs better with full and limited finetuning data scenarios."
A Preliminary Study on Augmenting Speech Emotion Recognition using a Diffusion Model,"In this paper, we propose to utilise diffusion models for data augmentation in speech emotion recognition (SER). In particular, we present an effective approach to utilise improved denoising diffusion probabilistic models (IDDPM) to generate synthetic emotional data. We condition the IDDPM with the textual embedding from bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) to generate high-quality synthetic emotional samples in different speakers' voices\footnote{synthetic samples URL: \url{https://emulationai.com/research/diffusion-ser.}}. We implement a series of experiments and show that better quality synthetic data helps improve SER performance. We compare results with generative adversarial networks (GANs) and show that the proposed model generates better-quality synthetic samples that can considerably improve the performance of SER when augmented with synthetic data."
TrustSER: On the Trustworthiness of Fine-tuning Pre-trained Speech Embeddings For Speech Emotion Recognition,"Recent studies have explored the use of pre-trained embeddings for speech emotion recognition (SER), achieving comparable performance to conventional methods that rely on low-level knowledge-inspired acoustic features. These embeddings are often generated from models trained on large-scale speech datasets using self-supervised or weakly-supervised learning objectives. Despite the significant advancements made in SER through the use of pre-trained embeddings, there is a limited understanding of the trustworthiness of these methods, including privacy breaches, unfair performance, vulnerability to adversarial attacks, and computational cost, all of which may hinder the real-world deployment of these systems. In response, we introduce TrustSER, a general framework designed to evaluate the trustworthiness of SER systems using deep learning methods, with a focus on privacy, safety, fairness, and sustainability, offering unique insights into future research in the field of SER. Our code is publicly available under: https://github.com/usc-sail/trust-ser."
"A Comparative Study on E-Branchformer vs Conformer in Speech Recognition, Translation, and Understanding Tasks","Conformer, a convolution-augmented Transformer variant, has become the de facto encoder architecture for speech processing due to its superior performance in various tasks, including automatic speech recognition (ASR), speech translation (ST) and spoken language understanding (SLU). Recently, a new encoder called E-Branchformer has outperformed Conformer in the LibriSpeech ASR benchmark, making it promising for more general speech applications. This work compares E-Branchformer and Conformer through extensive experiments using different types of end-to-end sequence-to-sequence models. Results demonstrate that E-Branchformer achieves comparable or better performance than Conformer in almost all evaluation sets across 15 ASR, 2 ST, and 3 SLU benchmarks, while being more stable during training. We will release our training configurations and pre-trained models for reproducibility, which can benefit the speech community."
FunASR: A Fundamental End-to-End Speech Recognition Toolkit,"This paper introduces FunASR, an open-source speech recognition toolkit designed to bridge the gap between academic research and industrial applications. FunASR offers models trained on large-scale industrial corpora and the ability to deploy them in applications. The toolkit's flagship model, Paraformer, is a non-autoregressive end-to-end speech recognition model that has been trained on a manually annotated Mandarin speech recognition dataset that contains 60,000 hours of speech. To improve the performance of Paraformer, we have added timestamp prediction and hotword customization capabilities to the standard Paraformer backbone. In addition, to facilitate model deployment, we have open-sourced a voice activity detection model based on the Feedforward Sequential Memory Network (FSMN-VAD) and a text post-processing punctuation model based on the controllable time-delay Transformer (CT-Transformer), both of which were trained on industrial corpora. These functional modules provide a solid foundation for building high-precision long audio speech recognition services. Compared to other models trained on open datasets, Paraformer demonstrates superior performance."
Making More of Little Data: Improving Low-Resource Automatic Speech Recognition Using Data Augmentation,"The performance of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems has advanced substantially in recent years, particularly for languages for which a large amount of transcribed speech is available. Unfortunately, for low-resource languages, such as minority languages, regional languages or dialects, ASR performance generally remains much lower. In this study, we investigate whether data augmentation techniques could help improve low-resource ASR performance, focusing on four typologically diverse minority languages or language variants (West Germanic: Gronings, West-Frisian; Malayo-Polynesian: Besemah, Nasal). For all four languages, we examine the use of self-training, where an ASR system trained with the available human-transcribed data is used to generate transcriptions, which are then combined with the original data to train a new ASR system. For Gronings, for which there was a pre-existing text-to-speech (TTS) system available, we also examined the use of TTS to generate ASR training data from text-only sources. We find that using a self-training approach consistently yields improved performance (a relative WER reduction up to 20.5% compared to using an ASR system trained on 24 minutes of manually transcribed speech). The performance gain from TTS augmentation for Gronings was even stronger (up to 25.5% relative reduction in WER compared to a system based on 24 minutes of manually transcribed speech). In sum, our results show the benefit of using self-training or (if possible) TTS-generated data as an efficient solution to overcome the limitations of data availability for resource-scarce languages in order to improve ASR performance."
Accurate and Reliable Confidence Estimation Based on Non-Autoregressive End-to-End Speech Recognition System,"Estimating confidence scores for recognition results is a classic task in ASR field and of vital importance for kinds of downstream tasks and training strategies. Previous end-to-end~(E2E) based confidence estimation models (CEM) predict score sequences of equal length with input transcriptions, leading to unreliable estimation when deletion and insertion errors occur. In this paper we proposed CIF-Aligned confidence estimation model (CA-CEM) to achieve accurate and reliable confidence estimation based on novel non-autoregressive E2E ASR model - Paraformer. CA-CEM utilizes the modeling character of continuous integrate-and-fire (CIF) mechanism to generate token-synchronous acoustic embedding, which solves the estimation failure issue above. We measure the quality of estimation with AUC and RMSE in token level and ECE-U - a proposed metrics in utterance level. CA-CEM gains 24% and 19% relative reduction on ECE-U and also better AUC and RMSE on two test sets. Furthermore, we conduct analysis to explore the potential of CEM for different ASR related usage."
Use of Speech Impairment Severity for Dysarthric Speech Recognition,"A key challenge in dysarthric speech recognition is the speaker-level diversity attributed to both speaker-identity associated factors such as gender, and speech impairment severity. Most prior researches on addressing this issue focused on using speaker-identity only. To this end, this paper proposes a novel set of techniques to use both severity and speaker-identity in dysarthric speech recognition: a) multitask training incorporating severity prediction error; b) speaker-severity aware auxiliary feature adaptation; and c) structured LHUC transforms separately conditioned on speaker-identity and severity. Experiments conducted on UASpeech suggest incorporating additional speech impairment severity into state-of-the-art hybrid DNN, E2E Conformer and pre-trained Wav2vec 2.0 ASR systems produced statistically significant WER reductions up to 4.78% (14.03% relative). Using the best system the lowest published WER of 17.82% (51.25% on very low intelligibility) was obtained on UASpeech."
OOD-Speech: A Large Bengali Speech Recognition Dataset for Out-of-Distribution Benchmarking,"We present OOD-Speech, the first out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarking dataset for Bengali automatic speech recognition (ASR). Being one of the most spoken languages globally, Bengali portrays large diversity in dialects and prosodic features, which demands ASR frameworks to be robust towards distribution shifts. For example, islamic religious sermons in Bengali are delivered with a tonality that is significantly different from regular speech. Our training dataset is collected via massively online crowdsourcing campaigns which resulted in 1177.94 hours collected and curated from 22,645 native Bengali speakers from South Asia. Our test dataset comprises 23.03 hours of speech collected and manually annotated from 17 different sources, e.g., Bengali TV drama, Audiobook, Talk show, Online class, and Islamic sermons to name a few. OOD-Speech is jointly the largest publicly available speech dataset, as well as the first out-of-distribution ASR benchmarking dataset for Bengali."
Cross-Modal Global Interaction and Local Alignment for Audio-Visual Speech Recognition,"Audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) research has gained a great success recently by improving the noise-robustness of audio-only automatic speech recognition (ASR) with noise-invariant visual information. However, most existing AVSR approaches simply fuse the audio and visual features by concatenation, without explicit interactions to capture the deep correlations between them, which results in sub-optimal multimodal representations for downstream speech recognition task. In this paper, we propose a cross-modal global interaction and local alignment (GILA) approach for AVSR, which captures the deep audio-visual (A-V) correlations from both global and local perspectives. Specifically, we design a global interaction model to capture the A-V complementary relationship on modality level, as well as a local alignment approach to model the A-V temporal consistency on frame level. Such a holistic view of cross-modal correlations enable better multimodal representations for AVSR. Experiments on public benchmarks LRS3 and LRS2 show that our GILA outperforms the supervised learning state-of-the-art."
Accelerator-Aware Training for Transducer-Based Speech Recognition,"Machine learning model weights and activations are represented in full-precision during training. This leads to performance degradation in runtime when deployed on neural network accelerator (NNA) chips, which leverage highly parallelized fixed-point arithmetic to improve runtime memory and latency. In this work, we replicate the NNA operators during the training phase, accounting for the degradation due to low-precision inference on the NNA in back-propagation. Our proposed method efficiently emulates NNA operations, thus foregoing the need to transfer quantization error-prone data to the Central Processing Unit (CPU), ultimately reducing the user perceived latency (UPL). We apply our approach to Recurrent Neural Network-Transducer (RNN-T), an attractive architecture for on-device streaming speech recognition tasks. We train and evaluate models on 270K hours of English data and show a 5-7% improvement in engine latency while saving up to 10% relative degradation in WER."
Investigating the Sensitivity of Automatic Speech Recognition Systems to Phonetic Variation in L2 Englishes,"Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems exhibit the best performance on speech that is similar to that on which it was trained. As such, underrepresented varieties including regional dialects, minority-speakers, and low-resource languages, see much higher word error rates (WERs) than those varieties seen as 'prestigious', 'mainstream', or 'standard'. This can act as a barrier to incorporating ASR technology into the annotation process for large-scale linguistic research since the manual correction of the erroneous automated transcripts can be just as time and resource consuming as manual transcriptions. A deeper understanding of the behaviour of an ASR system is thus beneficial from a speech technology standpoint, in terms of improving ASR accuracy, and from an annotation standpoint, where knowing the likely errors made by an ASR system can aid in this manual correction. This work demonstrates a method of probing an ASR system to discover how it handles phonetic variation across a number of L2 Englishes. Specifically, how particular phonetic realisations which were rare or absent in the system's training data can lead to phoneme level misrecognitions and contribute to higher WERs. It is demonstrated that the behaviour of the ASR is systematic and consistent across speakers with similar spoken varieties (in this case the same L1) and phoneme substitution errors are typically in agreement with human annotators. By identifying problematic productions specific weaknesses can be addressed by sourcing such realisations for training and fine-tuning thus making the system more robust to pronunciation variation."
Learning Robust Self-attention Features for Speech Emotion Recognition with Label-adaptive Mixup,"Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is to recognize human emotions in a natural verbal interaction scenario with machines, which is considered as a challenging problem due to the ambiguous human emotions. Despite the recent progress in SER, state-of-the-art models struggle to achieve a satisfactory performance. We propose a self-attention based method with combined use of label-adaptive mixup and center loss. By adapting label probabilities in mixup and fitting center loss to the mixup training scheme, our proposed method achieves a superior performance to the state-of-the-art methods."
Robust Acoustic and Semantic Contextual Biasing in Neural Transducers for Speech Recognition,"Attention-based contextual biasing approaches have shown significant improvements in the recognition of generic and/or personal rare-words in End-to-End Automatic Speech Recognition (E2E ASR) systems like neural transducers. These approaches employ cross-attention to bias the model towards specific contextual entities injected as bias-phrases to the model. Prior approaches typically relied on subword encoders for encoding the bias phrases. However, subword tokenizations are coarse and fail to capture granular pronunciation information which is crucial for biasing based on acoustic similarity. In this work, we propose to use lightweight character representations to encode fine-grained pronunciation features to improve contextual biasing guided by acoustic similarity between the audio and the contextual entities (termed acoustic biasing). We further integrate pretrained neural language model (NLM) based encoders to encode the utterance's semantic context along with contextual entities to perform biasing informed by the utterance's semantic context (termed semantic biasing). Experiments using a Conformer Transducer model on the Librispeech dataset show a 4.62% - 9.26% relative WER improvement on different biasing list sizes over the baseline contextual model when incorporating our proposed acoustic and semantic biasing approach. On a large-scale in-house dataset, we observe 7.91% relative WER improvement compared to our baseline model. On tail utterances, the improvements are even more pronounced with 36.80% and 23.40% relative WER improvements on Librispeech rare words and an in-house testset respectively."
Fast Conformer with Linearly Scalable Attention for Efficient Speech Recognition,"Conformer-based models have become the most dominant end-to-end architecture for speech processing tasks. In this work, we propose a carefully redesigned Conformer with a new down-sampling schema. The proposed model, named Fast Conformer, is 2.8x faster than original Conformer, while preserving state-of-the-art accuracy on Automatic Speech Recognition benchmarks. Also we replace the original Conformer global attention with limited context attention post-training to enable transcription of an hour-long audio. We further improve long-form speech transcription by adding a global token. Fast Conformer combined with a Transformer decoder also outperforms the original Conformer in accuracy and in speed for Speech Translation and Spoken Language Understanding."
Multi-Temporal Lip-Audio Memory for Visual Speech Recognition,"Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) is a task to predict a sentence or word from lip movements. Some works have been recently presented which use audio signals to supplement visual information. However, existing methods utilize only limited information such as phoneme-level features and soft labels of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) networks. In this paper, we present a Multi-Temporal Lip-Audio Memory (MTLAM) that makes the best use of audio signals to complement insufficient information of lip movements. The proposed method is mainly composed of two parts: 1) MTLAM saves multi-temporal audio features produced from short- and long-term audio signals, and the MTLAM memorizes a visual-to-audio mapping to load stored multi-temporal audio features from visual features at the inference phase. 2) We design an audio temporal model to produce multi-temporal audio features capturing the context of neighboring words. In addition, to construct effective visual-to-audio mapping, the audio temporal models can generate audio features time-aligned with visual features. Through extensive experiments, we validate the effectiveness of the MTLAM achieving state-of-the-art performances on two public VSR datasets."
A vector quantized masked autoencoder for audiovisual speech emotion recognition,"While fully-supervised models have been shown to be effective for audiovisual speech emotion recognition (SER), the limited availability of labeled data remains a major challenge in the field. To address this issue, self-supervised learning approaches, such as masked autoencoders (MAEs), have gained popularity as potential solutions. In this paper, we propose the VQ-MAE-AV model, a vector quantized MAE specifically designed for audiovisual speech self-supervised representation learning. Unlike existing multimodal MAEs that rely on the processing of the raw audiovisual speech data, the proposed method employs a self-supervised paradigm based on discrete audio and visual speech representations learned by two pre-trained vector quantized variational autoencoders. Experimental results show that the proposed approach, which is pre-trained on the VoxCeleb2 database and fine-tuned on standard emotional audiovisual speech datasets, outperforms the state-of-the-art audiovisual SER methods."
Considerations for Ethical Speech Recognition Datasets,"Speech AI Technologies are largely trained on publicly available datasets or by the massive web-crawling of speech. In both cases, data acquisition focuses on minimizing collection effort, without necessarily taking the data subjects' protection or user needs into consideration. This results to models that are not robust when used on users who deviate from the dominant demographics in the training set, discriminating individuals having different dialects, accents, speaking styles, and disfluencies. In this talk, we use automatic speech recognition as a case study and examine the properties that ethical speech datasets should possess towards responsible AI applications. We showcase diversity issues, inclusion practices, and necessary considerations that can improve trained models, while facilitating model explainability and protecting users and data subjects. We argue for the legal & privacy protection of data subjects, targeted data sampling corresponding to user demographics & needs, appropriate meta data that ensure explainability & accountability in cases of model failure, and the sociotechnical \& situated model design. We hope this talk can inspire researchers \& practitioners to design and use more human-centric datasets in speech technologies and other domains, in ways that empower and respect users, while improving machine learning models' robustness and utility."
Lessons Learned in ATCO2: 5000 hours of Air Traffic Control Communications for Robust Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding,"Voice communication between air traffic controllers (ATCos) and pilots is critical for ensuring safe and efficient air traffic control (ATC). This task requires high levels of awareness from ATCos and can be tedious and error-prone. Recent attempts have been made to integrate artificial intelligence (AI) into ATC in order to reduce the workload of ATCos. However, the development of data-driven AI systems for ATC demands large-scale annotated datasets, which are currently lacking in the field. This paper explores the lessons learned from the ATCO2 project, a project that aimed to develop a unique platform to collect and preprocess large amounts of ATC data from airspace in real time. Audio and surveillance data were collected from publicly accessible radio frequency channels with VHF receivers owned by a community of volunteers and later uploaded to Opensky Network servers, which can be considered an ""unlimited source"" of data. In addition, this paper reviews previous work from ATCO2 partners, including (i) robust automatic speech recognition, (ii) natural language processing, (iii) English language identification of ATC communications, and (iv) the integration of surveillance data such as ADS-B. We believe that the pipeline developed during the ATCO2 project, along with the open-sourcing of its data, will encourage research in the ATC field. A sample of the ATCO2 corpus is available on the following website: https://www.atco2.org/data, while the full corpus can be purchased through ELDA at http://catalog.elra.info/en-us/repository/browse/ELRA-S0484. We demonstrated that ATCO2 is an appropriate dataset to develop ASR engines when little or near to no ATC in-domain data is available. For instance, with the CNN-TDNNf kaldi model, we reached the performance of as low as 17.9% and 24.9% WER on public ATC datasets which is 6.6/7.6% better than ""out-of-domain"" but supervised CNN-TDNNf model."
Emotions Beyond Words: Non-Speech Audio Emotion Recognition With Edge Computing,"Non-speech emotion recognition has a wide range of applications including healthcare, crime control and rescue, and entertainment, to name a few. Providing these applications using edge computing has great potential, however, recent studies are focused on speech-emotion recognition using complex architectures. In this paper, a non-speech-based emotion recognition system is proposed, which can rely on edge computing to analyse emotions conveyed through non-speech expressions like screaming and crying. In particular, we explore knowledge distillation to design a computationally efficient system that can be deployed on edge devices with limited resources without degrading the performance significantly. We comprehensively evaluate our proposed framework using two publicly available datasets and highlight its effectiveness by comparing the results with the well-known MobileNet model. Our results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of using edge computing for non-speech emotion detection, which can potentially improve applications that rely on emotion detection in communication networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on an edge-computing-based framework for detecting emotions in non-speech audio, offering promising directions for future research."
Deep Learning-based Spatio Temporal Facial Feature Visual Speech Recognition,"In low-resource computing contexts, such as smartphones and other tiny devices, Both deep learning and machine learning are being used in a lot of identification systems. as authentication techniques. The transparent, contactless, and non-invasive nature of these face recognition technologies driven by AI has led to their meteoric rise in popularity in recent years. While they are mostly successful, there are still methods to get inside without permission by utilising things like pictures, masks, glasses, etc. In this research, we present an alternate authentication process that makes use of both facial recognition and the individual's distinctive temporal facial feature motions while they speak a password. Because the suggested methodology allows for a password to be specified in any language, it is not limited by language. The suggested model attained an accuracy of 96.1% when tested on the industry-standard MIRACL-VC1 dataset, demonstrating its efficacy as a reliable and powerful solution. In addition to being data-efficient, the suggested technique shows promising outcomes with as little as 10 positive video examples for training the model. The effectiveness of the network's training is further proved via comparisons with other combined facial recognition and lip reading models."
Enhancing multilingual speech recognition in air traffic control by sentence-level language identification,"Automatic speech recognition (ASR) technique is becoming increasingly popular to improve the efficiency and safety of air traffic control (ATC) operations. However, the conversation between ATC controllers and pilots using multilingual speech brings a great challenge to building high-accuracy ASR systems. In this work, we present a two-stage multilingual ASR framework. The first stage is to train a language identifier (LID), that based on a recurrent neural network (RNN) to obtain sentence language identification in the form of one-hot encoding. The second stage aims to train an RNN-based end-to-end multilingual recognition model that utilizes sentence language features generated by LID to enhance input features. In this work, We introduce Featurewise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to improve the performance of multilingual ASR by utilizing sentence language identification. Furthermore, we introduce a new sentence language identification learning module called SLIL, which consists of a FiLM layer and a Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks layer. Extensive experiments on the ATCSpeech dataset show that our proposed method outperforms the baseline model. Compared to the vanilla FiLMed backbone model, the proposed multilingual ASR model obtains about 7.50% character error rate relative performance improvement."
Deep Transfer Learning for Automatic Speech Recognition: Towards Better Generalization,"Automatic speech recognition (ASR) has recently become an important challenge when using deep learning (DL). It requires large-scale training datasets and high computational and storage resources. Moreover, DL techniques and machine learning (ML) approaches in general, hypothesize that training and testing data come from the same domain, with the same input feature space and data distribution characteristics. This assumption, however, is not applicable in some real-world artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Moreover, there are situations where gathering real data is challenging, expensive, or rarely occurring, which can not meet the data requirements of DL models. deep transfer learning (DTL) has been introduced to overcome these issues, which helps develop high-performing models using real datasets that are small or slightly different but related to the training data. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of DTL-based ASR frameworks to shed light on the latest developments and helps academics and professionals understand current challenges. Specifically, after presenting the DTL background, a well-designed taxonomy is adopted to inform the state-of-the-art. A critical analysis is then conducted to identify the limitations and advantages of each framework. Moving on, a comparative study is introduced to highlight the current challenges before deriving opportunities for future research."
Self-regularised Minimum Latency Training for Streaming Transformer-based Speech Recognition,"This paper proposes a self-regularised minimum latency training (SR-MLT) method for streaming Transformer-based automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. In previous works, latency was optimised by truncating the online attention weights based on the hard alignments obtained from conventional ASR models, without taking into account the potential loss of ASR accuracy. On the contrary, here we present a strategy to obtain the alignments as a part of the model training without external supervision. The alignments produced by the proposed method are dynamically regularised on the training data, such that the latency reduction does not result in the loss of ASR accuracy. SR-MLT is applied as a fine-tuning step on the pre-trained Transformer models that are based on either monotonic chunkwise attention (MoChA) or cumulative attention (CA) algorithms for online decoding. ASR experiments on the AIShell-1 and Librispeech datasets show that when applied on a decent pre-trained MoChA or CA baseline model, SR-MLT can effectively reduce the latency with the relative gains ranging from 11.8% to 39.5%. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that under certain accuracy levels, the models trained with SR-MLT can achieve lower latency when compared to those supervised using external hard alignments."
A Comparative Study of Pre-trained Speech and Audio Embeddings for Speech Emotion Recognition,"Pre-trained models (PTMs) have shown great promise in the speech and audio domain. Embeddings leveraged from these models serve as inputs for learning algorithms with applications in various downstream tasks. One such crucial task is Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) which has a wide range of applications, including dynamic analysis of customer calls, mental health assessment, and personalized language learning. PTM embeddings have helped advance SER, however, a comprehensive comparison of these PTM embeddings that consider multiple facets such as embedding model architecture, data used for pre-training, and the pre-training procedure being followed is missing. A thorough comparison of PTM embeddings will aid in the faster and more efficient development of models and enable their deployment in real-world scenarios. In this work, we exploit this research gap and perform a comparative analysis of embeddings extracted from eight speech and audio PTMs (wav2vec 2.0, data2vec, wavLM, UniSpeech-SAT, wav2clip, YAMNet, x-vector, ECAPA). We perform an extensive empirical analysis with four speech emotion datasets (CREMA-D, TESS, SAVEE, Emo-DB) by training three algorithms (XGBoost, Random Forest, FCN) on the derived embeddings. The results of our study indicate that the best performance is achieved by algorithms trained on embeddings derived from PTMs trained for speaker recognition followed by wav2clip and UniSpeech-SAT. This can relay that the top performance by embeddings from speaker recognition PTMs is most likely due to the model taking up information about numerous speech features such as tone, accent, pitch, and so on during its speaker recognition training. Insights from this work will assist future studies in their selection of embeddings for applications related to SER."
A vector quantized masked autoencoder for speech emotion recognition,"Recent years have seen remarkable progress in speech emotion recognition (SER), thanks to advances in deep learning techniques. However, the limited availability of labeled data remains a significant challenge in the field. Self-supervised learning has recently emerged as a promising solution to address this challenge. In this paper, we propose the vector quantized masked autoencoder for speech (VQ-MAE-S), a self-supervised model that is fine-tuned to recognize emotions from speech signals. The VQ-MAE-S model is based on a masked autoencoder (MAE) that operates in the discrete latent space of a vector-quantized variational autoencoder. Experimental results show that the proposed VQ-MAE-S model, pre-trained on the VoxCeleb2 dataset and fine-tuned on emotional speech data, outperforms an MAE working on the raw spectrogram representation and other state-of-the-art methods in SER."
Non-autoregressive End-to-end Approaches for Joint Automatic Speech Recognition and Spoken Language Understanding,"This paper presents the use of non-autoregressive (NAR) approaches for joint automatic speech recognition (ASR) and spoken language understanding (SLU) tasks. The proposed NAR systems employ a Conformer encoder that applies connectionist temporal classification (CTC) to transcribe the speech utterance into raw ASR hypotheses, which are further refined with a bidirectional encoder representations from Transformers (BERT)-like decoder. In the meantime, the intent and slot labels of the utterance are predicted simultaneously using the same decoder. Both Mask-CTC and self-conditioned CTC (SC-CTC) approaches are explored for this study. Experiments conducted on the SLURP dataset show that the proposed SC-Mask-CTC NAR system achieves 3.7% and 3.2% absolute gains in SLU metrics and a competitive level of ASR accuracy, when compared to a Conformer-Transformer based autoregressive (AR) model. Additionally, the NAR systems achieve 6x faster decoding speed than the AR baseline."
Approximate Nearest Neighbour Phrase Mining for Contextual Speech Recognition,"This paper presents an extension to train end-to-end Context-Aware Transformer Transducer ( CATT ) models by using a simple, yet efficient method of mining hard negative phrases from the latent space of the context encoder. During training, given a reference query, we mine a number of similar phrases using approximate nearest neighbour search. These sampled phrases are then used as negative examples in the context list alongside random and ground truth contextual information. By including approximate nearest neighbour phrases (ANN-P) in the context list, we encourage the learned representation to disambiguate between similar, but not identical, biasing phrases. This improves biasing accuracy when there are several similar phrases in the biasing inventory. We carry out experiments in a large-scale data regime obtaining up to 7% relative word error rate reductions for the contextual portion of test data. We also extend and evaluate CATT approach in streaming applications."
Political corpus creation through automatic speech recognition on EU debates,"In this paper, we present a transcribed corpus of the LIBE committee of the EU parliament, totalling 3.6 Million running words. The meetings of parliamentary committees of the EU are a potentially valuable source of information for political scientists but the data is not readily available because only disclosed as speech recordings together with limited metadata. The meetings are in English, partly spoken by non-native speakers, and partly spoken by interpreters. We investigated the most appropriate Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model to create an accurate text transcription of the audio recordings of the meetings in order to make their content available for research and analysis. We focused on the unsupervised domain adaptation of the ASR pipeline. Building on the transformer-based Wav2vec2.0 model, we experimented with multiple acoustic models, language models and the addition of domain-specific terms. We found that a domain-specific acoustic model and a domain-specific language model give substantial improvements to the ASR output, reducing the word error rate (WER) from 28.22 to 17.95. The use of domain-specific terms in the decoding stage did not have a positive effect on the quality of the ASR in terms of WER. Initial topic modelling results indicated that the corpus is useful for downstream analysis tasks. We release the resulting corpus and our analysis pipeline for future research."
A CTC Alignment-based Non-autoregressive Transformer for End-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition,"Recently, end-to-end models have been widely used in automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Two of the most representative approaches are connectionist temporal classification (CTC) and attention-based encoder-decoder (AED) models. Autoregressive transformers, variants of AED, adopt an autoregressive mechanism for token generation and thus are relatively slow during inference. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of a CTC Alignment-based Single-Step Non-Autoregressive Transformer (CASS-NAT) for end-to-end ASR. In CASS-NAT, word embeddings in the autoregressive transformer (AT) are substituted with token-level acoustic embeddings (TAE) that are extracted from encoder outputs with the acoustical boundary information offered by the CTC alignment. TAE can be obtained in parallel, resulting in a parallel generation of output tokens. During training, Viterbi-alignment is used for TAE generation, and multiple training strategies are further explored to improve the word error rate (WER) performance. During inference, an error-based alignment sampling method is investigated in depth to reduce the alignment mismatch in the training and testing processes. Experimental results show that the CASS-NAT has a WER that is close to AT on various ASR tasks, while providing a ~24x inference speedup. With and without self-supervised learning, we achieve new state-of-the-art results for non-autoregressive models on several datasets. We also analyze the behavior of the CASS-NAT decoder to explain why it can perform similarly to AT. We find that TAEs have similar functionality to word embeddings for grammatical structures, which might indicate the possibility of learning some semantic information from TAEs without a language model."
Sim-T: Simplify the Transformer Network by Multiplexing Technique for Speech Recognition,"In recent years, a great deal of attention has been paid to the Transformer network for speech recognition tasks due to its excellent model performance. However, the Transformer network always involves heavy computation and large number of parameters, causing serious deployment problems in devices with limited computation sources or storage memory. In this paper, a new lightweight model called Sim-T has been proposed to expand the generality of the Transformer model. Under the help of the newly developed multiplexing technique, the Sim-T can efficiently compress the model with negligible sacrifice on its performance. To be more precise, the proposed technique includes two parts, that are, module weight multiplexing and attention score multiplexing. Moreover, a novel decoder structure has been proposed to facilitate the attention score multiplexing. Extensive experiments have been conducted to validate the effectiveness of Sim-T. In Aishell-1 dataset, when the proposed Sim-T is 48% parameter less than the baseline Transformer, 0.4% CER improvement can be obtained. Alternatively, 69% parameter reduction can be achieved if the Sim-T gives the same performance as the baseline Transformer. With regard to the HKUST and WSJ eval92 datasets, CER and WER will be improved by 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively, when parameters in Sim-T are 40% less than the baseline Transformer."
An Empirical Study and Improvement for Speech Emotion Recognition,"Multimodal speech emotion recognition aims to detect speakers' emotions from audio and text. Prior works mainly focus on exploiting advanced networks to model and fuse different modality information to facilitate performance, while neglecting the effect of different fusion strategies on emotion recognition. In this work, we consider a simple yet important problem: how to fuse audio and text modality information is more helpful for this multimodal task. Further, we propose a multimodal emotion recognition model improved by perspective loss. Empirical results show our method obtained new state-of-the-art results on the IEMOCAP dataset. The in-depth analysis explains why the improved model can achieve improvements and outperforms baselines."
Dual-Attention Neural Transducers for Efficient Wake Word Spotting in Speech Recognition,"We present dual-attention neural biasing, an architecture designed to boost Wake Words (WW) recognition and improve inference time latency on speech recognition tasks. This architecture enables a dynamic switch for its runtime compute paths by exploiting WW spotting to select which branch of its attention networks to execute for an input audio frame. With this approach, we effectively improve WW spotting accuracy while saving runtime compute cost as defined by floating point operations (FLOPs). Using an in-house de-identified dataset, we demonstrate that the proposed dual-attention network can reduce the compute cost by 90\% for WW audio frames, with only 1\% increase in the number of parameters. This architecture improves WW F1 score by 16\% relative and improves generic rare word error rate by 3\% relative compared to the baselines."
Designing and Evaluating Speech Emotion Recognition Systems: A reality check case study with IEMOCAP,"There is an imminent need for guidelines and standard test sets to allow direct and fair comparisons of speech emotion recognition (SER). While resources, such as the Interactive Emotional Dyadic Motion Capture (IEMOCAP) database, have emerged as widely-adopted reference corpora for researchers to develop and test models for SER, published work reveals a wide range of assumptions and variety in its use that challenge reproducibility and generalization. Based on a critical review of the latest advances in SER using IEMOCAP as the use case, our work aims at two contributions: First, using an analysis of the recent literature, including assumptions made and metrics used therein, we provide a set of SER evaluation guidelines. Second, using recent publications with open-sourced implementations, we focus on reproducibility assessment in SER."
Dialog act guided contextual adapter for personalized speech recognition,"Personalization in multi-turn dialogs has been a long standing challenge for end-to-end automatic speech recognition (E2E ASR) models. Recent work on contextual adapters has tackled rare word recognition using user catalogs. This adaptation, however, does not incorporate an important cue, the dialog act, which is available in a multi-turn dialog scenario. In this work, we propose a dialog act guided contextual adapter network. Specifically, it leverages dialog acts to select the most relevant user catalogs and creates queries based on both -- the audio as well as the semantic relationship between the carrier phrase and user catalogs to better guide the contextual biasing. On industrial voice assistant datasets, our model outperforms both the baselines - dialog act encoder-only model, and the contextual adaptation, leading to the most improvement over the no-context model: 58% average relative word error rate reduction (WERR) in the multi-turn dialog scenario, in comparison to the prior-art contextual adapter, which has achieved 39% WERR over the no-context model."
SynthVSR: Scaling Up Visual Speech Recognition With Synthetic Supervision,"Recently reported state-of-the-art results in visual speech recognition (VSR) often rely on increasingly large amounts of video data, while the publicly available transcribed video datasets are limited in size. In this paper, for the first time, we study the potential of leveraging synthetic visual data for VSR. Our method, termed SynthVSR, substantially improves the performance of VSR systems with synthetic lip movements. The key idea behind SynthVSR is to leverage a speech-driven lip animation model that generates lip movements conditioned on the input speech. The speech-driven lip animation model is trained on an unlabeled audio-visual dataset and could be further optimized towards a pre-trained VSR model when labeled videos are available. As plenty of transcribed acoustic data and face images are available, we are able to generate large-scale synthetic data using the proposed lip animation model for semi-supervised VSR training. We evaluate the performance of our approach on the largest public VSR benchmark - Lip Reading Sentences 3 (LRS3). SynthVSR achieves a WER of 43.3% with only 30 hours of real labeled data, outperforming off-the-shelf approaches using thousands of hours of video. The WER is further reduced to 27.9% when using all 438 hours of labeled data from LRS3, which is on par with the state-of-the-art self-supervised AV-HuBERT method. Furthermore, when combined with large-scale pseudo-labeled audio-visual data SynthVSR yields a new state-of-the-art VSR WER of 16.9% using publicly available data only, surpassing the recent state-of-the-art approaches trained with 29 times more non-public machine-transcribed video data (90,000 hours). Finally, we perform extensive ablation studies to understand the effect of each component in our proposed method."
PROCTER: PROnunciation-aware ConTextual adaptER for personalized speech recognition in neural transducers,"End-to-End (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems used in voice assistants often have difficulties recognizing infrequent words personalized to the user, such as names and places. Rare words often have non-trivial pronunciations, and in such cases, human knowledge in the form of a pronunciation lexicon can be useful. We propose a PROnunCiation-aware conTextual adaptER (PROCTER) that dynamically injects lexicon knowledge into an RNN-T model by adding a phonemic embedding along with a textual embedding. The experimental results show that the proposed PROCTER architecture outperforms the baseline RNN-T model by improving the word error rate (WER) by 44% and 57% when measured on personalized entities and personalized rare entities, respectively, while increasing the model size (number of trainable parameters) by only 1%. Furthermore, when evaluated in a zero-shot setting to recognize personalized device names, we observe 7% WER improvement with PROCTER, as compared to only 1% WER improvement with text-only contextual attention"
Auto-AVSR: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition with Automatic Labels,"Audio-visual speech recognition has received a lot of attention due to its robustness against acoustic noise. Recently, the performance of automatic, visual, and audio-visual speech recognition (ASR, VSR, and AV-ASR, respectively) has been substantially improved, mainly due to the use of larger models and training sets. However, accurate labelling of datasets is time-consuming and expensive. Hence, in this work, we investigate the use of automatically-generated transcriptions of unlabelled datasets to increase the training set size. For this purpose, we use publicly-available pre-trained ASR models to automatically transcribe unlabelled datasets such as AVSpeech and VoxCeleb2. Then, we train ASR, VSR and AV-ASR models on the augmented training set, which consists of the LRS2 and LRS3 datasets as well as the additional automatically-transcribed data. We demonstrate that increasing the size of the training set, a recent trend in the literature, leads to reduced WER despite using noisy transcriptions. The proposed model achieves new state-of-the-art performance on AV-ASR on LRS2 and LRS3. In particular, it achieves a WER of 0.9% on LRS3, a relative improvement of 30% over the current state-of-the-art approach, and outperforms methods that have been trained on non-publicly available datasets with 26 times more training data."
Enhancing Unsupervised Speech Recognition with Diffusion GANs,"We enhance the vanilla adversarial training method for unsupervised Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) by a diffusion-GAN. Our model (1) injects instance noises of various intensities to the generator's output and unlabeled reference text which are sampled from pretrained phoneme language models with a length constraint, (2) asks diffusion timestep-dependent discriminators to separate them, and (3) back-propagates the gradients to update the generator. Word/phoneme error rate comparisons with wav2vec-U under Librispeech (3.1% for test-clean and 5.6% for test-other), TIMIT and MLS datasets, show that our enhancement strategies work effectively."
Pyramid Multi-branch Fusion DCNN with Multi-Head Self-Attention for Mandarin Speech Recognition,"As one of the major branches of automatic speech recognition, attention-based models greatly improves the feature representation ability of the model. In particular, the multi-head mechanism is employed in the attention, hoping to learn speech features of more aspects in different attention subspaces. For speech recognition of complex languages, on the one hand, a small head size will lead to an obvious shortage of learnable aspects. On the other hand, we need to reduce the dimension of each subspace to keep the size of the overall feature space unchanged when we increase the number of heads, which will significantly weaken the ability to represent the feature of each subspace. Therefore, this paper explores how to use a small attention subspace to represent complete speech features while ensuring many heads. In this work we propose a novel neural network architecture, namely, pyramid multi-branch fusion DCNN with multi-head self-attention. The proposed architecture is inspired by Dilated Convolution Neural Networks (DCNN), it uses multiple branches with DCNN to extract the feature of the input speech under different receptive fields. To reduce the number of parameters, every two branches are merged until all the branches are merged into one. Thus, its shape is like a pyramid rotated 90 degrees. We demonstrate that on Aishell-1, a widely used Mandarin speech dataset, our model achieves a character error rate (CER) of 6.45% on the test sets."
Beyond Universal Transformer: block reusing with adaptor in Transformer for automatic speech recognition,"Transformer-based models have recently made significant achievements in the application of end-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR). It is possible to deploy the E2E ASR system on smart devices with the help of Transformer-based models. While these models still have the disadvantage of requiring a large number of model parameters. To overcome the drawback of universal Transformer models for the application of ASR on edge devices, we propose a solution that can reuse the block in Transformer models for the occasion of the small footprint ASR system, which meets the objective of accommodating resource limitations without compromising recognition accuracy. Specifically, we design a novel block-reusing strategy for speech Transformer (BRST) to enhance the effectiveness of parameters and propose an adapter module (ADM) that can produce a compact and adaptable model with only a few additional trainable parameters accompanying each reusing block. We conducted an experiment with the proposed method on the public AISHELL-1 corpus, and the results show that the proposed approach achieves the character error rate (CER) of 9.3%/6.63% with only 7.6M/8.3M parameters without and with the ADM, respectively. In addition, we also make a deeper analysis to show the effect of ADM in the general block-reusing method."
Exploring Turkish Speech Recognition via Hybrid CTC/Attention Architecture and Multi-feature Fusion Network,"In recent years, End-to-End speech recognition technology based on deep learning has developed rapidly. Due to the lack of Turkish speech data, the performance of Turkish speech recognition system is poor. Firstly, this paper studies a series of speech recognition tuning technologies. The results show that the performance of the model is the best when the data enhancement technology combining speed perturbation with noise addition is adopted and the beam search width is set to 16. Secondly, to maximize the use of effective feature information and improve the accuracy of feature extraction, this paper proposes a new feature extractor LSPC. LSPC and LiGRU network are combined to form a shared encoder structure, and model compression is realized. The results show that the performance of LSPC is better than MSPC and VGGnet when only using Fbank features, and the WER is improved by 1.01% and 2.53% respectively. Finally, based on the above two points, a new multi-feature fusion network is proposed as the main structure of the encoder. The results show that the WER of the proposed feature fusion network based on LSPC is improved by 0.82% and 1.94% again compared with the single feature (Fbank feature and Spectrogram feature) extraction using LSPC. Our model achieves performance comparable to that of advanced End-to-End models."
Knowledge Distillation from Multiple Foundation Models for End-to-End Speech Recognition,"Although large foundation models pre-trained by self-supervised learning have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many tasks including automatic speech recognition (ASR), knowledge distillation (KD) is often required in practice to transfer the knowledge learned by large teacher models into much smaller student models with affordable computation and memory costs. This paper proposes a novel two-stage KD framework to distil the knowledge from multiple speech foundation models as teachers into a single student neural transducer model for ASR. In the first stage, the student model encoder is pre-trained using the embeddings extracted from multiple teacher models. In the second stage, the student encoder is fine-tuned with the audio-text pairs based on the ASR task. Experiments on the LibriSpeech 100-hour subset show that the proposed KD framework improves the performance of both streaming and non-streaming student models when using only one teacher. The performance of the student model can be further enhanced when multiple teachers are used jointly, achieving word error rate reductions (WERRs) of 17.5% and 10.6%. Our proposed framework can be combined with other existing KD methods to achieve further improvements. Further WERRs were obtained by incorporating extra unlabelled data during encoder pre-training, leading to a total relative WERR of 55.0% on the non-streaming student model."
A Deep Learning System for Domain-specific speech Recognition,"As human-machine voice interfaces provide easy access to increasingly intelligent machines, many state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems are proposed. However, commercial ASR systems usually have poor performance on domain-specific speech especially under low-resource settings. The author works with pre-trained DeepSpeech2 and Wav2Vec2 acoustic models to develop benefit-specific ASR systems. The domain-specific data are collected using proposed semi-supervised learning annotation with little human intervention. The best performance comes from a fine-tuned Wav2Vec2-Large-LV60 acoustic model with an external KenLM, which surpasses the Google and AWS ASR systems on benefit-specific speech. The viability of using error prone ASR transcriptions as part of spoken language understanding (SLU) is also investigated. Results of a benefit-specific natural language understanding (NLU) task show that the domain-specific fine-tuned ASR system can outperform the commercial ASR systems even when its transcriptions have higher word error rate (WER), and the results between fine-tuned ASR and human transcriptions are similar."
Watch or Listen: Robust Audio-Visual Speech Recognition with Visual Corruption Modeling and Reliability Scoring,"This paper deals with Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) under multimodal input corruption situations where audio inputs and visual inputs are both corrupted, which is not well addressed in previous research directions. Previous studies have focused on how to complement the corrupted audio inputs with the clean visual inputs with the assumption of the availability of clean visual inputs. However, in real life, clean visual inputs are not always accessible and can even be corrupted by occluded lip regions or noises. Thus, we firstly analyze that the previous AVSR models are not indeed robust to the corruption of multimodal input streams, the audio and the visual inputs, compared to uni-modal models. Then, we design multimodal input corruption modeling to develop robust AVSR models. Lastly, we propose a novel AVSR framework, namely Audio-Visual Reliability Scoring module (AV-RelScore), that is robust to the corrupted multimodal inputs. The AV-RelScore can determine which input modal stream is reliable or not for the prediction and also can exploit the more reliable streams in prediction. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated with comprehensive experiments on popular benchmark databases, LRS2 and LRS3. We also show that the reliability scores obtained by AV-RelScore well reflect the degree of corruption and make the proposed model focus on the reliable multimodal representations."
Sharing Low Rank Conformer Weights for Tiny Always-On Ambient Speech Recognition Models,"Continued improvements in machine learning techniques offer exciting new opportunities through the use of larger models and larger training datasets. However, there is a growing need to offer these new capabilities on-board low-powered devices such as smartphones, wearables and other embedded environments where only low memory is available. Towards this, we consider methods to reduce the model size of Conformer-based speech recognition models which typically require models with greater than 100M parameters down to just 5M parameters while minimizing impact on model quality. Such a model allows us to achieve always-on ambient speech recognition on edge devices with low-memory neural processors. We propose model weight reuse at different levels within our model architecture: (i) repeating full conformer block layers, (ii) sharing specific conformer modules across layers, (iii) sharing sub-components per conformer module, and (iv) sharing decomposed sub-component weights after low-rank decomposition. By sharing weights at different levels of our model, we can retain the full model in-memory while increasing the number of virtual transformations applied to the input. Through a series of ablation studies and evaluations, we find that with weight sharing and a low-rank architecture, we can achieve a WER of 2.84 and 2.94 for Librispeech dev-clean and test-clean respectively with a 5M parameter model."
A large-scale multimodal dataset of human speech recognition,"Nowadays, non-privacy small-scale motion detection has attracted an increasing amount of research in remote sensing in speech recognition. These new modalities are employed to enhance and restore speech information from speakers of multiple types of data. In this paper, we propose a dataset contains 7.5 GHz Channel Impulse Response (CIR) data from ultra-wideband (UWB) radars, 77-GHz frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) data from millimetre wave (mmWave) radar, and laser data. Meanwhile, a depth camera is adopted to record the landmarks of the subject's lip and voice. Approximately 400 minutes of annotated speech profiles are provided, which are collected from 20 participants speaking 5 vowels, 15 words and 16 sentences. The dataset has been validated and has potential for the research of lip reading and multimodal speech recognition."
Improving Accented Speech Recognition with Multi-Domain Training,"Thanks to the rise of self-supervised learning, automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems now achieve near-human performance on a wide variety of datasets. However, they still lack generalization capability and are not robust to domain shifts like accent variations. In this work, we use speech audio representing four different French accents to create fine-tuning datasets that improve the robustness of pre-trained ASR models. By incorporating various accents in the training set, we obtain both in-domain and out-of-domain improvements. Our numerical experiments show that we can reduce error rates by up to 25% (relative) on African and Belgian accents compared to single-domain training while keeping a good performance on standard French."
I3D: Transformer architectures with input-dependent dynamic depth for speech recognition,"Transformer-based end-to-end speech recognition has achieved great success. However, the large footprint and computational overhead make it difficult to deploy these models in some real-world applications. Model compression techniques can reduce the model size and speed up inference, but the compressed model has a fixed architecture which might be suboptimal. We propose a novel Transformer encoder with Input-Dependent Dynamic Depth (I3D) to achieve strong performance-efficiency trade-offs. With a similar number of layers at inference time, I3D-based models outperform the vanilla Transformer and the static pruned model via iterative layer pruning. We also present interesting analysis on the gate probabilities and the input-dependency, which helps us better understand deep encoders."
The Multimodal Information based Speech Processing (MISP) 2022 Challenge: Audio-Visual Diarization and Recognition,"The Multi-modal Information based Speech Processing (MISP) challenge aims to extend the application of signal processing technology in specific scenarios by promoting the research into wake-up words, speaker diarization, speech recognition, and other technologies. The MISP2022 challenge has two tracks: 1) audio-visual speaker diarization (AVSD), aiming to solve ``who spoken when'' using both audio and visual data; 2) a novel audio-visual diarization and recognition (AVDR) task that focuses on addressing ``who spoken what when'' with audio-visual speaker diarization results. Both tracks focus on the Chinese language, and use far-field audio and video in real home-tv scenarios: 2-6 people communicating each other with TV noise in the background. This paper introduces the dataset, track settings, and baselines of the MISP2022 challenge. Our analyses of experiments and examples indicate the good performance of AVDR baseline system, and the potential difficulties in this challenge due to, e.g., the far-field video quality, the presence of TV noise in the background, and the indistinguishable speakers."
wav2vec and its current potential to Automatic Speech Recognition in German for the usage in Digital History: A comparative assessment of available ASR-technologies for the use in cultural heritage contexts,"In this case study we trained and published a state-of-the-art open-source model for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) for German to evaluate the current potential of this technology for the use in the larger context of Digital Humanities and cultural heritage indexation. Along with this paper we publish our wav2vec2 based speech to text model while we evaluate its performance on a corpus of historical recordings we assembled compared against commercial cloud-based and proprietary services. While our model achieves moderate results, we see that proprietary cloud services fare significantly better. As our results show, recognition rates over 90 percent can currently be achieved, however, these numbers drop quickly once the recordings feature limited audio quality or use of non-every day or outworn language. A big issue is the high variety of different dialects and accents in the German language. Nevertheless, this paper highlights that the currently available quality of recognition is high enough to address various use cases in the Digital Humanities. We argue that ASR will become a key technology for the documentation and analysis of audio-visual sources and identify an array of important questions that the DH community and cultural heritage stakeholders will have to address in the near future."
MIXPGD: Hybrid Adversarial Training for Speech Recognition Systems,"Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems based on deep neural networks are weak against adversarial perturbations. We propose mixPGD adversarial training method to improve the robustness of the model for ASR systems. In standard adversarial training, adversarial samples are generated by leveraging supervised or unsupervised methods. We merge the capabilities of both supervised and unsupervised approaches in our method to generate new adversarial samples which aid in improving model robustness. Extensive experiments and comparison across various state-of-the-art defense methods and adversarial attacks have been performed to show that mixPGD gains 4.1% WER of better performance than previous best performing models under white-box adversarial attack setting. We tested our proposed defense method against both white-box and transfer based black-box attack settings to ensure that our defense strategy is robust against various types of attacks. Empirical results on several adversarial attacks validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach."
Clinical BERTScore: An Improved Measure of Automatic Speech Recognition Performance in Clinical Settings,"Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) in medical contexts has the potential to save time, cut costs, increase report accuracy, and reduce physician burnout. However, the healthcare industry has been slower to adopt this technology, in part due to the importance of avoiding medically-relevant transcription mistakes. In this work, we present the Clinical BERTScore (CBERTScore), an ASR metric that penalizes clinically-relevant mistakes more than others. We demonstrate that this metric more closely aligns with clinician preferences on medical sentences as compared to other metrics (WER, BLUE, METEOR, etc), sometimes by wide margins. We collect a benchmark of 18 clinician preferences on 149 realistic medical sentences called the Clinician Transcript Preference benchmark (CTP) and make it publicly available for the community to further develop clinically-aware ASR metrics. To our knowledge, this is the first public dataset of its kind. We demonstrate that CBERTScore more closely matches what clinicians prefer."
MixSpeech: Cross-Modality Self-Learning with Audio-Visual Stream Mixup for Visual Speech Translation and Recognition,"Multi-media communications facilitate global interaction among people. However, despite researchers exploring cross-lingual translation techniques such as machine translation and audio speech translation to overcome language barriers, there is still a shortage of cross-lingual studies on visual speech. This lack of research is mainly due to the absence of datasets containing visual speech and translated text pairs. In this paper, we present \textbf{AVMuST-TED}, the first dataset for \textbf{A}udio-\textbf{V}isual \textbf{Mu}ltilingual \textbf{S}peech \textbf{T}ranslation, derived from \textbf{TED} talks. Nonetheless, visual speech is not as distinguishable as audio speech, making it difficult to develop a mapping from source speech phonemes to the target language text. To address this issue, we propose MixSpeech, a cross-modality self-learning framework that utilizes audio speech to regularize the training of visual speech tasks. To further minimize the cross-modality gap and its impact on knowledge transfer, we suggest adopting mixed speech, which is created by interpolating audio and visual streams, along with a curriculum learning strategy to adjust the mixing ratio as needed. MixSpeech enhances speech translation in noisy environments, improving BLEU scores for four languages on AVMuST-TED by +1.4 to +4.2. Moreover, it achieves state-of-the-art performance in lip reading on CMLR (11.1\%), LRS2 (25.5\%), and LRS3 (28.0\%)."
hierarchical network with decoupled knowledge distillation for speech emotion recognition,"The goal of Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is to enable computers to recognize the emotion category of a given utterance in the same way that humans do. The accuracy of SER is strongly dependent on the validity of the utterance-level representation obtained by the model. Nevertheless, the ``dark knowledge"" carried by non-target classes is always ignored by previous studies. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical network, called DKDFMH, which employs decoupled knowledge distillation in a deep convolutional neural network with a fused multi-head attention mechanism. Our approach applies logit distillation to obtain higher-level semantic features from different scales of attention sets and delve into the knowledge carried by non-target classes, thus guiding the model to focus more on the differences between sentiment features. To validate the effectiveness of our model, we conducted experiments on the Interactive Emotional Dyadic Motion Capture (IEMOCAP) dataset. We achieved competitive performance, with 79.1% weighted accuracy (WA) and 77.1% unweighted accuracy (UA). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time since 2015 that logit distillation has been returned to state-of-the-art status."
End-to-End Speech Recognition: A Survey,"In the last decade of automatic speech recognition (ASR) research, the introduction of deep learning brought considerable reductions in word error rate of more than 50% relative, compared to modeling without deep learning. In the wake of this transition, a number of all-neural ASR architectures were introduced. These so-called end-to-end (E2E) models provide highly integrated, completely neural ASR models, which rely strongly on general machine learning knowledge, learn more consistently from data, while depending less on ASR domain-specific experience. The success and enthusiastic adoption of deep learning accompanied by more generic model architectures lead to E2E models now becoming the prominent ASR approach. The goal of this survey is to provide a taxonomy of E2E ASR models and corresponding improvements, and to discuss their properties and their relation to the classical hidden Markov model (HMM) based ASR architecture. All relevant aspects of E2E ASR are covered in this work: modeling, training, decoding, and external language model integration, accompanied by discussions of performance and deployment opportunities, as well as an outlook into potential future developments."
DWFormer: Dynamic Window transFormer for Speech Emotion Recognition,"Speech emotion recognition is crucial to human-computer interaction. The temporal regions that represent different emotions scatter in different parts of the speech locally. Moreover, the temporal scales of important information may vary over a large range within and across speech segments. Although transformer-based models have made progress in this field, the existing models could not precisely locate important regions at different temporal scales. To address the issue, we propose Dynamic Window transFormer (DWFormer), a new architecture that leverages temporal importance by dynamically splitting samples into windows. Self-attention mechanism is applied within windows for capturing temporal important information locally in a fine-grained way. Cross-window information interaction is also taken into account for global communication. DWFormer is evaluated on both the IEMOCAP and the MELD datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed model achieves better performance than the previous state-of-the-art methods."
Language-Universal Adapter Learning with Knowledge Distillation for End-to-End Multilingual Speech Recognition,"In this paper, we propose a language-universal adapter learning framework based on a pre-trained model for end-to-end multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR). For acoustic modeling, the wav2vec 2.0 pre-trained model is fine-tuned by inserting language-specific and language-universal adapters. An online knowledge distillation is then used to enable the language-universal adapters to learn both language-specific and universal features. The linguistic information confusion is also reduced by leveraging language identifiers (LIDs). With LIDs we perform a position-wise modification on the multi-head attention outputs. In the inference procedure, the language-specific adapters are removed while the language-universal adapters are kept activated. The proposed method improves the recognition accuracy and addresses the linear increase of the number of adapters' parameters with the number of languages in common multilingual ASR systems. Experiments on the BABEL dataset confirm the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Compared to the conventional multilingual model, a 3.3% absolute error rate reduction is achieved. The code is available at: https://github.com/shen9712/UniversalAdapterLearning."
Google USM: Scaling Automatic Speech Recognition Beyond 100 Languages,"We introduce the Universal Speech Model (USM), a single large model that performs automatic speech recognition (ASR) across 100+ languages. This is achieved by pre-training the encoder of the model on a large unlabeled multilingual dataset of 12 million (M) hours spanning over 300 languages, and fine-tuning on a smaller labeled dataset. We use multilingual pre-training with random-projection quantization and speech-text modality matching to achieve state-of-the-art performance on downstream multilingual ASR and speech-to-text translation tasks. We also demonstrate that despite using a labeled training set 1/7-th the size of that used for the Whisper model, our model exhibits comparable or better performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain speech recognition tasks across many languages."
Synthetic Cross-accent Data Augmentation for Automatic Speech Recognition,"The awareness for biased ASR datasets or models has increased notably in recent years. Even for English, despite a vast amount of available training data, systems perform worse for non-native speakers. In this work, we improve an accent-conversion model (ACM) which transforms native US-English speech into accented pronunciation. We include phonetic knowledge in the ACM training to provide accurate feedback about how well certain pronunciation patterns were recovered in the synthesized waveform. Furthermore, we investigate the feasibility of learned accent representations instead of static embeddings. Generated data was then used to train two state-of-the-art ASR systems. We evaluated our approach on native and non-native English datasets and found that synthetically accented data helped the ASR to better understand speech from seen accents. This observation did not translate to unseen accents, and it was not observed for a model that had been pre-trained exclusively with native speech."
MuAViC: A Multilingual Audio-Visual Corpus for Robust Speech Recognition and Robust Speech-to-Text Translation,"We introduce MuAViC, a multilingual audio-visual corpus for robust speech recognition and robust speech-to-text translation providing 1200 hours of audio-visual speech in 9 languages. It is fully transcribed and covers 6 English-to-X translation as well as 6 X-to-English translation directions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first open benchmark for audio-visual speech-to-text translation and the largest open benchmark for multilingual audio-visual speech recognition. Our baseline results show that MuAViC is effective for building noise-robust speech recognition and translation models. We make the corpus available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/muavic."
deHuBERT: Disentangling Noise in a Self-supervised Model for Robust Speech Recognition,"Existing self-supervised pre-trained speech models have offered an effective way to leverage massive unannotated corpora to build good automatic speech recognition (ASR). However, many current models are trained on a clean corpus from a single source, which tends to do poorly when noise is present during testing. Nonetheless, it is crucial to overcome the adverse influence of noise for real-world applications. In this work, we propose a novel training framework, called deHuBERT, for noise reduction encoding inspired by H. Barlow's redundancy-reduction principle. The new framework improves the HuBERT training algorithm by introducing auxiliary losses that drive the self- and cross-correlation matrix between pairwise noise-distorted embeddings towards identity matrix. This encourages the model to produce noise-agnostic speech representations. With this method, we report improved robustness in noisy environments, including unseen noises, without impairing the performance on the clean set."
Exploring Self-supervised Pre-trained ASR Models For Dysarthric and Elderly Speech Recognition,"Automatic recognition of disordered and elderly speech remains a highly challenging task to date due to the difficulty in collecting such data in large quantities. This paper explores a series of approaches to integrate domain adapted SSL pre-trained models into TDNN and Conformer ASR systems for dysarthric and elderly speech recognition: a) input feature fusion between standard acoustic frontends and domain adapted wav2vec2.0 speech representations; b) frame-level joint decoding of TDNN systems separately trained using standard acoustic features alone and with additional wav2vec2.0 features; and c) multi-pass decoding involving the TDNN/Conformer system outputs to be rescored using domain adapted wav2vec2.0 models. In addition, domain adapted wav2vec2.0 representations are utilized in acoustic-to-articulatory (A2A) inversion to construct multi-modal dysarthric and elderly speech recognition systems. Experiments conducted on the UASpeech dysarthric and DementiaBank Pitt elderly speech corpora suggest TDNN and Conformer ASR systems integrated domain adapted wav2vec2.0 models consistently outperform the standalone wav2vec2.0 models by statistically significant WER reductions of 8.22% and 3.43% absolute (26.71% and 15.88% relative) on the two tasks respectively. The lowest published WERs of 22.56% (52.53% on very low intelligibility, 39.09% on unseen words) and 18.17% are obtained on the UASpeech test set of 16 dysarthric speakers, and the DementiaBank Pitt test set respectively."
Structured Pruning of Self-Supervised Pre-trained Models for Speech Recognition and Understanding,"Self-supervised speech representation learning (SSL) has shown to be effective in various downstream tasks, but SSL models are usually large and slow. Model compression techniques such as pruning aim to reduce the model size and computation without degradation in accuracy. Prior studies focus on the pruning of Transformers; however, speech models not only utilize a stack of Transformer blocks, but also combine a frontend network based on multiple convolutional layers for low-level feature representation learning. This frontend has a small size but a heavy computational cost. In this work, we propose three task-specific structured pruning methods to deal with such heterogeneous networks. Experiments on LibriSpeech and SLURP show that the proposed method is more accurate than the original wav2vec2-base with 10% to 30% less computation, and is able to reduce the computation by 40% to 50% without any degradation."
Diagonal State Space Augmented Transformers for Speech Recognition,"We improve on the popular conformer architecture by replacing the depthwise temporal convolutions with diagonal state space (DSS) models. DSS is a recently introduced variant of linear RNNs obtained by discretizing a linear dynamical system with a diagonal state transition matrix. DSS layers project the input sequence onto a space of orthogonal polynomials where the choice of basis functions, metric and support is controlled by the eigenvalues of the transition matrix. We compare neural transducers with either conformer or our proposed DSS-augmented transformer (DSSformer) encoders on three public corpora: Switchboard English conversational telephone speech 300 hours, Switchboard+Fisher 2000 hours, and a spoken archive of holocaust survivor testimonials called MALACH 176 hours. On Switchboard 300/2000 hours, we reach a single model performance of 8.9%/6.7% WER on the combined test set of the Hub5 2000 evaluation, respectively, and on MALACH we improve the WER by 7% relative over the previous best published result. In addition, we present empirical evidence suggesting that DSS layers learn damped Fourier basis functions where the attenuation coefficients are layer specific whereas the frequency coefficients converge to almost identical linearly-spaced values across all layers."
Explanations for Automatic Speech Recognition,"We address quality assessment for neural network based ASR by providing explanations that help increase our understanding of the system and ultimately help build trust in the system. Compared to simple classification labels, explaining transcriptions is more challenging as judging their correctness is not straightforward and transcriptions as a variable-length sequence is not handled by existing interpretable machine learning models. We provide an explanation for an ASR transcription as a subset of audio frames that is both a minimal and sufficient cause of the transcription. To do this, we adapt existing explainable AI (XAI) techniques from image classification-Statistical Fault Localisation(SFL) and Causal. Additionally, we use an adapted version of Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) for ASR as a baseline in our experiments. We evaluate the quality of the explanations generated by the proposed techniques over three different ASR ,Google API, the baseline model of Sphinx, Deepspeech and 100 audio samples from the Commonvoice dataset."
Multimodal Speech Recognition for Language-Guided Embodied Agents,"Benchmarks for language-guided embodied agents typically assume text-based instructions, but deployed agents will encounter spoken instructions. While Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models can bridge the input gap, erroneous ASR transcripts can hurt the agents' ability to complete tasks. In this work, we propose training a multimodal ASR model to reduce errors in transcribing spoken instructions by considering the accompanying visual context. We train our model on a dataset of spoken instructions, synthesized from the ALFRED task completion dataset, where we simulate acoustic noise by systematically masking spoken words. We find that utilizing visual observations facilitates masked word recovery, with multimodal ASR models recovering up to 30% more masked words than unimodal baselines. We also find that a text-trained embodied agent successfully completes tasks more often by following transcribed instructions from multimodal ASR models."
MoLE : Mixture of Language Experts for Multi-Lingual Automatic Speech Recognition,"Multi-lingual speech recognition aims to distinguish linguistic expressions in different languages and integrate acoustic processing simultaneously. In contrast, current multi-lingual speech recognition research follows a language-aware paradigm, mainly targeted to improve recognition performance rather than discriminate language characteristics. In this paper, we present a multi-lingual speech recognition network named Mixture-of-Language-Expert(MoLE), which digests speech in a variety of languages. Specifically, MoLE analyzes linguistic expression from input speech in arbitrary languages, activating a language-specific expert with a lightweight language tokenizer. The tokenizer not only activates experts, but also estimates the reliability of the activation. Based on the reliability, the activated expert and the language-agnostic expert are aggregated to represent language-conditioned embedding for efficient speech recognition. Our proposed model is evaluated in 5 languages scenario, and the experimental results show that our structure is advantageous on multi-lingual recognition, especially for speech in low-resource language."
DST: Deformable Speech Transformer for Emotion Recognition,"Enabled by multi-head self-attention, Transformer has exhibited remarkable results in speech emotion recognition (SER). Compared to the original full attention mechanism, window-based attention is more effective in learning fine-grained features while greatly reducing model redundancy. However, emotional cues are present in a multi-granularity manner such that the pre-defined fixed window can severely degrade the model flexibility. In addition, it is difficult to obtain the optimal window settings manually. In this paper, we propose a Deformable Speech Transformer, named DST, for SER task. DST determines the usage of window sizes conditioned on input speech via a light-weight decision network. Meanwhile, data-dependent offsets derived from acoustic features are utilized to adjust the positions of the attention windows, allowing DST to adaptively discover and attend to the valuable information embedded in the speech. Extensive experiments on IEMOCAP and MELD demonstrate the superiority of DST."
Mingling or Misalignment? Temporal Shift for Speech Emotion Recognition with Pre-trained Representations,"Fueled by recent advances of self-supervised models, pre-trained speech representations proved effective for the downstream speech emotion recognition (SER) task. Most prior works mainly focus on exploiting pre-trained representations and just adopt a linear head on top of the pre-trained model, neglecting the design of the downstream network. In this paper, we propose a temporal shift module to mingle channel-wise information without introducing any parameter or FLOP. With the temporal shift module, three designed baseline building blocks evolve into corresponding shift variants, i.e. ShiftCNN, ShiftLSTM, and Shiftformer. Moreover, to balance the trade-off between mingling and misalignment, we propose two technical strategies, placement of shift and proportion of shift. The family of temporal shift models all outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the benchmark IEMOCAP dataset under both finetuning and feature extraction settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/ECNU-Cross-Innovation-Lab/ShiftSER."
Pre-Finetuning for Few-Shot Emotional Speech Recognition,"Speech models have long been known to overfit individual speakers for many classification tasks. This leads to poor generalization in settings where the speakers are out-of-domain or out-of-distribution, as is common in production environments. We view speaker adaptation as a few-shot learning problem and propose investigating transfer learning approaches inspired by recent success with pre-trained models in natural language tasks. We propose pre-finetuning speech models on difficult tasks to distill knowledge into few-shot downstream classification objectives. We pre-finetune Wav2Vec2.0 on every permutation of four multiclass emotional speech recognition corpora and evaluate our pre-finetuned models through 33,600 few-shot fine-tuning trials on the Emotional Speech Dataset."
Multi-task learning of speech and speaker recognition,"We study multi-task learning for two orthogonal speech technology tasks: speech and speaker recognition. We use wav2vec2 as a base architecture with two task-specific output heads. We experiment with different methods to mix speaker and speech information in the output embedding sequence, and propose a simple dynamic approach to balance the speech and speaker recognition loss functions. Our multi-task learning networks can produce a shared speaker and speech embedding, which are evaluated on the LibriSpeech and VoxCeleb test sets, and achieve a performance comparable to separate single-task models. Code is available at https://github.com/nikvaessen/2022-repo-mt-w2v2."
Factual Consistency Oriented Speech Recognition,"This paper presents a novel optimization framework for automatic speech recognition (ASR) with the aim of reducing hallucinations produced by an ASR model. The proposed framework optimizes the ASR model to maximize an expected factual consistency score between ASR hypotheses and ground-truth transcriptions, where the factual consistency score is computed by a separately trained estimator. Experimental results using the AMI meeting corpus and the VoxPopuli corpus show that the ASR model trained with the proposed framework generates ASR hypotheses that have significantly higher consistency scores with ground-truth transcriptions while maintaining the word error rates close to those of cross entropy-trained ASR models. Furthermore, it is shown that training the ASR models with the proposed framework improves the speech summarization quality as measured by the factual consistency of meeting conversation summaries generated by a large language model."
Can Voice Assistants Be Microaggressors? Cross-Race Psychological Responses to Failures of Automatic Speech Recognition,"Language technologies have a racial bias, committing greater errors for Black users than for white users. However, little work has evaluated what effect these disparate error rates have on users themselves. The present study aims to understand if speech recognition errors in human-computer interactions may mirror the same effects as misunderstandings in interpersonal cross-race communication. In a controlled experiment (N=108), we randomly assigned Black and white participants to interact with a voice assistant pre-programmed to exhibit a high versus low error rate. Results revealed that Black participants in the high error rate condition, compared to Black participants in the low error rate condition, exhibited significantly higher levels of self-consciousness, lower levels of self-esteem and positive affect, and less favorable ratings of the technology. White participants did not exhibit this disparate pattern. We discuss design implications and the diverse research directions to which this initial study aims to contribute."
Evaluating Automatic Speech Recognition in an Incremental Setting,"The increasing reliability of automatic speech recognition has proliferated its everyday use. However, for research purposes, it is often unclear which model one should choose for a task, particularly if there is a requirement for speed as well as accuracy. In this paper, we systematically evaluate six speech recognizers using metrics including word error rate, latency, and the number of updates to already recognized words on English test data, as well as propose and compare two methods for streaming audio into recognizers for incremental recognition. We further propose Revokes per Second as a new metric for evaluating incremental recognition and demonstrate that it provides insights into overall model performance. We find that, generally, local recognizers are faster and require fewer updates than cloud-based recognizers. Finally, we find Meta's Wav2Vec model to be the fastest, and find Mozilla's DeepSpeech model to be the most stable in its predictions."
Gradient Remedy for Multi-Task Learning in End-to-End Noise-Robust Speech Recognition,"Speech enhancement (SE) is proved effective in reducing noise from noisy speech signals for downstream automatic speech recognition (ASR), where multi-task learning strategy is employed to jointly optimize these two tasks. However, the enhanced speech learned by SE objective may not always yield good ASR results. From the optimization view, there sometimes exists interference between the gradients of SE and ASR tasks, which could hinder the multi-task learning and finally lead to sub-optimal ASR performance. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach called gradient remedy (GR) to solve interference between task gradients in noise-robust speech recognition, from perspectives of both angle and magnitude. Specifically, we first project the SE task's gradient onto a dynamic surface that is at acute angle to ASR gradient, in order to remove the conflict between them and assist in ASR optimization. Furthermore, we adaptively rescale the magnitude of two gradients to prevent the dominant ASR task from being misled by SE gradient. Experimental results show that the proposed approach well resolves the gradient interference and achieves relative word error rate (WER) reductions of 9.3% and 11.1% over multi-task learning baseline, on RATS and CHiME-4 datasets, respectively. Our code is available at GitHub."
MADI: Inter-domain Matching and Intra-domain Discrimination for Cross-domain Speech Recognition,"End-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) usually suffers from performance degradation when applied to a new domain due to domain shift. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to improve the performance on the unlabeled target domain by transferring knowledge from the source to the target domain. To improve transferability, existing UDA approaches mainly focus on matching the distributions of the source and target domains globally and/or locally, while ignoring the model discriminability. In this paper, we propose a novel UDA approach for ASR via inter-domain MAtching and intra-domain DIscrimination (MADI), which improves the model transferability by fine-grained inter-domain matching and discriminability by intra-domain contrastive discrimination simultaneously. Evaluations on the Libri-Adapt dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. MADI reduces the relative word error rate (WER) on cross-device and cross-environment ASR by 17.7% and 22.8%, respectively."
Stabilising and accelerating light gated recurrent units for automatic speech recognition,"The light gated recurrent units (Li-GRU) is well-known for achieving impressive results in automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks while being lighter and faster to train than a standard gated recurrent units (GRU). However, the unbounded nature of its rectified linear unit on the candidate recurrent gate induces an important gradient exploding phenomenon disrupting the training process and preventing it from being applied to famous datasets. In this paper, we theoretically and empirically derive the necessary conditions for its stability as well as engineering mechanisms to speed up by a factor of five its training time, hence introducing a novel version of this architecture named SLi-GRU. Then, we evaluate its performance both on a toy task illustrating its newly acquired capabilities and a set of three different ASR datasets demonstrating lower word error rates compared to more complex recurrent neural networks."
A Sidecar Separator Can Convert a Single-Talker Speech Recognition System to a Multi-Talker One,"Although automatic speech recognition (ASR) can perform well in common non-overlapping environments, sustaining performance in multi-talker overlapping speech recognition remains challenging. Recent research revealed that ASR model's encoder captures different levels of information with different layers -- the lower layers tend to have more acoustic information, and the upper layers more linguistic. This inspires us to develop a Sidecar separator to empower a well-trained ASR model for multi-talker scenarios by separating the mixed speech embedding between two suitable layers. We experimented with a wav2vec 2.0-based ASR model with a Sidecar mounted. By freezing the parameters of the original model and training only the Sidecar (8.7 M, 8.4% of all parameters), the proposed approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin for the 2-speaker mixed LibriMix dataset, reaching a word error rate (WER) of 10.36%; and obtains comparable results (7.56%) for LibriSpeechMix dataset when limited training."
Emphasizing Unseen Words: New Vocabulary Acquisition for End-to-End Speech Recognition,"Due to the dynamic nature of human language, automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems need to continuously acquire new vocabulary. Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) words, such as trending words and new named entities, pose problems to modern ASR systems that require long training times to adapt their large numbers of parameters. Different from most previous research focusing on language model post-processing, we tackle this problem on an earlier processing level and eliminate the bias in acoustic modeling to recognize OOV words acoustically. We propose to generate OOV words using text-to-speech systems and to rescale losses to encourage neural networks to pay more attention to OOV words. Specifically, we enlarge the classification loss used for training neural networks' parameters of utterances containing OOV words (sentence-level), or rescale the gradient used for back-propagation for OOV words (word-level), when fine-tuning a previously trained model on synthetic audio. To overcome catastrophic forgetting, we also explore the combination of loss rescaling and model regularization, i.e. L2 regularization and elastic weight consolidation (EWC). Compared with previous methods that just fine-tune synthetic audio with EWC, the experimental results on the LibriSpeech benchmark reveal that our proposed loss rescaling approach can achieve significant improvement on the recall rate with only a slight decrease on word error rate. Moreover, word-level rescaling is more stable than utterance-level rescaling and leads to higher recall rates and precision on OOV word recognition. Furthermore, our proposed combined loss rescaling and weight consolidation methods can support continual learning of an ASR system."
Front-End Adapter: Adapting Front-End Input of Speech based Self-Supervised Learning for Speech Recognition,"Recent years have witnessed a boom in self-supervised learning (SSL) in various areas including speech processing. Speech based SSL models present promising performance in a range of speech related tasks. However, the training of SSL models is computationally expensive and a common practice is to fine-tune a released SSL model on the specific task. It is essential to use consistent front-end input during pre-training and fine-tuning. This consistency may introduce potential issues when the optimal front-end is not the same as that used in pre-training. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective front-end adapter to address this front-end discrepancy. By minimizing the distance between the outputs of different front-ends, the filterbank feature (Fbank) can be compatible with SSL models which are pre-trained with waveform. The experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed front-end adapter on several popular SSL models for the speech recognition task."
From User Perceptions to Technical Improvement: Enabling People Who Stutter to Better Use Speech Recognition,"Consumer speech recognition systems do not work as well for many people with speech diferences, such as stuttering, relative to the rest of the general population. However, what is not clear is the degree to which these systems do not work, how they can be improved, or how much people want to use them. In this paper, we frst address these questions using results from a 61-person survey from people who stutter and fnd participants want to use speech recognition but are frequently cut of, misunderstood, or speech predictions do not represent intent. In a second study, where 91 people who stutter recorded voice assistant commands and dictation, we quantify how dysfuencies impede performance in a consumer-grade speech recognition system. Through three technical investigations, we demonstrate how many common errors can be prevented, resulting in a system that cuts utterances of 79.1% less often and improves word error rate from 25.4% to 9.9%."
Deep Implicit Distribution Alignment Networks for Cross-Corpus Speech Emotion Recognition,"In this paper, we propose a novel deep transfer learning method called deep implicit distribution alignment networks (DIDAN) to deal with cross-corpus speech emotion recognition (SER) problem, in which the labeled training (source) and unlabeled testing (target) speech signals come from different corpora. Specifically, DIDAN first adopts a simple deep regression network consisting of a set of convolutional and fully connected layers to directly regress the source speech spectrums into the emotional labels such that the proposed DIDAN can own the emotion discriminative ability. Then, such ability is transferred to be also applicable to the target speech samples regardless of corpus variance by resorting to a well-designed regularization term called implicit distribution alignment (IDA). Unlike widely-used maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) and its variants, the proposed IDA absorbs the idea of sample reconstruction to implicitly align the distribution gap, which enables DIDAN to learn both emotion discriminative and corpus invariant features from speech spectrums. To evaluate the proposed DIDAN, extensive cross-corpus SER experiments on widely-used speech emotion corpora are carried out. Experimental results show that the proposed DIDAN can outperform lots of recent state-of-the-art methods in coping with the cross-corpus SER tasks."
Gaussian-smoothed Imbalance Data Improves Speech Emotion Recognition,"In speech emotion recognition tasks, models learn emotional representations from datasets. We find the data distribution in the IEMOCAP dataset is very imbalanced, which may harm models to learn a better representation. To address this issue, we propose a novel Pairwise-emotion Data Distribution Smoothing (PDDS) method. PDDS considers that the distribution of emotional data should be smooth in reality, then applies Gaussian smoothing to emotion-pairs for constructing a new training set with a smoother distribution. The required new data are complemented using the mixup augmentation. As PDDS is model and modality agnostic, it is evaluated with three SOTA models on the IEMOCAP dataset. The experimental results show that these models are improved by 0.2\% - 4.8\% and 1.5\% - 5.9\% in terms of WA and UA. In addition, an ablation study demonstrates that the key advantage of PDDS is the reasonable data distribution rather than a simple data augmentation."
JEIT: Joint End-to-End Model and Internal Language Model Training for Speech Recognition,"We propose JEIT, a joint end-to-end (E2E) model and internal language model (ILM) training method to inject large-scale unpaired text into ILM during E2E training which improves rare-word speech recognition. With JEIT, the E2E model computes an E2E loss on audio-transcript pairs while its ILM estimates a cross-entropy loss on unpaired text. The E2E model is trained to minimize a weighted sum of E2E and ILM losses. During JEIT, ILM absorbs knowledge from unpaired text while the E2E training serves as regularization. Unlike ILM adaptation methods, JEIT does not require a separate adaptation step and avoids the need for Kullback-Leibler divergence regularization of ILM. We also show that modular hybrid autoregressive transducer (MHAT) performs better than HAT in the JEIT framework, and is much more robust than HAT during ILM adaptation. To push the limit of unpaired text injection, we further propose a combined JEIT and JOIST training (CJJT) that benefits from modality matching, encoder text injection and ILM training. Both JEIT and CJJT can foster a more effective LM fusion. With 100B unpaired sentences, JEIT/CJJT improves rare-word recognition accuracy by up to 16.4% over a model trained without unpaired text."
Prompt Tuning of Deep Neural Networks for Speaker-adaptive Visual Speech Recognition,"Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) aims to infer speech into text depending on lip movements alone. As it focuses on visual information to model the speech, its performance is inherently sensitive to personal lip appearances and movements, and this makes the VSR models show degraded performance when they are applied to unseen speakers. In this paper, to remedy the performance degradation of the VSR model on unseen speakers, we propose prompt tuning methods of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for speaker-adaptive VSR. Specifically, motivated by recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP), we finetune prompts on adaptation data of target speakers instead of modifying the pre-trained model parameters. Different from the previous prompt tuning methods mainly limited to Transformer variant architecture, we explore different types of prompts, the addition, the padding, and the concatenation form prompts that can be applied to the VSR model which is composed of CNN and Transformer in general. With the proposed prompt tuning, we show that the performance of the pre-trained VSR model on unseen speakers can be largely improved by using a small amount of adaptation data (e.g., less than 5 minutes), even if the pre-trained model is already developed with large speaker variations. Moreover, by analyzing the performance and parameters of different types of prompts, we investigate when the prompt tuning is preferred over the finetuning methods. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on both word- and sentence-level VSR databases, LRW-ID and GRID."
Confidence Score Based Speaker Adaptation of Conformer Speech Recognition Systems,"Speaker adaptation techniques provide a powerful solution to customise automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems for individual users. Practical application of unsupervised model-based speaker adaptation techniques to data intensive end-to-end ASR systems is hindered by the scarcity of speaker-level data and performance sensitivity to transcription errors. To address these issues, a set of compact and data efficient speaker-dependent (SD) parameter representations are used to facilitate both speaker adaptive training and test-time unsupervised speaker adaptation of state-of-the-art Conformer ASR systems. The sensitivity to supervision quality is reduced using a confidence score-based selection of the less erroneous subset of speaker-level adaptation data. Two lightweight confidence score estimation modules are proposed to produce more reliable confidence scores. The data sparsity issue, which is exacerbated by data selection, is addressed by modelling the SD parameter uncertainty using Bayesian learning. Experiments on the benchmark 300-hour Switchboard and the 233-hour AMI datasets suggest that the proposed confidence score-based adaptation schemes consistently outperformed the baseline speaker-independent (SI) Conformer model and conventional non-Bayesian, point estimate-based adaptation using no speaker data selection. Similar consistent performance improvements were retained after external Transformer and LSTM language model rescoring. In particular, on the 300-hour Switchboard corpus, statistically significant WER reductions of 1.0%, 1.3%, and 1.4% absolute (9.5%, 10.9%, and 11.3% relative) were obtained over the baseline SI Conformer on the NIST Hub5'00, RT02, and RT03 evaluation sets respectively. Similar WER reductions of 2.7% and 3.3% absolute (8.9% and 10.2% relative) were also obtained on the AMI development and evaluation sets."
ASDF: A Differential Testing Framework for Automatic Speech Recognition Systems,"Recent years have witnessed wider adoption of Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) techniques in various domains. Consequently, evaluating and enhancing the quality of ASR systems is of great importance. This paper proposes ASDF, an Automated Speech Recognition Differential Testing Framework for testing ASR systems. ASDF extends an existing ASR testing tool, the CrossASR++, which synthesizes test cases from a text corpus. However, CrossASR++ fails to make use of the text corpus efficiently and provides limited information on how the failed test cases can improve ASR systems. To address these limitations, our tool incorporates two novel features: (1) a text transformation module to boost the number of generated test cases and uncover more errors in ASR systems and (2) a phonetic analysis module to identify on which phonemes the ASR system tend to produce errors. ASDF generates more high-quality test cases by applying various text transformation methods (e.g., change tense) to the texts in failed test cases. By doing so, ASDF can utilize a small text corpus to generate a large number of audio test cases, something which CrossASR++ is not capable of. In addition, ASDF implements more metrics to evaluate the performance of ASR systems from multiple perspectives. ASDF performs phonetic analysis on the identified failed test cases to identify the phonemes that ASR systems tend to transcribe incorrectly, providing useful information for developers to improve ASR systems. The demonstration video of our tool is made online at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzVwfc3h9As. The implementation is available at https://github.com/danielyuenhx/asdf-differential-testing."
Leveraging supplementary text data to kick-start automatic speech recognition system development with limited transcriptions,"Recent research using pre-trained transformer models suggests that just 10 minutes of transcribed speech may be enough to fine-tune such a model for automatic speech recognition (ASR) -- at least if we can also leverage vast amounts of text data (803 million tokens). But is that much text data necessary? We study the use of different amounts of text data, both for creating a lexicon that constrains ASR decoding to possible words (e.g. *dogz vs. dogs), and for training larger language models that bias the system toward probable word sequences (e.g. too dogs vs. two dogs). We perform experiments using 10 minutes of transcribed speech from English (for replicating prior work) and two additional pairs of languages differing in the availability of supplemental text data: Gronings and Frisian (~7.5M token corpora available), and Besemah and Nasal (only small lexica available). For all languages, we found that using only a lexicon did not appreciably improve ASR performance. For Gronings and Frisian, we found that lexica and language models derived from 'novel-length' 80k token subcorpora reduced the word error rate (WER) to 39% on average. Our findings suggest that where a text corpus in the upper tens of thousands of tokens or more is available, fine-tuning a transformer model with just tens of minutes of transcribed speech holds some promise towards obtaining human-correctable transcriptions near the 30% WER rule-of-thumb."
MAC: A unified framework boosting low resource automatic speech recognition,"We propose a unified framework for low resource automatic speech recognition tasks named meta audio concatenation (MAC). It is easy to implement and can be carried out in extremely low resource environments. Mathematically, we give a clear description of MAC framework from the perspective of bayesian sampling. In this framework, we leverage a novel concatenative synthesis text-to-speech system to boost the low resource ASR task. By the concatenative synthesis text-to-speech system, we can integrate language pronunciation rules and adjust the TTS process. Furthermore, we propose a broad notion of meta audio set to meet the modeling needs of different languages and different scenes when using the system. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the great effectiveness of MAC on low resource ASR tasks. For CTC greedy search, CTC prefix, attention, and attention rescoring decode mode in Cantonese ASR task, Taiwanese ASR task, and Japanese ASR task the MAC method can reduce the CER by more than 15\%. Furthermore, in the ASR task, MAC beats wav2vec2 (with fine-tuning) on common voice datasets of Cantonese and gets really competitive results on common voice datasets of Taiwanese and Japanese. Among them, it is worth mentioning that we achieve a \textbf{10.9\%} character error rate (CER) on the common voice Cantonese ASR task, bringing about \textbf{30\%} relative improvement compared to the wav2vec2 (with fine-tuning)."
cross-modal fusion techniques for utterance-level emotion recognition from text and speech,"Multimodal emotion recognition (MER) is a fundamental complex research problem due to the uncertainty of human emotional expression and the heterogeneity gap between different modalities. Audio and text modalities are particularly important for a human participant in understanding emotions. Although many successful attempts have been designed multimodal representations for MER, there still exist multiple challenges to be addressed: 1) bridging the heterogeneity gap between multimodal features and model inter- and intra-modal interactions of multiple modalities; 2) effectively and efficiently modelling the contextual dynamics in the conversation sequence. In this paper, we propose Cross-Modal RoBERTa (CM-RoBERTa) model for emotion detection from spoken audio and corresponding transcripts. As the core unit of the CM-RoBERTa, parallel self- and cross- attention is designed to dynamically capture inter- and intra-modal interactions of audio and text. Specially, the mid-level fusion and residual module are employed to model long-term contextual dependencies and learn modality-specific patterns. We evaluate the approach on the MELD dataset and the experimental results show the proposed approach achieves the state-of-art performance on the dataset."
deep learning of segment-level feature representation for speech emotion recognition in conversations,"Accurately detecting emotions in conversation is a necessary yet challenging task due to the complexity of emotions and dynamics in dialogues. The emotional state of a speaker can be influenced by many different factors, such as interlocutor stimulus, dialogue scene, and topic. In this work, we propose a conversational speech emotion recognition method to deal with capturing attentive contextual dependency and speaker-sensitive interactions. First, we use a pretrained VGGish model to extract segment-based audio representation in individual utterances. Second, an attentive bi-directional gated recurrent unit (GRU) models contextual-sensitive information and explores intra- and inter-speaker dependencies jointly in a dynamic manner. The experiments conducted on the standard conversational dataset MELD demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method when compared against state-of the-art methods."
Complex Dynamic Neurons Improved Spiking Transformer Network for Efficient Automatic Speech Recognition,"The spiking neural network (SNN) using leaky-integrated-and-fire (LIF) neurons has been commonly used in automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks. However, the LIF neuron is still relatively simple compared to that in the biological brain. Further research on more types of neurons with different scales of neuronal dynamics is necessary. Here we introduce four types of neuronal dynamics to post-process the sequential patterns generated from the spiking transformer to get the complex dynamic neuron improved spiking transformer neural network (DyTr-SNN). We found that the DyTr-SNN could handle the non-toy automatic speech recognition task well, representing a lower phoneme error rate, lower computational cost, and higher robustness. These results indicate that the further cooperation of SNNs and neural dynamics at the neuron and network scales might have much in store for the future, especially on the ASR tasks."
Improving Rare Words Recognition through Homophone Extension and Unified Writing for Low-resource Cantonese Speech Recognition,"Homophone characters are common in tonal syllable-based languages, such as Mandarin and Cantonese. The data-intensive end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems are more likely to mis-recognize homophone characters and rare words under low-resource settings. For the problem of lowresource Cantonese speech recognition, this paper presents a novel homophone extension method to integrate human knowledge of the homophone lexicon into the beam search decoding process with language model re-scoring. Besides, we propose an automatic unified writing method to merge the variants of Cantonese characters and standardize speech annotation guidelines, which enables more efficient utilization of labeled utterances by providing more samples for the merged characters. We empirically show that both homophone extension and unified writing improve the recognition performance significantly on both in-domain and out-of-domain test sets, with an absolute Character Error Rate (CER) decrease of around 5% and 18%."
BayesSpeech: A Bayesian Transformer Network for Automatic Speech Recognition,"Recent developments using End-to-End Deep Learning models have been shown to have near or better performance than state of the art Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) on Automatic Speech Recognition tasks. These models tend to be lighter weight and require less training time than traditional RNN-based approaches. However, these models take frequentist approach to weight training. In theory, network weights are drawn from a latent, intractable probability distribution. We introduce BayesSpeech for end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition. BayesSpeech is a Bayesian Transformer Network where these intractable posteriors are learned through variational inference and the local reparameterization trick without recurrence. We show how the introduction of variance in the weights leads to faster training time and near state-of-the-art performance on LibriSpeech-960."
A Multi-Purpose Audio-Visual Corpus for Multi-Modal Persian Speech Recognition: the Arman-AV Dataset,"In recent years, significant progress has been made in automatic lip reading. But these methods require large-scale datasets that do not exist for many low-resource languages. In this paper, we have presented a new multipurpose audio-visual dataset for Persian. This dataset consists of almost 220 hours of videos with 1760 corresponding speakers. In addition to lip reading, the dataset is suitable for automatic speech recognition, audio-visual speech recognition, and speaker recognition. Also, it is the first large-scale lip reading dataset in Persian. A baseline method was provided for each mentioned task. In addition, we have proposed a technique to detect visemes (a visual equivalent of a phoneme) in Persian. The visemes obtained by this method increase the accuracy of the lip reading task by 7% relatively compared to the previously proposed visemes, which can be applied to other languages as well."
From English to More Languages: Parameter-Efficient Model Reprogramming for Cross-Lingual Speech Recognition,"In this work, we propose a new parameter-efficient learning framework based on neural model reprogramming for cross-lingual speech recognition, which can \textbf{re-purpose} well-trained English automatic speech recognition (ASR) models to recognize the other languages. We design different auxiliary neural architectures focusing on learnable pre-trained feature enhancement that, for the first time, empowers model reprogramming on ASR. Specifically, we investigate how to select trainable components (i.e., encoder) of a conformer-based RNN-Transducer, as a frozen pre-trained backbone. Experiments on a seven-language multilingual LibriSpeech speech (MLS) task show that model reprogramming only requires 4.2% (11M out of 270M) to 6.8% (45M out of 660M) of its original trainable parameters from a full ASR model to perform competitive results in a range of 11.9% to 8.1% WER averaged across different languages. In addition, we discover different setups to make large-scale pre-trained ASR succeed in both monolingual and multilingual speech recognition. Our methods outperform existing ASR tuning architectures and their extension with self-supervised losses (e.g., w2v-bert) in terms of lower WER and better training efficiency."
Syllable Subword Tokens for Open Vocabulary Speech Recognition in Malayalam,"In a hybrid automatic speech recognition (ASR) system, a pronunciation lexicon (PL) and a language model (LM) are essential to correctly retrieve spoken word sequences. Being a morphologically complex language, the vocabulary of Malayalam is so huge and it is impossible to build a PL and an LM that cover all diverse word forms. Usage of subword tokens to build PL and LM, and combining them to form words after decoding, enables the recovery of many out of vocabulary words. In this work we investigate the impact of using syllables as subword tokens instead of words in Malayalam ASR, and evaluate the relative improvement in lexicon size, model memory requirement and word error rate."
Using Kaldi for Automatic Speech Recognition of Conversational Austrian German,"As dialogue systems are becoming more and more interactional and social, also the accurate automatic speech recognition (ASR) of conversational speech is of increasing importance. This shifts the focus from short, spontaneous, task-oriented dialogues to the much higher complexity of casual face-to-face conversations. However, the collection and annotation of such conversations is a time-consuming process and data is sparse for this specific speaking style. This paper presents ASR experiments with read and conversational Austrian German as target. In order to deal with having only limited resources available for conversational German and, at the same time, with a large variation among speakers with respect to pronunciation characteristics, we improve a Kaldi-based ASR system by incorporating a (large) knowledge-based pronunciation lexicon, while exploring different data-based methods to restrict the number of pronunciation variants for each lexical entry. We achieve best WER of 0.4% on Austrian German read speech and best average WER of 48.5% on conversational speech. We find that by using our best pronunciation lexicon a similarly high performance can be achieved than by increasing the size of the data used for the language model by approx. 360% to 760%. Our findings indicate that for low-resource scenarios -- despite the general trend in speech technology towards using data-based methods only -- knowledge-based approaches are a successful, efficient method."
Modulation spectral features for speech emotion recognition using deep neural networks,"This work explores the use of constant-Q transform based modulation spectral features (CQT-MSF) for speech emotion recognition (SER). The human perception and analysis of sound comprise of two important cognitive parts: early auditory analysis and cortex-based processing. The early auditory analysis considers spectrogram-based representation whereas cortex-based analysis includes extraction of temporal modulations from the spectrogram. This temporal modulation representation of spectrogram is called modulation spectral feature (MSF). As the constant-Q transform (CQT) provides higher resolution at emotion salient low-frequency regions of speech, we find that CQT-based spectrogram, together with its temporal modulations, provides a representation enriched with emotion-specific information. We argue that CQT-MSF when used with a 2-dimensional convolutional network can provide a time-shift invariant and deformation insensitive representation for SER. Our results show that CQT-MSF outperforms standard mel-scale based spectrogram and its modulation features on two popular SER databases, Berlin EmoDB and RAVDESS. We also show that our proposed feature outperforms the shift and deformation invariant scattering transform coefficients, hence, showing the importance of joint hand-crafted and self-learned feature extraction instead of reliance on complete hand-crafted features. Finally, we perform Grad-CAM analysis to visually inspect the contribution of constant-Q modulation features over SER."
Multilingual Alzheimer's Dementia Recognition through Spontaneous Speech: a Signal Processing Grand Challenge,"This Signal Processing Grand Challenge (SPGC) targets a difficult automatic prediction problem of societal and medical relevance, namely, the detection of Alzheimer's Dementia (AD). Participants were invited to employ signal processing and machine learning methods to create predictive models based on spontaneous speech data. The Challenge has been designed to assess the extent to which predictive models built based on speech in one language (English) generalise to another language (Greek). To the best of our knowledge no work has investigated acoustic features of the speech signal in multilingual AD detection. Our baseline system used conventional machine learning algorithms with Active Data Representation of acoustic features, achieving accuracy of 73.91% on AD detection, and 4.95 root mean squared error on cognitive score prediction."
Streaming Punctuation: A Novel Punctuation Technique Leveraging Bidirectional Context for Continuous Speech Recognition,"While speech recognition Word Error Rate (WER) has reached human parity for English, continuous speech recognition scenarios such as voice typing and meeting transcriptions still suffer from segmentation and punctuation problems, resulting from irregular pausing patterns or slow speakers. Transformer sequence tagging models are effective at capturing long bi-directional context, which is crucial for automatic punctuation. Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) production systems, however, are constrained by real-time requirements, making it hard to incorporate the right context when making punctuation decisions. Context within the segments produced by ASR decoders can be helpful but limiting in overall punctuation performance for a continuous speech session. In this paper, we propose a streaming approach for punctuation or re-punctuation of ASR output using dynamic decoding windows and measure its impact on punctuation and segmentation accuracy across scenarios. The new system tackles over-segmentation issues, improving segmentation F0.5-score by 13.9%. Streaming punctuation achieves an average BLEUscore improvement of 0.66 for the downstream task of Machine Translation (MT)."
Generative Emotional AI for Speech Emotion Recognition: The Case for Synthetic Emotional Speech Augmentation,"Despite advances in deep learning, current state-of-the-art speech emotion recognition (SER) systems still have poor performance due to a lack of speech emotion datasets. This paper proposes augmenting SER systems with synthetic emotional speech generated by an end-to-end text-to-speech (TTS) system based on an extended Tacotron architecture. The proposed TTS system includes encoders for speaker and emotion embeddings, a sequence-to-sequence text generator for creating Mel-spectrograms, and a WaveRNN to generate audio from the Mel-spectrograms. Extensive experiments show that the quality of the generated emotional speech can significantly improve SER performance on multiple datasets, as demonstrated by a higher mean opinion score (MOS) compared to the baseline. The generated samples were also effective at augmenting SER performance."
Using External Off-Policy Speech-To-Text Mappings in Contextual End-To-End Automated Speech Recognition,"Despite improvements to the generalization performance of automated speech recognition (ASR) models, specializing ASR models for downstream tasks remains a challenging task, primarily due to reduced data availability (necessitating increased data collection), and rapidly shifting data distributions (requiring more frequent model fine-tuning). In this work, we investigate the potential of leveraging external knowledge, particularly through off-policy key-value stores generated with text-to-speech methods, to allow for flexible post-training adaptation to new data distributions. In our approach, audio embeddings captured from text-to-speech, along with semantic text embeddings, are used to bias ASR via an approximate k-nearest-neighbor (KNN) based attentive fusion step. Our experiments on LibiriSpeech and in-house voice assistant/search datasets show that the proposed approach can reduce domain adaptation time by up to 1K GPU-hours while providing up to 3% WER improvement compared to a fine-tuning baseline, suggesting a promising approach for adapting production ASR systems in challenging zero and few-shot scenarios."
Audio-Visual Efficient Conformer for Robust Speech Recognition,"End-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems based on neural networks have seen large improvements in recent years. The availability of large scale hand-labeled datasets and sufficient computing resources made it possible to train powerful deep neural networks, reaching very low Word Error Rate (WER) on academic benchmarks. However, despite impressive performance on clean audio samples, a drop of performance is often observed on noisy speech. In this work, we propose to improve the noise robustness of the recently proposed Efficient Conformer Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)-based architecture by processing both audio and visual modalities. We improve previous lip reading methods using an Efficient Conformer back-end on top of a ResNet-18 visual front-end and by adding intermediate CTC losses between blocks. We condition intermediate block features on early predictions using Inter CTC residual modules to relax the conditional independence assumption of CTC-based models. We also replace the Efficient Conformer grouped attention by a more efficient and simpler attention mechanism that we call patch attention. We experiment with publicly available Lip Reading Sentences 2 (LRS2) and Lip Reading Sentences 3 (LRS3) datasets. Our experiments show that using audio and visual modalities allows to better recognize speech in the presence of environmental noise and significantly accelerate training, reaching lower WER with 4 times less training steps. Our Audio-Visual Efficient Conformer (AVEC) model achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching WER of 2.3% and 1.8% on LRS2 and LRS3 test sets. Code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/burchim/AVEC."
Sample-Efficient Unsupervised Domain Adaptation of Speech Recognition Systems A case study for Modern Greek,"Modern speech recognition systems exhibits rapid performance degradation under domain shift. This issue is especially prevalent in data-scarce settings, such as low-resource languages, where diversity of training data is limited. In this work we propose M2DS2, a simple and sample-efficient finetuning strategy for large pretrained speech models, based on mixed source and target domain self-supervision. We find that including source domain self-supervision stabilizes training and avoids mode collapse of the latent representations. For evaluation, we collect HParl, a 120 hour speech corpus for Greek, consisting of plenary sessions in the Greek Parliament. We merge HParl with two popular Greek corpora to create GREC-MD, a test-bed for multi-domain evaluation of Greek ASR systems. In our experiments we find that, while other Unsupervised Domain Adaptation baselines fail in this resource-constrained environment, M2DS2 yields significant improvements for cross-domain adaptation, even when a only a few hours of in-domain audio are available. When we relax the problem in a weakly supervised setting, we find that independent adaptation for audio using M2DS2 and language using simple LM augmentation techniques is particularly effective, yielding word error rates comparable to the fully supervised baselines."
Memory Augmented Lookup Dictionary based Language Modeling for Automatic Speech Recognition,"Recent studies have shown that using an external Language Model (LM) benefits the end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). However, predicting tokens that appear less frequently in the training set is still quite challenging. The long-tail prediction problems have been widely studied in many applications, but only been addressed by a few studies for ASR and LMs. In this paper, we propose a new memory augmented lookup dictionary based Transformer architecture for LM. The newly introduced lookup dictionary incorporates rich contextual information in training set, which is vital to correctly predict long-tail tokens. With intensive experiments on Chinese and English data sets, our proposed method is proved to outperform the baseline Transformer LM by a great margin on both word/character error rate and tail tokens error rate. This is achieved without impact on the decoding efficiency. Overall, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in boosting the ASR decoding performance, especially for long-tail tokens."
Macro-block dropout for improved regularization in training end-to-end speech recognition models,"This paper proposes a new regularization algorithm referred to as macro-block dropout. The overfitting issue has been a difficult problem in training large neural network models. The dropout technique has proven to be simple yet very effective for regularization by preventing complex co-adaptations during training. In our work, we define a macro-block that contains a large number of units from the input to a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Rather than applying dropout to each unit, we apply random dropout to each macro-block. This algorithm has the effect of applying different drop out rates for each layer even if we keep a constant average dropout rate, which has better regularization effects. In our experiments using Recurrent Neural Network-Transducer (RNN-T), this algorithm shows relatively 4.30 % and 6.13 % Word Error Rates (WERs) improvement over the conventional dropout on LibriSpeech test-clean and test-other. With an Attention-based Encoder-Decoder (AED) model, this algorithm shows relatively 4.36 % and 5.85 % WERs improvement over the conventional dropout on the same test sets."
End-to-End Automatic Speech Recognition model for the Sudanese Dialect,"Designing a natural voice interface rely mostly on Speech recognition for interaction between human and their modern digital life equipment. In addition, speech recognition narrows the gap between monolingual individuals to better exchange communication. However, the field lacks wide support for several universal languages and their dialects, while most of the daily conversations are carried out using them. This paper comes to inspect the viability of designing an Automatic Speech Recognition model for the Sudanese dialect, which is one of the Arabic Language dialects, and its complexity is a product of historical and social conditions unique to its speakers. This condition is reflected in both the form and content of the dialect, so this paper gives an overview of the Sudanese dialect and the tasks of collecting represented resources and pre-processing performed to construct a modest dataset to overcome the lack of annotated data. Also proposed end- to-end speech recognition model, the design of the model was formed using Convolution Neural Networks. The Sudanese dialect dataset would be a stepping stone to enable future Natural Language Processing research targeting the dialect. The designed model provided some insights into the current recognition task and reached an average Label Error Rate of 73.67%."
Fast Entropy-Based Methods of Word-Level Confidence Estimation for End-To-End Automatic Speech Recognition,"This paper presents a class of new fast non-trainable entropy-based confidence estimation methods for automatic speech recognition. We show how per-frame entropy values can be normalized and aggregated to obtain a confidence measure per unit and per word for Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) and Recurrent Neural Network Transducer (RNN-T) models. Proposed methods have similar computational complexity to the traditional method based on the maximum per-frame probability, but they are more adjustable, have a wider effective threshold range, and better push apart the confidence distributions of correct and incorrect words. We evaluate the proposed confidence measures on LibriSpeech test sets, and show that they are up to 2 and 4 times better than confidence estimation based on the maximum per-frame probability at detecting incorrect words for Conformer-CTC and Conformer-RNN-T models, respectively."
Leveraging Modality-specific Representations for Audio-visual Speech Recognition via Reinforcement Learning,"Audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) has gained remarkable success for ameliorating the noise-robustness of speech recognition. Mainstream methods focus on fusing audio and visual inputs to obtain modality-invariant representations. However, such representations are prone to over-reliance on audio modality as it is much easier to recognize than video modality in clean conditions. As a result, the AVSR model underestimates the importance of visual stream in face of noise corruption. To this end, we leverage visual modality-specific representations to provide stable complementary information for the AVSR task. Specifically, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) based framework called MSRL, where the agent dynamically harmonizes modality-invariant and modality-specific representations in the auto-regressive decoding process. We customize a reward function directly related to task-specific metrics (i.e., word error rate), which encourages the MSRL to effectively explore the optimal integration strategy. Experimental results on the LRS3 dataset show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art in both clean and various noisy conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the better generality of MSRL system than other baselines when test set contains unseen noises."
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision,"We study the capabilities of speech processing systems trained simply to predict large amounts of transcripts of audio on the internet. When scaled to 680,000 hours of multilingual and multitask supervision, the resulting models generalize well to standard benchmarks and are often competitive with prior fully supervised results but in a zero-shot transfer setting without the need for any fine-tuning. When compared to humans, the models approach their accuracy and robustness. We are releasing models and inference code to serve as a foundation for further work on robust speech processing."
Progressive Multi-Scale Self-Supervised Learning for Speech Recognition,"Self-supervised learning (SSL) models have achieved considerable improvements in automatic speech recognition (ASR). In addition, ASR performance could be further improved if the model is dedicated to audio content information learning theoretically. To this end, we propose a progressive multi-scale self-supervised learning (PMS-SSL) method, which uses fine-grained target sets to compute SSL loss at top layer while uses coarse-grained target sets at intermediate layers. Furthermore, PMS-SSL introduces multi-scale structure into multi-head self-attention for better speech representation, which restricts the attention area into a large scope at higher layers while restricts the attention area into a small scope at lower layers. Experiments on Librispeech dataset indicate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Compared with HuBERT, PMS-SSL achieves 13.7% / 12.7% relative WER reduction on test other evaluation subsets respectively when fine-tuned on 10hours / 100hours subsets."
LMEC: Learnable Multiplicative Absolute Position Embedding Based Conformer for Speech Recognition,"This paper proposes a Learnable Multiplicative absolute position Embedding based Conformer (LMEC). It contains a kernelized linear attention (LA) module called LMLA to solve the time-consuming problem for long sequence speech recognition as well as an alternative to the FFN structure. First, the ELU function is adopted as the kernel function of our proposed LA module. Second, we propose a novel Learnable Multiplicative Absolute Position Embedding (LM-APE) based re-weighting mechanism that can reduce the well-known quadratic temporal-space complexity of softmax self-attention. Third, we use Gated Linear Units (GLU) to substitute the Feed Forward Network (FFN) for better performance. Extensive experiments have been conducted on the public LibriSpeech datasets. Compared to the Conformer model with cosFormer style linear attention, our proposed method can achieve up to 0.63% word-error-rate improvement on test-other and improve the inference speed by up to 13% (left product) and 33% (right product) on the LA module."
Fast and accurate factorized neural transducer for text adaption of end-to-end speech recognition models,"Neural transducer is now the most popular end-to-end model for speech recognition, due to its naturally streaming ability. However, it is challenging to adapt it with text-only data. Factorized neural transducer (FNT) model was proposed to mitigate this problem. The improved adaptation ability of FNT on text-only adaptation data came at the cost of lowered accuracy compared to the standard neural transducer model. We propose several methods to improve the performance of the FNT model. They are: adding CTC criterion during training, adding KL divergence loss during adaptation, using a pre-trained language model to seed the vocabulary predictor, and an efficient adaptation approach by interpolating the vocabulary predictor with the n-gram language model. A combination of these approaches results in a relative word-error-rate reduction of 9.48\% from the standard FNT model. Furthermore, n-gram interpolation with the vocabulary predictor improves the adaptation speed hugely with satisfactory adaptation performance."
Continual Learning for On-Device Speech Recognition using Disentangled Conformers,"Automatic speech recognition research focuses on training and evaluating on static datasets. Yet, as speech models are increasingly deployed on personal devices, such models encounter user-specific distributional shifts. To simulate this real-world scenario, we introduce LibriContinual, a continual learning benchmark for speaker-specific domain adaptation derived from LibriVox audiobooks, with data corresponding to 118 individual speakers and 6 train splits per speaker of different sizes. Additionally, current speech recognition models and continual learning algorithms are not optimized to be compute-efficient. We adapt a general-purpose training algorithm NetAug for ASR and create a novel Conformer variant called the DisConformer (Disentangled Conformer). This algorithm produces ASR models consisting of a frozen 'core' network for general-purpose use and several tunable 'augment' networks for speaker-specific tuning. Using such models, we propose a novel compute-efficient continual learning algorithm called DisentangledCL. Our experiments show that the DisConformer models significantly outperform baselines on general ASR i.e. LibriSpeech (15.58% rel. WER on test-other). On speaker-specific LibriContinual they significantly outperform trainable-parameter-matched baselines (by 20.65% rel. WER on test) and even match fully finetuned baselines in some settings."
Surrogate Gradient Spiking Neural Networks as Encoders for Large Vocabulary Continuous Speech Recognition,"Compared to conventional artificial neurons that produce dense and real-valued responses, biologically-inspired spiking neurons transmit sparse and binary information, which can also lead to energy-efficient implementations. Recent research has shown that spiking neural networks can be trained like standard recurrent neural networks using the surrogate gradient method. They have shown promising results on speech command recognition tasks. Using the same technique, we show that they are scalable to large vocabulary continuous speech recognition, where they are capable of replacing LSTMs in the encoder with only minor loss of performance. This suggests that they may be applicable to more involved sequence-to-sequence tasks. Moreover, in contrast to their recurrent non-spiking counterparts, they show robustness to exploding gradient problems without the need to use gates."
Cross-Modal Mutual Learning for Cued Speech Recognition,"Automatic Cued Speech Recognition (ACSR) provides an intelligent human-machine interface for visual communications, where the Cued Speech (CS) system utilizes lip movements and hand gestures to code spoken language for hearing-impaired people. Previous ACSR approaches often utilize direct feature concatenation as the main fusion paradigm. However, the asynchronous modalities i.e., lip, hand shape and hand position) in CS may cause interference for feature concatenation. To address this challenge, we propose a transformer based cross-modal mutual learning framework to prompt multi-modal interaction. Compared with the vanilla self-attention, our model forces modality-specific information of different modalities to pass through a modality-invariant codebook, collating linguistic representations for tokens of each modality. Then the shared linguistic knowledge is used to re-synchronize multi-modal sequences. Moreover, we establish a novel large-scale multi-speaker CS dataset for Mandarin Chinese. To our knowledge, this is the first work on ACSR for Mandarin Chinese. Extensive experiments are conducted for different languages i.e., Chinese, French, and British English). Results demonstrate that our model exhibits superior recognition performance to the state-of-the-art by a large margin."
SoftCorrect: Error Correction with Soft Detection for Automatic Speech Recognition,"Error correction in automatic speech recognition (ASR) aims to correct those incorrect words in sentences generated by ASR models. Since recent ASR models usually have low word error rate (WER), to avoid affecting originally correct tokens, error correction models should only modify incorrect words, and therefore detecting incorrect words is important for error correction. Previous works on error correction either implicitly detect error words through target-source attention or CTC (connectionist temporal classification) loss, or explicitly locate specific deletion/substitution/insertion errors. However, implicit error detection does not provide clear signal about which tokens are incorrect and explicit error detection suffers from low detection accuracy. In this paper, we propose SoftCorrect with a soft error detection mechanism to avoid the limitations of both explicit and implicit error detection. Specifically, we first detect whether a token is correct or not through a probability produced by a dedicatedly designed language model, and then design a constrained CTC loss that only duplicates the detected incorrect tokens to let the decoder focus on the correction of error tokens. Compared with implicit error detection with CTC loss, SoftCorrect provides explicit signal about which words are incorrect and thus does not need to duplicate every token but only incorrect tokens; compared with explicit error detection, SoftCorrect does not detect specific deletion/substitution/insertion errors but just leaves it to CTC loss. Experiments on AISHELL-1 and Aidatatang datasets show that SoftCorrect achieves 26.1% and 9.4% CER reduction respectively, outperforming previous works by a large margin, while still enjoying fast speed of parallel generation."
MMSpeech: Multi-modal Multi-task Encoder-Decoder Pre-training for Speech Recognition,"In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal multi-task encoder-decoder pre-training framework (MMSpeech) for Mandarin automatic speech recognition (ASR), which employs both unlabeled speech and text data. The main difficulty in speech-text joint pre-training comes from the significant difference between speech and text modalities, especially for Mandarin speech and text. Unlike English and other languages with an alphabetic writing system, Mandarin uses an ideographic writing system where character and sound are not tightly mapped to one another. Therefore, we propose to introduce the phoneme modality into pre-training, which can help capture modality-invariant information between Mandarin speech and text. Specifically, we employ a multi-task learning framework including five self-supervised and supervised tasks with speech and text data. For end-to-end pre-training, we introduce self-supervised speech-to-pseudo-codes (S2C) and phoneme-to-text (P2T) tasks utilizing unlabeled speech and text data, where speech-pseudo-codes pairs and phoneme-text pairs are a supplement to the supervised speech-text pairs. To train the encoder to learn better speech representation, we introduce self-supervised masked speech prediction (MSP) and supervised phoneme prediction (PP) tasks to learn to map speech into phonemes. Besides, we directly add the downstream supervised speech-to-text (S2T) task into the pre-training process, which can further improve the pre-training performance and achieve better recognition results even without fine-tuning. Experiments on AISHELL-1 show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a more than 40% relative improvement compared with other pre-training methods."
Handling and extracting key entities from customer conversations using Speech recognition and Named Entity recognition,"In this modern era of technology with e-commerce developing at a rapid pace, it is very important to understand customer requirements and details from a business conversation. It is very crucial for customer retention and satisfaction. Extracting key insights from these conversations is very important when it comes to developing their product or solving their issue. Understanding customer feedback, responses, and important details of the product are essential and it would be done using Named entity recognition (NER). For extracting the entities we would be converting the conversations to text using the optimal speech-to-text model. The model would be a two-stage network in which the conversation is converted to text. Then, suitable entities are extracted using robust techniques using a NER BERT transformer model. This will aid in the enrichment of customer experience when there is an issue which is faced by them. If a customer faces a problem he will call and register his complaint. The model will then extract the key features from this conversation which will be necessary to look into the problem. These features would include details like the order number, and the exact problem. All these would be extracted directly from the conversation and this would reduce the effort of going through the conversation again."
Analysis of constant-Q filterbank based representations for speech emotion recognition,"This work analyzes the constant-Q filterbank-based time-frequency representations for speech emotion recognition (SER). Constant-Q filterbank provides non-linear spectro-temporal representation with higher frequency resolution at low frequencies. Our investigation reveals how the increased low-frequency resolution benefits SER. The time-domain comparative analysis between short-term mel-frequency spectral coefficients (MFSCs) and constant-Q filterbank-based features, namely constant-Q transform (CQT) and continuous wavelet transform (CWT), reveals that constant-Q representations provide higher time-invariance at low-frequencies. This provides increased robustness against emotion irrelevant temporal variations in pitch, especially for low-arousal emotions. The corresponding frequency-domain analysis over different emotion classes shows better resolution of pitch harmonics in constant-Q-based time-frequency representations than MFSC. These advantages of constant-Q representations are further consolidated by SER performance in the extensive evaluation of features over four publicly available databases with six advanced deep neural network architectures as the back-end classifiers. Our inferences in this study hint toward the suitability and potentiality of constant-Q features for SER."
Benchmarking Evaluation Metrics for Code-Switching Automatic Speech Recognition,"Code-switching poses a number of challenges and opportunities for multilingual automatic speech recognition. In this paper, we focus on the question of robust and fair evaluation metrics. To that end, we develop a reference benchmark data set of code-switching speech recognition hypotheses with human judgments. We define clear guidelines for minimal editing of automatic hypotheses. We validate the guidelines using 4-way inter-annotator agreement. We evaluate a large number of metrics in terms of correlation with human judgments. The metrics we consider vary in terms of representation (orthographic, phonological, semantic), directness (intrinsic vs extrinsic), granularity (e.g. word, character), and similarity computation method. The highest correlation to human judgment is achieved using transliteration followed by text normalization. We release the first corpus for human acceptance of code-switching speech recognition results in dialectal Arabic/English conversation speech."
On Word Error Rate Definitions and their Efficient Computation for Multi-Speaker Speech Recognition Systems,"We present a general framework to compute the word error rate (WER) of ASR systems that process recordings containing multiple speakers at their input and that produce multiple output word sequences (MIMO). Such ASR systems are typically required, e.g., for meeting transcription. We provide an efficient implementation based on a dynamic programming search in a multi-dimensional Levenshtein distance tensor under the constraint that a reference utterance must be matched consistently with one hypothesis output. This also results in an efficient implementation of the ORC WER which previously suffered from exponential complexity. We give an overview of commonly used WER definitions for multi-speaker scenarios and show that they are specializations of the above MIMO WER tuned to particular application scenarios. We conclude with a discussion of the pros and cons of the various WER definitions and a recommendation when to use which."
Inter-KD: Intermediate Knowledge Distillation for CTC-Based Automatic Speech Recognition,"Recently, the advance in deep learning has brought a considerable improvement in the end-to-end speech recognition field, simplifying the traditional pipeline while producing promising results. Among the end-to-end models, the connectionist temporal classification (CTC)-based model has attracted research interest due to its non-autoregressive nature. However, such CTC models require a heavy computational cost to achieve outstanding performance. To mitigate the computational burden, we propose a simple yet effective knowledge distillation (KD) for the CTC framework, namely Inter-KD, that additionally transfers the teacher's knowledge to the intermediate CTC layers of the student network. From the experimental results on the LibriSpeech, we verify that the Inter-KD shows better achievements compared to the conventional KD methods. Without using any language model (LM) and data augmentation, Inter-KD improves the word error rate (WER) performance from 8.85 % to 6.30 % on the test-clean."
A new Speech Feature Fusion method with cross gate parallel CNN for Speaker Recognition,"In this paper, a new speech feature fusion method is proposed for speaker recognition on the basis of the cross gate parallel convolutional neural network (CG-PCNN). The Mel filter bank features (MFBFs) of different frequency resolutions can be extracted from each speech frame of a speaker's speech by several Mel filter banks, where the numbers of the triangular filters in the Mel filter banks are different. Due to the frequency resolutions of these MFBFs are different, there are some complementaries for these MFBFs. The CG-PCNN is utilized to extract the deep features from these MFBFs, which applies a cross gate mechanism to capture the complementaries for improving the performance of the speaker recognition system. Then, the fusion feature can be obtained by concatenating these deep features for speaker recognition. The experimental results show that the speaker recognition system with the proposed speech feature fusion method is effective, and marginally outperforms the existing state-of-the-art systems."
"SpeechNet: Weakly Supervised, End-to-End Speech Recognition at Industrial Scale","End-to-end automatic speech recognition systems represent the state of the art, but they rely on thousands of hours of manually annotated speech for training, as well as heavyweight computation for inference. Of course, this impedes commercialization since most companies lack vast human and computational resources. In this paper, we explore training and deploying an ASR system in the label-scarce, compute-limited setting. To reduce human labor, we use a third-party ASR system as a weak supervision source, supplemented with labeling functions derived from implicit user feedback. To accelerate inference, we propose to route production-time queries across a pool of CUDA graphs of varying input lengths, the distribution of which best matches the traffic's. Compared to our third-party ASR, we achieve a relative improvement in word-error rate of 8% and a speedup of 600%. Our system, called SpeechNet, currently serves 12 million queries per day on our voice-enabled smart television. To our knowledge, this is the first time a large-scale, Wav2vec-based deployment has been described in the academic literature."
Stutter-TTS: Controlled Synthesis and Improved Recognition of Stuttered Speech,"Stuttering is a speech disorder where the natural flow of speech is interrupted by blocks, repetitions or prolongations of syllables, words and phrases. The majority of existing automatic speech recognition (ASR) interfaces perform poorly on utterances with stutter, mainly due to lack of matched training data. Synthesis of speech with stutter thus presents an opportunity to improve ASR for this type of speech. We describe Stutter-TTS, an end-to-end neural text-to-speech model capable of synthesizing diverse types of stuttering utterances. We develop a simple, yet effective prosody-control strategy whereby additional tokens are introduced into source text during training to represent specific stuttering characteristics. By choosing the position of the stutter tokens, Stutter-TTS allows word-level control of where stuttering occurs in the synthesized utterance. We are able to synthesize stutter events with high accuracy (F1-scores between 0.63 and 0.84, depending on stutter type). By fine-tuning an ASR model on synthetic stuttered speech we are able to reduce word error by 5.7% relative on stuttered utterances, with only minor (<0.2% relative) degradation for fluent utterances."
Hey ASR System! Why Aren't You More Inclusive? Automatic Speech Recognition Systems' Bias and Proposed Bias Mitigation Techniques. A Literature Review,"Speech is the fundamental means of communication between humans. The advent of AI and sophisticated speech technologies have led to the rapid proliferation of human-to-computer-based interactions, fueled primarily by Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. ASR systems normally take human speech in the form of audio and convert it into words, but for some users, it cannot decode the speech, and any output text is filled with errors that are incomprehensible to the human reader. These systems do not work equally for everyone and actually hinder the productivity of some users. In this paper, we present research that addresses ASR biases against gender, race, and the sick and disabled, while exploring studies that propose ASR debiasing techniques for mitigating these discriminations. We also discuss techniques for designing a more accessible and inclusive ASR technology. For each approach surveyed, we also provide a summary of the investigation and methods applied, the ASR systems and corpora used, and the research findings, and highlight their strengths and/or weaknesses. Finally, we propose future opportunities for Natural Language Processing researchers to explore in the next level creation of ASR technologies."
LongFNT: Long-form Speech Recognition with Factorized Neural Transducer,"Traditional automatic speech recognition~(ASR) systems usually focus on individual utterances, without considering long-form speech with useful historical information, which is more practical in real scenarios. Simply attending longer transcription history for a vanilla neural transducer model shows no much gain in our preliminary experiments, since the prediction network is not a pure language model. This motivates us to leverage the factorized neural transducer structure, containing a real language model, the vocabulary predictor. We propose the {LongFNT-Text} architecture, which fuses the sentence-level long-form features directly with the output of the vocabulary predictor and then embeds token-level long-form features inside the vocabulary predictor, with a pre-trained contextual encoder RoBERTa to further boost the performance. Moreover, we propose the {LongFNT} architecture by extending the long-form speech to the original speech input and achieve the best performance. The effectiveness of our LongFNT approach is validated on LibriSpeech and GigaSpeech corpora with 19% and 12% relative word error rate~(WER) reduction, respectively."
Unsupervised Model-based speaker adaptation of end-to-end lattice-free MMI model for speech recognition,"Modeling the speaker variability is a key challenge for automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. In this paper, the learning hidden unit contributions (LHUC) based adaptation techniques with compact speaker dependent (SD) parameters are used to facilitate both speaker adaptive training (SAT) and unsupervised test-time speaker adaptation for end-to-end (E2E) lattice-free MMI (LF-MMI) models. An unsupervised model-based adaptation framework is proposed to estimate the SD parameters in E2E paradigm using LF-MMI and cross entropy (CE) criterions. Various regularization methods of the standard LHUC adaptation, e.g., the Bayesian LHUC (BLHUC) adaptation, are systematically investigated to mitigate the risk of overfitting, on E2E LF-MMI CNN-TDNN and CNN-TDNN-BLSTM models. Lattice-based confidence score estimation is used for adaptation data selection to reduce the supervision label uncertainty. Experiments on the 300-hour Switchboard task suggest that applying BLHUC in the proposed unsupervised E2E adaptation framework to byte pair encoding (BPE) based E2E LF-MMI systems consistently outperformed the baseline systems by relative word error rate (WER) reductions up to 10.5% and 14.7% on the NIST Hub5'00 and RT03 evaluation sets, and achieved the best performance in WERs of 9.0% and 9.7%, respectively. These results are comparable to the results of state-of-the-art adapted LF-MMI hybrid systems and adapted Conformer-based E2E systems."
Avoid Overthinking in Self-Supervised Models for Speech Recognition,"Self-supervised learning (SSL) models reshaped our approach to speech, language and vision. However their huge size and the opaque relations between their layers and tasks result in slow inference and network overthinking, where predictions made from the last layer of large models is worse than those made from intermediate layers. Early exit (EE) strategies can solve both issues by dynamically reducing computations at inference time for certain samples. Although popular for classification tasks in vision and language, EE has seen less use for sequence-to-sequence speech recognition (ASR) tasks where outputs from early layers are often degenerate. This challenge is further compounded when speech SSL models are applied on out-of-distribution (OOD) data. This paper first shows that SSL models do overthinking in ASR. We then motivate further research in EE by computing an optimal bound for performance versus speed trade-offs. To approach this bound we propose two new strategies for ASR: (1) we adapt the recently proposed patience strategy to ASR; and (2) we design a new EE strategy specific to ASR that performs better than all strategies previously introduced."
Data Augmentation with Unsupervised Speaking Style Transfer for Speech Emotion Recognition,"Currently, the performance of Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) systems is mainly constrained by the absence of large-scale labelled corpora. Data augmentation is regarded as a promising approach, which borrows methods from Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), for instance, perturbation on speed and pitch, or generating emotional speech utilizing generative adversarial networks. In this paper, we propose EmoAug, a novel style transfer model to augment emotion expressions, in which a semantic encoder and a paralinguistic encoder represent verbal and non-verbal information respectively. Additionally, a decoder reconstructs speech signals by conditioning on the aforementioned two information flows in an unsupervised fashion. Once training is completed, EmoAug enriches expressions of emotional speech in different prosodic attributes, such as stress, rhythm and intensity, by feeding different styles into the paralinguistic encoder. In addition, we can also generate similar numbers of samples for each class to tackle the data imbalance issue. Experimental results on the IEMOCAP dataset demonstrate that EmoAug can successfully transfer different speaking styles while retaining the speaker identity and semantic content. Furthermore, we train a SER model with data augmented by EmoAug and show that it not only surpasses the state-of-the-art supervised and self-supervised methods but also overcomes overfitting problems caused by data imbalance. Some audio samples can be found on our demo website."
Speaker Adaptation for End-To-End Speech Recognition Systems in Noisy Environments,"We analyze the impact of speaker adaptation in end-to-end architectures based on transformers and wav2vec 2.0 under different noise conditions. We demonstrate that the proven method of concatenating speaker vectors to the acoustic features and supplying them as an auxiliary model input remains a viable option to increase the robustness of end-to-end architectures. By including speaker embeddings obtained from x-vector and ECAPA-TDNN models, we achieve relative word error rate improvements of up to 9.6% on LibriSpeech and up to 14.5% on Switchboard. The effect on transformer-based architectures is approximately inversely proportional to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and is strongest in heavily noised environments (SNR=0). The most substantial benefit of speaker adaption in systems based on wav2vec 2.0 can be achieved under moderate noise conditions (SNR\geq18). We also find that x-vectors tend to yield larger improvements than ECAPA-TDNN embeddings."
Streaming Joint Speech Recognition and Disfluency Detection,"Disfluency detection has mainly been solved in a pipeline approach, as post-processing of speech recognition. In this study, we propose Transformer-based encoder-decoder models that jointly solve speech recognition and disfluency detection, which work in a streaming manner. Compared to pipeline approaches, the joint models can leverage acoustic information that makes disfluency detection robust to recognition errors and provide non-verbal clues. Moreover, joint modeling results in low-latency and lightweight inference. We investigate two joint model variants for streaming disfluency detection: a transcript-enriched model and a multi-task model. The transcript-enriched model is trained on text with special tags indicating the starting and ending points of the disfluent part. However, it has problems with latency and standard language model adaptation, which arise from the additional disfluency tags. We propose a multi-task model to solve such problems, which has two output layers at the Transformer decoder; one for speech recognition and the other for disfluency detection. It is modeled to be conditioned on the currently recognized token with an additional token-dependency mechanism. We show that the proposed joint models outperformed a BERT-based pipeline approach in both accuracy and latency, on both the Switchboard and the corpus of spontaneous Japanese."
Multilingual Speech Emotion Recognition With Multi-Gating Mechanism and Neural Architecture Search,"Speech emotion recognition (SER) classifies audio into emotion categories such as Happy, Angry, Fear, Disgust and Neutral. While Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is a common application for popular languages, it continues to be a problem for low-resourced languages, i.e., languages with no pretrained speech-to-text recognition models. This paper firstly proposes a language-specific model that extract emotional information from multiple pre-trained speech models, and then designs a multi-domain model that simultaneously performs SER for various languages. Our multidomain model employs a multi-gating mechanism to generate unique weighted feature combination for each language, and also searches for specific neural network structure for each language through a neural architecture search module. In addition, we introduce a contrastive auxiliary loss to build more separable representations for audio data. Our experiments show that our model raises the state-of-the-art accuracy by 3% for German and 14.3% for French."
Temporal Modeling Matters: A Novel Temporal Emotional Modeling Approach for Speech Emotion Recognition,"Speech emotion recognition (SER) plays a vital role in improving the interactions between humans and machines by inferring human emotion and affective states from speech signals. Whereas recent works primarily focus on mining spatiotemporal information from hand-crafted features, we explore how to model the temporal patterns of speech emotions from dynamic temporal scales. Towards that goal, we introduce a novel temporal emotional modeling approach for SER, termed Temporal-aware bI-direction Multi-scale Network (TIM-Net), which learns multi-scale contextual affective representations from various time scales. Specifically, TIM-Net first employs temporal-aware blocks to learn temporal affective representation, then integrates complementary information from the past and the future to enrich contextual representations, and finally, fuses multiple time scale features for better adaptation to the emotional variation. Extensive experimental results on six benchmark SER datasets demonstrate the superior performance of TIM-Net, gaining 2.34% and 2.61% improvements of the average UAR and WAR over the second-best on each corpus. The source code is available at https://github.com/Jiaxin-Ye/TIM-Net_SER."
Improving Children's Speech Recognition by Fine-tuning Self-supervised Adult Speech Representations,"Children's speech recognition is a vital, yet largely overlooked domain when building inclusive speech technologies. The major challenge impeding progress in this domain is the lack of adequate child speech corpora; however, recent advances in self-supervised learning have created a new opportunity for overcoming this problem of data scarcity. In this paper, we leverage self-supervised adult speech representations and use three well-known child speech corpora to build models for children's speech recognition. We assess the performance of fine-tuning on both native and non-native children's speech, examine the effect of cross-domain child corpora, and investigate the minimum amount of child speech required to fine-tune a model which outperforms a state-of-the-art adult model. We also analyze speech recognition performance across children's ages. Our results demonstrate that fine-tuning with cross-domain child corpora leads to relative improvements of up to 46.08% and 45.53% for native and non-native child speech respectively, and absolute improvements of 14.70% and 31.10%. We also show that with as little as 5 hours of transcribed children's speech, it is possible to fine-tune a children's speech recognition system that outperforms a state-of-the-art adult model fine-tuned on 960 hours of adult speech."
Describing emotions with acoustic property prompts for speech emotion recognition,"Emotions lie on a broad continuum and treating emotions as a discrete number of classes limits the ability of a model to capture the nuances in the continuum. The challenge is how to describe the nuances of emotions and how to enable a model to learn the descriptions. In this work, we devise a method to automatically create a description (or prompt) for a given audio by computing acoustic properties, such as pitch, loudness, speech rate, and articulation rate. We pair a prompt with its corresponding audio using 5 different emotion datasets. We trained a neural network model using these audio-text pairs. Then, we evaluate the model using one more dataset. We investigate how the model can learn to associate the audio with the descriptions, resulting in performance improvement of Speech Emotion Recognition and Speech Audio Retrieval. We expect our findings to motivate research describing the broad continuum of emotion"
The Far Side of Failure: Investigating the Impact of Speech Recognition Errors on Subsequent Dementia Classification,"Linguistic anomalies detectable in spontaneous speech have shown promise for various clinical applications including screening for dementia and other forms of cognitive impairment. The feasibility of deploying automated tools that can classify language samples obtained from speech in large-scale clinical settings depends on the ability to capture and automatically transcribe the speech for subsequent analysis. However, the impressive performance of self-supervised learning (SSL) automatic speech recognition (ASR) models with curated speech data is not apparent with challenging speech samples from clinical settings. One of the key questions for successfully applying ASR models for clinical applications is whether imperfect transcripts they generate provide sufficient information for downstream tasks to operate at an acceptable level of accuracy. In this study, we examine the relationship between the errors produced by several deep learning ASR systems and their impact on the downstream task of dementia classification. One of our key findings is that, paradoxically, ASR systems with relatively high error rates can produce transcripts that result in better downstream classification accuracy than classification based on verbatim transcripts."
Sentiment recognition of Italian elderly through domain adaptation on cross-corpus speech dataset,"The aim of this work is to define a speech emotion recognition (SER) model able to recognize positive, neutral and negative emotions in natural conversations of Italian elderly people. Several datasets for SER are available in the literature. However most of them are in English or Chinese, have been recorded while actors and actresses pronounce short phrases and thus are not related to natural conversation. Moreover only few speeches among all the databases are related to elderly people. Therefore, in this work, a multi-language and multi-age corpus is considered merging a dataset in English, that includes also elderly people, with a dataset in Italian. A general model, trained on young and adult English actors and actresses is proposed, based on XGBoost. Then two strategies of domain adaptation are proposed to adapt the model either to elderly people and to Italian speakers. The results suggest that this approach increases the classification performance, underlining also that new datasets should be collected."
Self-supervised learning with bi-label masked speech prediction for streaming multi-talker speech recognition,"Self-supervised learning (SSL), which utilizes the input data itself for representation learning, has achieved state-of-the-art results for various downstream speech tasks. However, most of the previous studies focused on offline single-talker applications, with limited investigations in multi-talker cases, especially for streaming scenarios. In this paper, we investigate SSL for streaming multi-talker speech recognition, which generates transcriptions of overlapping speakers in a streaming fashion. We first observe that conventional SSL techniques do not work well on this task due to the poor representation of overlapping speech. We then propose a novel SSL training objective, referred to as bi-label masked speech prediction, which explicitly preserves representations of all speakers in overlapping speech. We investigate various aspects of the proposed system including data configuration and quantizer selection. The proposed SSL setup achieves substantially better word error rates on the LibriSpeechMix dataset."
Adaptive Multi-Corpora Language Model Training for Speech Recognition,"Neural network language model (NNLM) plays an essential role in automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems, especially in adaptation tasks when text-only data is available. In practice, an NNLM is typically trained on a combination of data sampled from multiple corpora. Thus, the data sampling strategy is important to the adaptation performance. Most existing works focus on designing static sampling strategies. However, each corpus may show varying impacts at different NNLM training stages. In this paper, we introduce a novel adaptive multi-corpora training algorithm that dynamically learns and adjusts the sampling probability of each corpus along the training process. The algorithm is robust to corpora sizes and domain relevance. Compared with static sampling strategy baselines, the proposed approach yields remarkable improvement by achieving up to relative 7% and 9% word error rate (WER) reductions on in-domain and out-of-domain adaptation tasks, respectively."
Improving Noisy Student Training on Non-target Domain Data for Automatic Speech Recognition,"Noisy Student Training (NST) has recently demonstrated extremely strong performance in Automatic Speech Recognition(ASR). In this paper, we propose a data selection strategy named LM Filter to improve the performance of NST on non-target domain data in ASR tasks. Hypotheses with and without a Language Model are generated and the CER differences between them are utilized as a filter threshold. Results reveal that significant improvements of 10.4% compared with no data filtering baselines. We can achieve 3.31% CER in AISHELL-1 test set, which is best result from our knowledge without any other supervised data. We also perform evaluations on the supervised 1000 hour AISHELL-2 dataset and competitive results of 4.73% CER can be achieved."
Towards Improved Room Impulse Response Estimation for Speech Recognition,"We propose a novel approach for blind room impulse response (RIR) estimation systems in the context of a downstream application scenario, far-field automatic speech recognition (ASR). We first draw the connection between improved RIR estimation and improved ASR performance, as a means of evaluating neural RIR estimators. We then propose a generative adversarial network (GAN) based architecture that encodes RIR features from reverberant speech and constructs an RIR from the encoded features, and uses a novel energy decay relief loss to optimize for capturing energy-based properties of the input reverberant speech. We show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines on acoustic benchmarks (by 17\% on the energy decay relief and 22\% on an early-reflection energy metric), as well as in an ASR evaluation task (by 6.9\% in word error rate)."
ATCO2 corpus: A Large-Scale Dataset for Research on Automatic Speech Recognition and Natural Language Understanding of Air Traffic Control Communications,"Personal assistants, automatic speech recognizers and dialogue understanding systems are becoming more critical in our interconnected digital world. A clear example is air traffic control (ATC) communications. ATC aims at guiding aircraft and controlling the airspace in a safe and optimal manner. These voice-based dialogues are carried between an air traffic controller (ATCO) and pilots via very-high frequency radio channels. In order to incorporate these novel technologies into ATC (low-resource domain), large-scale annotated datasets are required to develop the data-driven AI systems. Two examples are automatic speech recognition (ASR) and natural language understanding (NLU). In this paper, we introduce the ATCO2 corpus, a dataset that aims at fostering research on the challenging ATC field, which has lagged behind due to lack of annotated data. The ATCO2 corpus covers 1) data collection and pre-processing, 2) pseudo-annotations of speech data, and 3) extraction of ATC-related named entities. The ATCO2 corpus is split into three subsets. 1) ATCO2-test-set corpus contains 4 hours of ATC speech with manual transcripts and a subset with gold annotations for named-entity recognition (callsign, command, value). 2) The ATCO2-PL-set corpus consists of 5281 hours of unlabeled ATC data enriched with automatic transcripts from an in-domain speech recognizer, contextual information, speaker turn information, signal-to-noise ratio estimate and English language detection score per sample. Both available for purchase through ELDA at http://catalog.elra.info/en-us/repository/browse/ELRA-S0484. 3) The ATCO2-test-set-1h corpus is a one-hour subset from the original test set corpus, that we are offering for free at https://www.atco2.org/data. We expect the ATCO2 corpus will foster research on robust ASR and NLU not only in the field of ATC communications but also in the general research community."
"Streaming, fast and accurate on-device Inverse Text Normalization for Automatic Speech Recognition","Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems typically yield output in lexical form. However, humans prefer a written form output. To bridge this gap, ASR systems usually employ Inverse Text Normalization (ITN).  In previous works, Weighted Finite State Transducers (WFST) have been employed to do ITN. WFSTs are nicely suited to this task but their size and run-time costs can make deployment on embedded applications challenging.  In this paper, we describe the development of an on-device ITN system that is streaming, lightweight & accurate. At the core of our system is a streaming transformer tagger, that tags lexical tokens from ASR. The tag informs which ITN category might be applied, if at all. Following that, we apply an ITN-category-specific WFST, only on the tagged text, to reliably perform the ITN conversion. We show that the proposed ITN solution performs equivalent to strong baselines, while being significantly smaller in size and retaining customization capabilities."
Multi-blank Transducers for Speech Recognition,"This paper proposes a modification to RNN-Transducer (RNN-T) models for automatic speech recognition (ASR). In standard RNN-T, the emission of a blank symbol consumes exactly one input frame; in our proposed method, we introduce additional blank symbols, which consume two or more input frames when emitted. We refer to the added symbols as big blanks, and the method multi-blank RNN-T. For training multi-blank RNN-Ts, we propose a novel logit under-normalization method in order to prioritize emissions of big blanks. With experiments on multiple languages and datasets, we show that multi-blank RNN-T methods could bring relative speedups of over +90%/+139% to model inference for English Librispeech and German Multilingual Librispeech datasets, respectively. The multi-blank RNN-T method also improves ASR accuracy consistently. We will release our implementation of the method in the NeMo (\url{https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo}) toolkit."
"Hi,KIA: A Speech Emotion Recognition Dataset for Wake-Up Words","Wake-up words (WUW) is a short sentence used to activate a speech recognition system to receive the user's speech input. WUW utterances include not only the lexical information for waking up the system but also non-lexical information such as speaker identity or emotion. In particular, recognizing the user's emotional state may elaborate the voice communication. However, there is few dataset where the emotional state of the WUW utterances is labeled. In this paper, we introduce Hi, KIA, a new WUW dataset which consists of 488 Korean accent emotional utterances collected from four male and four female speakers and each of utterances is labeled with four emotional states including anger, happy, sad, or neutral. We present the step-by-step procedure to build the dataset, covering scenario selection, post-processing, and human validation for label agreement. Also, we provide two classification models for WUW speech emotion recognition using the dataset. One is based on traditional hand-craft features and the other is a transfer-learning approach using a pre-trained neural network. These classification models could be used as benchmarks in further research."
Evaluation of Automated Speech Recognition Systems for Conversational Speech: A Linguistic Perspective,"Automatic speech recognition (ASR) meets more informal and free-form input data as voice user interfaces and conversational agents such as the voice assistants such as Alexa, Google Home, etc., gain popularity. Conversational speech is both the most difficult and environmentally relevant sort of data for speech recognition. In this paper, we take a linguistic perspective, and take the French language as a case study toward disambiguation of the French homophones. Our contribution aims to provide more insight into human speech transcription accuracy in conditions to reproduce those of state-of-the-art ASR systems, although in a much focused situation. We investigate a case study involving the most common errors encountered in the automatic transcription of French language."
LAMASSU: Streaming Language-Agnostic Multilingual Speech Recognition and Translation Using Neural Transducers,"End-to-end formulation of automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech translation (ST) makes it easy to use a single model for both multilingual ASR and many-to-many ST. In this paper, we propose streaming language-agnostic multilingual speech recognition and translation using neural transducers (LAMASSU). To enable multilingual text generation in LAMASSU, we conduct a systematic comparison between specified and unified prediction and joint networks. We leverage a language-agnostic multilingual encoder that substantially outperforms shared encoders. To enhance LAMASSU, we propose to feed target LID to encoders. We also apply connectionist temporal classification regularization to transducer training. Experimental results show that LAMASSU not only drastically reduces the model size but also outperforms monolingual ASR and bilingual ST models."
SPEAKER VGG CCT: Cross-corpus Speech Emotion Recognition with Speaker Embedding and Vision Transformers,"In recent years, Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) has been investigated mainly transforming the speech signal into spectrograms that are then classified using Convolutional Neural Networks pretrained on generic images and fine tuned with spectrograms. In this paper, we start from the general idea above and develop a new learning solution for SER, which is based on Compact Convolutional Transformers (CCTs) combined with a speaker embedding. With CCTs, the learning power of Vision Transformers (ViT) is combined with a diminished need for large volume of data as made possible by the convolution. This is important in SER, where large corpora of data are usually not available. The speaker embedding allows the network to extract an identity representation of the speaker, which is then integrated by means of a self-attention mechanism with the features that the CCT extracts from the spectrogram. Overall, the solution is capable of operating in real-time showing promising results in a cross-corpus scenario, where training and test datasets are kept separate. Experiments have been performed on several benchmarks in a cross-corpus setting as rarely used in the literature, with results that are comparable or superior to those obtained with state-of-the-art network architectures. Our code is available at https://github.com/JabuMlDev/Speaker-VGG-CCT."
Minimum Latency Training of Sequence Transducers for Streaming End-to-End Speech Recognition,"Sequence transducers, such as the RNN-T and the Conformer-T, are one of the most promising models of end-to-end speech recognition, especially in streaming scenarios where both latency and accuracy are important. Although various methods, such as alignment-restricted training and FastEmit, have been studied to reduce the latency, latency reduction is often accompanied with a significant degradation in accuracy. We argue that this suboptimal performance might be caused because none of the prior methods explicitly model and reduce the latency. In this paper, we propose a new training method to explicitly model and reduce the latency of sequence transducer models. First, we define the expected latency at each diagonal line on the lattice, and show that its gradient can be computed efficiently within the forward-backward algorithm. Then we augment the transducer loss with this expected latency, so that an optimal trade-off between latency and accuracy is achieved. Experimental results on the WSJ dataset show that the proposed minimum latency training reduces the latency of causal Conformer-T from 220 ms to 27 ms within a WER degradation of 0.7%, and outperforms conventional alignment-restricted training (110 ms) and FastEmit (67 ms) methods."
Streaming Audio-Visual Speech Recognition with Alignment Regularization,"Recognizing a word shortly after it is spoken is an important requirement for automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems in real-world scenarios. As a result, a large body of work on streaming audio-only ASR models has been presented in the literature. However, streaming audio-visual automatic speech recognition (AV-ASR) has received little attention in earlier works. In this work, we propose a streaming AV-ASR system based on a hybrid connectionist temporal classification (CTC)/attention neural network architecture. The audio and the visual encoder neural networks are both based on the conformer architecture, which is made streamable using chunk-wise self-attention (CSA) and causal convolution. Streaming recognition with a decoder neural network is realized by using the triggered attention technique, which performs time-synchronous decoding with joint CTC/attention scoring. For frame-level ASR criteria, such as CTC, a synchronized response from the audio and visual encoders is critical for a joint AV decision making process. In this work, we propose a novel alignment regularization technique that promotes synchronization of the audio and visual encoder, which in turn results in better word error rates (WERs) at all SNR levels for streaming and offline AV-ASR models. The proposed AV-ASR model achieves WERs of 2.0% and 2.6% on the Lip Reading Sentences 3 (LRS3) dataset in an offline and online setup, respectively, which both present state-of-the-art results when no external training data are used."
Speech-based emotion recognition with self-supervised models using attentive channel-wise correlations and label smoothing,"When recognizing emotions from speech, we encounter two common problems: how to optimally capture emotion-relevant information from the speech signal and how to best quantify or categorize the noisy subjective emotion labels. Self-supervised pre-trained representations can robustly capture information from speech enabling state-of-the-art results in many downstream tasks including emotion recognition. However, better ways of aggregating the information across time need to be considered as the relevant emotion information is likely to appear piecewise and not uniformly across the signal. For the labels, we need to take into account that there is a substantial degree of noise that comes from the subjective human annotations. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to attentive pooling based on correlations between the representations' coefficients combined with label smoothing, a method aiming to reduce the confidence of the classifier on the training labels. We evaluate our proposed approach on the benchmark dataset IEMOCAP, and demonstrate high performance surpassing that in the literature. The code to reproduce the results is available at github.com/skakouros/s3prl_attentive_correlation."
Hybrid-SD (H_SD): A new hybrid evaluation metric for automatic speech recognition tasks,"Many studies have examined the shortcomings of word error rate (WER) as an evaluation metric for automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems, particularly when used for spoken language understanding tasks such as intent recognition and dialogue systems. In this paper, we propose Hybrid-SD (H_SD), a new hybrid evaluation metric for ASR systems that takes into account both semantic correctness and error rate. To generate sentence dissimilarity scores (SD), we built a fast and lightweight SNanoBERT model using distillation techniques. Our experiments show that the SNanoBERT model is 25.9x smaller and 38.8x faster than SRoBERTa while achieving comparable results on well-known benchmarks. Hence, making it suitable for deploying with ASR models on edge devices. We also show that H_SD correlates more strongly with downstream tasks such as intent recognition and named-entity recognition (NER)."
Adversarial Data Augmentation Using VAE-GAN for Disordered Speech Recognition,"Automatic recognition of disordered speech remains a highly challenging task to date. The underlying neuro-motor conditions, often compounded with co-occurring physical disabilities, lead to the difficulty in collecting large quantities of impaired speech required for ASR system development. This paper presents novel variational auto-encoder generative adversarial network (VAE-GAN) based personalized disordered speech augmentation approaches that simultaneously learn to encode, generate and discriminate synthesized impaired speech. Separate latent features are derived to learn dysarthric speech characteristics and phoneme context representations. Self-supervised pre-trained Wav2vec 2.0 embedding features are also incorporated. Experiments conducted on the UASpeech corpus suggest the proposed adversarial data augmentation approach consistently outperformed the baseline speed perturbation and non-VAE GAN augmentation methods with trained hybrid TDNN and End-to-end Conformer systems. After LHUC speaker adaptation, the best system using VAE-GAN based augmentation produced an overall WER of 27.78% on the UASpeech test set of 16 dysarthric speakers, and the lowest published WER of 57.31% on the subset of speakers with ""Very Low"" intelligibility."
Leveraging Domain Features for Detecting Adversarial Attacks Against Deep Speech Recognition in Noise,"In recent years, significant progress has been made in deep model-based automatic speech recognition (ASR), leading to its widespread deployment in the real world. At the same time, adversarial attacks against deep ASR systems are highly successful. Various methods have been proposed to defend ASR systems from these attacks. However, existing classification based methods focus on the design of deep learning models while lacking exploration of domain specific features. This work leverages filter bank-based features to better capture the characteristics of attacks for improved detection. Furthermore, the paper analyses the potentials of using speech and non-speech parts separately in detecting adversarial attacks. In the end, considering adverse environments where ASR systems may be deployed, we study the impact of acoustic noise of various types and signal-to-noise ratios. Extensive experiments show that the inverse filter bank features generally perform better in both clean and noisy environments, the detection is effective using either speech or non-speech part, and the acoustic noise can largely degrade the detection performance."
"The ISCSLP 2022 Intelligent Cockpit Speech Recognition Challenge (ICSRC): Dataset, Tracks, Baseline and Results","This paper summarizes the outcomes from the ISCSLP 2022 Intelligent Cockpit Speech Recognition Challenge (ICSRC). We first address the necessity of the challenge and then introduce the associated dataset collected from a new-energy vehicle (NEV) covering a variety of cockpit acoustic conditions and linguistic contents. We then describe the track arrangement and the baseline system. Specifically, we set up two tracks in terms of allowed model/system size to investigate resource-constrained and -unconstrained setups, targeting to vehicle embedded as well as cloud ASR systems respectively. Finally we summarize the challenge results and provide the major observations from the submitted systems."
Towards Zero-Shot Code-Switched Speech Recognition,"In this work, we seek to build effective code-switched (CS) automatic speech recognition systems (ASR) under the zero-shot setting where no transcribed CS speech data is available for training. Previously proposed frameworks which conditionally factorize the bilingual task into its constituent monolingual parts are a promising starting point for leveraging monolingual data efficiently. However, these methods require the monolingual modules to perform language segmentation. That is, each monolingual module has to simultaneously detect CS points and transcribe speech segments of one language while ignoring those of other languages -- not a trivial task. We propose to simplify each monolingual module by allowing them to transcribe all speech segments indiscriminately with a monolingual script (i.e. transliteration). This simple modification passes the responsibility of CS point detection to subsequent bilingual modules which determine the final output by considering multiple monolingual transliterations along with external language model information. We apply this transliteration-based approach in an end-to-end differentiable neural network and demonstrate its efficacy for zero-shot CS ASR on Mandarin-English SEAME test sets."
Variable Attention Masking for Configurable Transformer Transducer Speech Recognition,"This work studies the use of attention masking in transformer transducer based speech recognition for building a single configurable model for different deployment scenarios. We present a comprehensive set of experiments comparing fixed masking, where the same attention mask is applied at every frame, with chunked masking, where the attention mask for each frame is determined by chunk boundaries, in terms of recognition accuracy and latency. We then explore the use of variable masking, where the attention masks are sampled from a target distribution at training time, to build models that can work in different configurations. Finally, we investigate how a single configurable model can be used to perform both first pass streaming recognition and second pass acoustic rescoring. Experiments show that chunked masking achieves a better accuracy vs latency trade-off compared to fixed masking, both with and without FastEmit. We also show that variable masking improves the accuracy by up to 8% relative in the acoustic re-scoring scenario."
Intermediate Fine-Tuning Using Imperfect Synthetic Speech for Improving Electrolaryngeal Speech Recognition,"Research on automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems for electrolaryngeal speakers has been relatively unexplored due to small datasets. When training data is lacking in ASR, a large-scale pretraining and fine tuning framework is often sufficient to achieve high recognition rates; however, in electrolaryngeal speech, the domain shift between the pretraining and fine-tuning data is too large to overcome, limiting the maximum improvement of recognition rates. To resolve this, we propose an intermediate fine-tuning step that uses imperfect synthetic speech to close the domain shift gap between the pretraining and target data. Despite the imperfect synthetic data, we show the effectiveness of this on electrolaryngeal speech datasets, with improvements of 6.1% over the baseline that did not use imperfect synthetic speech. Results show how the intermediate fine-tuning stage focuses on learning the high-level inherent features of the imperfect synthetic data rather than the low-level features such as intelligibility."
Monolingual Recognizers Fusion for Code-switching Speech Recognition,"The bi-encoder structure has been intensively investigated in code-switching (CS) automatic speech recognition (ASR). However, most existing methods require the structures of two monolingual ASR models (MAMs) should be the same and only use the encoder of MAMs. This leads to the problem that pre-trained MAMs cannot be timely and fully used for CS ASR. In this paper, we propose a monolingual recognizers fusion method for CS ASR. It has two stages: the speech awareness (SA) stage and the language fusion (LF) stage. In the SA stage, acoustic features are mapped to two language-specific predictions by two independent MAMs. To keep the MAMs focused on their own language, we further extend the language-aware training strategy for the MAMs. In the LF stage, the BELM fuses two language-specific predictions to get the final prediction. Moreover, we propose a text simulation strategy to simplify the training process of the BELM and reduce reliance on CS data. Experiments on a Mandarin-English corpus show the efficiency of the proposed method. The mix error rate is significantly reduced on the test set after using open-source pre-trained MAMs."
Fast-U2++: Fast and Accurate End-to-End Speech Recognition in Joint CTC/Attention Frames,"Recently, the unified streaming and non-streaming two-pass (U2/U2++) end-to-end model for speech recognition has shown great performance in terms of streaming capability, accuracy and latency. In this paper, we present fast-U2++, an enhanced version of U2++ to further reduce partial latency. The core idea of fast-U2++ is to output partial results of the bottom layers in its encoder with a small chunk, while using a large chunk in the top layers of its encoder to compensate the performance degradation caused by the small chunk. Moreover, we use knowledge distillation method to reduce the token emission latency. We present extensive experiments on Aishell-1 dataset. Experiments and ablation studies show that compared to U2++, fast-U2++ reduces model latency from 320ms to 80ms, and achieves a character error rate (CER) of 5.06% with a streaming setup."
Unified End-to-End Speech Recognition and Endpointing for Fast and Efficient Speech Systems,"Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems typically rely on an external endpointer (EP) model to identify speech boundaries. In this work, we propose a method to jointly train the ASR and EP tasks in a single end-to-end (E2E) multitask model, improving EP quality by optionally leveraging information from the ASR audio encoder. We introduce a ""switch"" connection, which trains the EP to consume either the audio frames directly or low-level latent representations from the ASR model. This results in a single E2E model that can be used during inference to perform frame filtering at low cost, and also make high quality end-of-query (EOQ) predictions based on ongoing ASR computation. We present results on a voice search test set showing that, compared to separate single-task models, this approach reduces median endpoint latency by 120 ms (30.8% reduction), and 90th percentile latency by 170 ms (23.0% reduction), without regressing word error rate. For continuous recognition, WER improves by 10.6% (relative)."
A Comparative Study on Multichannel Speaker-Attributed Automatic Speech Recognition in Multi-party Meetings,"Speaker-attributed automatic speech recognition (SA-ASR) in multi-party meeting scenarios is one of the most valuable and challenging ASR task. It was shown that single-channel frame-level diarization with serialized output training (SC-FD-SOT), single-channel word-level diarization with SOT (SC-WD-SOT) and joint training of single-channel target-speaker separation and ASR (SC-TS-ASR) can be exploited to partially solve this problem. In this paper, we propose three corresponding multichannel (MC) SA-ASR approaches, namely MC-FD-SOT, MC-WD-SOT and MC-TS-ASR. For different tasks/models, different multichannel data fusion strategies are considered, including channel-level cross-channel attention for MC-FD-SOT, frame-level cross-channel attention for MC-WD-SOT and neural beamforming for MC-TS-ASR. Results on the AliMeeting corpus reveal that our proposed models can consistently outperform the corresponding single-channel counterparts in terms of the speaker-dependent character error rate."
Adapting self-supervised models to multi-talker speech recognition using speaker embeddings,"Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods which learn representations of data without explicit supervision have gained popularity in speech-processing tasks, particularly for single-talker applications. However, these models often have degraded performance for multi-talker scenarios -- possibly due to the domain mismatch -- which severely limits their use for such applications. In this paper, we investigate the adaptation of upstream SSL models to the multi-talker automatic speech recognition (ASR) task under two conditions. First, when segmented utterances are given, we show that adding a target speaker extraction (TSE) module based on enrollment embeddings is complementary to mixture-aware pre-training. Second, for unsegmented mixtures, we propose a novel joint speaker modeling (JSM) approach, which aggregates information from all speakers in the mixture through their embeddings. With controlled experiments on Libri2Mix, we show that using speaker embeddings provides relative WER improvements of 9.1% and 42.1% over strong baselines for the segmented and unsegmented cases, respectively. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our models for real conversational mixtures through experiments on the AMI dataset."
Speech-text based multi-modal training with bidirectional attention for improved speech recognition,"To let the state-of-the-art end-to-end ASR model enjoy data efficiency, as well as much more unpaired text data by multi-modal training, one needs to address two problems: 1) the synchronicity of feature sampling rates between speech and language (aka text data); 2) the homogeneity of the learned representations from two encoders. In this paper we propose to employ a novel bidirectional attention mechanism (BiAM) to jointly learn both ASR encoder (bottom layers) and text encoder with a multi-modal learning method. The BiAM is to facilitate feature sampling rate exchange, realizing the quality of the transformed features for the one kind to be measured in another space, with diversified objective functions. As a result, the speech representations are enriched with more linguistic information, while the representations generated by the text encoder are more similar to corresponding speech ones, and therefore the shared ASR models are more amenable for unpaired text data pretraining. To validate the efficacy of the proposed method, we perform two categories of experiments with or without extra unpaired text data. Experimental results on Librispeech corpus show it can achieve up to 6.15% word error rate reduction (WERR) with only paired data learning, while 9.23% WERR when more unpaired text data is employed."
Joint Audio/Text Training for Transformer Rescorer of Streaming Speech Recognition,"Recently, there has been an increasing interest in two-pass streaming end-to-end speech recognition (ASR) that incorporates a 2nd-pass rescoring model on top of the conventional 1st-pass streaming ASR model to improve recognition accuracy while keeping latency low. One of the latest 2nd-pass rescoring model, Transformer Rescorer, takes the n-best initial outputs and audio embeddings from the 1st-pass model, and then choose the best output by re-scoring the n-best initial outputs. However, training this Transformer Rescorer requires expensive paired audio-text training data because the model uses audio embeddings as input. In this work, we present our Joint Audio/Text training method for Transformer Rescorer, to leverage unpaired text-only data which is relatively cheaper than paired audio-text data. We evaluate Transformer Rescorer with our Joint Audio/Text training on Librispeech dataset as well as our large-scale in-house dataset and show that our training method can improve word error rate (WER) significantly compared to standard Transformer Rescorer without requiring any extra model parameters or latency."
Structured State Space Decoder for Speech Recognition and Synthesis,"Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems developed in recent years have shown promising results with self-attention models (e.g., Transformer and Conformer), which are replacing conventional recurrent neural networks. Meanwhile, a structured state space model (S4) has been recently proposed, producing promising results for various long-sequence modeling tasks, including raw speech classification. The S4 model can be trained in parallel, same as the Transformer model. In this study, we applied S4 as a decoder for ASR and text-to-speech (TTS) tasks by comparing it with the Transformer decoder. For the ASR task, our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a competitive word error rate (WER) of 1.88%/4.25% on LibriSpeech test-clean/test-other set and a character error rate (CER) of 3.80%/2.63%/2.98% on the CSJ eval1/eval2/eval3 set. Furthermore, the proposed model is more robust than the standard Transformer model, particularly for long-form speech on both the datasets. For the TTS task, the proposed method outperforms the Transformer baseline."
FusionFormer: Fusing Operations in Transformer for Efficient Streaming Speech Recognition,"The recently proposed Conformer architecture which combines convolution with attention to capture both local and global dependencies has become the \textit{de facto} backbone model for Automatic Speech Recognition~(ASR). Inherited from the Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, the architecture takes Layer Normalization~(LN) as a default normalization technique. However, through a series of systematic studies, we find that LN might take 10\% of the inference time despite that it only contributes to 0.1\% of the FLOPs. This motivates us to replace LN with other normalization techniques, e.g., Batch Normalization~(BN), to speed up inference with the help of operator fusion methods and the avoidance of calculating the mean and variance statistics during inference. After examining several plain attempts which directly remove all LN layers or replace them with BN in the same place, we find that the divergence issue is mainly caused by the unstable layer output. We therefore propose to append a BN layer to each linear or convolution layer where stabilized training results are observed. We also propose to simplify the activations in Conformer, such as Swish and GLU, by replacing them with ReLU. All these exchanged modules can be fused into the weights of the adjacent linear/convolution layers and hence have zero inference cost. Therefore, we name it FusionFormer. Our experiments indicate that FusionFormer is as effective as the LN-based Conformer and is about 10\% faster."
BERT Meets CTC: New Formulation of End-to-End Speech Recognition with Pre-trained Masked Language Model,"This paper presents BERT-CTC, a novel formulation of end-to-end speech recognition that adapts BERT for connectionist temporal classification (CTC). Our formulation relaxes the conditional independence assumptions used in conventional CTC and incorporates linguistic knowledge through the explicit output dependency obtained by BERT contextual embedding. BERT-CTC attends to the full contexts of the input and hypothesized output sequences via the self-attention mechanism. This mechanism encourages a model to learn inner/inter-dependencies between the audio and token representations while maintaining CTC's training efficiency. During inference, BERT-CTC combines a mask-predict algorithm with CTC decoding, which iteratively refines an output sequence. The experimental results reveal that BERT-CTC improves over conventional approaches across variations in speaking styles and languages. Finally, we show that the semantic representations in BERT-CTC are beneficial towards downstream spoken language understanding tasks."
Unifying the Discrete and Continuous Emotion labels for Speech Emotion Recognition,"Traditionally, in paralinguistic analysis for emotion detection from speech, emotions have been identified with discrete or dimensional (continuous-valued) labels. Accordingly, models that have been proposed for emotion detection use one or the other of these label types. However, psychologists like Russell and Plutchik have proposed theories and models that unite these views, maintaining that these representations have shared and complementary information. This paper is an attempt to validate these viewpoints computationally. To this end, we propose a model to jointly predict continuous and discrete emotional attributes and show how the relationship between these can be utilized to improve the robustness and performance of emotion recognition tasks. Our approach comprises multi-task and hierarchical multi-task learning frameworks that jointly model the relationships between continuous-valued and discrete emotion labels. Experimental results on two widely used datasets (IEMOCAP and MSPPodcast) for speech-based emotion recognition show that our model results in statistically significant improvements in performance over strong baselines with non-unified approaches. We also demonstrate that using one type of label (discrete or continuous-valued) for training improves recognition performance in tasks that use the other type of label. Experimental results and reasoning for this approach (called the mismatched training approach) are also presented."
Filter and evolve: progressive pseudo label refining for semi-supervised automatic speech recognition,"Fine tuning self supervised pretrained models using pseudo labels can effectively improve speech recognition performance. But, low quality pseudo labels can misguide decision boundaries and degrade performance. We propose a simple yet effective strategy to filter low quality pseudo labels to alleviate this problem. Specifically, pseudo-labels are produced over the entire training set and filtered via average probability scores calculated from the model output. Subsequently, an optimal percentage of utterances with high probability scores are considered reliable training data with trustworthy labels. The model is iteratively updated to correct the unreliable pseudo labels to minimize the effect of noisy labels. The process above is repeated until unreliable pseudo abels have been adequately corrected. Extensive experiments on LibriSpeech show that these filtered samples enable the refined model to yield more correct predictions, leading to better ASR performances under various experimental settings."
Contextual-Utterance Training for Automatic Speech Recognition,"Recent studies of streaming automatic speech recognition (ASR) recurrent neural network transducer (RNN-T)-based systems have fed the encoder with past contextual information in order to improve its word error rate (WER) performance. In this paper, we first propose a contextual-utterance training technique which makes use of the previous and future contextual utterances in order to do an implicit adaptation to the speaker, topic and acoustic environment. Also, we propose a dual-mode contextual-utterance training technique for streaming automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. This proposed approach allows to make a better use of the available acoustic context in streaming models by distilling ""in-place"" the knowledge of a teacher, which is able to see both past and future contextual utterances, to the student which can only see the current and past contextual utterances. The experimental results show that a conformer-transducer system trained with the proposed techniques outperforms the same system trained with the classical RNN-T loss. Specifically, the proposed technique is able to reduce both the WER and the average last token emission latency by more than 6% and 40ms relative, respectively."
Universal speaker recognition encoders for different speech segments duration,Creating universal speaker encoders which are robust for different acoustic and speech duration conditions is a big challenge today. According to our observations systems trained on short speech segments are optimal for short phrase speaker verification and systems trained on long segments are superior for long segments verification. A system trained simultaneously on pooled short and long speech segments does not give optimal verification results and usually degrades both for short and long segments. This paper addresses the problem of creating universal speaker encoders for different speech segments duration. We describe our simple recipe for training universal speaker encoder for any type of selected neural network architecture. According to our evaluation results of wav2vec-TDNN based systems obtained for NIST SRE and VoxCeleb1 benchmarks the proposed universal encoder provides speaker verification improvements in case of different enrollment and test speech segment duration. The key feature of the proposed encoder is that it has the same inference time as the selected neural network architecture.
Random Utterance Concatenation Based Data Augmentation for Improving Short-video Speech Recognition,"One of limitations in end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) framework is its performance would be compromised if train-test utterance lengths are mismatched. In this paper, we propose an on-the-fly random utterance concatenation (RUC) based data augmentation method to alleviate train-test utterance length mismatch issue for short-video ASR task. Specifically, we are motivated by observations that our human-transcribed training utterances tend to be much shorter for short-video spontaneous speech (~3 seconds on average), while our test utterance generated from voice activity detection front-end is much longer (~10 seconds on average). Such a mismatch can lead to suboptimal performance. Empirically, it's observed the proposed RUC method significantly improves long utterance recognition without performance drop on short one. Overall, it achieves 5.72% word error rate reduction on average for 15 languages and improved robustness to various utterance length."
GM-TCNet: Gated Multi-scale Temporal Convolutional Network using Emotion Causality for Speech Emotion Recognition,"In human-computer interaction, Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) plays an essential role in understanding the user's intent and improving the interactive experience. While similar sentimental speeches own diverse speaker characteristics but share common antecedents and consequences, an essential challenge for SER is how to produce robust and discriminative representations through causality between speech emotions. In this paper, we propose a Gated Multi-scale Temporal Convolutional Network (GM-TCNet) to construct a novel emotional causality representation learning component with a multi-scale receptive field. GM-TCNet deploys a novel emotional causality representation learning component to capture the dynamics of emotion across the time domain, constructed with dilated causal convolution layer and gating mechanism. Besides, it utilizes skip connection fusing high-level features from different gated convolution blocks to capture abundant and subtle emotion changes in human speech. GM-TCNet first uses a single type of feature, mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, as inputs and then passes them through the gated temporal convolutional module to generate the high-level features. Finally, the features are fed to the emotion classifier to accomplish the SER task. The experimental results show that our model maintains the highest performance in most cases compared to state-of-the-art techniques."
Exploring Effective Distillation of Self-Supervised Speech Models for Automatic Speech Recognition,"Recent years have witnessed great strides in self-supervised learning (SSL) on the speech processing. The SSL model is normally pre-trained on a great variety of unlabelled data and a large model size is preferred to increase the modeling capacity. However, this might limit its potential applications due to the expensive computation and memory costs introduced by the oversize model. Miniaturization for SSL models has become an important research direction of practical value. To this end, we explore the effective distillation of HuBERT-based SSL models for automatic speech recognition (ASR). First, in order to establish a strong baseline, a comprehensive study on different student model structures is conducted. On top of this, as a supplement to the regression loss widely adopted in previous works, a discriminative loss is introduced for HuBERT to enhance the distillation performance, especially in low-resource scenarios. In addition, we design a simple and effective algorithm to distill the front-end input from waveform to Fbank feature, resulting in 17% parameter reduction and doubling inference speed, at marginal performance degradation."
Make More of Your Data: Minimal Effort Data Augmentation for Automatic Speech Recognition and Translation,"Data augmentation is a technique to generate new training data based on existing data. We evaluate the simple and cost-effective method of concatenating the original data examples to build new training instances. Continued training with such augmented data is able to improve off-the-shelf Transformer and Conformer models that were optimized on the original data only. We demonstrate considerable improvements on the LibriSpeech-960h test sets (WER 2.83 and 6.87 for test-clean and test-other), which carry over to models combined with shallow fusion (WER 2.55 and 6.27). Our method of continued training also leads to improvements of up to 0.9 WER on the ASR part of CoVoST-2 for four non English languages, and we observe that the gains are highly dependent on the size of the original training data. We compare different concatenation strategies and found that our method does not need speaker information to achieve its improvements. Finally, we demonstrate on two datasets that our methods also works for speech translation tasks."
Weight Averaging: A Simple Yet Effective Method to Overcome Catastrophic Forgetting in Automatic Speech Recognition,"Adapting a trained Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model to new tasks results in catastrophic forgetting of old tasks, limiting the model's ability to learn continually and to be extended to new speakers, dialects, languages, etc. Focusing on End-to-End ASR, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method to overcome catastrophic forgetting: weight averaging. By simply taking the average of the previous and the adapted model, our method achieves high performance on both the old and new tasks. It can be further improved by introducing a knowledge distillation loss during the adaptation. We illustrate the effectiveness of our method on both monolingual and multilingual ASR. In both cases, our method strongly outperforms all baselines, even in its simplest form."
Training Autoregressive Speech Recognition Models with Limited in-domain Supervision,"Advances in self-supervised learning have significantly reduced the amount of transcribed audio required for training. However, the majority of work in this area is focused on read speech. We explore limited supervision in the domain of conversational speech. While we assume the amount of in-domain data is limited, we augment the model with open source read speech data. The XLS-R model has been shown to perform well with limited adaptation data and serves as a strong baseline. We use untranscribed data for self-supervised learning and semi-supervised training in an autoregressive encoder-decoder model. We demonstrate that by using the XLS-R model for pseudotranscription, a much smaller autoregressive model can outperform a finetuned XLS-R model when transcribed in-domain data is limited, reducing WER by as much as 8% absolute."
"Four-in-One: A Joint Approach to Inverse Text Normalization, Punctuation, Capitalization, and Disfluency for Automatic Speech Recognition","Features such as punctuation, capitalization, and formatting of entities are important for readability, understanding, and natural language processing tasks. However, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems produce spoken-form text devoid of formatting, and tagging approaches to formatting address just one or two features at a time. In this paper, we unify spoken-to-written text conversion via a two-stage process: First, we use a single transformer tagging model to jointly produce token-level tags for inverse text normalization (ITN), punctuation, capitalization, and disfluencies. Then, we apply the tags to generate written-form text and use weighted finite state transducer (WFST) grammars to format tagged ITN entity spans. Despite joining four models into one, our unified tagging approach matches or outperforms task-specific models across all four tasks on benchmark test sets across several domains."
Knowledge Transfer For On-Device Speech Emotion Recognition with Neural Structured Learning,"Speech emotion recognition (SER) has been a popular research topic in human-computer interaction (HCI). As edge devices are rapidly springing up, applying SER to edge devices is promising for a huge number of HCI applications. Although deep learning has been investigated to improve the performance of SER by training complex models, the memory space and computational capability of edge devices represents a constraint for embedding deep learning models. We propose a neural structured learning (NSL) framework through building synthesized graphs. An SER model is trained on a source dataset and used to build graphs on a target dataset. A relatively lightweight model is then trained with the speech samples and graphs together as the input. Our experiments demonstrate that training a lightweight SER model on the target dataset with speech samples and graphs can not only produce small SER models, but also enhance the model performance compared to models with speech samples only and those using classic transfer learning strategies."
Monotonic segmental attention for automatic speech recognition,"We introduce a novel segmental-attention model for automatic speech recognition. We restrict the decoder attention to segments to avoid quadratic runtime of global attention, better generalize to long sequences, and eventually enable streaming. We directly compare global-attention and different segmental-attention modeling variants. We develop and compare two separate time-synchronous decoders, one specifically taking the segmental nature into account, yielding further improvements. Using time-synchronous decoding for segmental models is novel and a step towards streaming applications. Our experiments show the importance of a length model to predict the segment boundaries. The final best segmental-attention model using segmental decoding performs better than global-attention, in contrast to other monotonic attention approaches in the literature. Further, we observe that the segmental model generalizes much better to long sequences of up to several minutes."
Linguistic-Enhanced Transformer with CTC Embedding for Speech Recognition,"The recent emergence of joint CTC-Attention model shows significant improvement in automatic speech recognition (ASR). The improvement largely lies in the modeling of linguistic information by decoder. The decoder joint-optimized with an acoustic encoder renders the language model from ground-truth sequences in an auto-regressive manner during training. However, the training corpus of the decoder is limited to the speech transcriptions, which is far less than the corpus needed to train an acceptable language model. This leads to poor robustness of decoder. To alleviate this problem, we propose linguistic-enhanced transformer, which introduces refined CTC information to decoder during training process, so that the decoder can be more robust. Our experiments on AISHELL-1 speech corpus show that the character error rate (CER) is relatively reduced by up to 7%. We also find that in joint CTC-Attention ASR model, decoder is more sensitive to linguistic information than acoustic information."
Pretrained audio neural networks for Speech emotion recognition in Portuguese,"The goal of speech emotion recognition (SER) is to identify the emotional aspects of speech. The SER challenge for Brazilian Portuguese speech was proposed with short snippets of Portuguese which are classified as neutral, non-neutral female and non-neutral male according to paralinguistic elements (laughing, crying, etc). This dataset contains about 50 minutes of Brazilian Portuguese speech. As the dataset leans on the small side, we investigate whether a combination of transfer learning and data augmentation techniques can produce positive results. Thus, by combining a data augmentation technique called SpecAugment, with the use of Pretrained Audio Neural Networks (PANNs) for transfer learning we are able to obtain interesting results. The PANNs (CNN6, CNN10 and CNN14) are pretrained on a large dataset called AudioSet containing more than 5000 hours of audio. They were finetuned on the SER dataset and the best performing model (CNN10) on the validation set was submitted to the challenge, achieving an F1 score of 0.73 up from 0.54 from the baselines provided by the challenge. Moreover, we also tested the use of Transformer neural architecture, pretrained on about 600 hours of Brazilian Portuguese audio data. Transformers, as well as more complex models of PANNs (CNN14), fail to generalize to the test set in the SER dataset and do not beat the baseline. Considering the limitation of the dataset sizes, currently the best approach for SER is using PANNs (specifically, CNN6 and CNN10)."
Pronunciation Generation for Foreign Language Words in Intra-Sentential Code-Switching Speech Recognition,"Code-Switching refers to the phenomenon of switching languages within a sentence or discourse. However, limited code-switching , different language phoneme-sets and high rebuilding costs throw a challenge to make the specialized acoustic model for code-switching speech recognition. In this paper, we make use of limited code-switching data as driving materials and explore a shortcut to quickly develop intra-sentential code-switching recognition skill on the commissioned native language acoustic model, where we propose a data-driven method to make the seed lexicon which is used to train grapheme-to-phoneme model to predict mapping pronunciations for foreign language word in code-switching sentences. The core work of the data-driven technology in this paper consists of a phonetic decoding method and different selection methods. And for imbalanced word-level driving materials problem, we have an internal assistance inspiration that learning the good pronunciation rules in the words that possess sufficient materials using the grapheme-to-phoneme model to help the scarce. Our experiments show that the Mixed Error Rate in intra-sentential Chinese-English code-switching recognition reduced from 29.15\%, acquired on the pure Chinese recognizer, to 12.13\% by adding foreign language words' pronunciation through our data-driven approach, and finally get the best result 11.14\% with the combination of different selection methods and internal assistance tactic."
Fast Yet Effective Speech Emotion Recognition with Self-distillation,"Speech emotion recognition (SER) is the task of recognising human's emotional states from speech. SER is extremely prevalent in helping dialogue systems to truly understand our emotions and become a trustworthy human conversational partner. Due to the lengthy nature of speech, SER also suffers from the lack of abundant labelled data for powerful models like deep neural networks. Pre-trained complex models on large-scale speech datasets have been successfully applied to SER via transfer learning. However, fine-tuning complex models still requires large memory space and results in low inference efficiency. In this paper, we argue achieving a fast yet effective SER is possible with self-distillation, a method of simultaneously fine-tuning a pretrained model and training shallower versions of itself. The benefits of our self-distillation framework are threefold: (1) the adoption of self-distillation method upon the acoustic modality breaks through the limited ground-truth of speech data, and outperforms the existing models' performance on an SER dataset; (2) executing powerful models at different depth can achieve adaptive accuracy-efficiency trade-offs on resource-limited edge devices; (3) a new fine-tuning process rather than training from scratch for self-distillation leads to faster learning time and the state-of-the-art accuracy on data with small quantities of label information."
Reducing Language confusion for Code-switching Speech Recognition with Token-level Language Diarization,"Code-switching (CS) refers to the phenomenon that languages switch within a speech signal and leads to language confusion for automatic speech recognition (ASR). This paper aims to address language confusion for improving CS-ASR from two perspectives: incorporating and disentangling language information. We incorporate language information in the CS-ASR model by dynamically biasing the model with token-level language posteriors which are outputs of a sequence-to-sequence auxiliary language diarization module. In contrast, the disentangling process reduces the difference between languages via adversarial training so as to normalize two languages. We conduct the experiments on the SEAME dataset. Compared to the baseline model, both the joint optimization with LD and the language posterior bias achieve performance improvement. The comparison of the proposed methods indicates that incorporating language information is more effective than disentangling for reducing language confusion in CS speech."
UFO2: A unified pre-training framework for online and offline speech recognition,"In this paper, we propose a Unified pre-training Framework for Online and Offline (UFO2) Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), which 1) simplifies the two separate training workflows for online and offline modes into one process, and 2) improves the Word Error Rate (WER) performance with limited utterance annotating. Specifically, we extend the conventional offline-mode Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)-based ASR approach to a unified manner, where the model training is conditioned on both the full-context and dynamic-chunked inputs. To enhance the pre-trained representation model, stop-gradient operation is applied to decouple the online-mode objectives to the quantizer. Moreover, in both the pre-training and the downstream fine-tuning stages, joint losses are proposed to train the unified model with full-weight sharing for the two modes. Experimental results on the LibriSpeech dataset show that UFO2 outperforms the SSL-based baseline method by 29.7% and 18.2% relative WER reduction in offline and online modes, respectively."
Effect of different splitting criteria on the performance of speech emotion recognition,"Traditional speech emotion recognition (SER) evaluations have been performed merely on a speaker-independent condition; some of them even did not evaluate their result on this condition. This paper highlights the importance of splitting training and test data for SER by script, known as sentence-open or text-independent criteria. The results show that employing sentence-open criteria degraded the performance of SER. This finding implies the difficulties of recognizing emotion from speech in different linguistic information embedded in acoustic information. Surprisingly, text-independent criteria consistently performed worse than speaker+text-independent criteria. The full order of difficulties for splitting criteria on SER performances from the most difficult to the easiest is text-independent, speaker+text-independent, speaker-independent, and speaker+text-dependent. The gap between speaker+text-independent and text-independent was smaller than other criteria, strengthening the difficulties of recognizing emotion from speech in different sentences."
ESB: A Benchmark For Multi-Domain End-to-End Speech Recognition,"Speech recognition applications cover a range of different audio and text distributions, with different speaking styles, background noise, transcription punctuation and character casing. However, many speech recognition systems require dataset-specific tuning (audio filtering, punctuation removal and normalisation of casing), therefore assuming a-priori knowledge of both the audio and text distributions. This tuning requirement can lead to systems failing to generalise to other datasets and domains. To promote the development of multi-domain speech systems, we introduce the End-to-end Speech Benchmark (ESB) for evaluating the performance of a single automatic speech recognition (ASR) system across a broad set of speech datasets. Benchmarked systems must use the same data pre- and post-processing algorithm across datasets - assuming the audio and text data distributions are a-priori unknown. We compare a series of state-of-the-art (SoTA) end-to-end (E2E) systems on this benchmark, demonstrating how a single speech system can be applied and evaluated on a wide range of data distributions. We find E2E systems to be effective across datasets: in a fair comparison, E2E systems achieve within 2.6% of SoTA systems tuned to a specific dataset. Our analysis reveals that transcription artefacts, such as punctuation and casing, pose difficulties for ASR systems and should be included in evaluation. We believe E2E benchmarking over a range of datasets promotes the research of multi-domain speech recognition systems. ESB is available at https://huggingface.co/esb."
Time-Domain Speech Enhancement for Robust Automatic Speech Recognition,"It has been shown that the intelligibility of noisy speech can be improved by speech enhancement algorithms. However, speech enhancement has not been established as an effective front-end for robust automatic speech recognition (ASR) in comparison with an ASR model trained on noisy speech directly. The divide between speech enhancement and ASR impedes the progress of robust ASR systems especially as speech enhancement has made big strides in recent years. In this work, we focus on eliminating such divide with an ARN (attentive recurrent network) based time-domain enhancement model. The proposed system fully decouples speech enhancement and an acoustic model trained only on clean speech. Results on the CHiME-2 corpus show that ARN enhanced speech translates to improved ASR results. The proposed system achieves 6.28\% average word error rate, outperforming the previous best by 19.3\%."
Can Visual Context Improve Automatic Speech Recognition for an Embodied Agent?,"The usage of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems are becoming omnipresent ranging from personal assistant to chatbots, home, and industrial automation systems, etc. Modern robots are also equipped with ASR capabilities for interacting with humans as speech is the most natural interaction modality. However, ASR in robots faces additional challenges as compared to a personal assistant. Being an embodied agent, a robot must recognize the physical entities around it and therefore reliably recognize the speech containing the description of such entities. However, current ASR systems are often unable to do so due to limitations in ASR training, such as generic datasets and open-vocabulary modeling. Also, adverse conditions during inference, such as noise, accented, and far-field speech makes the transcription inaccurate. In this work, we present a method to incorporate a robot's visual information into an ASR system and improve the recognition of a spoken utterance containing a visible entity. Specifically, we propose a new decoder biasing technique to incorporate the visual context while ensuring the ASR output does not degrade for incorrect context. We achieve a 59% relative reduction in WER from an unmodified ASR system."
"Investigating self-supervised, weakly supervised and fully supervised training approaches for multi-domain automatic speech recognition: a study on Bangladeshi Bangla","Despite huge improvements in automatic speech recognition (ASR) employing neural networks, ASR systems still suffer from a lack of robustness and generalizability issues due to domain shifting. This is mainly because principal corpus design criteria are often not identified and examined adequately while compiling ASR datasets. In this study, we investigate the robustness of the state-of-the-art transfer learning approaches such as self-supervised wav2vec 2.0 and weakly supervised Whisper as well as fully supervised convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for multi-domain ASR. We also demonstrate the significance of domain selection while building a corpus by assessing these models on a novel multi-domain Bangladeshi Bangla ASR evaluation benchmark - BanSpeech, which contains approximately 6.52 hours of human-annotated speech and 8085 utterances from 13 distinct domains. SUBAK.KO, a mostly read speech corpus for the morphologically rich language Bangla, has been used to train the ASR systems. Experimental evaluation reveals that self-supervised cross-lingual pre-training is the best strategy compared to weak supervision and full supervision to tackle the multi-domain ASR task. Moreover, the ASR models trained on SUBAK.KO face difficulty recognizing speech from domains with mostly spontaneous speech. The BanSpeech will be publicly available to meet the need for a challenging evaluation benchmark for Bangla ASR."
Speech Emotion Recognition via an Attentive Time-Frequency Neural Network,"Spectrogram is commonly used as the input feature of deep neural networks to learn the high(er)-level time-frequency pattern of speech signal for speech emotion recognition (SER). \textcolor{black}{Generally, different emotions correspond to specific energy activations both within frequency bands and time frames on spectrogram, which indicates the frequency and time domains are both essential to represent the emotion for SER. However, recent spectrogram-based works mainly focus on modeling the long-term dependency in time domain, leading to these methods encountering the following two issues: (1) neglecting to model the emotion-related correlations within frequency domain during the time-frequency joint learning; (2) ignoring to capture the specific frequency bands associated with emotions.} To cope with the issues, we propose an attentive time-frequency neural network (ATFNN) for SER, including a time-frequency neural network (TFNN) and time-frequency attention. Specifically, aiming at the first issue, we design a TFNN with a frequency-domain encoder (F-Encoder) based on the Transformer encoder and a time-domain encoder (T-Encoder) based on the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM). The F-Encoder and T-Encoder model the correlations within frequency bands and time frames, respectively, and they are embedded into a time-frequency joint learning strategy to obtain the time-frequency patterns for speech emotions. Moreover, to handle the second issue, we also adopt time-frequency attention with a frequency-attention network (F-Attention) and a time-attention network (T-Attention) to focus on the emotion-related frequency band ranges and time frame ranges, which can enhance the discriminability of speech emotion features."
Guided contrastive self-supervised pre-training for automatic speech recognition,"Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) is a representation learning method that maximizes the mutual information between intermediate latent representations and the output of a given model. It can be used to effectively initialize the encoder of an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model. We present a novel modification of CPC called Guided Contrastive Predictive Coding (GCPC). Our proposed method maximizes the mutual information between representations from a prior-knowledge model and the output of the model being pre-trained, allowing prior knowledge injection during pre-training. We validate our method on 3 ASR tasks: German, French and English. Our method outperforms CPC pre-training on all three datasets, reducing the Word Error Rate (WER) by 4.44%, 6.55% and 15.43% relative on the German, French and English (Librispeech) tasks respectively, compared to training from scratch, while CPC pre-training only brings 2.96%, 1.01% and 14.39% relative WER reduction respectively."
Joint Speech Translation and Named Entity Recognition,"Modern automatic translation systems aim at place the human at the center by providing contextual support and knowledge. In this context, a critical task is enriching the output with information regarding the mentioned entities, which is currently achieved processing the generated translation with named entity recognition (NER) and entity linking systems. In light of the recent promising results shown by direct speech translation (ST) models and the known weaknesses of cascades (error propagation and additional latency), in this paper we propose multitask models that jointly perform ST and NER, and compare them with a cascade baseline. The experimental results show that our models significantly outperform the cascade on the NER task (by 0.4-1.0 F1), without degradation in terms of translation quality, and with the same computational efficiency of a plain direct ST model."
Improving Semi-supervised End-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition using CycleGAN and Inter-domain Losses,"We propose a novel method that combines CycleGAN and inter-domain losses for semi-supervised end-to-end automatic speech recognition. Inter-domain loss targets the extraction of an intermediate shared representation of speech and text inputs using a shared network. CycleGAN uses cycle-consistent loss and the identity mapping loss to preserve relevant characteristics of the input feature after converting from one domain to another. As such, both approaches are suitable to train end-to-end models on unpaired speech-text inputs. In this paper, we exploit the advantages from both inter-domain loss and CycleGAN to achieve better shared representation of unpaired speech and text inputs and thus improve the speech-to-text mapping. Our experimental results on the WSJ eval92 and Voxforge (non English) show 8~8.5% character error rate reduction over the baseline, and the results on LibriSpeech test_clean also show noticeable improvement."
Anchored Speech Recognition with Neural Transducers,"Neural transducers have achieved human level performance on standard speech recognition benchmarks. However, their performance significantly degrades in the presence of cross-talk, especially when the primary speaker has a low signal-to-noise ratio. Anchored speech recognition refers to a class of methods that use information from an anchor segment (e.g., wake-words) to recognize device-directed speech while ignoring interfering background speech. In this paper, we investigate anchored speech recognition to make neural transducers robust to background speech. We extract context information from the anchor segment with a tiny auxiliary network, and use encoder biasing and joiner gating to guide the transducer towards the target speech. Moreover, to improve the robustness of context embedding extraction, we propose auxiliary training objectives to disentangle lexical content from speaking style. We evaluate our methods on synthetic LibriSpeech-based mixtures comprising several SNR and overlap conditions; they improve relative word error rates by 19.6% over a strong baseline, when averaged over all conditions."
"End-to-End Integration of Speech Recognition, Dereverberation, Beamforming, and Self-Supervised Learning Representation","Self-supervised learning representation (SSLR) has demonstrated its significant effectiveness in automatic speech recognition (ASR), mainly with clean speech. Recent work pointed out the strength of integrating SSLR with single-channel speech enhancement for ASR in noisy environments. This paper further advances this integration by dealing with multi-channel input. We propose a novel end-to-end architecture by integrating dereverberation, beamforming, SSLR, and ASR within a single neural network. Our system achieves the best performance reported in the literature on the CHiME-4 6-channel track with a word error rate (WER) of 1.77%. While the WavLM-based strong SSLR demonstrates promising results by itself, the end-to-end integration with the weighted power minimization distortionless response beamformer, which simultaneously performs dereverberation and denoising, improves WER significantly. Its effectiveness is also validated on the REVERB dataset."
HMM vs. CTC for Automatic Speech Recognition: Comparison Based on Full-Sum Training from Scratch,"In this work, we compare from-scratch sequence-level cross-entropy (full-sum) training of Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) topologies for automatic speech recognition (ASR). Besides accuracy, we further analyze their capability for generating high-quality time alignment between the speech signal and the transcription, which can be crucial for many subsequent applications. Moreover, we propose several methods to improve convergence of from-scratch full-sum training by addressing the alignment modeling issue. Systematic comparison is conducted on both Switchboard and LibriSpeech corpora across CTC, posterior HMM with and w/o transition probabilities, and standard hybrid HMM. We also provide a detailed analysis of both Viterbi forced-alignment and Baum-Welch full-sum occupation probabilities."
Towards Personalization of CTC Speech Recognition Models with Contextual Adapters and Adaptive Boosting,"End-to-end speech recognition models trained using joint Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)-Attention loss have gained popularity recently. In these models, a non-autoregressive CTC decoder is often used at inference time due to its speed and simplicity. However, such models are hard to personalize because of their conditional independence assumption that prevents output tokens from previous time steps to influence future predictions. To tackle this, we propose a novel two-way approach that first biases the encoder with attention over a predefined list of rare long-tail and out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words and then uses dynamic boosting and phone alignment network during decoding to further bias the subword predictions. We evaluate our approach on open-source VoxPopuli and in-house medical datasets to showcase a 60% improvement in F1 score on domain-specific rare words over a strong CTC baseline."
Sub-8-bit quantization for on-device speech recognition: a regularization-free approach,"For on-device automatic speech recognition (ASR), quantization aware training (QAT) is ubiquitous to achieve the trade-off between model predictive performance and efficiency. Among existing QAT methods, one major drawback is that the quantization centroids have to be predetermined and fixed. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a regularization-free, ""soft-to-hard"" compression mechanism with self-adjustable centroids in a mu-Law constrained space, resulting in a simpler yet more versatile quantization scheme, called General Quantizer (GQ). We apply GQ to ASR tasks using Recurrent Neural Network Transducer (RNN-T) and Conformer architectures on both LibriSpeech and de-identified far-field datasets. Without accuracy degradation, GQ can compress both RNN-T and Conformer into sub-8-bit, and for some RNN-T layers, to 1-bit for fast and accurate inference. We observe a 30.73% memory footprint saving and 31.75% user-perceived latency reduction compared to 8-bit QAT via physical device benchmarking."
Language-agnostic Code-Switching in End-To-End Speech Recognition,"Code-Switching (CS) is referred to the phenomenon of alternately using words and phrases from different languages. While today's neural end-to-end (E2E) models deliver state-of-the-art performances on the task of automatic speech recognition (ASR) it is commonly known that these systems are very data-intensive. However, there is only a few transcribed and aligned CS speech available. To overcome this problem and train multilingual systems which can transcribe CS speech, we propose a simple yet effective data augmentation in which audio and corresponding labels of different source languages are concatenated. By using this training data, our E2E model improves on transcribing CS speech and improves performance over the multilingual model, as well. The results show that this augmentation technique can even improve the model's performance on inter-sentential language switches not seen during training by 5,03\% WER."
Bringing NURC/SP to Digital Life: the Role of Open-source Automatic Speech Recognition Models,"The NURC Project that started in 1969 to study the cultured linguistic urban norm spoken in five Brazilian capitals, was responsible for compiling a large corpus for each capital. The digitized NURC/SP comprises 375 inquiries in 334 hours of recordings taken in São Paulo capital. Although 47 inquiries have transcripts, there was no alignment between the audio-transcription, and 328 inquiries were not transcribed. This article presents an evaluation and error analysis of three automatic speech recognition models trained with spontaneous speech in Portuguese and one model trained with prepared speech. The evaluation allowed us to choose the best model, using WER and CER metrics, in a manually aligned sample of NURC/SP, to automatically transcribe 284 hours."
Learning to Jointly Transcribe and Subtitle for End-to-End Spontaneous Speech Recognition,"TV subtitles are a rich source of transcriptions of many types of speech, ranging from read speech in news reports to conversational and spontaneous speech in talk shows and soaps. However, subtitles are not verbatim (i.e. exact) transcriptions of speech, so they cannot be used directly to improve an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model. We propose a multitask dual-decoder Transformer model that jointly performs ASR and automatic subtitling. The ASR decoder (possibly pre-trained) predicts the verbatim output and the subtitle decoder generates a subtitle, while sharing the encoder. The two decoders can be independent or connected. The model is trained to perform both tasks jointly, and is able to effectively use subtitle data. We show improvements on regular ASR and on spontaneous and conversational ASR by incorporating the additional subtitle decoder. The method does not require preprocessing (aligning, filtering, pseudo-labeling, ...) of the subtitles."
LeVoice ASR Systems for the ISCSLP 2022 Intelligent Cockpit Speech Recognition Challenge,"This paper describes LeVoice automatic speech recognition systems to track2 of intelligent cockpit speech recognition challenge 2022. Track2 is a speech recognition task without limits on the scope of model size. Our main points include deep learning based speech enhancement, text-to-speech based speech generation, training data augmentation via various techniques and speech recognition model fusion. We compared and fused the hybrid architecture and two kinds of end-to-end architecture. For end-to-end modeling, we used models based on connectionist temporal classification/attention-based encoder-decoder architecture and recurrent neural network transducer/attention-based encoder-decoder architecture. The performance of these models is evaluated with an additional language model to improve word error rates. As a result, our system achieved 10.2\% character error rate on the challenge test set data and ranked third place among the submitted systems in the challenge."
Multilingual Zero Resource Speech Recognition Base on Self-Supervise Pre-Trained Acoustic Models,"Labeled audio data is insufficient to build satisfying speech recognition systems for most of the languages in the world. There have been some zero-resource methods trying to perform phoneme or word-level speech recognition without labeled audio data of the target language, but the error rate of these methods is usually too high to be applied in real-world scenarios. Recently, the representation ability of self-supervise pre-trained models has been found to be extremely beneficial in zero-resource phoneme recognition. As far as we are concerned, this paper is the first attempt to extend the use of pre-trained models into word-level zero-resource speech recognition. This is done by fine-tuning the pre-trained models on IPA phoneme transcriptions and decoding with a language model trained on extra texts. Experiments on Wav2vec 2.0 and HuBERT models show that this method can achieve less than 20% word error rate on some languages, and the average error rate on 8 languages is 33.77%."
Inner speech recognition through electroencephalographic signals,"This work focuses on inner speech recognition starting from EEG signals. Inner speech recognition is defined as the internalized process in which the person thinks in pure meanings, generally associated with an auditory imagery of own inner ""voice"". The decoding of the EEG into text should be understood as the classification of a limited number of words (commands) or the presence of phonemes (units of sound that make up words). Speech-related BCIs provide effective vocal communication strategies for controlling devices through speech commands interpreted from brain signals, improving the quality of life of people who have lost the capability to speak, by restoring communication with their environment. Two public inner speech datasets are analysed. Using this data, some classification models are studied and implemented starting from basic methods such as Support Vector Machines, to ensemble methods such as the eXtreme Gradient Boosting classifier up to the use of neural networks such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (BiLSTM). With the LSTM and BiLSTM models, generally not used in the literature of inner speech recognition, results in line with or superior to those present in the stateof-the-art are obtained."
An Ensemble Teacher-Student Learning Approach with Poisson Sub-sampling to Differential Privacy Preserving Speech Recognition,"We propose an ensemble learning framework with Poisson sub-sampling to effectively train a collection of teacher models to issue some differential privacy (DP) guarantee for training data. Through boosting under DP, a student model derived from the training data suffers little model degradation from the models trained with no privacy protection. Our proposed solution leverages upon two mechanisms, namely: (i) a privacy budget amplification via Poisson sub-sampling to train a target prediction model that requires less noise to achieve a same level of privacy budget, and (ii) a combination of the sub-sampling technique and an ensemble teacher-student learning framework that introduces DP-preserving noise at the output of the teacher models and transfers DP-preserving properties via noisy labels. Privacy-preserving student models are then trained with the noisy labels to learn the knowledge with DP-protection from the teacher model ensemble. Experimental evidences on spoken command recognition and continuous speech recognition of Mandarin speech show that our proposed framework greatly outperforms existing DP-preserving algorithms in both speech processing tasks."
Automatic Speech Recognition of Low-Resource Languages Based on Chukchi,"The following paper presents a project focused on the research and creation of a new Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) based in the Chukchi language. There is no one complete corpus of the Chukchi language, so most of the work consisted in collecting audio and texts in the Chukchi language from open sources and processing them. We managed to collect 21:34:23 hours of audio recordings and 112,719 sentences (or 2,068,273 words) of text in the Chukchi language. The XLSR model was trained on the obtained data, which showed good results even with a small amount of data. Besides the fact that the Chukchi language is a low-resource language, it is also polysynthetic, which significantly complicates any automatic processing. Thus, the usual WER metric for evaluating ASR becomes less indicative for a polysynthetic language. However, the CER metric showed good results. The question of metrics for polysynthetic languages remains open."
An Experimental Study on Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensemble Learning for End-to-End Speech Recognition,"Differential privacy (DP) is one data protection avenue to safeguard user information used for training deep models by imposing noisy distortion on privacy data. Such a noise perturbation often results in a severe performance degradation in automatic speech recognition (ASR) in order to meet a privacy budget \varepsilon. Private aggregation of teacher ensemble (PATE) utilizes ensemble probabilities to improve ASR accuracy when dealing with the noise effects controlled by small values of \varepsilon. We extend PATE learning to work with dynamic patterns, namely speech utterances, and perform a first experimental demonstration that it prevents acoustic data leakage in ASR training. We evaluate three end-to-end deep models, including LAS, hybrid CTC/attention, and RNN transducer, on the open-source LibriSpeech and TIMIT corpora. PATE learning-enhanced ASR models outperform the benchmark DP-SGD mechanisms, especially under strict DP budgets, giving relative word error rate reductions between 26.2% and 27.5% for an RNN transducer model evaluated with LibriSpeech. We also introduce a DP-preserving ASR solution for pretraining on public speech corpora."
Cloud-based Automatic Speech Recognition Systems for Southeast Asian Languages,"This paper provides an overall introduction of our Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems for Southeast Asian languages. As not much existing work has been carried out on such regional languages, a few difficulties should be addressed before building the systems: limitation on speech and text resources, lack of linguistic knowledge, etc. This work takes Bahasa Indonesia and Thai as examples to illustrate the strategies of collecting various resources required for building ASR systems."
Damage Control During Domain Adaptation for Transducer Based Automatic Speech Recognition,"Automatic speech recognition models are often adapted to improve their accuracy in a new domain. A potential drawback of model adaptation to new domains is catastrophic forgetting, where the Word Error Rate on the original domain is significantly degraded. This paper addresses the situation when we want to simultaneously adapt automatic speech recognition models to a new domain and limit the degradation of accuracy on the original domain without access to the original training dataset. We propose several techniques such as a limited training strategy and regularized adapter modules for the Transducer encoder, prediction, and joiner network. We apply these methods to the Google Speech Commands and to the UK and Ireland English Dialect speech data set and obtain strong results on the new target domain while limiting the degradation on the original domain."
Multi-stage Progressive Compression of Conformer Transducer for On-device Speech Recognition,"The smaller memory bandwidth in smart devices prompts development of smaller Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models. To obtain a smaller model, one can employ the model compression techniques. Knowledge distillation (KD) is a popular model compression approach that has shown to achieve smaller model size with relatively lesser degradation in the model performance. In this approach, knowledge is distilled from a trained large size teacher model to a smaller size student model. Also, the transducer based models have recently shown to perform well for on-device streaming ASR task, while the conformer models are efficient in handling long term dependencies. Hence in this work we employ a streaming transducer architecture with conformer as the encoder. We propose a multi-stage progressive approach to compress the conformer transducer model using KD. We progressively update our teacher model with the distilled student model in a multi-stage setup. On standard LibriSpeech dataset, our experimental results have successfully achieved compression rates greater than 60% without significant degradation in the performance compared to the larger teacher model."
Blind Signal Dereverberation for Machine Speech Recognition,"We present a method to remove unknown convolutive noise introduced to speech by reverberations of recording environments, utilizing some amount of training speech data from the reverberant environment, and any available non-reverberant speech data. Using Fourier transform computed over long temporal windows, which ideally cover the entire room impulse response, we convert room induced convolution to additions in the log spectral domain. Next, we compute a spectral normalization vector from statistics gathered over reverberated as well as over clean speech in the log spectral domain. During operation, this normalization vectors are used to alleviate reverberations from complex speech spectra recorded under the same reverberant conditions . Such dereverberated complex speech spectra are used to compute complex FDLP-spectrograms for use in automatic speech recognition."
E-Branchformer: Branchformer with Enhanced merging for speech recognition,"Conformer, combining convolution and self-attention sequentially to capture both local and global information, has shown remarkable performance and is currently regarded as the state-of-the-art for automatic speech recognition (ASR). Several other studies have explored integrating convolution and self-attention but they have not managed to match Conformer's performance. The recently introduced Branchformer achieves comparable performance to Conformer by using dedicated branches of convolution and self-attention and merging local and global context from each branch. In this paper, we propose E-Branchformer, which enhances Branchformer by applying an effective merging method and stacking additional point-wise modules. E-Branchformer sets new state-of-the-art word error rates (WERs) 1.81% and 3.65% on LibriSpeech test-clean and test-other sets without using any external training data."
End-to-End Label Uncertainty Modeling in Speech Emotion Recognition using Bayesian Neural Networks and Label Distribution Learning,"To train machine learning algorithms to predict emotional expressions in terms of arousal and valence, annotated datasets are needed. However, as different people perceive others' emotional expressions differently, their annotations are per se subjective. For this, annotations are typically collected from multiple annotators and averaged to obtain ground-truth labels. However, when exclusively trained on this averaged ground-truth, the trained network is agnostic to the inherent subjectivity in emotional expressions. In this work, we therefore propose an end-to-end Bayesian neural network capable of being trained on a distribution of labels to also capture the subjectivity-based label uncertainty. Instead of a Gaussian, we model the label distribution using Student's t-distribution, which also accounts for the number of annotations. We derive the corresponding Kullback-Leibler divergence loss and use it to train an estimator for the distribution of labels, from which the mean and uncertainty can be inferred. We validate the proposed method using two in-the-wild datasets. We show that the proposed t-distribution based approach achieves state-of-the-art uncertainty modeling results in speech emotion recognition, and also consistent results in cross-corpora evaluations. Furthermore, analyses reveal that the advantage of a t-distribution over a Gaussian grows with increasing inter-annotator correlation and a decreasing number of annotators."
Adaptive Sparse and Monotonic Attention for Transformer-based Automatic Speech Recognition,"The Transformer architecture model, based on self-attention and multi-head attention, has achieved remarkable success in offline end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). However, self-attention and multi-head attention cannot be easily applied for streaming or online ASR. For self-attention in Transformer ASR, the softmax normalization function-based attention mechanism makes it impossible to highlight important speech information. For multi-head attention in Transformer ASR, it is not easy to model monotonic alignments in different heads. To overcome these two limits, we integrate sparse attention and monotonic attention into Transformer-based ASR. The sparse mechanism introduces a learned sparsity scheme to enable each self-attention structure to fit the corresponding head better. The monotonic attention deploys regularization to prune redundant heads for the multi-head attention structure. The experiments show that our method can effectively improve the attention mechanism on widely used benchmarks of speech recognition."
ConvRNN-T: Convolutional Augmented Recurrent Neural Network Transducers for Streaming Speech Recognition,"The recurrent neural network transducer (RNN-T) is a prominent streaming end-to-end (E2E) ASR technology. In RNN-T, the acoustic encoder commonly consists of stacks of LSTMs. Very recently, as an alternative to LSTM layers, the Conformer architecture was introduced where the encoder of RNN-T is replaced with a modified Transformer encoder composed of convolutional layers at the frontend and between attention layers. In this paper, we introduce a new streaming ASR model, Convolutional Augmented Recurrent Neural Network Transducers (ConvRNN-T) in which we augment the LSTM-based RNN-T with a novel convolutional frontend consisting of local and global context CNN encoders. ConvRNN-T takes advantage of causal 1-D convolutional layers, squeeze-and-excitation, dilation, and residual blocks to provide both global and local audio context representation to LSTM layers. We show ConvRNN-T outperforms RNN-T, Conformer, and ContextNet on Librispeech and in-house data. In addition, ConvRNN-T offers less computational complexity compared to Conformer. ConvRNN-T's superior accuracy along with its low footprint make it a promising candidate for on-device streaming ASR technologies."
"Watch What You Pretrain For: Targeted, Transferable Adversarial Examples on Self-Supervised Speech Recognition models","A targeted adversarial attack produces audio samples that can force an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system to output attacker-chosen text. To exploit ASR models in real-world, black-box settings, an adversary can leverage the transferability property, i.e. that an adversarial sample produced for a proxy ASR can also fool a different remote ASR. However recent work has shown that transferability against large ASR models is very difficult. In this work, we show that modern ASR architectures, specifically ones based on Self-Supervised Learning, are in fact vulnerable to transferability. We successfully demonstrate this phenomenon by evaluating state-of-the-art self-supervised ASR models like Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, Data2Vec and WavLM. We show that with low-level additive noise achieving a 30dB Signal-Noise Ratio, we can achieve target transferability with up to 80% accuracy. Next, we 1) use an ablation study to show that Self-Supervised learning is the main cause of that phenomenon, and 2) we provide an explanation for this phenomenon. Through this we show that modern ASR architectures are uniquely vulnerable to adversarial security threats."
On the Impact of Speech Recognition Errors in Passage Retrieval for Spoken Question Answering,"Interacting with a speech interface to query a Question Answering (QA) system is becoming increasingly popular. Typically, QA systems rely on passage retrieval to select candidate contexts and reading comprehension to extract the final answer. While there has been some attention to improving the reading comprehension part of QA systems against errors that automatic speech recognition (ASR) models introduce, the passage retrieval part remains unexplored. However, such errors can affect the performance of passage retrieval, leading to inferior end-to-end performance. To address this gap, we augment two existing large-scale passage ranking and open domain QA datasets with synthetic ASR noise and study the robustness of lexical and dense retrievers against questions with ASR noise. Furthermore, we study the generalizability of data augmentation techniques across different domains; with each domain being a different language dialect or accent. Finally, we create a new dataset with questions voiced by human users and use their transcriptions to show that the retrieval performance can further degrade when dealing with natural ASR noise instead of synthetic ASR noise."
Bangla-Wave: Improving Bangla Automatic Speech Recognition Utilizing N-gram Language Models,"Although over 300M around the world speak Bangla, scant work has been done in improving Bangla voice-to-text transcription due to Bangla being a low-resource language. However, with the introduction of the Bengali Common Voice 9.0 speech dataset, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models can now be significantly improved. With 399hrs of speech recordings, Bengali Common Voice is the largest and most diversified open-source Bengali speech corpus in the world. In this paper, we outperform the SOTA pretrained Bengali ASR models by finetuning a pretrained wav2vec2 model on the common voice dataset. We also demonstrate how to significantly improve the performance of an ASR model by adding an n-gram language model as a post-processor. Finally, we do some experiments and hyperparameter tuning to generate a robust Bangla ASR model that is better than the existing ASR models."
Unsupervised domain adaptation for speech recognition with unsupervised error correction,"The transcription quality of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems degrades significantly when transcribing audios coming from unseen domains. We propose an unsupervised error correction method for unsupervised ASR domain adaption, aiming to recover transcription errors caused by domain mismatch. Unlike existing correction methods that rely on transcribed audios for training, our approach requires only unlabeled data of the target domains in which a pseudo-labeling technique is applied to generate correction training samples. To reduce over-fitting to the pseudo data, we also propose an encoder-decoder correction model that can take into account additional information such as dialogue context and acoustic features. Experiment results show that our method obtains a significant word error rate (WER) reduction over non-adapted ASR systems. The correction model can also be applied on top of other adaptation approaches to bring an additional improvement of 10% relatively."
Parameter-Efficient Conformers via Sharing Sparsely-Gated Experts for End-to-End Speech Recognition,"While transformers and their variant conformers show promising performance in speech recognition, the parameterized property leads to much memory cost during training and inference. Some works use cross-layer weight-sharing to reduce the parameters of the model. However, the inevitable loss of capacity harms the model performance. To address this issue, this paper proposes a parameter-efficient conformer via sharing sparsely-gated experts. Specifically, we use sparsely-gated mixture-of-experts (MoE) to extend the capacity of a conformer block without increasing computation. Then, the parameters of the grouped conformer blocks are shared so that the number of parameters is reduced. Next, to ensure the shared blocks with the flexibility of adapting representations at different levels, we design the MoE routers and normalization individually. Moreover, we use knowledge distillation to further improve the performance. Experimental results show that the proposed model achieves competitive performance with 1/3 of the parameters of the encoder, compared with the full-parameter model."
An Automatic Speech Recognition System for Bengali Language based on Wav2Vec2 and Transfer Learning,"An independent, automated method of decoding and transcribing oral speech is known as automatic speech recognition (ASR). A typical ASR system extracts feature from audio recordings or streams and run one or more algorithms to map the features to corresponding texts. Numerous of research has been done in the field of speech signal processing in recent years. When given adequate resources, both conventional ASR and emerging end-to-end (E2E) speech recognition have produced promising results. However, for low-resource languages like Bengali, the current state of ASR lags behind, although the low resource state does not reflect upon the fact that this language is spoken by over 500 million people all over the world. Despite its popularity, there aren't many diverse open-source datasets available, which makes it difficult to conduct research on Bengali speech recognition systems. This paper is a part of the competition named `BUET CSE Fest DL Sprint'. The purpose of this paper is to improve the speech recognition performance of the Bengali language by adopting speech recognition technology on the E2E structure based on the transfer learning framework. The proposed method effectively models the Bengali language and achieves 3.819 score in `Levenshtein Mean Distance' on the test dataset of 7747 samples, when only 1000 samples of train dataset were used to train."
Applying wav2vec2 for Speech Recognition on Bengali Common Voices Dataset,"Speech is inherently continuous, where discrete words, phonemes and other units are not clearly segmented, and so speech recognition has been an active research problem for decades. In this work we have fine-tuned wav2vec 2.0 to recognize and transcribe Bengali speech -- training it on the Bengali Common Voice Speech Dataset. After training for 71 epochs, on a training set consisting of 36919 mp3 files, we achieved a training loss of 0.3172 and WER of 0.2524 on a validation set of size 7,747. Using a 5-gram language model, the Levenshtein Distance was 2.6446 on a test set of size 7,747. Then the training set and validation set were combined, shuffled and split into 85-15 ratio. Training for 7 more epochs on this combined dataset yielded an improved Levenshtein Distance of 2.60753 on the test set. Our model was the best performing one, achieving a Levenshtein Distance of 6.234 on a hidden dataset, which was 1.1049 units lower than other competing submissions."
Analysis of Self-Attention Head Diversity for Conformer-based Automatic Speech Recognition,"Attention layers are an integral part of modern end-to-end automatic speech recognition systems, for instance as part of the Transformer or Conformer architecture. Attention is typically multi-headed, where each head has an independent set of learned parameters and operates on the same input feature sequence. The output of multi-headed attention is a fusion of the outputs from the individual heads. We empirically analyze the diversity between representations produced by the different attention heads and demonstrate that the heads become highly correlated during the course of training. We investigate a few approaches to increasing attention head diversity, including using different attention mechanisms for each head and auxiliary training loss functions to promote head diversity. We show that introducing diversity-promoting auxiliary loss functions during training is a more effective approach, and obtain WER improvements of up to 6% relative on the Librispeech corpus. Finally, we draw a connection between the diversity of attention heads and the similarity of the gradients of head parameters."
Streaming End-to-End Multilingual Speech Recognition with Joint Language Identification,"Language identification is critical for many downstream tasks in automatic speech recognition (ASR), and is beneficial to integrate into multilingual end-to-end ASR as an additional task. In this paper, we propose to modify the structure of the cascaded-encoder-based recurrent neural network transducer (RNN-T) model by integrating a per-frame language identifier (LID) predictor. RNN-T with cascaded encoders can achieve streaming ASR with low latency using first-pass decoding with no right-context, and achieve lower word error rates (WERs) using second-pass decoding with longer right-context. By leveraging such differences in the right-contexts and a streaming implementation of statistics pooling, the proposed method can achieve accurate streaming LID prediction with little extra test-time cost. Experimental results on a voice search dataset with 9 language locales shows that the proposed method achieves an average of 96.2% LID prediction accuracy and the same second-pass WER as that obtained by including oracle LID in the input."
VarArray Meets t-SOT: Advancing the State of the Art of Streaming Distant Conversational Speech Recognition,"This paper presents a novel streaming automatic speech recognition (ASR) framework for multi-talker overlapping speech captured by a distant microphone array with an arbitrary geometry. Our framework, named t-SOT-VA, capitalizes on independently developed two recent technologies; array-geometry-agnostic continuous speech separation, or VarArray, and streaming multi-talker ASR based on token-level serialized output training (t-SOT). To combine the best of both technologies, we newly design a t-SOT-based ASR model that generates a serialized multi-talker transcription based on two separated speech signals from VarArray. We also propose a pre-training scheme for such an ASR model where we simulate VarArray's output signals based on monaural single-talker ASR training data. Conversation transcription experiments using the AMI meeting corpus show that the system based on the proposed framework significantly outperforms conventional ones. Our system achieves the state-of-the-art word error rates of 13.7% and 15.5% for the AMI development and evaluation sets, respectively, in the multiple-distant-microphone setting while retaining the streaming inference capability."
Multilingual Transformer Language Model for Speech Recognition in Low-resource Languages,"It is challenging to train and deploy Transformer LMs for hybrid speech recognition 2nd pass re-ranking in low-resource languages due to (1) data scarcity in low-resource languages, (2) expensive computing costs for training and refreshing 100+ monolingual models, and (3) hosting inefficiency considering sparse traffic. In this study, we present a new way to group multiple low-resource locales together and optimize the performance of Multilingual Transformer LMs in ASR. Our Locale-group Multilingual Transformer LMs outperform traditional multilingual LMs along with reducing maintenance costs and operating expenses. Further, for low-resource but high-traffic locales where deploying monolingual models is feasible, we show that fine-tuning our locale-group multilingual LMs produces better monolingual LM candidates than baseline monolingual LMs."
ASR2K: Speech Recognition for Around 2000 Languages without Audio,"Most recent speech recognition models rely on large supervised datasets, which are unavailable for many low-resource languages. In this work, we present a speech recognition pipeline that does not require any audio for the target language. The only assumption is that we have access to raw text datasets or a set of n-gram statistics. Our speech pipeline consists of three components: acoustic, pronunciation, and language models. Unlike the standard pipeline, our acoustic and pronunciation models use multilingual models without any supervision. The language model is built using n-gram statistics or the raw text dataset. We build speech recognition for 1909 languages by combining it with Crubadan: a large endangered languages n-gram database. Furthermore, we test our approach on 129 languages across two datasets: Common Voice and CMU Wilderness dataset. We achieve 50% CER and 74% WER on the Wilderness dataset with Crubadan statistics only and improve them to 45% CER and 69% WER when using 10000 raw text utterances."
Predict-and-Update Network: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition Inspired by Human Speech Perception,"Audio and visual signals complement each other in human speech perception, so do they in speech recognition. The visual hint is less evident than the acoustic hint, but more robust in a complex acoustic environment, as far as speech perception is concerned. It remains a challenge how we effectively exploit the interaction between audio and visual signals for automatic speech recognition. There have been studies to exploit visual signals as redundant or complementary information to audio input in a synchronous manner. Human studies suggest that visual signal primes the listener in advance as to when and on which frequency to attend to. We propose a Predict-and-Update Network (P&U net), to simulate such a visual cueing mechanism for Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR). In particular, we first predict the character posteriors of the spoken words, i.e. the visual embedding, based on the visual signals. The audio signal is then conditioned on the visual embedding via a novel cross-modal Conformer, that updates the character posteriors. We validate the effectiveness of the visual cueing mechanism through extensive experiments. The proposed P&U net outperforms the state-of-the-art AVSR methods on both LRS2-BBC and LRS3-BBC datasets, with the relative reduced Word Error Rate (WER)s exceeding 10% and 40% under clean and noisy conditions, respectively."
Attention Enhanced Citrinet for Speech Recognition,"Citrinet is an end-to-end convolutional Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) based automatic speech recognition (ASR) model. To capture local and global contextual information, 1D time-channel separable convolutions combined with sub-word encoding and squeeze-and-excitation (SE) are used in Citrinet, making the whole architecture to be as deep as including 23 blocks with 235 convolution layers and 46 linear layers. This pure convolutional and deep architecture makes Critrinet relatively slow at convergence. In this paper, we propose to introduce multi-head attentions together with feed-forward networks in the convolution module in Citrinet blocks while keeping the SE module and residual module unchanged. For speeding up, we remove 8 convolution layers in each attention-enhanced Citrinet block and reduce 23 blocks to 13. Experiments on the Japanese CSJ-500h and Magic-1600h dataset show that the attention-enhanced Citrinet with less layers and blocks and converges faster with lower character error rates than (1) Citrinet with 80\% training time and (2) Conformer with 40\% training time and 29.8\% model size."
Deep Sparse Conformer for Speech Recognition,"Conformer has achieved impressive results in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) by leveraging transformer's capturing of content-based global interactions and convolutional neural network's exploiting of local features. In Conformer, two macaron-like feed-forward layers with half-step residual connections sandwich the multi-head self-attention and convolution modules followed by a post layer normalization. We improve Conformer's long-sequence representation ability in two directions, \emph{sparser} and \emph{deeper}. We adapt a sparse self-attention mechanism with \mathcal{O}(L\text{log}L) in time complexity and memory usage. A deep normalization strategy is utilized when performing residual connections to ensure our training of hundred-level Conformer blocks. On the Japanese CSJ-500h dataset, this deep sparse Conformer achieves respectively CERs of 5.52\%, 4.03\% and 4.50\% on the three evaluation sets and 4.16\%, 2.84\% and 3.20\% when ensembling five deep sparse Conformer variants from 12 to 16, 17, 50, and finally 100 encoder layers."
Bayesian Neural Network Language Modeling for Speech Recognition,"State-of-the-art neural network language models (NNLMs) represented by long short term memory recurrent neural networks (LSTM-RNNs) and Transformers are becoming highly complex. They are prone to overfitting and poor generalization when given limited training data. To this end, an overarching full Bayesian learning framework encompassing three methods is proposed in this paper to account for the underlying uncertainty in LSTM-RNN and Transformer LMs. The uncertainty over their model parameters, choice of neural activations and hidden output representations are modeled using Bayesian, Gaussian Process and variational LSTM-RNN or Transformer LMs respectively. Efficient inference approaches were used to automatically select the optimal network internal components to be Bayesian learned using neural architecture search. A minimal number of Monte Carlo parameter samples as low as one was also used. These allow the computational costs incurred in Bayesian NNLM training and evaluation to be minimized. Experiments are conducted on two tasks: AMI meeting transcription and Oxford-BBC LipReading Sentences 2 (LRS2) overlapped speech recognition using state-of-the-art LF-MMI trained factored TDNN systems featuring data augmentation, speaker adaptation and audio-visual multi-channel beamforming for overlapped speech. Consistent performance improvements over the baseline LSTM-RNN and Transformer LMs with point estimated model parameters and drop-out regularization were obtained across both tasks in terms of perplexity and word error rate (WER). In particular, on the LRS2 data, statistically significant WER reductions up to 1.3% and 1.2% absolute (12.1% and 11.3% relative) were obtained over the baseline LSTM-RNN and Transformer LMs respectively after model combination between Bayesian NNLMs and their respective baselines."
Speech Emotion Recognition using Supervised Deep Recurrent System for Mental Health Monitoring,"Understanding human behavior and monitoring mental health are essential to maintaining the community and society's safety. As there has been an increase in mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic due to uncontrolled mental health, early detection of mental issues is crucial. Nowadays, the usage of Intelligent Virtual Personal Assistants (IVA) has increased worldwide. Individuals use their voices to control these devices to fulfill requests and acquire different services. This paper proposes a novel deep learning model based on the gated recurrent neural network and convolution neural network to understand human emotion from speech to improve their IVA services and monitor their mental health."
Spatio-Temporal Representation Learning Enhanced Source Cell-phone Recognition from Speech Recordings,"The existing source cell-phone recognition method lacks the long-term feature characterization of the source device, resulting in inaccurate representation of the source cell-phone related features which leads to insufficient recognition accuracy. In this paper, we propose a source cell-phone recognition method based on spatio-temporal representation learning, which includes two main parts: extraction of sequential Gaussian mean matrix features and construction of a recognition model based on spatio-temporal representation learning. In the feature extraction part, based on the analysis of time-series representation of recording source signals, we extract sequential Gaussian mean matrix with long-term and short-term representation ability by using the sensitivity of Gaussian mixture model to data distribution. In the model construction part, we design a structured spatio-temporal representation learning network C3D-BiLSTM to fully characterize the spatio-temporal information, combine 3D convolutional network and bidirectional long short-term memory network for short-term spectral information and long-time fluctuation information representation learning, and achieve accurate recognition of cell-phones by fusing spatio-temporal feature information of recording source signals. The method achieves an average accuracy of 99.03% for the closed-set recognition of 45 cell-phones under the CCNU\_Mobile dataset, and 98.18% in small sample size experiments, with recognition performance better than the existing state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results show that the method exhibits excellent recognition performance in multi-class cell-phones recognition."
Interpretable Multimodal Emotion Recognition using Hybrid Fusion of Speech and Image Data,"This paper proposes a multimodal emotion recognition system based on hybrid fusion that classifies the emotions depicted by speech utterances and corresponding images into discrete classes. A new interpretability technique has been developed to identify the important speech & image features leading to the prediction of particular emotion classes. The proposed system's architecture has been determined through intensive ablation studies. It fuses the speech & image features and then combines speech, image, and intermediate fusion outputs. The proposed interpretability technique incorporates the divide & conquer approach to compute shapely values denoting each speech & image feature's importance. We have also constructed a large-scale dataset (IIT-R SIER dataset), consisting of speech utterances, corresponding images, and class labels, i.e., 'anger,' 'happy,' 'hate,' and 'sad.' The proposed system has achieved 83.29% accuracy for emotion recognition. The enhanced performance of the proposed system advocates the importance of utilizing complementary information from multiple modalities for emotion recognition."
Low-Level Physiological Implications of End-to-End Learning of Speech Recognition,"Current speech recognition architectures perform very well from the point of view of machine learning, hence user interaction. This suggests that they are emulating the human biological system well. We investigate whether the inference can be inverted to provide insights into that biological system; in particular the hearing mechanism. Using SincNet, we confirm that end-to-end systems do learn well known filterbank structures. However, we also show that wider band-width filters are important in the learned structure. Whilst some benefits can be gained by initialising both narrow and wide-band filters, physiological constraints suggest that such filters arise in mid-brain rather than the cochlea. We show that standard machine learning architectures must be modified to allow this process to be emulated neurally."
Improving Speech Emotion Recognition Through Focus and Calibration Attention Mechanisms,"Attention has become one of the most commonly used mechanisms in deep learning approaches. The attention mechanism can help the system focus more on the feature space's critical regions. For example, high amplitude regions can play an important role for Speech Emotion Recognition (SER). In this paper, we identify misalignments between the attention and the signal amplitude in the existing multi-head self-attention. To improve the attention area, we propose to use a Focus-Attention (FA) mechanism and a novel Calibration-Attention (CA) mechanism in combination with the multi-head self-attention. Through the FA mechanism, the network can detect the largest amplitude part in the segment. By employing the CA mechanism, the network can modulate the information flow by assigning different weights to each attention head and improve the utilization of surrounding contexts. To evaluate the proposed method, experiments are performed with the IEMOCAP and RAVDESS datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed framework significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on both datasets."
Representation Learning with Graph Neural Networks for Speech Emotion Recognition,"Learning expressive representation is crucial in deep learning. In speech emotion recognition (SER), vacuum regions or noises in the speech interfere with expressive representation learning. However, traditional RNN-based models are susceptible to such noise. Recently, Graph Neural Network (GNN) has demonstrated its effectiveness for representation learning, and we adopt this framework for SER. In particular, we propose a cosine similarity-based graph as an ideal graph structure for representation learning in SER. We present a Cosine similarity-based Graph Convolutional Network (CoGCN) that is robust to perturbation and noise. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods or provides competitive results with a significant model size reduction with only 1/30 parameters."
Feature Selection Enhancement and Feature Space Visualization for Speech-Based Emotion Recognition,"Robust speech emotion recognition relies on the quality of the speech features. We present speech features enhancement strategy that improves speech emotion recognition. We used the INTERSPEECH 2010 challenge feature-set. We identified subsets from the features set and applied Principle Component Analysis to the subsets. Finally, the features are fused horizontally. The resulting feature set is analyzed using t-distributed neighbour embeddings (t-SNE) before the application of features for emotion recognition. The method is compared with the state-of-the-art methods used in the literature. The empirical evidence is drawn using two well-known datasets: Emotional Speech Dataset (EMO-DB) and Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song (RAVDESS) for two languages, German and English, respectively. Our method achieved an average recognition gain of 11.5\% for six out of seven emotions for the EMO-DB dataset, and 13.8\% for seven out of eight emotions for the RAVDESS dataset as compared to the baseline study."
Analyzing Robustness of End-to-End Neural Models for Automatic Speech Recognition,"We investigate robustness properties of pre-trained neural models for automatic speech recognition. Real life data in machine learning is usually very noisy and almost never clean, which can be attributed to various factors depending on the domain, e.g. outliers, random noise and adversarial noise. Therefore, the models we develop for various tasks should be robust to such kinds of noisy data, which led to the thriving field of robust machine learning. We consider this important issue in the setting of automatic speech recognition. With the increasing popularity of pre-trained models, it's an important question to analyze and understand the robustness of such models to noise. In this work, we perform a robustness analysis of the pre-trained neural models wav2vec2, HuBERT and DistilHuBERT on the LibriSpeech and TIMIT datasets. We use different kinds of noising mechanisms and measure the model performances as quantified by the inference time and the standard Word Error Rate metric. We also do an in-depth layer-wise analysis of the wav2vec2 model when injecting noise in between layers, enabling us to predict at a high level what each layer learns. Finally for this model, we visualize the propagation of errors across the layers and compare how it behaves on clean versus noisy data. Our experiments conform the predictions of Pasad et al. [2021] and also raise interesting directions for future work."
Uconv-Conformer: High Reduction of Input Sequence Length for End-to-End Speech Recognition,"Optimization of modern ASR architectures is among the highest priority tasks since it saves many computational resources for model training and inference. The work proposes a new Uconv-Conformer architecture based on the standard Conformer model. It consistently reduces the input sequence length by 16 times, which results in speeding up the work of the intermediate layers. To solve the convergence issue connected with such a significant reduction of the time dimension, we use upsampling blocks like in the U-Net architecture to ensure the correct CTC loss calculation and stabilize network training. The Uconv-Conformer architecture appears to be not only faster in terms of training and inference speed but also shows better WER compared to the baseline Conformer. Our best Uconv-Conformer model shows 47.8% and 23.5% inference acceleration on the CPU and GPU, respectively. Relative WER reduction is 7.3% and 9.2% on LibriSpeech test_clean and test_other respectively."
Generative Data Augmentation Guided by Triplet Loss for Speech Emotion Recognition,"Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is crucial for human-computer interaction but still remains a challenging problem because of two major obstacles: data scarcity and imbalance. Many datasets for SER are substantially imbalanced, where data utterances of one class (most often Neutral) are much more frequent than those of other classes. Furthermore, only a few data resources are available for many existing spoken languages. To address these problems, we exploit a GAN-based augmentation model guided by a triplet network, to improve SER performance given imbalanced and insufficient training data. We conduct experiments and demonstrate: 1) With a highly imbalanced dataset, our augmentation strategy significantly improves the SER performance (+8% recall score compared with the baseline). 2) Moreover, in a cross-lingual benchmark, where we train a model with enough source language utterances but very few target language utterances (around 50 in our experiments), our augmentation strategy brings benefits for the SER performance of all three target languages."
Large vocabulary speech recognition for languages of Africa: multilingual modeling and self-supervised learning,"Almost none of the 2,000+ languages spoken in Africa have widely available automatic speech recognition systems, and the required data is also only available for a few languages. We have experimented with two techniques which may provide pathways to large vocabulary speech recognition for African languages: multilingual modeling and self-supervised learning. We gathered available open source data and collected data for 15 languages, and trained experimental models using these techniques. Our results show that pooling the small amounts of data available in multilingual end-to-end models, and pre-training on unsupervised data can help improve speech recognition quality for many African languages."
Global Performance Disparities Between English-Language Accents in Automatic Speech Recognition,"Past research has identified discriminatory automatic speech recognition (ASR) performance as a function of the racial group and nationality of the speaker. In this paper, we expand the discussion beyond bias as a function of the individual national origin of the speaker to look for bias as a function of the geopolitical orientation of their nation of origin. We audit some of the most popular English language ASR services using a large and global data set of speech from The Speech Accent Archive, which includes over 2,700 speakers of English born in 171 different countries. We show that, even when controlling for multiple linguistic covariates, ASR service performance has a statistically significant relationship to the political alignment of the speaker's birth country with respect to the United States' geopolitical power. This holds for all ASR services tested. We discuss this bias in the context of the historical use of language to maintain global and political power."
DENT-DDSP: Data-efficient noisy speech generator using differentiable digital signal processors for explicit distortion modelling and noise-robust speech recognition,"The performances of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems degrade drastically under noisy conditions. Explicit distortion modelling (EDM), as a feature compensation step, is able to enhance ASR systems under such conditions by simulating the in-domain noisy speeches from the clean counterparts. Yet, existing distortion models are either non-trainable or unexplainable and often lack controllability and generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a fully explainable and controllable model: DENT-DDSP to achieve EDM. DENT-DDSP utilizes novel differentiable digital signal processing (DDSP) components and requires only 10 seconds of training data to achieve high fidelity. The experiment shows that the simulated noisy data from DENT-DDSP achieves the highest simulation fidelity compared to other baseline models in terms of multi-scale spectral loss (MSSL). Moreover, to validate whether the data simulated by DENT-DDSP are able to replace the scarce in-domain noisy data in the noise-robust ASR tasks, several downstream ASR models with the same architecture are trained using the simulated data and the real data. The experiment shows that the model trained with the simulated noisy data from DENT-DDSP achieves similar performances to the benchmark with a 2.7\% difference in terms of word error rate (WER). The code of the model is released online."
Pronunciation-aware unique character encoding for RNN Transducer-based Mandarin speech recognition,"For Mandarin end-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks, compared to character-based modeling units, pronunciation-based modeling units could improve the sharing of modeling units in model training but meet homophone problems. In this study, we propose to use a novel pronunciation-aware unique character encoding for building E2E RNN-T-based Mandarin ASR systems. The proposed encoding is a combination of pronunciation-base syllable and character index (CI). By introducing the CI, the RNN-T model can overcome the homophone problem while utilizing the pronunciation information for extracting modeling units. With the proposed encoding, the model outputs can be converted into the final recognition result through a one-to-one mapping. We conducted experiments on Aishell and MagicData datasets, and the experimental results showed the effectiveness of the proposed method."
Extending RNN-T-based speech recognition systems with emotion and language classification,"Speech transcription, emotion recognition, and language identification are usually considered to be three different tasks. Each one requires a different model with a different architecture and training process. We propose using a recurrent neural network transducer (RNN-T)-based speech-to-text (STT) system as a common component that can be used for emotion recognition and language identification as well as for speech recognition. Our work extends the STT system for emotion classification through minimal changes, and shows successful results on the IEMOCAP and MELD datasets. In addition, we demonstrate that by adding a lightweight component to the RNN-T module, it can also be used for language identification. In our evaluations, this new classifier demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy for the NIST-LRE-07 dataset."
Knowledge-driven Subword Grammar Modeling for Automatic Speech Recognition in Tamil and Kannada,"In this paper, we present specially designed automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems for the highly agglutinative and inflective languages of Tamil and Kannada that can recognize unlimited vocabulary of words. We use subwords as the basic lexical units for recognition and construct subword grammar weighted finite state transducer (SG-WFST) graphs for word segmentation that captures most of the complex word formation rules of the languages. We have identified the following category of words (i) verbs, (ii) nouns, (ii) pronouns, and (iv) numbers. The prefix, infix and suffix lists of subwords are created for each of these categories and are used to design the SG-WFST graphs. We also present a heuristic segmentation algorithm that can even segment exceptional words that do not follow the rules encapsulated in the SG-WFST graph. Most of the data-driven subword dictionary creation algorithms are computation driven, and hence do not guarantee morpheme-like units and so we have used the linguistic knowledge of the languages and manually created the subword dictionaries and the graphs. Finally, we train a deep neural network acoustic model and combine it with the pronunciation lexicon of the subword dictionary and the SG-WFST graph to build the subword-ASR systems. Since the subword-ASR produces subword sequences as output for a given test speech, we post-process its output to get the final word sequence, so that the actual number of words that can be recognized is much higher. Upon experimenting the subword-ASR system with the IISc-MILE Tamil and Kannada ASR corpora, we observe an absolute word error rate reduction of 12.39% and 13.56% over the baseline word-based ASR systems for Tamil and Kannada, respectively."
Subword Dictionary Learning and Segmentation Techniques for Automatic Speech Recognition in Tamil and Kannada,"We present automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems for Tamil and Kannada based on subword modeling to effectively handle unlimited vocabulary due to the highly agglutinative nature of the languages. We explore byte pair encoding (BPE), and proposed a variant of this algorithm named extended-BPE, and Morfessor tool to segment each word as subwords. We have effectively incorporated maximum likelihood (ML) and Viterbi estimation techniques with weighted finite state transducers (WFST) framework in these algorithms to learn the subword dictionary from a large text corpus. Using the learnt subword dictionary, the words in training data transcriptions are segmented to subwords and we train deep neural network ASR systems which recognize subword sequence for any given test speech utterance. The output subword sequence is then post-processed using deterministic rules to get the final word sequence such that the actual number of words that can be recognized is much larger. For Tamil ASR, We use 152 hours of data for training and 65 hours for testing, whereas for Kannada ASR, we use 275 hours for training and 72 hours for testing. Upon experimenting with different combination of segmentation and estimation techniques, we find that the word error rate (WER) reduces drastically when compared to the baseline word-level ASR, achieving a maximum absolute WER reduction of 6.24% and 6.63% for Tamil and Kannada respectively."
Multimodal Speech Emotion Recognition using Cross Attention with Aligned Audio and Text,"In this paper, we propose a novel speech emotion recognition model called Cross Attention Network (CAN) that uses aligned audio and text signals as inputs. It is inspired by the fact that humans recognize speech as a combination of simultaneously produced acoustic and textual signals. First, our method segments the audio and the underlying text signals into equal number of steps in an aligned way so that the same time steps of the sequential signals cover the same time span in the signals. Together with this technique, we apply the cross attention to aggregate the sequential information from the aligned signals. In the cross attention, each modality is aggregated independently by applying the global attention mechanism onto each modality. Then, the attention weights of each modality are applied directly to the other modality in a crossed way, so that the CAN gathers the audio and text information from the same time steps based on each modality. In the experiments conducted on the standard IEMOCAP dataset, our model outperforms the state-of-the-art systems by 2.66% and 3.18% relatively in terms of the weighted and unweighted accuracy."
Implementation Of Tiny Machine Learning Models On Arduino 33 BLE For Gesture And Speech Recognition,"In this article gesture recognition and speech recognition applications are implemented on embedded systems with Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML). It features 3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis gyroscope and 3-axis magnetometer. The gesture recognition,provides an innovative approach nonverbal communication. It has wide applications in human-computer interaction and sign language. Here in the implementation of hand gesture recognition, TinyML model is trained and deployed from EdgeImpulse framework for hand gesture recognition and based on the hand movements, Arduino Nano 33 BLE device having 6-axis IMU can find out the direction of movement of hand. The Speech is a mode of communication. Speech recognition is a way by which the statements or commands of human speech is understood by the computer which reacts accordingly. The main aim of speech recognition is to achieve communication between man and machine. Here in the implementation of speech recognition, TinyML model is trained and deployed from EdgeImpulse framework for speech recognition and based on the keywords pronounced by human, Arduino Nano 33 BLE device having built-in microphone can make an RGB LED glow like red, green or blue based on keyword pronounced. The results of each application are obtained and listed in the results section and given the analysis upon the results."
Domain Adapting Deep Reinforcement Learning for Real-world Speech Emotion Recognition,"Computers can understand and then engage with people in an emotionally intelligent way thanks to speech-emotion recognition (SER). However, the performance of SER in cross-corpus and real-world live data feed scenarios can be significantly improved. The inability to adapt an existing model to a new domain is one of the shortcomings of SER methods. To address this challenge, researchers have developed domain adaptation techniques that transfer knowledge learnt by a model across the domain. Although existing domain adaptation techniques have improved performances across domains, they can be improved to adapt to a real-world live data feed situation where a model can self-tune while deployed. In this paper, we present a deep reinforcement learning-based strategy (RL-DA) for adapting a pre-trained model to a real-world live data feed setting while interacting with the environment and collecting continual feedback. RL-DA is evaluated on SER tasks, including cross-corpus and cross-language domain adaption schema. Evaluation results show that in a live data feed setting, RL-DA outperforms a baseline strategy by 11% and 14% in cross-corpus and cross-language scenarios, respectively."
Label Uncertainty Modeling and Prediction for Speech Emotion Recognition using t-Distributions,"As different people perceive others' emotional expressions differently, their annotation in terms of arousal and valence are per se subjective. To address this, these emotion annotations are typically collected by multiple annotators and averaged across annotators in order to obtain labels for arousal and valence. However, besides the average, also the uncertainty of a label is of interest, and should also be modeled and predicted for automatic emotion recognition. In the literature, for simplicity, label uncertainty modeling is commonly approached with a Gaussian assumption on the collected annotations. However, as the number of annotators is typically rather small due to resource constraints, we argue that the Gaussian approach is a rather crude assumption. In contrast, in this work we propose to model the label distribution using a Student's t-distribution which allows us to account for the number of annotations available. With this model, we derive the corresponding Kullback-Leibler divergence based loss function and use it to train an estimator for the distribution of emotion labels, from which the mean and uncertainty can be inferred. Through qualitative and quantitative analysis, we show the benefits of the t-distribution over a Gaussian distribution. We validate our proposed method on the AVEC'16 dataset. Results reveal that our t-distribution based approach improves over the Gaussian approach with state-of-the-art uncertainty modeling results in speech-based emotion recognition, along with an optimal and even faster convergence."
Unsupervised data selection for Speech Recognition with contrastive loss ratios,"This paper proposes an unsupervised data selection method by using a submodular function based on contrastive loss ratios of target and training data sets. A model using a contrastive loss function is trained on both sets. Then the ratio of frame-level losses for each model is used by a submodular function. By using the submodular function, a training set for automatic speech recognition matching the target data set is selected. Experiments show that models trained on the data sets selected by the proposed method outperform the selection method based on log-likelihoods produced by GMM-HMM models, in terms of word error rate (WER). When selecting a fixed amount, e.g. 10 hours of data, the difference between the results of two methods on Tedtalks was 20.23% WER relative. The method can also be used to select data with the aim of minimising negative transfer, while maintaining or improving on performance of models trained on the whole training set. Results show that the WER on the WSJCAM0 data set was reduced by 6.26% relative when selecting 85% from the whole data set."
Learning a Dual-Mode Speech Recognition Model via Self-Pruning,"There is growing interest in unifying the streaming and full-context automatic speech recognition (ASR) networks into a single end-to-end ASR model to simplify the model training and deployment for both use cases. While in real-world ASR applications, the streaming ASR models typically operate under more storage and computational constraints - e.g., on embedded devices - than any server-side full-context models. Motivated by the recent progress in Omni-sparsity supernet training, where multiple subnetworks are jointly optimized in one single model, this work aims to jointly learn a compact sparse on-device streaming ASR model, and a large dense server non-streaming model, in a single supernet. Next, we present that, performing supernet training on both wav2vec 2.0 self-supervised learning and supervised ASR fine-tuning can not only substantially improve the large non-streaming model as shown in prior works, and also be able to improve the compact sparse streaming model."
Toward Fairness in Speech Recognition: Discovery and mitigation of performance disparities,"As for other forms of AI, speech recognition has recently been examined with respect to performance disparities across different user cohorts. One approach to achieve fairness in speech recognition is to (1) identify speaker cohorts that suffer from subpar performance and (2) apply fairness mitigation measures targeting the cohorts discovered. In this paper, we report on initial findings with both discovery and mitigation of performance disparities using data from a product-scale AI assistant speech recognition system. We compare cohort discovery based on geographic and demographic information to a more scalable method that groups speakers without human labels, using speaker embedding technology. For fairness mitigation, we find that oversampling of underrepresented cohorts, as well as modeling speaker cohort membership by additional input variables, reduces the gap between top- and bottom-performing cohorts, without deteriorating overall recognition accuracy."
CTL-MTNet: A Novel CapsNet and Transfer Learning-Based Mixed Task Net for the Single-Corpus and Cross-Corpus Speech Emotion Recognition,"Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) has become a growing focus of research in human-computer interaction. An essential challenge in SER is to extract common attributes from different speakers or languages, especially when a specific source corpus has to be trained to recognize the unknown data coming from another speech corpus. To address this challenge, a Capsule Network (CapsNet) and Transfer Learning based Mixed Task Net (CTLMTNet) are proposed to deal with both the singlecorpus and cross-corpus SER tasks simultaneously in this paper. For the single-corpus task, the combination of Convolution-Pooling and Attention CapsNet module CPAC) is designed by embedding the self-attention mechanism to the CapsNet, guiding the module to focus on the important features that can be fed into different capsules. The extracted high-level features by CPAC provide sufficient discriminative ability. Furthermore, to handle the cross-corpus task, CTL-MTNet employs a Corpus Adaptation Adversarial Module (CAAM) by combining CPAC with Margin Disparity Discrepancy (MDD), which can learn the domain-invariant emotion representations through extracting the strong emotion commonness. Experiments including ablation studies and visualizations on both singleand cross-corpus tasks using four well-known SER datasets in different languages are conducted for performance evaluation and comparison. The results indicate that in both tasks the CTL-MTNet showed better performance in all cases compared to a number of state-of-the-art methods. The source code and the supplementary materials are available at: https://github.com/MLDMXM2017/CTLMTNet"
Knowledge Transfer and Distillation from Autoregressive to Non-Autoregressive Speech Recognition,"Modern non-autoregressive~(NAR) speech recognition systems aim to accelerate the inference speed; however, they suffer from performance degradation compared with autoregressive~(AR) models as well as the huge model size issue. We propose a novel knowledge transfer and distillation architecture that leverages knowledge from AR models to improve the NAR performance while reducing the model's size. Frame- and sequence-level objectives are well-designed for transfer learning. To further boost the performance of NAR, a beam search method on Mask-CTC is developed to enlarge the search space during the inference stage. Experiments show that the proposed NAR beam search relatively reduces CER by over 5% on AISHELL-1 benchmark with a tolerable real-time-factor~(RTF) increment. By knowledge transfer, the NAR student who has the same size as the AR teacher obtains relative CER reductions of 8/16% on AISHELL-1 dev/test sets, and over 25% relative WER reductions on LibriSpeech test-clean/other sets. Moreover, the ~9x smaller NAR models achieve ~25% relative CER/WER reductions on both AISHELL-1 and LibriSpeech benchmarks with the proposed knowledge transfer and distillation."
"ESPnet-SE++: Speech Enhancement for Robust Speech Recognition, Translation, and Understanding","This paper presents recent progress on integrating speech separation and enhancement (SSE) into the ESPnet toolkit. Compared with the previous ESPnet-SE work, numerous features have been added, including recent state-of-the-art speech enhancement models with their respective training and evaluation recipes. Importantly, a new interface has been designed to flexibly combine speech enhancement front-ends with other tasks, including automatic speech recognition (ASR), speech translation (ST), and spoken language understanding (SLU). To showcase such integration, we performed experiments on carefully designed synthetic datasets for noisy-reverberant multi-channel ST and SLU tasks, which can be used as benchmark corpora for future research. In addition to these new tasks, we also use CHiME-4 and WSJ0-2Mix to benchmark multi- and single-channel SE approaches. Results show that the integration of SE front-ends with back-end tasks is a promising research direction even for tasks besides ASR, especially in the multi-channel scenario. The code is available online at https://github.com/ESPnet/ESPnet. The multi-channel ST and SLU datasets, which are another contribution of this work, are released on HuggingFace."
ILASR: Privacy-Preserving Incremental Learning for Automatic Speech Recognition at Production Scale,"Incremental learning is one paradigm to enable model building and updating at scale with streaming data. For end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks, the absence of human annotated labels along with the need for privacy preserving policies for model building makes it a daunting challenge. Motivated by these challenges, in this paper we use a cloud based framework for production systems to demonstrate insights from privacy preserving incremental learning for automatic speech recognition (ILASR). By privacy preserving, we mean, usage of ephemeral data which are not human annotated. This system is a step forward for production levelASR models for incremental/continual learning that offers near real-time test-bed for experimentation in the cloud for end-to-end ASR, while adhering to privacy-preserving policies. We show that the proposed system can improve the production models significantly(3%) over a new time period of six months even in the absence of human annotated labels with varying levels of weak supervision and large batch sizes in incremental learning. This improvement is 20% over test sets with new words and phrases in the new time period. We demonstrate the effectiveness of model building in a privacy-preserving incremental fashion for ASR while further exploring the utility of having an effective teacher model and use of large batch sizes."
Reducing Geographic Disparities in Automatic Speech Recognition via Elastic Weight Consolidation,"We present an approach to reduce the performance disparity between geographic regions without degrading performance on the overall user population for ASR. A popular approach is to fine-tune the model with data from regions where the ASR model has a higher word error rate (WER). However, when the ASR model is adapted to get better performance on these high-WER regions, its parameters wander from the previous optimal values, which can lead to worse performance in other regions. In our proposed method, we utilize the elastic weight consolidation (EWC) regularization loss to identify directions in parameters space along which the ASR weights can vary to improve for high-error regions, while still maintaining performance on the speaker population overall. Our results demonstrate that EWC can reduce the word error rate (WER) in the region with highest WER by 3.2% relative while reducing the overall WER by 1.3% relative. We also evaluate the role of language and acoustic models in ASR fairness and propose a clustering algorithm to identify WER disparities based on geographic region."
Sotto Voce: Federated Speech Recognition with Differential Privacy Guarantees,"Speech data is expensive to collect, and incredibly sensitive to its sources. It is often the case that organizations independently collect small datasets for their own use, but often these are not performant for the demands of machine learning. Organizations could pool these datasets together and jointly build a strong ASR system; sharing data in the clear, however, comes with tremendous risk, in terms of intellectual property loss as well as loss of privacy of the individuals who exist in the dataset. In this paper, we offer a potential solution for learning an ML model across multiple organizations where we can provide mathematical guarantees limiting privacy loss. We use a Federated Learning approach built on a strong foundation of Differential Privacy techniques. We apply these to a senone classification prototype and demonstrate that the model improves with the addition of private data while still respecting privacy."
Direction-Aware Joint Adaptation of Neural Speech Enhancement and Recognition in Real Multiparty Conversational Environments,"This paper describes noisy speech recognition for an augmented reality headset that helps verbal communication within real multiparty conversational environments. A major approach that has actively been studied in simulated environments is to sequentially perform speech enhancement and automatic speech recognition (ASR) based on deep neural networks (DNNs) trained in a supervised manner. In our task, however, such a pretrained system fails to work due to the mismatch between the training and test conditions and the head movements of the user. To enhance only the utterances of a target speaker, we use beamforming based on a DNN-based speech mask estimator that can adaptively extract the speech components corresponding to a head-relative particular direction. We propose a semi-supervised adaptation method that jointly updates the mask estimator and the ASR model at run-time using clean speech signals with ground-truth transcriptions and noisy speech signals with highly-confident estimated transcriptions. Comparative experiments using the state-of-the-art distant speech recognition system show that the proposed method significantly improves the ASR performance."
Efficient spike encoding algorithms for neuromorphic speech recognition,"Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) are known to be very effective for neuromorphic processor implementations, achieving orders of magnitude improvements in energy efficiency and computational latency over traditional deep learning approaches. Comparable algorithmic performance was recently made possible as well with the adaptation of supervised training algorithms to the context of SNN. However, information including audio, video, and other sensor-derived data are typically encoded as real-valued signals that are not well-suited to SNN, preventing the network from leveraging spike timing information. Efficient encoding from real-valued signals to spikes is therefore critical and significantly impacts the performance of the overall system. To efficiently encode signals into spikes, both the preservation of information relevant to the task at hand as well as the density of the encoded spikes must be considered. In this paper, we study four spike encoding methods in the context of a speaker independent digit classification system: Send on Delta, Time to First Spike, Leaky Integrate and Fire Neuron and Bens Spiker Algorithm. We first show that all encoding methods yield higher classification accuracy using significantly fewer spikes when encoding a bio-inspired cochleagram as opposed to a traditional short-time Fourier transform. We then show that two Send On Delta variants result in classification results comparable with a state of the art deep convolutional neural network baseline, while simultaneously reducing the encoded bit rate. Finally, we show that several encoding methods result in improved performance over the conventional deep learning baseline in certain cases, further demonstrating the power of spike encoding algorithms in the encoding of real-valued signals and that neuromorphic implementation has the potential to outperform state of the art techniques."
Semi-supervised cross-lingual speech emotion recognition,"Speech emotion recognition (SER) on a single language has achieved remarkable results through deep learning approaches over the last decade. However, cross-lingual SER remains a challenge in real-world applications due to (i) a large difference between the source and target domain distributions, (ii) the availability of few labeled and many unlabeled utterances for the new language. Taking into account previous aspects, we propose a Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) method for cross-lingual emotion recognition when a few labels from the new language are available. Based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), our method adapts to a new language by exploiting a pseudo-labeling strategy for the unlabeled utterances. In particular, the use of a hard and soft pseudo-labels approach is investigated. We thoroughly evaluate the performance of the method in a speaker-independent setup on both the source and the new language and show its robustness across five languages belonging to different linguistic strains."
Visual Context-driven Audio Feature Enhancement for Robust End-to-End Audio-Visual Speech Recognition,"This paper focuses on designing a noise-robust end-to-end Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) system. To this end, we propose Visual Context-driven Audio Feature Enhancement module (V-CAFE) to enhance the input noisy audio speech with a help of audio-visual correspondence. The proposed V-CAFE is designed to capture the transition of lip movements, namely visual context and to generate a noise reduction mask by considering the obtained visual context. Through context-dependent modeling, the ambiguity in viseme-to-phoneme mapping can be refined for mask generation. The noisy representations are masked out with the noise reduction mask resulting in enhanced audio features. The enhanced audio features are fused with the visual features and taken to an encoder-decoder model composed of Conformer and Transformer for speech recognition. We show the proposed end-to-end AVSR with the V-CAFE can further improve the noise-robustness of AVSR. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated in noisy speech recognition and overlapped speech recognition experiments using the two largest audio-visual datasets, LRS2 and LRS3."
Huqariq: A Multilingual Speech Corpus of Native Languages of Peru for Speech Recognition,"The Huqariq corpus is a multilingual collection of speech from native Peruvian languages. The transcribed corpus is intended for the research and development of speech technologies to preserve endangered languages in Peru. Huqariq is primarily designed for the development of automatic speech recognition, language identification and text-to-speech tools. In order to achieve corpus collection sustainably, we employ the crowdsourcing methodology. Huqariq includes four native languages of Peru, and it is expected that by the end of the year 2022, it can reach up to 20 native languages out of the 48 native languages in Peru. The corpus has 220 hours of transcribed audio recorded by more than 500 volunteers, making it the largest speech corpus for native languages in Peru. In order to verify the quality of the corpus, we present speech recognition experiments using 220 hours of fully transcribed audio."
End-to-end speech recognition modeling from de-identified data,"De-identification of data used for automatic speech recognition modeling is a critical component in protecting privacy, especially in the medical domain. However, simply removing all personally identifiable information (PII) from end-to-end model training data leads to a significant performance degradation in particular for the recognition of names, dates, locations, and words from similar categories. We propose and evaluate a two-step method for partially recovering this loss. First, PII is identified, and each occurrence is replaced with a random word sequence of the same category. Then, corresponding audio is produced via text-to-speech or by splicing together matching audio fragments extracted from the corpus. These artificial audio/label pairs, together with speaker turns from the original data without PII, are used to train models. We evaluate the performance of this method on in-house data of medical conversations and observe a recovery of almost the entire performance degradation in the general word error rate while still maintaining a strong diarization performance. Our main focus is the improvement of recall and precision in the recognition of PII-related words. Depending on the PII category, between 50\% - 90\% of the performance degradation can be recovered using our proposed method."
Multitask Learning from Augmented Auxiliary Data for Improving Speech Emotion Recognition,"Despite the recent progress in speech emotion recognition (SER), state-of-the-art systems lack generalisation across different conditions. A key underlying reason for poor generalisation is the scarcity of emotion datasets, which is a significant roadblock to designing robust machine learning (ML) models. Recent works in SER focus on utilising multitask learning (MTL) methods to improve generalisation by learning shared representations. However, most of these studies propose MTL solutions with the requirement of meta labels for auxiliary tasks, which limits the training of SER systems. This paper proposes an MTL framework (MTL-AUG) that learns generalised representations from augmented data. We utilise augmentation-type classification and unsupervised reconstruction as auxiliary tasks, which allow training SER systems on augmented data without requiring any meta labels for auxiliary tasks. The semi-supervised nature of MTL-AUG allows for the exploitation of the abundant unlabelled data to further boost the performance of SER. We comprehensively evaluate the proposed framework in the following settings: (1) within corpus, (2) cross-corpus and cross-language, (3) noisy speech, (4) and adversarial attacks. Our evaluations using the widely used IEMOCAP, MSP-IMPROV, and EMODB datasets show improved results compared to existing state-of-the-art methods."
Online Continual Learning of End-to-End Speech Recognition Models,"Continual Learning, also known as Lifelong Learning, aims to continually learn from new data as it becomes available. While prior research on continual learning in automatic speech recognition has focused on the adaptation of models across multiple different speech recognition tasks, in this paper we propose an experimental setting for \textit{online continual learning} for automatic speech recognition of a single task. Specifically focusing on the case where additional training data for the same task becomes available incrementally over time, we demonstrate the effectiveness of performing incremental model updates to end-to-end speech recognition models with an online Gradient Episodic Memory (GEM) method. Moreover, we show that with online continual learning and a selective sampling strategy, we can maintain an accuracy that is similar to retraining a model from scratch while requiring significantly lower computation costs. We have also verified our method with self-supervised learning (SSL) features."
pMCT: Patched Multi-Condition Training for Robust Speech Recognition,"We propose a novel Patched Multi-Condition Training (pMCT) method for robust Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). pMCT employs Multi-condition Audio Modification and Patching (MAMP) via mixing {\it patches} of the same utterance extracted from clean and distorted speech. Training using patch-modified signals improves robustness of models in noisy reverberant scenarios. Our proposed pMCT is evaluated on the LibriSpeech dataset showing improvement over using vanilla Multi-Condition Training (MCT). For analyses on robust ASR, we employed pMCT on the VOiCES dataset which is a noisy reverberant dataset created using utterances from LibriSpeech. In the analyses, pMCT achieves 23.1% relative WER reduction compared to the MCT."
Intermediate-layer output Regularization for Attention-based Speech Recognition with Shared Decoder,"Intermediate layer output (ILO) regularization by means of multitask training on encoder side has been shown to be an effective approach to yielding improved results on a wide range of end-to-end ASR frameworks. In this paper, we propose a novel method to do ILO regularized training differently. Instead of using conventional multitask methods that entail more training overhead, we directly make the intermediate layer output as input to the decoder, that is, our decoder not only accepts the output of the final encoder layer as input, it also takes the output of the encoder ILO as input during training. With the proposed method, as both encoder and decoder are simultaneously ""regularized"", the network is more sufficiently trained, consistently leading to improved results, over the ILO-based CTC method, as well as over the original attention-based modeling method without the proposed method employed."
Internal Language Model Estimation based Language Model Fusion for Cross-Domain Code-Switching Speech Recognition,"Internal Language Model Estimation (ILME) based language model (LM) fusion has been shown significantly improved recognition results over conventional shallow fusion in both intra-domain and cross-domain speech recognition tasks. In this paper, we attempt to apply our ILME method to cross-domain code-switching speech recognition (CSSR) work. Specifically, our curiosity comes from several aspects. First, we are curious about how effective the ILME-based LM fusion is for both intra-domain and cross-domain CSSR tasks. We verify this with or without merging two code-switching domains. More importantly, we train an end-to-end (E2E) speech recognition model by means of merging two monolingual data sets and observe the efficacy of the proposed ILME-based LM fusion for CSSR. Experimental results on SEAME that is from Southeast Asian and another Chinese Mainland CS data set demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ILME-based LM fusion method."
Tandem Multitask Training of Speaker Diarisation and Speech Recognition for Meeting Transcription,"Self-supervised-learning-based pre-trained models for speech data, such as Wav2Vec 2.0 (W2V2), have become the backbone of many speech tasks. In this paper, to achieve speaker diarisation and speech recognition using a single model, a tandem multitask training (TMT) method is proposed to fine-tune W2V2. For speaker diarisation, the tasks of voice activity detection (VAD) and speaker classification (SC) are required, and connectionist temporal classification (CTC) is used for ASR. The multitask framework implements VAD, SC, and ASR using an early layer, middle layer, and late layer of W2V2, which coincides with the order of segmenting the audio with VAD, clustering the segments based on speaker embeddings, and transcribing each segment with ASR. Experimental results on the augmented multi-party (AMI) dataset showed that using different W2V2 layers for VAD, SC, and ASR from the earlier to later layers for TMT not only saves computational cost, but also reduces diarisation error rates (DERs). Joint fine-tuning of VAD, SC, and ASR yielded 16%/17% relative reductions of DER with manual/automatic segmentation respectively, and consistent reductions in speaker attributed word error rate, compared to the baseline with separately fine-tuned models."
Investigating the Impact of Cross-lingual Acoustic-Phonetic Similarities on Multilingual Speech Recognition,"Multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems mostly benefit low resource languages but suffer degradation in performance across several languages relative to their monolingual counterparts. Limited studies have focused on understanding the languages behaviour in the multilingual speech recognition setups. In this paper, a novel data-driven approach is proposed to investigate the cross-lingual acoustic-phonetic similarities. This technique measures the similarities between posterior distributions from various monolingual acoustic models against a target speech signal. Deep neural networks are trained as mapping networks to transform the distributions from different acoustic models into a directly comparable form. The analysis observes that the languages closeness can not be truly estimated by the volume of overlapping phonemes set. Entropy analysis of the proposed mapping networks exhibits that a language with lesser overlap can be more amenable to cross-lingual transfer, and hence more beneficial in the multilingual setup. Finally, the proposed posterior transformation approach is leveraged to fuse monolingual models for a target language. A relative improvement of ~8% over monolingual counterpart is achieved."
End-to-end Speech-to-Punctuated-Text Recognition,"Conventional automatic speech recognition systems do not produce punctuation marks which are important for the readability of the speech recognition results. They are also needed for subsequent natural language processing tasks such as machine translation. There have been a lot of works on punctuation prediction models that insert punctuation marks into speech recognition results as post-processing. However, these studies do not utilize acoustic information for punctuation prediction and are directly affected by speech recognition errors. In this study, we propose an end-to-end model that takes speech as input and outputs punctuated texts. This model is expected to predict punctuation robustly against speech recognition errors while using acoustic information. We also propose to incorporate an auxiliary loss to train the model using the output of the intermediate layer and unpunctuated texts. Through experiments, we compare the performance of the proposed model to that of a cascaded system. The proposed model achieves higher punctuation prediction accuracy than the cascaded system without sacrificing the speech recognition error rate. It is also demonstrated that the multi-task learning using the intermediate output against the unpunctuated text is effective. Moreover, the proposed model has only about 1/7th of the parameters compared to the cascaded system."
Branchformer: Parallel MLP-Attention Architectures to Capture Local and Global Context for Speech Recognition and Understanding,"Conformer has proven to be effective in many speech processing tasks. It combines the benefits of extracting local dependencies using convolutions and global dependencies using self-attention. Inspired by this, we propose a more flexible, interpretable and customizable encoder alternative, Branchformer, with parallel branches for modeling various ranged dependencies in end-to-end speech processing. In each encoder layer, one branch employs self-attention or its variant to capture long-range dependencies, while the other branch utilizes an MLP module with convolutional gating (cgMLP) to extract local relationships. We conduct experiments on several speech recognition and spoken language understanding benchmarks. Results show that our model outperforms both Transformer and cgMLP. It also matches with or outperforms state-of-the-art results achieved by Conformer. Furthermore, we show various strategies to reduce computation thanks to the two-branch architecture, including the ability to have variable inference complexity in a single trained model. The weights learned for merging branches indicate how local and global dependencies are utilized in different layers, which benefits model designing."
Kaggle Competition: Cantonese Audio-Visual Speech Recognition for In-car Commands,"With the rise of deep learning and intelligent vehicles, the smart assistant has become an essential in-car component to facilitate driving and provide extra functionalities. In-car smart assistants should be able to process general as well as car-related commands and perform corresponding actions, which eases driving and improves safety. However, in this research field, most datasets are in major languages, such as English and Chinese. There is a huge data scarcity issue for low-resource languages, hindering the development of research and applications for broader communities. Therefore, it is crucial to have more benchmarks to raise awareness and motivate the research in low-resource languages. To mitigate this problem, we collect a new dataset, namely Cantonese In-car Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (CI-AVSR), for in-car speech recognition in the Cantonese language with video and audio data. Together with it, we propose Cantonese Audio-Visual Speech Recognition for In-car Commands as a new challenge for the community to tackle low-resource speech recognition under in-car scenarios."
A cross-corpus study on speech emotion recognition,"For speech emotion datasets, it has been difficult to acquire large quantities of reliable data and acted emotions may be over the top compared to less expressive emotions displayed in everyday life. Lately, larger datasets with natural emotions have been created. Instead of ignoring smaller, acted datasets, this study investigates whether information learnt from acted emotions is useful for detecting natural emotions. Cross-corpus research has mostly considered cross-lingual and even cross-age datasets, and difficulties arise from different methods of annotating emotions causing a drop in performance. To be consistent, four adult English datasets covering acted, elicited and natural emotions are considered. A state-of-the-art model is proposed to accurately investigate the degradation of performance. The system involves a bi-directional LSTM with an attention mechanism to classify emotions across datasets. Experiments study the effects of training models in a cross-corpus and multi-domain fashion and results show the transfer of information is not successful. Out-of-domain models, followed by adapting to the missing dataset, and domain adversarial training (DAT) are shown to be more suitable to generalising to emotions across datasets. This shows positive information transfer from acted datasets to those with more natural emotions and the benefits from training on different corpora."
Minimizing Sequential Confusion Error in Speech Command Recognition,"Speech command recognition (SCR) has been commonly used on resource constrained devices to achieve hands-free user experience. However, in real applications, confusion among commands with similar pronunciations often happens due to the limited capacity of small models deployed on edge devices, which drastically affects the user experience. In this paper, inspired by the advances of discriminative training in speech recognition, we propose a novel minimize sequential confusion error (MSCE) training criterion particularly for SCR, aiming to alleviate the command confusion problem. Specifically, we aim to improve the ability of discriminating the target command from other commands on the basis of MCE discriminative criteria. We define the likelihood of different commands through connectionist temporal classification (CTC). During training, we propose several strategies to use prior knowledge creating a confusing sequence set for similar-sounding command instead of creating the whole non-target command set, which can better save the training resources and effectively reduce command confusion errors. Specifically, we design and compare three different strategies for confusing set construction. By using our proposed method, we can relatively reduce the False Reject Rate~(FRR) by 33.7% at 0.01 False Alarm Rate~(FAR) and confusion errors by 18.28% on our collected speech command set."
Generating gender-ambiguous voices for privacy-preserving speech recognition,"Our voice encodes a uniquely identifiable pattern which can be used to infer private attributes, such as gender or identity, that an individual might wish not to reveal when using a speech recognition service. To prevent attribute inference attacks alongside speech recognition tasks, we present a generative adversarial network, GenGAN, that synthesises voices that conceal the gender or identity of a speaker. The proposed network includes a generator with a U-Net architecture that learns to fool a discriminator. We condition the generator only on gender information and use an adversarial loss between signal distortion and privacy preservation. We show that GenGAN improves the trade-off between privacy and utility compared to privacy-preserving representation learning methods that consider gender information as a sensitive attribute to protect."
A Graph Isomorphism Network with Weighted Multiple Aggregators for Speech Emotion Recognition,"Speech emotion recognition (SER) is an essential part of human-computer interaction. In this paper, we propose an SER network based on a Graph Isomorphism Network with Weighted Multiple Aggregators (WMA-GIN), which can effectively handle the problem of information confusion when neighbour nodes' features are aggregated together in GIN structure. Moreover, a Full-Adjacent (FA) layer is adopted for alleviating the over-squashing problem, which is existed in all Graph Neural Network (GNN) structures, including GIN. Furthermore, a multi-phase attention mechanism and multi-loss training strategy are employed to avoid missing the useful emotional information in the stacked WMA-GIN layers. We evaluated the performance of our proposed WMA-GIN on the popular IEMOCAP dataset. The experimental results show that WMA-GIN outperforms other GNN-based methods and is comparable to some advanced non-graph-based methods by achieving 72.48% of weighted accuracy (WA) and 67.72% of unweighted accuracy (UA)."
Tree-constrained Pointer Generator with Graph Neural Network Encodings for Contextual Speech Recognition,"Incorporating biasing words obtained as contextual knowledge is critical for many automatic speech recognition (ASR) applications. This paper proposes the use of graph neural network (GNN) encodings in a tree-constrained pointer generator (TCPGen) component for end-to-end contextual ASR. By encoding the biasing words in the prefix-tree with a tree-based GNN, lookahead for future wordpieces in end-to-end ASR decoding is achieved at each tree node by incorporating information about all wordpieces on the tree branches rooted from it, which allows a more accurate prediction of the generation probability of the biasing words. Systems were evaluated on the Librispeech corpus using simulated biasing tasks, and on the AMI corpus by proposing a novel visual-grounded contextual ASR pipeline that extracts biasing words from slides alongside each meeting. Results showed that TCPGen with GNN encodings achieved about a further 15% relative WER reduction on the biasing words compared to the original TCPGen, with a negligible increase in the computation cost for decoding."
Improving Low-Resource Speech Recognition with Pretrained Speech Models: Continued Pretraining vs. Semi-Supervised Training,"Self-supervised Transformer based models, such as wav2vec 2.0 and HuBERT, have produced significant improvements over existing approaches to automatic speech recognition (ASR). This is evident in the performance of the wav2vec 2.0 based pretrained XLSR-53 model across many languages when fine-tuned with available labeled data. However, the performance from finetuning these models can be dependent on the amount of in-language or similar-to-in-language data included in the pretraining dataset. In this paper we investigate continued pretraining (CoPT) with unlabeled in-language audio data on the XLSR-53 pretrained model in several low-resource languages. CoPT is more computationally efficient than semi-supervised training (SST), the standard approach of utilizing unlabeled data in ASR, since it omits the need for pseudo-labeling of the unlabeled data. We show CoPT results in word error rates (WERs), equal to or slightly better than using SST. In addition, we show that using the CoPT model for pseudo-labeling, and using these labels in SST, results in further improvements in WER."
Sub-8-Bit Quantization Aware Training for 8-Bit Neural Network Accelerator with On-Device Speech Recognition,"We present a novel sub-8-bit quantization-aware training (S8BQAT) scheme for 8-bit neural network accelerators. Our method is inspired from Lloyd-Max compression theory with practical adaptations for a feasible computational overhead during training. With the quantization centroids derived from a 32-bit baseline, we augment training loss with a Multi-Regional Absolute Cosine (MRACos) regularizer that aggregates weights towards their nearest centroid, effectively acting as a pseudo compressor. Additionally, a periodically invoked hard compressor is introduced to improve the convergence rate by emulating runtime model weight quantization. We apply S8BQAT on speech recognition tasks using Recurrent Neural NetworkTransducer (RNN-T) architecture. With S8BQAT, we are able to increase the model parameter size to reduce the word error rate by 4-16% relatively, while still improving latency by 5%."
FeaRLESS: Feature Refinement Loss for Ensembling Self-Supervised Learning Features in Robust End-to-end Speech Recognition,"Self-supervised learning representations (SSLR) have resulted in robust features for downstream tasks in many fields. Recently, several SSLRs have shown promising results on automatic speech recognition (ASR) benchmark corpora. However, previous studies have only shown performance for solitary SSLRs as an input feature for ASR models. In this study, we propose to investigate the effectiveness of diverse SSLR combinations using various fusion methods within end-to-end (E2E) ASR models. In addition, we will show there are correlations between these extracted SSLRs. As such, we further propose a feature refinement loss for decorrelation to efficiently combine the set of input features. For evaluation, we show that the proposed 'FeaRLESS learning features' perform better than systems without the proposed feature refinement loss for both the WSJ and Fearless Steps Challenge (FSC) corpora."
Language-specific Characteristic Assistance for Code-switching Speech Recognition,"Dual-encoder structure successfully utilizes two language-specific encoders (LSEs) for code-switching speech recognition. Because LSEs are initialized by two pre-trained language-specific models (LSMs), the dual-encoder structure can exploit sufficient monolingual data and capture the individual language attributes. However, most existing methods have no language constraints on LSEs and underutilize language-specific knowledge of LSMs. In this paper, we propose a language-specific characteristic assistance (LSCA) method to mitigate the above problems. Specifically, during training, we introduce two language-specific losses as language constraints and generate corresponding language-specific targets for them. During decoding, we take the decoding abilities of LSMs into account by combining the output probabilities of two LSMs and the mixture model to obtain the final predictions. Experiments show that either the training or decoding method of LSCA can improve the model's performance. Furthermore, the best result can obtain up to 15.4% relative error reduction on the code-switching test set by combining the training and decoding methods of LSCA. Moreover, the system can process code-switching speech recognition tasks well without extra shared parameters or even retraining based on two pre-trained LSMs by using our method."
Bengali Common Voice Speech Dataset for Automatic Speech Recognition,"Bengali is one of the most spoken languages in the world with over 300 million speakers globally. Despite its popularity, research into the development of Bengali speech recognition systems is hindered due to the lack of diverse open-source datasets. As a way forward, we have crowdsourced the Bengali Common Voice Speech Dataset, which is a sentence-level automatic speech recognition corpus. Collected on the Mozilla Common Voice platform, the dataset is part of an ongoing campaign that has led to the collection of over 400 hours of data in 2 months and is growing rapidly. Our analysis shows that this dataset has more speaker, phoneme, and environmental diversity compared to the OpenSLR Bengali ASR dataset, the largest existing open-source Bengali speech dataset. We present insights obtained from the dataset and discuss key linguistic challenges that need to be addressed in future versions. Additionally, we report the current performance of a few Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) algorithms and set a benchmark for future research."
Exploring linguistic feature and model combination for speech recognition based automatic AD detection,"Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial in facilitating preventive care and delay progression. Speech based automatic AD screening systems provide a non-intrusive and more scalable alternative to other clinical screening techniques. Scarcity of such specialist data leads to uncertainty in both model selection and feature learning when developing such systems. To this end, this paper investigates the use of feature and model combination approaches to improve the robustness of domain fine-tuning of BERT and Roberta pre-trained text encoders on limited data, before the resulting embedding features being fed into an ensemble of backend classifiers to produce the final AD detection decision via majority voting. Experiments conducted on the ADReSS20 Challenge dataset suggest consistent performance improvements were obtained using model and feature combination in system development. State-of-the-art AD detection accuracies of 91.67 percent and 93.75 percent were obtained using manual and ASR speech transcripts respectively on the ADReSS20 test set consisting of 48 elderly speakers."
Conformer Based Elderly Speech Recognition System for Alzheimer's Disease Detection,"Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial in facilitating preventive care to delay further progression. This paper presents the development of a state-of-the-art Conformer based speech recognition system built on the DementiaBank Pitt corpus for automatic AD detection. The baseline Conformer system trained with speed perturbation and SpecAugment based data augmentation is significantly improved by incorporating a set of purposefully designed modeling features, including neural architecture search based auto-configuration of domain-specific Conformer hyper-parameters in addition to parameter fine-tuning; fine-grained elderly speaker adaptation using learning hidden unit contributions (LHUC); and two-pass cross-system rescoring based combination with hybrid TDNN systems. An overall word error rate (WER) reduction of 13.6% absolute (34.8% relative) was obtained on the evaluation data of 48 elderly speakers. Using the final systems' recognition outputs to extract textual features, the best-published speech recognition based AD detection accuracy of 91.7% was obtained."
TALCS: An Open-Source Mandarin-English Code-Switching Corpus and a Speech Recognition Baseline,"This paper introduces a new corpus of Mandarin-English code-switching speech recognition--TALCS corpus, suitable for training and evaluating code-switching speech recognition systems. TALCS corpus is derived from real online one-to-one English teaching scenes in TAL education group, which contains roughly 587 hours of speech sampled at 16 kHz. To our best knowledge, TALCS corpus is the largest well labeled Mandarin-English code-switching open source automatic speech recognition (ASR) dataset in the world. In this paper, we will introduce the recording procedure in detail, including audio capturing devices and corpus environments. And the TALCS corpus is freely available for download under the permissive license1. Using TALCS corpus, we conduct ASR experiments in two popular speech recognition toolkits to make a baseline system, including ESPnet and Wenet. The Mixture Error Rate (MER) performance in the two speech recognition toolkits is compared in TALCS corpus. The experimental results implies that the quality of audio recordings and transcriptions are promising and the baseline system is workable."
SpeechEQ: Speech Emotion Recognition based on Multi-scale Unified Datasets and Multitask Learning,"Speech emotion recognition (SER) has many challenges, but one of the main challenges is that each framework does not have a unified standard. In this paper, we propose SpeechEQ, a framework for unifying SER tasks based on a multi-scale unified metric. This metric can be trained by Multitask Learning (MTL), which includes two emotion recognition tasks of Emotion States Category (EIS) and Emotion Intensity Scale (EIS), and two auxiliary tasks of phoneme recognition and gender recognition. For this framework, we build a Mandarin SER dataset - SpeechEQ Dataset (SEQD). We conducted experiments on the public CASIA and ESD datasets in Mandarin, which exhibit that our method outperforms baseline methods by a relatively large margin, yielding 8.0% and 6.5% improvement in accuracy respectively. Additional experiments on IEMOCAP with four emotion categories (i.e., angry, happy, sad, and neutral) also show the proposed method achieves a state-of-the-art of both weighted accuracy (WA) of 78.16% and unweighted accuracy (UA) of 77.47%."
On Comparison of Encoders for Attention based End to End Speech Recognition in Standalone and Rescoring Mode,"The streaming automatic speech recognition (ASR) models are more popular and suitable for voice-based applications. However, non-streaming models provide better performance as they look at the entire audio context. To leverage the benefits of the non-streaming model in streaming applications like voice search, it is commonly used in second pass re-scoring mode. The candidate hypothesis generated using steaming models is re-scored using a non-streaming model. In this work, we evaluate the non-streaming attention-based end-to-end ASR models on the Flipkart voice search task in both standalone and re-scoring modes. These models are based on Listen-Attend-Spell (LAS) encoder-decoder architecture. We experiment with different encoder variations based on LSTM, Transformer, and Conformer. We compare the latency requirements of these models along with their performance. Overall we show that the Transformer model offers acceptable WER with the lowest latency requirements. We report a relative WER improvement of around 16% with the second pass LAS re-scoring with latency overhead under 5ms. We also highlight the importance of CNN front-end with Transformer architecture to achieve comparable word error rates (WER). Moreover, we observe that in the second pass re-scoring mode all the encoders provide similar benefits whereas the difference in performance is prominent in standalone text generation mode."
TEVR: Improving Speech Recognition by Token Entropy Variance Reduction,"This paper presents TEVR, a speech recognition model designed to minimize the variation in token entropy w.r.t. to the language model. This takes advantage of the fact that if the language model will reliably and accurately predict a token anyway, then the acoustic model doesn't need to be accurate in recognizing it. We train German ASR models with 900 million parameters and show that on CommonVoice German, TEVR scores a very competitive 3.64% word error rate, which outperforms the best reported results by a relative 16.89% reduction in word error rate. We hope that releasing our fully trained speech recognition pipeline to the community will lead to privacy-preserving offline virtual assistants in the future."
Predicting within and across language phoneme recognition performance of self-supervised learning speech pre-trained models,"In this work, we analyzed and compared speech representations extracted from different frozen self-supervised learning (SSL) speech pre-trained models on their ability to capture articulatory features (AF) information and their subsequent prediction of phone recognition performance for within and across language scenarios. Specifically, we compared CPC, wav2vec 2.0, and HuBert. First, frame-level AF probing tasks were implemented. Subsequently, phone-level end-to-end ASR systems for phoneme recognition tasks were implemented, and the performance on the frame-level AF probing task and the phone accuracy were correlated. Compared to the conventional speech representation MFCC, all SSL pre-trained speech representations captured more AF information, and achieved better phoneme recognition performance within and across languages, with HuBert performing best. The frame-level AF probing task is a good predictor of phoneme recognition performance, showing the importance of capturing AF information in the speech representations. Compared with MFCC, in the within-language scenario, the performance of these SSL speech pre-trained models on AF probing tasks achieved a maximum relative increase of 34.4%, and it resulted in the lowest PER of 10.2%. In the cross-language scenario, the maximum relative increase of 26.7% also resulted in the lowest PER of 23.0%."
Confidence Score Based Conformer Speaker Adaptation for Speech Recognition,"A key challenge for automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems is to model the speaker level variability. In this paper, compact speaker dependent learning hidden unit contributions (LHUC) are used to facilitate both speaker adaptive training (SAT) and test time unsupervised speaker adaptation for state-of-the-art Conformer based end-to-end ASR systems. The sensitivity during adaptation to supervision error rate is reduced using confidence score based selection of the more ""trustworthy"" subset of speaker specific data. A confidence estimation module is used to smooth the over-confident Conformer decoder output probabilities before serving as confidence scores. The increased data sparsity due to speaker level data selection is addressed using Bayesian estimation of LHUC parameters. Experiments on the 300-hour Switchboard corpus suggest that the proposed LHUC-SAT Conformer with confidence score based test time unsupervised adaptation outperformed the baseline speaker independent and i-vector adapted Conformer systems by up to 1.0%, 1.0%, and 1.2% absolute (9.0%, 7.9%, and 8.9% relative) word error rate (WER) reductions on the NIST Hub5'00, RT02, and RT03 evaluation sets respectively. Consistent performance improvements were retained after external Transformer and LSTM language models were used for rescoring."
Analysis of Self-Supervised Learning and Dimensionality Reduction Methods in Clustering-Based Active Learning for Speech Emotion Recognition,"When domain experts are needed to perform data annotation for complex machine-learning tasks, reducing annotation effort is crucial in order to cut down time and expenses. For cases when there are no annotations available, one approach is to utilize the structure of the feature space for clustering-based active learning (AL) methods. However, these methods are heavily dependent on how the samples are organized in the feature space and what distance metric is used. Unsupervised methods such as contrastive predictive coding (CPC) can potentially be used to learn organized feature spaces, but these methods typically create high-dimensional features which might be challenging for estimating data density. In this paper, we combine CPC and multiple dimensionality reduction methods in search of functioning practices for clustering-based AL. Our experiments for simulating speech emotion recognition system deployment show that both the local and global topology of the feature space can be successfully used for AL, and that CPC can be used to improve clustering-based AL performance over traditional signal features. Additionally, we observe that compressing data dimensionality does not harm AL performance substantially, and that 2-D feature representations achieved similar AL performance as higher-dimensional representations when the number of annotations is not very low."
The Makerere Radio Speech Corpus: A Luganda Radio Corpus for Automatic Speech Recognition,"Building a usable radio monitoring automatic speech recognition (ASR) system is a challenging task for under-resourced languages and yet this is paramount in societies where radio is the main medium of public communication and discussions. Initial efforts by the United Nations in Uganda have proved how understanding the perceptions of rural people who are excluded from social media is important in national planning. However, these efforts are being challenged by the absence of transcribed speech datasets. In this paper, The Makerere Artificial Intelligence research lab releases a Luganda radio speech corpus of 155 hours. To our knowledge, this is the first publicly available radio dataset in sub-Saharan Africa. The paper describes the development of the voice corpus and presents baseline Luganda ASR performance results using Coqui STT toolkit, an open source speech recognition toolkit."
Boosting Cross-Domain Speech Recognition with Self-Supervision,"The cross-domain performance of automatic speech recognition (ASR) could be severely hampered due to the mismatch between training and testing distributions. Since the target domain usually lacks labeled data, and domain shifts exist at acoustic and linguistic levels, it is challenging to perform unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for ASR. Previous work has shown that self-supervised learning (SSL) or pseudo-labeling (PL) is effective in UDA by exploiting the self-supervisions of unlabeled data. However, these self-supervisions also face performance degradation in mismatched domain distributions, which previous work fails to address. This work presents a systematic UDA framework to fully utilize the unlabeled data with self-supervision in the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm. On the one hand, we apply continued pre-training and data replay techniques to mitigate the domain mismatch of the SSL pre-trained model. On the other hand, we propose a domain-adaptive fine-tuning approach based on the PL technique with three unique modifications: Firstly, we design a dual-branch PL method to decrease the sensitivity to the erroneous pseudo-labels; Secondly, we devise an uncertainty-aware confidence filtering strategy to improve pseudo-label correctness; Thirdly, we introduce a two-step PL approach to incorporate target domain linguistic knowledge, thus generating more accurate target domain pseudo-labels. Experimental results on various cross-domain scenarios demonstrate that the proposed approach could effectively boost the cross-domain performance and significantly outperform previous approaches."
Paraformer: Fast and Accurate Parallel Transformer for Non-autoregressive End-to-End Speech Recognition,"Transformers have recently dominated the ASR field. Although able to yield good performance, they involve an autoregressive (AR) decoder to generate tokens one by one, which is computationally inefficient. To speed up inference, non-autoregressive (NAR) methods, e.g. single-step NAR, were designed, to enable parallel generation. However, due to an independence assumption within the output tokens, performance of single-step NAR is inferior to that of AR models, especially with a large-scale corpus. There are two challenges to improving single-step NAR: Firstly to accurately predict the number of output tokens and extract hidden variables; secondly, to enhance modeling of interdependence between output tokens. To tackle both challenges, we propose a fast and accurate parallel transformer, termed Paraformer. This utilizes a continuous integrate-and-fire based predictor to predict the number of tokens and generate hidden variables. A glancing language model (GLM) sampler then generates semantic embeddings to enhance the NAR decoder's ability to model context interdependence. Finally, we design a strategy to generate negative samples for minimum word error rate training to further improve performance. Experiments using the public AISHELL-1, AISHELL-2 benchmark, and an industrial-level 20,000 hour task demonstrate that the proposed Paraformer can attain comparable performance to the state-of-the-art AR transformer, with more than 10x speedup."
Censer: Curriculum Semi-supervised Learning for Speech Recognition Based on Self-supervised Pre-training,"Recent studies have shown that the benefits provided by self-supervised pre-training and self-training (pseudo-labeling) are complementary. Semi-supervised fine-tuning strategies under the pre-training framework, however, remain insufficiently studied. Besides, modern semi-supervised speech recognition algorithms either treat unlabeled data indiscriminately or filter out noisy samples with a confidence threshold. The dissimilarities among different unlabeled data are often ignored. In this paper, we propose Censer, a semi-supervised speech recognition algorithm based on self-supervised pre-training to maximize the utilization of unlabeled data. The pre-training stage of Censer adopts wav2vec2.0 and the fine-tuning stage employs an improved semi-supervised learning algorithm from slimIPL, which leverages unlabeled data progressively according to their pseudo labels' qualities. We also incorporate a temporal pseudo label pool and an exponential moving average to control the pseudo labels' update frequency and to avoid model divergence. Experimental results on Libri-Light and LibriSpeech datasets manifest our proposed method achieves better performance compared to existing approaches while being more unified."
AVATAR: Unconstrained Audiovisual Speech Recognition,"Audio-visual automatic speech recognition (AV-ASR) is an extension of ASR that incorporates visual cues, often from the movements of a speaker's mouth. Unlike works that simply focus on the lip motion, we investigate the contribution of entire visual frames (visual actions, objects, background etc.). This is particularly useful for unconstrained videos, where the speaker is not necessarily visible. To solve this task, we propose a new sequence-to-sequence AudioVisual ASR TrAnsformeR (AVATAR) which is trained end-to-end from spectrograms and full-frame RGB. To prevent the audio stream from dominating training, we propose different word-masking strategies, thereby encouraging our model to pay attention to the visual stream. We demonstrate the contribution of the visual modality on the How2 AV-ASR benchmark, especially in the presence of simulated noise, and show that our model outperforms all other prior work by a large margin. Finally, we also create a new, real-world test bed for AV-ASR called VisSpeech, which demonstrates the contribution of the visual modality under challenging audio conditions."
Transformer-based Automatic Speech Recognition of Formal and Colloquial Czech in MALACH Project,"Czech is a very specific language due to its large differences between the formal and the colloquial form of speech. While the formal (written) form is used mainly in official documents, literature, and public speeches, the colloquial (spoken) form is used widely among people in casual speeches. This gap introduces serious problems for ASR systems, especially when training or evaluating ASR models on datasets containing a lot of colloquial speech, such as the MALACH project. In this paper, we are addressing this problem in the light of a new paradigm in end-to-end ASR systems -- recently introduced self-supervised audio Transformers. Specifically, we are investigating the influence of colloquial speech on the performance of Wav2Vec 2.0 models and their ability to transcribe colloquial speech directly into formal transcripts. We are presenting results with both formal and colloquial forms in the training transcripts, language models, and evaluation transcripts."
Exploring Capabilities of Monolingual Audio Transformers using Large Datasets in Automatic Speech Recognition of Czech,"In this paper, we present our progress in pretraining Czech monolingual audio transformers from a large dataset containing more than 80 thousand hours of unlabeled speech, and subsequently fine-tuning the model on automatic speech recognition tasks using a combination of in-domain data and almost 6 thousand hours of out-of-domain transcribed speech. We are presenting a large palette of experiments with various fine-tuning setups evaluated on two public datasets (CommonVoice and VoxPopuli) and one extremely challenging dataset from the MALACH project. Our results show that monolingual Wav2Vec 2.0 models are robust ASR systems, which can take advantage of large labeled and unlabeled datasets and successfully compete with state-of-the-art LVCSR systems. Moreover, Wav2Vec models proved to be good zero-shot learners when no training data are available for the target ASR task."
Residual Language Model for End-to-end Speech Recognition,"End-to-end automatic speech recognition suffers from adaptation to unknown target domain speech despite being trained with a large amount of paired audio--text data. Recent studies estimate a linguistic bias of the model as the internal language model (LM). To effectively adapt to the target domain, the internal LM is subtracted from the posterior during inference and fused with an external target-domain LM. However, this fusion complicates the inference and the estimation of the internal LM may not always be accurate. In this paper, we propose a simple external LM fusion method for domain adaptation, which considers the internal LM estimation in its training. We directly model the residual factor of the external and internal LMs, namely the residual LM. To stably train the residual LM, we propose smoothing the estimated internal LM and optimizing it with a combination of cross-entropy and mean-squared-error losses, which consider the statistical behaviors of the internal LM in the target domain data. We experimentally confirmed that the proposed residual LM performs better than the internal LM estimation in most of the cross-domain and intra-domain scenarios."
Exploiting Cross-domain And Cross-Lingual Ultrasound Tongue Imaging Features For Elderly And Dysarthric Speech Recognition,"Articulatory features are inherently invariant to acoustic signal distortion and have been successfully incorporated into automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems designed for normal speech. Their practical application to atypical task domains such as elderly and disordered speech across languages is often limited by the difficulty in collecting such specialist data from target speakers. This paper presents a cross-domain and cross-lingual A2A inversion approach that utilizes the parallel audio and ultrasound tongue imaging (UTI) data of the 24-hour TaL corpus in A2A model pre-training before being cross-domain and cross-lingual adapted to three datasets across two languages: the English DementiaBank Pitt and Cantonese JCCOCC MoCA elderly speech corpora; and the English TORGO dysarthric speech data, to produce UTI based articulatory features. Experiments conducted on three tasks suggested incorporating the generated articulatory features consistently outperformed the baseline TDNN and Conformer ASR systems constructed using acoustic features only by statistically significant word or character error rate reductions up to 4.75%, 2.59% and 2.07% absolute (14.69%, 10.64% and 22.72% relative) after data augmentation, speaker adaptation and cross system multi-pass decoding were applied."
Investigation of Ensemble features of Self-Supervised Pretrained Models for Automatic Speech Recognition,"Self-supervised learning (SSL) based models have been shown to generate powerful representations that can be used to improve the performance of downstream speech tasks. Several state-of-the-art SSL models are available, and each of these models optimizes a different loss which gives rise to the possibility of their features being complementary. This paper proposes using an ensemble of such SSL representations and models, which exploits the complementary nature of the features extracted by the various pretrained models. We hypothesize that this results in a richer feature representation and shows results for the ASR downstream task. To this end, we use three SSL models that have shown excellent results on ASR tasks, namely HuBERT, Wav2vec2.0, and WaveLM. We explore the ensemble of models fine-tuned for the ASR task and the ensemble of features using the embeddings obtained from the pre-trained models for a downstream ASR task. We get improved performance over individual models and pre-trained features using Librispeech(100h) and WSJ dataset for the downstream tasks."
FedNST: Federated Noisy Student Training for Automatic Speech Recognition,"Federated Learning (FL) enables training state-of-the-art Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models on user devices (clients) in distributed systems, hence preventing transmission of raw user data to a central server. A key challenge facing practical adoption of FL for ASR is obtaining ground-truth labels on the clients. Existing approaches rely on clients to manually transcribe their speech, which is impractical for obtaining large training corpora. A promising alternative is using semi-/self-supervised learning approaches to leverage unlabelled user data. To this end, we propose FedNST, a novel method for training distributed ASR models using private and unlabelled user data. We explore various facets of FedNST, such as training models with different proportions of labelled and unlabelled data, and evaluate the proposed approach on 1173 simulated clients. Evaluating FedNST on LibriSpeech, where 960 hours of speech data is split equally into server (labelled) and client (unlabelled) data, showed a 22.5% relative word error rate reduction} (WERR) over a supervised baseline trained only on server data."
Squeezeformer: An Efficient Transformer for Automatic Speech Recognition,"The recently proposed Conformer model has become the de facto backbone model for various downstream speech tasks based on its hybrid attention-convolution architecture that captures both local and global features. However, through a series of systematic studies, we find that the Conformer architecture's design choices are not optimal. After re-examining the design choices for both the macro and micro-architecture of Conformer, we propose Squeezeformer which consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art ASR models under the same training schemes. In particular, for the macro-architecture, Squeezeformer incorporates (i) the Temporal U-Net structure which reduces the cost of the multi-head attention modules on long sequences, and (ii) a simpler block structure of multi-head attention or convolution modules followed up by feed-forward module instead of the Macaron structure proposed in Conformer. Furthermore, for the micro-architecture, Squeezeformer (i) simplifies the activations in the convolutional block, (ii) removes redundant Layer Normalization operations, and (iii) incorporates an efficient depthwise down-sampling layer to efficiently sub-sample the input signal. Squeezeformer achieves state-of-the-art results of 7.5%, 6.5%, and 6.0% word-error-rate (WER) on LibriSpeech test-other without external language models, which are 3.1%, 1.4%, and 0.6% better than Conformer-CTC with the same number of FLOPs. Our code is open-sourced and available online."
Speaker Identification using Speech Recognition,"The audio data is increasing day by day throughout the globe with the increase of telephonic conversations, video conferences and voice messages. This research provides a mechanism for identifying a speaker in an audio file, based on the human voice biometric features like pitch, amplitude, frequency etc. We proposed an unsupervised learning model where the model can learn speech representation with limited dataset. Librispeech dataset was used in this research and we were able to achieve word error rate of 1.8."
Adaptive Activation Network For Low Resource Multilingual Speech Recognition,"Low resource automatic speech recognition (ASR) is a useful but thorny task, since deep learning ASR models usually need huge amounts of training data. The existing models mostly established a bottleneck (BN) layer by pre-training on a large source language, and transferring to the low resource target language. In this work, we introduced an adaptive activation network to the upper layers of ASR model, and applied different activation functions to different languages. We also proposed two approaches to train the model: (1) cross-lingual learning, replacing the activation function from source language to target language, (2) multilingual learning, jointly training the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss of each language and the relevance of different languages. Our experiments on IARPA Babel datasets demonstrated that our approaches outperform the from-scratch training and traditional bottleneck feature based methods. In addition, combining the cross-lingual learning and multilingual learning together could further improve the performance of multilingual speech recognition."
Contrastive Siamese Network for Semi-supervised Speech Recognition,"This paper introduces contrastive siamese (c-siam) network, an architecture for leveraging unlabeled acoustic data in speech recognition. c-siam is the first network that extracts high-level linguistic information from speech by matching outputs of two identical transformer encoders. It contains augmented and target branches which are trained by: (1) masking inputs and matching outputs with a contrastive loss, (2) incorporating a stop gradient operation on the target branch, (3) using an extra learnable transformation on the augmented branch, (4) introducing new temporal augment functions to prevent the shortcut learning problem. We use the Libri-light 60k unsupervised data and the LibriSpeech 100hrs/960hrs supervised data to compare c-siam and other best-performing systems. Our experiments show that c-siam provides 20% relative word error rate improvement over wav2vec baselines. A c-siam network with 450M parameters achieves competitive results compared to the state-of-the-art networks with 600M parameters."
Global Normalization for Streaming Speech Recognition in a Modular Framework,"We introduce the Globally Normalized Autoregressive Transducer (GNAT) for addressing the label bias problem in streaming speech recognition. Our solution admits a tractable exact computation of the denominator for the sequence-level normalization. Through theoretical and empirical results, we demonstrate that by switching to a globally normalized model, the word error rate gap between streaming and non-streaming speech-recognition models can be greatly reduced (by more than 50\% on the Librispeech dataset). This model is developed in a modular framework which encompasses all the common neural speech recognition models. The modularity of this framework enables controlled comparison of modelling choices and creation of new models."
Contextual Adapters for Personalized Speech Recognition in Neural Transducers,"Personal rare word recognition in end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (E2E ASR) models is a challenge due to the lack of training data. A standard way to address this issue is with shallow fusion methods at inference time. However, due to their dependence on external language models and the deterministic approach to weight boosting, their performance is limited. In this paper, we propose training neural contextual adapters for personalization in neural transducer based ASR models. Our approach can not only bias towards user-defined words, but also has the flexibility to work with pretrained ASR models. Using an in-house dataset, we demonstrate that contextual adapters can be applied to any general purpose pretrained ASR model to improve personalization. Our method outperforms shallow fusion, while retaining functionality of the pretrained models by not altering any of the model weights. We further show that the adapter style training is superior to full-fine-tuning of the ASR models on datasets with user-defined content."
Heterogeneous Reservoir Computing Models for Persian Speech Recognition,"Over the last decade, deep-learning methods have been gradually incorporated into conventional automatic speech recognition (ASR) frameworks to create acoustic, pronunciation, and language models. Although it led to significant improvements in ASRs' recognition accuracy, due to their hard constraints related to hardware requirements (e.g., computing power and memory usage), it is unclear if such approaches are the most computationally- and energy-efficient options for embedded ASR applications. Reservoir computing (RC) models (e.g., echo state networks (ESNs) and liquid state machines (LSMs)), on the other hand, have been proven inexpensive to train, have vastly fewer parameters, and are compatible with emergent hardware technologies. However, their performance in speech processing tasks is relatively inferior to that of the deep-learning-based models. To enhance the accuracy of the RC in ASR applications, we propose heterogeneous single and multi-layer ESNs to create non-linear transformations of the inputs that capture temporal context at different scales. To test our models, we performed a speech recognition task on the Farsdat Persian dataset. Since, to the best of our knowledge, standard RC has not yet been employed to conduct any Persian ASR tasks, we also trained conventional single-layer and deep ESNs to provide baselines for comparison. Besides, we compared the RC performance with a standard long-short-term memory (LSTM) model. Heterogeneous RC models (1) show improved performance to the standard RC models; (2) perform on par in terms of recognition accuracy with the LSTM, and (3) reduce the training time considerably."
Adaptive multilingual speech recognition with pretrained models,"Multilingual speech recognition with supervised learning has achieved great results as reflected in recent research. With the development of pretraining methods on audio and text data, it is imperative to transfer the knowledge from unsupervised multilingual models to facilitate recognition, especially in many languages with limited data. Our work investigated the effectiveness of using two pretrained models for two modalities: wav2vec 2.0 for audio and MBART50 for text, together with the adaptive weight techniques to massively improve the recognition quality on the public datasets containing CommonVoice and Europarl. Overall, we noticed an 44% improvement over purely supervised learning, and more importantly, each technique provides a different reinforcement in different languages. We also explore other possibilities to potentially obtain the best model by slightly adding either depth or relative attention to the architecture."
Multi-Level Modeling Units for End-to-End Mandarin Speech Recognition,"The choice of modeling units is crucial for automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks. In mandarin scenarios, the Chinese characters represent meaning but are not directly related to the pronunciation. Thus only considering the writing of Chinese characters as modeling units is insufficient to capture speech features. In this paper, we present a novel method involves with multi-level modeling units, which integrates multi-level information for mandarin speech recognition. Specifically, the encoder block considers syllables as modeling units and the decoder block deals with character-level modeling units. To facilitate the incremental conversion from syllable features to character features, we design an auxiliary task that applies cross-entropy (CE) loss to intermediate decoder layers. During inference, the input feature sequences are converted into syllable sequences by the encoder block and then converted into Chinese characters by the decoder block. Experiments on the widely used AISHELL-1 corpus demonstrate that our method achieves promising results with CER of 4.1%/4.6% and 4.6%/5.2%, using the Conformer and the Transformer backbones respectively."
Content-Context Factorized Representations for Automated Speech Recognition,"Deep neural networks have largely demonstrated their ability to perform automated speech recognition (ASR) by extracting meaningful features from input audio frames. Such features, however, may consist not only of information about the spoken language content, but also may contain information about unnecessary contexts such as background noise and sounds or speaker identity, accent, or protected attributes. Such information can directly harm generalization performance, by introducing spurious correlations between the spoken words and the context in which such words were spoken. In this work, we introduce an unsupervised, encoder-agnostic method for factoring speech-encoder representations into explicit content-encoding representations and spurious context-encoding representations. By doing so, we demonstrate improved performance on standard ASR benchmarks, as well as improved performance in both real-world and artificially noisy ASR scenarios."
Insights on Neural Representations for End-to-End Speech Recognition,"End-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) models aim to learn a generalised speech representation. However, there are limited tools available to understand the internal functions and the effect of hierarchical dependencies within the model architecture. It is crucial to understand the correlations between the layer-wise representations, to derive insights on the relationship between neural representations and performance.  Previous investigations of network similarities using correlation analysis techniques have not been explored for End-to-End ASR models. This paper analyses and explores the internal dynamics between layers during training with CNN, LSTM and Transformer based approaches using Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and centered kernel alignment (CKA) for the experiments. It was found that neural representations within CNN layers exhibit hierarchical correlation dependencies as layer depth increases but this is mostly limited to cases where neural representation correlates more closely. This behaviour is not observed in LSTM architecture, however there is a bottom-up pattern observed across the training process, while Transformer encoder layers exhibit irregular coefficiency correlation as neural depth increases. Altogether, these results provide new insights into the role that neural architectures have upon speech recognition performance. More specifically, these techniques can be used as indicators to build better performing speech recognition models."
Deploying self-supervised learning in the wild for hybrid automatic speech recognition,"Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods have proven to be very successful in automatic speech recognition (ASR). These great improvements have been reported mostly based on highly curated datasets such as LibriSpeech for non-streaming End-to-End ASR models. However, the pivotal characteristics of SSL is to be utilized for any untranscribed audio data. In this paper, we provide a full exploration on how to utilize uncurated audio data in SSL from data pre-processing to deploying an streaming hybrid ASR model. More specifically, we present (1) the effect of Audio Event Detection (AED) model in data pre-processing pipeline (2) analysis on choosing optimizer and learning rate scheduling (3) comparison of recently developed contrastive losses, (4) comparison of various pre-training strategies such as utilization of in-domain versus out-domain pre-training data, monolingual versus multilingual pre-training data, multi-head multilingual SSL versus single-head multilingual SSL and supervised pre-training versus SSL. The experimental results show that SSL pre-training with in-domain uncurated data can achieve better performance in comparison to all the alternative out-domain pre-training strategies."
Streaming Noise Context Aware Enhancement For Automatic Speech Recognition in Multi-Talker Environments,"One of the most challenging scenarios for smart speakers is multi-talker, when target speech from the desired speaker is mixed with interfering speech from one or more speakers. A smart assistant needs to determine which voice to recognize and which to ignore and it needs to do so in a streaming, low-latency manner. This work presents two multi-microphone speech enhancement algorithms targeted at this scenario. Targeting on-device use-cases, we assume that the algorithm has access to the signal before the hotword, which is referred to as the noise context. First is the Context Aware Beamformer which uses the noise context and detected hotword to determine how to target the desired speaker. The second is an adaptive noise cancellation algorithm called Speech Cleaner which trains a filter using the noise context. It is demonstrated that the two algorithms are complementary in the signal-to-noise ratio conditions under which they work well. We also propose an algorithm to select which one to use based on estimated SNR. When using 3 microphone channels, the final system achieves a relative word error rate reduction of 55% at -12dB, and 43\% at 12dB."
"Accented Speech Recognition: Benchmarking, Pre-training, and Diverse Data","Building inclusive speech recognition systems is a crucial step towards developing technologies that speakers of all language varieties can use. Therefore, ASR systems must work for everybody independently of the way they speak. To accomplish this goal, there should be available data sets representing language varieties, and also an understanding of model configuration that is the most helpful in achieving robust understanding of all types of speech. However, there are not enough data sets for accented speech, and for the ones that are already available, more training approaches need to be explored to improve the quality of accented speech recognition. In this paper, we discuss recent progress towards developing more inclusive ASR systems, namely, the importance of building new data sets representing linguistic diversity, and exploring novel training approaches to improve performance for all users. We address recent directions within benchmarking ASR systems for accented speech, measure the effects of wav2vec 2.0 pre-training on accented speech recognition, and highlight corpora relevant for diverse ASR evaluations."
Personalized Adversarial Data Augmentation for Dysarthric and Elderly Speech Recognition,"Despite the rapid progress of automatic speech recognition (ASR) technologies targeting normal speech, accurate recognition of dysarthric and elderly speech remains highly challenging tasks to date. It is difficult to collect large quantities of such data for ASR system development due to the mobility issues often found among these users. To this end, data augmentation techniques play a vital role. In contrast to existing data augmentation techniques only modifying the speaking rate or overall shape of spectral contour, fine-grained spectro-temporal differences between dysarthric, elderly and normal speech are modelled using a novel set of speaker dependent (SD) generative adversarial networks (GAN) based data augmentation approaches in this paper. These flexibly allow both: a) temporal or speed perturbed normal speech spectra to be modified and closer to those of an impaired speaker when parallel speech data is available; and b) for non-parallel data, the SVD decomposed normal speech spectral basis features to be transformed into those of a target elderly speaker before being re-composed with the temporal bases to produce the augmented data for state-of-the-art TDNN and Conformer ASR system training. Experiments are conducted on four tasks: the English UASpeech and TORGO dysarthric speech corpora; the English DementiaBank Pitt and Cantonese JCCOCC MoCA elderly speech datasets. The proposed GAN based data augmentation approaches consistently outperform the baseline speed perturbation method by up to 0.91% and 3.0% absolute (9.61% and 6.4% relative) WER reduction on the TORGO and DementiaBank data respectively. Consistent performance improvements are retained after applying LHUC based speaker adaptation."
Improved Meta Learning for Low Resource Speech Recognition,"We propose a new meta learning based framework for low resource speech recognition that improves the previous model agnostic meta learning (MAML) approach. The MAML is a simple yet powerful meta learning approach. However, the MAML presents some core deficiencies such as training instabilities and slower convergence speed. To address these issues, we adopt multi-step loss (MSL). The MSL aims to calculate losses at every step of the inner loop of MAML and then combines them with a weighted importance vector. The importance vector ensures that the loss at the last step has more importance than the previous steps. Our empirical evaluation shows that MSL significantly improves the stability of the training procedure and it thus also improves the accuracy of the overall system. Our proposed system outperforms MAML based low resource ASR system on various languages in terms of character error rates and stable training behavior."
A Closer Look at Audio-Visual Multi-Person Speech Recognition and Active Speaker Selection,"Audio-visual automatic speech recognition is a promising approach to robust ASR under noisy conditions. However, up until recently it had been traditionally studied in isolation assuming the video of a single speaking face matches the audio, and selecting the active speaker at inference time when multiple people are on screen was put aside as a separate problem. As an alternative, recent work has proposed to address the two problems simultaneously with an attention mechanism, baking the speaker selection problem directly into a fully differentiable model. One interesting finding was that the attention indirectly learns the association between the audio and the speaking face even though this correspondence is never explicitly provided at training time. In the present work we further investigate this connection and examine the interplay between the two problems. With experiments involving over 50 thousand hours of public YouTube videos as training data, we first evaluate the accuracy of the attention layer on an active speaker selection task. Secondly, we show under closer scrutiny that an end-to-end model performs at least as well as a considerably larger two-step system that utilizes a hard decision boundary under various noise conditions and number of parallel face tracks."
End-to-End Multi-Person Audio/Visual Automatic Speech Recognition,"Traditionally, audio-visual automatic speech recognition has been studied under the assumption that the speaking face on the visual signal is the face matching the audio. However, in a more realistic setting, when multiple faces are potentially on screen one needs to decide which face to feed to the A/V ASR system. The present work takes the recent progress of A/V ASR one step further and considers the scenario where multiple people are simultaneously on screen (multi-person A/V ASR). We propose a fully differentiable A/V ASR model that is able to handle multiple face tracks in a video. Instead of relying on two separate models for speaker face selection and audio-visual ASR on a single face track, we introduce an attention layer to the ASR encoder that is able to soft-select the appropriate face video track. Experiments carried out on an A/V system trained on over 30k hours of YouTube videos illustrate that the proposed approach can automatically select the proper face tracks with minor WER degradation compared to an oracle selection of the speaking face while still showing benefits of employing the visual signal instead of the audio alone."
Best of Both Worlds: Multi-task Audio-Visual Automatic Speech Recognition and Active Speaker Detection,"Under noisy conditions, automatic speech recognition (ASR) can greatly benefit from the addition of visual signals coming from a video of the speaker's face. However, when multiple candidate speakers are visible this traditionally requires solving a separate problem, namely active speaker detection (ASD), which entails selecting at each moment in time which of the visible faces corresponds to the audio. Recent work has shown that we can solve both problems simultaneously by employing an attention mechanism over the competing video tracks of the speakers' faces, at the cost of sacrificing some accuracy on active speaker detection. This work closes this gap in active speaker detection accuracy by presenting a single model that can be jointly trained with a multi-task loss. By combining the two tasks during training we reduce the ASD classification accuracy by approximately 25%, while simultaneously improving the ASR performance when compared to the multi-person baseline trained exclusively for ASR."
Separator-Transducer-Segmenter: Streaming Recognition and Segmentation of Multi-party Speech,"Streaming recognition and segmentation of multi-party conversations with overlapping speech is crucial for the next generation of voice assistant applications. In this work we address its challenges discovered in the previous work on multi-turn recurrent neural network transducer (MT-RNN-T) with a novel approach, separator-transducer-segmenter (STS), that enables tighter integration of speech separation, recognition and segmentation in a single model. First, we propose a new segmentation modeling strategy through start-of-turn and end-of-turn tokens that improves segmentation without recognition accuracy degradation. Second, we further improve both speech recognition and segmentation accuracy through an emission regularization method, FastEmit, and multi-task training with speech activity information as an additional training signal. Third, we experiment with end-of-turn emission latency penalty to improve end-point detection for each speaker turn. Finally, we establish a novel framework for segmentation analysis of multi-party conversations through emission latency metrics. With our best model, we report 4.6% abs. turn counting accuracy improvement and 17% rel. word error rate (WER) improvement on LibriCSS dataset compared to the previously published work."
Deep Learning Enabled Semantic Communications with Speech Recognition and Synthesis,"In this paper, we develop a deep learning based semantic communication system for speech transmission, named DeepSC-ST. We take the speech recognition and speech synthesis as the transmission tasks of the communication system, respectively. First, the speech recognition-related semantic features are extracted for transmission by a joint semantic-channel encoder and the text is recovered at the receiver based on the received semantic features, which significantly reduces the required amount of data transmission without performance degradation. Then, we perform speech synthesis at the receiver, which dedicates to re-generate the speech signals by feeding the recognized text and the speaker information into a neural network module. To enable the DeepSC-ST adaptive to dynamic channel environments, we identify a robust model to cope with different channel conditions. According to the simulation results, the proposed DeepSC-ST significantly outperforms conventional communication systems and existing DL-enabled communication systems, especially in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. A software demonstration is further developed as a proof-of-concept of the DeepSC-ST."
Speaker Reinforcement Using Target Source Extraction for Robust Automatic Speech Recognition,"Improving the accuracy of single-channel automatic speech recognition (ASR) in noisy conditions is challenging. Strong speech enhancement front-ends are available, however, they typically require that the ASR model is retrained to cope with the processing artifacts. In this paper we explore a speaker reinforcement strategy for improving recognition performance without retraining the acoustic model (AM). This is achieved by remixing the enhanced signal with the unprocessed input to alleviate the processing artifacts. We evaluate the proposed approach using a DNN speaker extraction based speech denoiser trained with a perceptually motivated loss function. Results show that (without AM retraining) our method yields about 23% and 25% relative accuracy gains compared with the unprocessed for the monoaural simulated and real CHiME-4 evaluation sets, respectively, and outperforms a state-of-the-art reference method."
A Highly Adaptive Acoustic Model for Accurate Multi-Dialect Speech Recognition,"Despite the success of deep learning in speech recognition, multi-dialect speech recognition remains a difficult problem. Although dialect-specific acoustic models are known to perform well in general, they are not easy to maintain when dialect-specific data is scarce and the number of dialects for each language is large. Therefore, a single unified acoustic model (AM) that generalizes well for many dialects has been in demand. In this paper, we propose a novel acoustic modeling technique for accurate multi-dialect speech recognition with a single AM. Our proposed AM is dynamically adapted based on both dialect information and its internal representation, which results in a highly adaptive AM for handling multiple dialects simultaneously. We also propose a simple but effective training method to deal with unseen dialects. The experimental results on large scale speech datasets show that the proposed AM outperforms all the previous ones, reducing word error rates (WERs) by 8.11% relative compared to a single all-dialects AM and by 7.31% relative compared to dialect-specific AMs."
On monoaural speech enhancement for automatic recognition of real noisy speech using mixture invariant training,"In this paper, we explore an improved framework to train a monoaural neural enhancement model for robust speech recognition. The designed training framework extends the existing mixture invariant training criterion to exploit both unpaired clean speech and real noisy data. It is found that the unpaired clean speech is crucial to improve quality of separated speech from real noisy speech. The proposed method also performs remixing of processed and unprocessed signals to alleviate the processing artifacts. Experiments on the single-channel CHiME-3 real test sets show that the proposed method improves significantly in terms of speech recognition performance over the enhancement system trained either on the mismatched simulated data in a supervised fashion or on the matched real data in an unsupervised fashion. Between 16% and 39% relative WER reduction has been achieved by the proposed system compared to the unprocessed signal using end-to-end and hybrid acoustic models without retraining on distorted data."
Emotion Recognition In Persian Speech Using Deep Neural Networks,"Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is of great importance in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), as it provides a deeper understanding of the situation and results in better interaction. In recent years, various machine learning and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms have been developed to improve SER techniques. Recognition of the spoken emotions depends on the type of expression that varies between different languages. In this paper, to further study important factors in the Farsi language, we examine various DL techniques on a Farsi/Persian dataset, Sharif Emotional Speech Database (ShEMO), which was released in 2018. Using signal features in low- and high-level descriptions and different deep neural networks and machine learning techniques, Unweighted Accuracy (UA) of 65.20% and Weighted Accuracy (WA) of 78.29% are achieved."
Improving Multimodal Speech Recognition by Data Augmentation and Speech Representations,"Multimodal speech recognition aims to improve the performance of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems by leveraging additional visual information that is usually associated to the audio input. While previous approaches make crucial use of strong visual representations, e.g. by finetuning pretrained image recognition networks, significantly less attention has been paid to its counterpart: the speech component. In this work, we investigate ways of improving the base speech recognition system by following similar techniques to the ones used for the visual encoder, namely, transferring representations and data augmentation. First, we show that starting from a pretrained ASR significantly improves the state-of-the-art performance; remarkably, even when building upon a strong unimodal system, we still find gains by including the visual modality. Second, we employ speech data augmentation techniques to encourage the multimodal system to attend to the visual stimuli. This technique replaces previously used word masking and comes with the benefits of being conceptually simpler and yielding consistent improvements in the multimodal setting. We provide empirical results on three multimodal datasets, including the newly introduced Localized Narratives."
Why does Self-Supervised Learning for Speech Recognition Benefit Speaker Recognition?,"Recently, self-supervised learning (SSL) has demonstrated strong performance in speaker recognition, even if the pre-training objective is designed for speech recognition. In this paper, we study which factor leads to the success of self-supervised learning on speaker-related tasks, e.g. speaker verification (SV), through a series of carefully designed experiments. Our empirical results on the Voxceleb-1 dataset suggest that the benefit of SSL to SV task is from a combination of mask speech prediction loss, data scale, and model size, while the SSL quantizer has a minor impact. We further employ the integrated gradients attribution method and loss landscape visualization to understand the effectiveness of self-supervised learning for speaker recognition performance."
Supervised Attention in Sequence-to-Sequence Models for Speech Recognition,"Attention mechanism in sequence-to-sequence models is designed to model the alignments between acoustic features and output tokens in speech recognition. However, attention weights produced by models trained end to end do not always correspond well with actual alignments, and several studies have further argued that attention weights might not even correspond well with the relevance attribution of frames. Regardless, visual similarity between attention weights and alignments is widely used during training as an indicator of the models quality. In this paper, we treat the correspondence between attention weights and alignments as a learning problem by imposing a supervised attention loss. Experiments have shown significant improved performance, suggesting that learning the alignments well during training critically determines the performance of sequence-to-sequence models."
Mask scalar prediction for improving robust automatic speech recognition,"Using neural network based acoustic frontends for improving robustness of streaming automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems is challenging because of the causality constraints and the resulting distortion that the frontend processing introduces in speech. Time-frequency masking based approaches have been shown to work well, but they need additional hyper-parameters to scale the mask to limit speech distortion. Such mask scalars are typically hand-tuned and chosen conservatively. In this work, we present a technique to predict mask scalars using an ASR-based loss in an end-to-end fashion, with minimal increase in the overall model size and complexity. We evaluate the approach on two robust ASR tasks: multichannel enhancement in the presence of speech and non-speech noise, and acoustic echo cancellation (AEC). Results show that the presented algorithm consistently improves word error rate (WER) without the need for any additional tuning over strong baselines that use hand-tuned hyper-parameters: up to 16% for multichannel enhancement in noisy conditions, and up to 7% for AEC."
Real-time Speech Emotion Recognition Based on Syllable-Level Feature Extraction,"Speech emotion recognition systems have high prediction latency because of the high computational requirements for deep learning models and low generalizability mainly because of the poor reliability of emotional measurements across multiple corpora. To solve these problems, we present a speech emotion recognition system based on a reductionist approach of decomposing and analyzing syllable-level features. Mel-spectrogram of an audio stream is decomposed into syllable-level components, which are then analyzed to extract statistical features. The proposed method uses formant attention, noise-gate filtering, and rolling normalization contexts to increase feature processing speed and tolerance to adversity. A set of syllable-level formant features is extracted and fed into a single hidden layer neural network that makes predictions for each syllable as opposed to the conventional approach of using a sophisticated deep learner to make sentence-wide predictions. The syllable level predictions help to achieve the real-time latency and lower the aggregated error in utterance level cross-corpus predictions. The experiments on IEMOCAP (IE), MSP-Improv (MI), and RAVDESS (RA) databases show that the method archives real-time latency while predicting with state-of-the-art cross-corpus unweighted accuracy of 47.6% for IE to MI and 56.2% for MI to IE."
Improved far-field speech recognition using Joint Variational Autoencoder,"Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems suffer considerably when source speech is corrupted with noise or room impulse responses (RIR). Typically, speech enhancement is applied in both mismatched and matched scenario training and testing. In matched setting, acoustic model (AM) is trained on dereverberated far-field features while in mismatched setting, AM is fixed. In recent past, mapping speech features from far-field to close-talk using denoising autoencoder (DA) has been explored. In this paper, we focus on matched scenario training and show that the proposed joint VAE based mapping achieves a significant improvement over DA. Specifically, we observe an absolute improvement of 2.5% in word error rate (WER) compared to DA based enhancement and 3.96% compared to AM trained directly on far-field filterbank features."
Efficient Training of Neural Transducer for Speech Recognition,"As one of the most popular sequence-to-sequence modeling approaches for speech recognition, the RNN-Transducer has achieved evolving performance with more and more sophisticated neural network models of growing size and increasing training epochs. While strong computation resources seem to be the prerequisite of training superior models, we try to overcome it by carefully designing a more efficient training pipeline. In this work, we propose an efficient 3-stage progressive training pipeline to build highly-performing neural transducer models from scratch with very limited computation resources in a reasonable short time period. The effectiveness of each stage is experimentally verified on both Librispeech and Switchboard corpora. The proposed pipeline is able to train transducer models approaching state-of-the-art performance with a single GPU in just 2-3 weeks. Our best conformer transducer achieves 4.1% WER on Librispeech test-other with only 35 epochs of training."
Layer-wise Fast Adaptation for End-to-End Multi-Accent Speech Recognition,"Accent variability has posed a huge challenge to automatic speech recognition~(ASR) modeling. Although one-hot accent vector based adaptation systems are commonly used, they require prior knowledge about the target accent and cannot handle unseen accents. Furthermore, simply concatenating accent embeddings does not make good use of accent knowledge, which has limited improvements. In this work, we aim to tackle these problems with a novel layer-wise adaptation structure injected into the E2E ASR model encoder. The adapter layer encodes an arbitrary accent in the accent space and assists the ASR model in recognizing accented speech. Given an utterance, the adaptation structure extracts the corresponding accent information and transforms the input acoustic feature into an accent-related feature through the linear combination of all accent bases. We further explore the injection position of the adaptation layer, the number of accent bases, and different types of accent bases to achieve better accent adaptation. Experimental results show that the proposed adaptation structure brings 12\% and 10\% relative word error rate~(WER) reduction on the AESRC2020 accent dataset and the Librispeech dataset, respectively, compared to the baseline."
Disappeared Command: Spoofing Attack On Automatic Speech Recognition Systems with Sound Masking,"The development of deep learning technology has greatly promoted the performance improvement of automatic speech recognition (ASR) technology, which has demonstrated an ability comparable to human hearing in many tasks. Voice interfaces are becoming more and more widely used as input for many applications and smart devices. However, existing research has shown that DNN is easily disturbed by slight disturbances and makes false recognition, which is extremely dangerous for intelligent voice applications controlled by voice."
An Investigation of Monotonic Transducers for Large-Scale Automatic Speech Recognition,"The two most popular loss functions for streaming end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) are RNN-Transducer (RNN-T) and connectionist temporal classification (CTC). Between these two loss types we can classify the monotonic RNN-T (MonoRNN-T) and the recently proposed CTC-like Transducer (CTC-T). Monotonic transducers have a few advantages. First, RNN-T can suffer from runaway hallucination, where a model keeps emitting non-blank symbols without advancing in time. Secondly, monotonic transducers consume exactly one model score per time step and are therefore more compatible with traditional FST-based ASR decoders. However, the MonoRNN-T so far has been found to have worse accuracy than RNN-T. It does not have to be that way: By regularizing the training via joint LAS training or parameter initialization from RNN-T, both MonoRNN-T and CTC-T perform as well or better than RNN-T. This is demonstrated for LibriSpeech and for a large-scale in-house data set."
Self Supervised Adversarial Domain Adaptation for Cross-Corpus and Cross-Language Speech Emotion Recognition,"Despite the recent advancement in speech emotion recognition (SER) within a single corpus setting, the performance of these SER systems degrades significantly for cross-corpus and cross-language scenarios. The key reason is the lack of generalisation in SER systems towards unseen conditions, which causes them to perform poorly in cross-corpus and cross-language settings. Recent studies focus on utilising adversarial methods to learn domain generalised representation for improving cross-corpus and cross-language SER to address this issue. However, many of these methods only focus on cross-corpus SER without addressing the cross-language SER performance degradation due to a larger domain gap between source and target language data. This contribution proposes an adversarial dual discriminator (ADDi) network that uses the three-players adversarial game to learn generalised representations without requiring any target data labels. We also introduce a self-supervised ADDi (sADDi) network that utilises self-supervised pre-training with unlabelled data. We propose synthetic data generation as a pretext task in sADDi, enabling the network to produce emotionally discriminative and domain invariant representations and providing complementary synthetic data to augment the system. The proposed model is rigorously evaluated using five publicly available datasets in three languages and compared with multiple studies on cross-corpus and cross-language SER. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves improved performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods."
"STRATA: Word Boundaries & Phoneme Recognition From Continuous Urdu Speech using Transfer Learning, Attention, & Data Augmentation","Phoneme recognition is a largely unsolved problem in NLP, especially for low-resource languages like Urdu. The systems that try to extract the phonemes from audio speech require hand-labeled phonetic transcriptions. This requires expert linguists to annotate speech data with its relevant phonetic representation which is both an expensive and a tedious task. In this paper, we propose STRATA, a framework for supervised phoneme recognition that overcomes the data scarcity issue for low resource languages using a seq2seq neural architecture integrated with transfer learning, attention mechanism, and data augmentation. STRATA employs transfer learning to reduce the network loss in half. It uses attention mechanism for word boundaries and frame alignment detection which further reduces the network loss by 4% and is able to identify the word boundaries with 92.2% accuracy. STRATA uses various data augmentation techniques to further reduce the loss by 1.5% and is more robust towards new signals both in terms of generalization and accuracy. STRATA is able to achieve a Phoneme Error Rate of 16.5% and improves upon the state of the art by 1.1% for TIMIT dataset (English) and 11.5% for CSaLT dataset (Urdu)."
HuBERT-EE: Early Exiting HuBERT for Efficient Speech Recognition,"Pre-training with self-supervised models, such as Hidden-unit BERT (HuBERT) and wav2vec 2.0, has brought significant improvements in automatic speech recognition (ASR). However, these models usually require an expensive computational cost to achieve outstanding performance, slowing down the inference speed. To improve the model efficiency, we propose an early exit scheme for ASR, namely HuBERT-EE, that allows the model to stop the inference dynamically. In HuBERT-EE, multiple early exit branches are added at the intermediate layers, and each branch is used to decide whether a prediction can be exited early. Experimental results on the LibriSpeech dataset show that HuBERT-EE can accelerate the inference of a large-scale HuBERT model while simultaneously balancing the trade-off between the word error rate (WER) performance and the latency."
Self-critical Sequence Training for Automatic Speech Recognition,"Although automatic speech recognition (ASR) task has gained remarkable success by sequence-to-sequence models, there are two main mismatches between its training and testing that might lead to performance degradation: 1) The typically used cross-entropy criterion aims to maximize log-likelihood of the training data, while the performance is evaluated by word error rate (WER), not log-likelihood; 2) The teacher-forcing method leads to the dependence on ground truth during training, which means that model has never been exposed to its own prediction before testing. In this paper, we propose an optimization method called self-critical sequence training (SCST) to make the training procedure much closer to the testing phase. As a reinforcement learning (RL) based method, SCST utilizes a customized reward function to associate the training criterion and WER. Furthermore, it removes the reliance on teacher-forcing and harmonizes the model with respect to its inference procedure. We conducted experiments on both clean and noisy speech datasets, and the results show that the proposed SCST respectively achieves 8.7% and 7.8% relative improvements over the baseline in terms of WER."
Speech Emotion Recognition with Global-Aware Fusion on Multi-scale Feature Representation,"Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is a fundamental task to predict the emotion label from speech data. Recent works mostly focus on using convolutional neural networks~(CNNs) to learn local attention map on fixed-scale feature representation by viewing time-varied spectral features as images. However, rich emotional feature at different scales and important global information are not able to be well captured due to the limits of existing CNNs for SER. In this paper, we propose a novel GLobal-Aware Multi-scale (GLAM) neural network (The code is available at https://github.com/lixiangucas01/GLAM) to learn multi-scale feature representation with global-aware fusion module to attend emotional information. Specifically, GLAM iteratively utilizes multiple convolutional kernels with different scales to learn multiple feature representation. Then, instead of using attention-based methods, a simple but effective global-aware fusion module is applied to grab most important emotional information globally. Experiments on the benchmark corpus IEMOCAP over four emotions demonstrates the superiority of our proposed model with 2.5% to 4.5% improvements on four common metrics compared to previous state-of-the-art approaches."
A Wav2vec2-Based Experimental Study on Self-Supervised Learning Methods to Improve Child Speech Recognition,"Despite recent advancements in deep learning technologies, Child Speech Recognition remains a challenging task. Current Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models require substantial amounts of annotated data for training, which is scarce. In this work, we explore using the ASR model, wav2vec2, with different pretraining and finetuning configurations for self-supervised learning (SSL) toward improving automatic child speech recognition. The pretrained wav2vec2 models were finetuned using different amounts of child speech training data, adult speech data, and a combination of both, to discover the optimum amount of data required to finetune the model for the task of child ASR. Our trained model achieves the best Word Error Rate (WER) of 7.42 on the MyST child speech dataset, 2.99 on the PFSTAR dataset and 12.47 on the CMU KIDS dataset as compared to any other previous methods. Our models outperformed the wav2vec2 BASE 960 on child speech which is considered a state-of-the-art ASR model on adult speech by just using 10 hours of child speech data in finetuning. The analysis of different types of training data and their effect on inference is also provided by using a combination of datasets in pretraining, finetuning and inference."
Unified Speech-Text Pre-training for Speech Translation and Recognition,"We describe a method to jointly pre-train speech and text in an encoder-decoder modeling framework for speech translation and recognition. The proposed method incorporates four self-supervised and supervised subtasks for cross modality learning. A self-supervised speech subtask leverages unlabelled speech data, and a (self-)supervised text to text subtask makes use of abundant text training data. Two auxiliary supervised speech tasks are included to unify speech and text modeling space. Our contribution lies in integrating linguistic information from the text corpus into the speech pre-training. Detailed analysis reveals learning interference among subtasks. Two pre-training configurations for speech translation and recognition, respectively, are presented to alleviate subtask interference. Our experiments show the proposed method can effectively fuse speech and text information into one model. It achieves between 1.7 and 2.3 BLEU improvement above the state of the art on the MuST-C speech translation dataset and comparable WERs to wav2vec 2.0 on the Librispeech speech recognition task."
Multistream neural architectures for cued-speech recognition using a pre-trained visual feature extractor and constrained CTC decoding,"This paper proposes a simple and effective approach for automatic recognition of Cued Speech (CS), a visual communication tool that helps people with hearing impairment to understand spoken language with the help of hand gestures that can uniquely identify the uttered phonemes in complement to lipreading. The proposed approach is based on a pre-trained hand and lips tracker used for visual feature extraction and a phonetic decoder based on a multistream recurrent neural network trained with connectionist temporal classification loss and combined with a pronunciation lexicon. The proposed system is evaluated on an updated version of the French CS dataset CSF18 for which the phonetic transcription has been manually checked and corrected. With a decoding accuracy at the phonetic level of 70.88%, the proposed system outperforms our previous CNN-HMM decoder and competes with more complex baselines."
Unsupervised Uncertainty Measures of Automatic Speech Recognition for Non-intrusive Speech Intelligibility Prediction,"Non-intrusive intelligibility prediction is important for its application in realistic scenarios, where a clean reference signal is difficult to access. The construction of many non-intrusive predictors require either ground truth intelligibility labels or clean reference signals for supervised learning. In this work, we leverage an unsupervised uncertainty estimation method for predicting speech intelligibility, which does not require intelligibility labels or reference signals to train the predictor. Our experiments demonstrate that the uncertainty from state-of-the-art end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) models is highly correlated with speech intelligibility. The proposed method is evaluated on two databases and the results show that the unsupervised uncertainty measures of ASR models are more correlated with speech intelligibility from listening results than the predictions made by widely used intrusive methods."
Auditory-Based Data Augmentation for End-to-End Automatic Speech Recognition,"End-to-end models have achieved significant improvement on automatic speech recognition. One common method to improve performance of these models is expanding the data-space through data augmentation. Meanwhile, human auditory inspired front-ends have also demonstrated improvement for automatic speech recognisers. In this work, a well-verified auditory-based model, which can simulate various hearing abilities, is investigated for the purpose of data augmentation for end-to-end speech recognition. By introducing the auditory model into the data augmentation process, end-to-end systems are encouraged to ignore variation from the signal that cannot be heard and thereby focus on robust features for speech recognition. Two mechanisms in the auditory model, spectral smearing and loudness recruitment, are studied on the LibriSpeech dataset with a transformer-based end-to-end model. The results show that the proposed augmentation methods can bring statistically significant improvement on the performance of the state-of-the-art SpecAugment."
Adding Connectionist Temporal Summarization into Conformer to Improve Its Decoder Efficiency For Speech Recognition,"The Conformer model is an excellent architecture for speech recognition modeling that effectively utilizes the hybrid losses of connectionist temporal classification (CTC) and attention to train model parameters. To improve the decoding efficiency of Conformer, we propose a novel connectionist temporal summarization (CTS) method that reduces the number of frames required for the attention decoder fed from the acoustic sequences generated by the encoder, thus reducing operations. However, to achieve such decoding improvements, we must fine-tune model parameters, as cross-attention observations are changed and thus require corresponding refinements. Our final experiments show that, with a beamwidth of 4, the LibriSpeech's decoding budget can be reduced by up to 20% and for FluentSpeech data it can be reduced by 11%, without losing ASR accuracy. An improvement in accuracy is even found for the LibriSpeech ""test-other"" set. The word error rate (WER) is reduced by 6\% relative at the beam width of 1 and by 3% relative at the beam width of 4."
Hierarchical Softmax for End-to-End Low-resource Multilingual Speech Recognition,"Low-resource speech recognition has been long-suffering from insufficient training data. In this paper, we propose an approach that leverages neighboring languages to improve low-resource scenario performance, founded on the hypothesis that similar linguistic units in neighboring languages exhibit comparable term frequency distributions, which enables us to construct a Huffman tree for performing multilingual hierarchical Softmax decoding. This hierarchical structure enables cross-lingual knowledge sharing among similar tokens, thereby enhancing low-resource training outcomes. Empirical analyses demonstrate that our method is effective in improving the accuracy and efficiency of low-resource speech recognition."
Defense against Adversarial Attacks on Hybrid Speech Recognition using Joint Adversarial Fine-tuning with Denoiser,"Adversarial attacks are a threat to automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems, and it becomes imperative to propose defenses to protect them. In this paper, we perform experiments to show that K2 conformer hybrid ASR is strongly affected by white-box adversarial attacks. We propose three defenses--denoiser pre-processor, adversarially fine-tuning ASR model, and adversarially fine-tuning joint model of ASR and denoiser. Our evaluation shows denoiser pre-processor (trained on offline adversarial examples) fails to defend against adaptive white-box attacks. However, adversarially fine-tuning the denoiser using a tandem model of denoiser and ASR offers more robustness. We evaluate two variants of this defense--one updating parameters of both models and the second keeping ASR frozen. The joint model offers a mean absolute decrease of 19.3\% ground truth (GT) WER with reference to baseline against fast gradient sign method (FGSM) attacks with different L_\infty norms. The joint model with frozen ASR parameters gives the best defense against projected gradient descent (PGD) with 7 iterations, yielding a mean absolute increase of 22.3\% GT WER with reference to baseline; and against PGD with 500 iterations, yielding a mean absolute decrease of 45.08\% GT WER and an increase of 68.05\% adversarial target WER."
Personal VAD 2.0: Optimizing Personal Voice Activity Detection for On-Device Speech Recognition,"Personalization of on-device speech recognition (ASR) has seen explosive growth in recent years, largely due to the increasing popularity of personal assistant features on mobile devices and smart home speakers. In this work, we present Personal VAD 2.0, a personalized voice activity detector that detects the voice activity of a target speaker, as part of a streaming on-device ASR system. Although previous proof-of-concept studies have validated the effectiveness of Personal VAD, there are still several critical challenges to address before this model can be used in production: first, the quality must be satisfactory in both enrollment and enrollment-less scenarios; second, it should operate in a streaming fashion; and finally, the model size should be small enough to fit a limited latency and CPU/Memory budget. To meet the multi-faceted requirements, we propose a series of novel designs: 1) advanced speaker embedding modulation methods; 2) a new training paradigm to generalize to enrollment-less conditions; 3) architecture and runtime optimizations for latency and resource restrictions. Extensive experiments on a realistic speech recognition system demonstrated the state-of-the-art performance of our proposed method."
Successes and critical failures of neural networks in capturing human-like speech recognition,"Natural and artificial audition can in principle acquire different solutions to a given problem. The constraints of the task, however, can nudge the cognitive science and engineering of audition to qualitatively converge, suggesting that a closer mutual examination would potentially enrich artificial hearing systems and process models of the mind and brain. Speech recognition - an area ripe for such exploration - is inherently robust in humans to a number transformations at various spectrotemporal granularities. To what extent are these robustness profiles accounted for by high-performing neural network systems? We bring together experiments in speech recognition under a single synthesis framework to evaluate state-of-the-art neural networks as stimulus-computable, optimized observers. In a series of experiments, we (1) clarify how influential speech manipulations in the literature relate to each other and to natural speech, (2) show the granularities at which machines exhibit out-of-distribution robustness, reproducing classical perceptual phenomena in humans, (3) identify the specific conditions where model predictions of human performance differ, and (4) demonstrate a crucial failure of all artificial systems to perceptually recover where humans do, suggesting alternative directions for theory and model building. These findings encourage a tighter synergy between the cognitive science and engineering of audition."
Emotional Speech Recognition with Pre-trained Deep Visual Models,"In this paper, we propose a new methodology for emotional speech recognition using visual deep neural network models. We employ the transfer learning capabilities of the pre-trained computer vision deep models to have a mandate for the emotion recognition in speech task. In order to achieve that, we propose to use a composite set of acoustic features and a procedure to convert them into images. Besides, we present a training paradigm for these models taking into consideration the different characteristics between acoustic-based images and regular ones. In our experiments, we use the pre-trained VGG-16 model and test the overall methodology on the Berlin EMO-DB dataset for speaker-independent emotion recognition. We evaluate the proposed model on the full list of the seven emotions and the results set a new state-of-the-art."
"3M: Multi-loss, Multi-path and Multi-level Neural Networks for speech recognition","Recently, Conformer based CTC/AED model has become a mainstream architecture for ASR. In this paper, based on our prior work, we identify and integrate several approaches to achieve further improvements for ASR tasks, which we denote as multi-loss, multi-path and multi-level, summarized as ""3M"" model. Specifically, multi-loss refers to the joint CTC/AED loss and multi-path denotes the Mixture-of-Experts(MoE) architecture which can effectively increase the model capacity without remarkably increasing computation cost. Multi-level means that we introduce auxiliary loss at multiple level of a deep model to help training. We evaluate our proposed method on the public WenetSpeech dataset and experimental results show that the proposed method provides 12.2%-17.6% relative CER improvement over the baseline model trained by Wenet toolkit. On our large scale dataset of 150k hours corpus, the 3M model has also shown obvious superiority over the baseline Conformer model. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/tencent-ailab/3m-asr."
User-Level Differential Privacy against Attribute Inference Attack of Speech Emotion Recognition in Federated Learning,"Many existing privacy-enhanced speech emotion recognition (SER) frameworks focus on perturbing the original speech data through adversarial training within a centralized machine learning setup. However, this privacy protection scheme can fail since the adversary can still access the perturbed data. In recent years, distributed learning algorithms, especially federated learning (FL), have gained popularity to protect privacy in machine learning applications. While FL provides good intuition to safeguard privacy by keeping the data on local devices, prior work has shown that privacy attacks, such as attribute inference attacks, are achievable for SER systems trained using FL. In this work, we propose to evaluate the user-level differential privacy (UDP) in mitigating the privacy leaks of the SER system in FL. UDP provides theoretical privacy guarantees with privacy parameters ε and δ. Our results show that the UDP can effectively decrease attribute information leakage while keeping the utility of the SER system with the adversary accessing one model update. However, the efficacy of the UDP suffers when the FL system leaks more model updates to the adversary. We make the code publicly available to reproduce the results in https://github.com/usc-sail/fed-ser-leakage."
Towards End-to-end Unsupervised Speech Recognition,"Unsupervised speech recognition has shown great potential to make Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems accessible to every language. However, existing methods still heavily rely on hand-crafted pre-processing. Similar to the trend of making supervised speech recognition end-to-end, we introduce wav2vec-U 2.0 which does away with all audio-side pre-processing and improves accuracy through better architecture. In addition, we introduce an auxiliary self-supervised objective that ties model predictions back to the input. Experiments show that wav2vec-U 2.0 improves unsupervised recognition results across different languages while being conceptually simpler."
Combining Spectral and Self-Supervised Features for Low Resource Speech Recognition and Translation,"Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) models have been successfully applied in various deep learning-based speech tasks, particularly those with a limited amount of data. However, the quality of SSL representations depends highly on the relatedness between the SSL training domain(s) and the target data domain. On the contrary, spectral feature (SF) extractors such as log Mel-filterbanks are hand-crafted non-learnable components, and could be more robust to domain shifts. The present work examines the assumption that combining non-learnable SF extractors to SSL models is an effective approach to low resource speech tasks. We propose a learnable and interpretable framework to combine SF and SSL representations. The proposed framework outperforms significantly both baseline and SSL models on Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Speech Translation (ST) tasks on three low resource datasets. We additionally design a mixture of experts based combination model. This last model reveals that the relative contribution of SSL models over conventional SF extractors is very small in case of domain mismatch between SSL training set and the target language data."
Hear No Evil: Towards Adversarial Robustness of Automatic Speech Recognition via Multi-Task Learning,"As automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems are now being widely deployed in the wild, the increasing threat of adversarial attacks raises serious questions about the security and reliability of using such systems. On the other hand, multi-task learning (MTL) has shown success in training models that can resist adversarial attacks in the computer vision domain. In this work, we investigate the impact of performing such multi-task learning on the adversarial robustness of ASR models in the speech domain. We conduct extensive MTL experimentation by combining semantically diverse tasks such as accent classification and ASR, and evaluate a wide range of adversarial settings. Our thorough analysis reveals that performing MTL with semantically diverse tasks consistently makes it harder for an adversarial attack to succeed. We also discuss in detail the serious pitfalls and their related remedies that have a significant impact on the robustness of MTL models. Our proposed MTL approach shows considerable absolute improvements in adversarially targeted WER ranging from 17.25 up to 59.90 compared to single-task learning baselines (attention decoder and CTC respectively). Ours is the first in-depth study that uncovers adversarial robustness gains from multi-task learning for ASR."
A Complementary Joint Training Approach Using Unpaired Speech and Text for Low-Resource Automatic Speech Recognition,"Unpaired data has shown to be beneficial for low-resource automatic speech recognition~(ASR), which can be involved in the design of hybrid models with multi-task training or language model dependent pre-training. In this work, we leverage unpaired data to train a general sequence-to-sequence model. Unpaired speech and text are used in the form of data pairs by generating the corresponding missing parts in prior to model training. Inspired by the complementarity of speech-PseudoLabel pair and SynthesizedAudio-text pair in both acoustic features and linguistic features, we propose a complementary joint training~(CJT) method that trains a model alternatively with two data pairs. Furthermore, label masking for pseudo-labels and gradient restriction for synthesized audio are proposed to further cope with the deviations from real data, termed as CJT++. Experimental results show that compared to speech-only training, the proposed basic CJT achieves great performance improvements on clean/other test sets, and the CJT++ re-training yields further performance enhancements. It is also apparent that the proposed method outperforms the wav2vec2.0 model with the same model size and beam size, particularly in extreme low-resource cases."
"Audio-visual multi-channel speech separation, dereverberation and recognition","Despite the rapid advance of automatic speech recognition (ASR) technologies, accurate recognition of cocktail party speech characterised by the interference from overlapping speakers, background noise and room reverberation remains a highly challenging task to date. Motivated by the invariance of visual modality to acoustic signal corruption, audio-visual speech enhancement techniques have been developed, although predominantly targeting overlapping speech separation and recognition tasks. In this paper, an audio-visual multi-channel speech separation, dereverberation and recognition approach featuring a full incorporation of visual information into all three stages of the system is proposed. The advantage of the additional visual modality over using audio only is demonstrated on two neural dereverberation approaches based on DNN-WPE and spectral mapping respectively. The learning cost function mismatch between the separation and dereverberation models and their integration with the back-end recognition system is minimised using fine-tuning on the MSE and LF-MMI criteria. Experiments conducted on the LRS2 dataset suggest that the proposed audio-visual multi-channel speech separation, dereverberation and recognition system outperforms the baseline audio-visual multi-channel speech separation and recognition system containing no dereverberation module by a statistically significant word error rate (WER) reduction of 2.06% absolute (8.77% relative)."
Cross-lingual Self-Supervised Speech Representations for Improved Dysarthric Speech Recognition,"State-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems perform well on healthy speech. However, the performance on impaired speech still remains an issue. The current study explores the usefulness of using Wav2Vec self-supervised speech representations as features for training an ASR system for dysarthric speech. Dysarthric speech recognition is particularly difficult as several aspects of speech such as articulation, prosody and phonation can be impaired. Specifically, we train an acoustic model with features extracted from Wav2Vec, Hubert, and the cross-lingual XLSR model. Results suggest that speech representations pretrained on large unlabelled data can improve word error rate (WER) performance. In particular, features from the multilingual model led to lower WERs than filterbanks (Fbank) or models trained on a single language. Improvements were observed in English speakers with cerebral palsy caused dysarthria (UASpeech corpus), Spanish speakers with Parkinsonian dysarthria (PC-GITA corpus) and Italian speakers with paralysis-based dysarthria (EasyCall corpus). Compared to using Fbank features, XLSR-based features reduced WERs by 6.8%, 22.0%, and 7.0% for the UASpeech, PC-GITA, and EasyCall corpus, respectively."
Deep Speech Based End-to-End Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) for Indian-English Accents,"Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) is an interdisciplinary application of computer science and linguistics that enable us to derive the transcription from the uttered speech waveform. It finds several applications in Military like High-performance fighter aircraft, helicopters, air-traffic controller. Other than military speech recognition is used in healthcare, persons with disabilities and many more. ASR has been an active research area. Several models and algorithms for speech to text (STT) have been proposed. One of the most recent is Mozilla Deep Speech, it is based on the Deep Speech research paper by Baidu. Deep Speech is a state-of-art speech recognition system is developed using end-to-end deep learning, it is trained using well-optimized Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) training system utilizing multiple Graphical Processing Units (GPUs). This training is mostly done using American-English accent datasets, which results in poor generalizability to other English accents. India is a land of vast diversity. This can even be seen in the speech, there are several English accents which vary from state to state. In this work, we have used transfer learning approach using most recent Deep Speech model i.e., deepspeech-0.9.3 to develop an end-to-end speech recognition system for Indian-English accents. This work utilizes fine-tuning and data argumentation to further optimize and improve the Deep Speech ASR system. Indic TTS data of Indian-English accents is used for transfer learning and fine-tuning the pre-trained Deep Speech model. A general comparison is made among the untrained model, our trained model and other available speech recognition services for Indian-English Accents."
Leveraging Phone Mask Training for Phonetic-Reduction-Robust E2E Uyghur Speech Recognition,"In Uyghur speech, consonant and vowel reduction are often encountered, especially in spontaneous speech with high speech rate, which will cause a degradation of speech recognition performance. To solve this problem, we propose an effective phone mask training method for Conformer-based Uyghur end-to-end (E2E) speech recognition. The idea is to randomly mask off a certain percentage features of phones during model training, which simulates the above verbal phenomena and facilitates E2E model to learn more contextual information. According to experiments, the above issues can be greatly alleviated. In addition, deep investigations are carried out into different units in masking, which shows the effectiveness of our proposed masking unit. We also further study the masking method and optimize filling strategy of phone mask. Finally, compared with Conformer-based E2E baseline without mask training, our model demonstrates about 5.51% relative Word Error Rate (WER) reduction on reading speech and 12.92% on spontaneous speech, respectively. The above approach has also been verified on test-set of open-source data THUYG-20, which shows 20% relative improvements."
End-to-end model for named entity recognition from speech without paired training data,"Recent works showed that end-to-end neural approaches tend to become very popular for spoken language understanding (SLU). Through the term end-to-end, one considers the use of a single model optimized to extract semantic information directly from the speech signal. A major issue for such models is the lack of paired audio and textual data with semantic annotation. In this paper, we propose an approach to build an end-to-end neural model to extract semantic information in a scenario in which zero paired audio data is available. Our approach is based on the use of an external model trained to generate a sequence of vectorial representations from text. These representations mimic the hidden representations that could be generated inside an end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) model by processing a speech signal. An SLU neural module is then trained using these representations as input and the annotated text as output. Last, the SLU module replaces the top layers of the ASR model to achieve the construction of the end-to-end model. Our experiments on named entity recognition, carried out on the QUAERO corpus, show that this approach is very promising, getting better results than a comparable cascade approach or than the use of synthetic voices."
"End-to-End Integration of Speech Recognition, Speech Enhancement, and Self-Supervised Learning Representation","This work presents our end-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) model targetting at robust speech recognition, called Integraded speech Recognition with enhanced speech Input for Self-supervised learning representation (IRIS). Compared with conventional E2E ASR models, the proposed E2E model integrates two important modules including a speech enhancement (SE) module and a self-supervised learning representation (SSLR) module. The SE module enhances the noisy speech. Then the SSLR module extracts features from enhanced speech to be used for speech recognition (ASR). To train the proposed model, we establish an efficient learning scheme. Evaluation results on the monaural CHiME-4 task show that the IRIS model achieves the best performance reported in the literature for the single-channel CHiME-4 benchmark (2.0% for the real development and 3.9% for the real test) thanks to the powerful pre-trained SSLR module and the fine-tuned SE module."
Zero-Shot Cross-lingual Aphasia Detection using Automatic Speech Recognition,"Aphasia is a common speech and language disorder, typically caused by a brain injury or a stroke, that affects millions of people worldwide. Detecting and assessing Aphasia in patients is a difficult, time-consuming process, and numerous attempts to automate it have been made, the most successful using machine learning models trained on aphasic speech data. Like in many medical applications, aphasic speech data is scarce and the problem is exacerbated in so-called ""low resource"" languages, which are, for this task, most languages excluding English. We attempt to leverage available data in English and achieve zero-shot aphasia detection in low-resource languages such as Greek and French, by using language-agnostic linguistic features. Current cross-lingual aphasia detection approaches rely on manually extracted transcripts. We propose an end-to-end pipeline using pre-trained Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models that share cross-lingual speech representations and are fine-tuned for our desired low-resource languages. To further boost our ASR model's performance, we also combine it with a language model. We show that our ASR-based end-to-end pipeline offers comparable results to previous setups using human-annotated transcripts."
Probing Speech Emotion Recognition Transformers for Linguistic Knowledge,"Large, pre-trained neural networks consisting of self-attention layers (transformers) have recently achieved state-of-the-art results on several speech emotion recognition (SER) datasets. These models are typically pre-trained in self-supervised manner with the goal to improve automatic speech recognition performance -- and thus, to understand linguistic information. In this work, we investigate the extent in which this information is exploited during SER fine-tuning. Using a reproducible methodology based on open-source tools, we synthesise prosodically neutral speech utterances while varying the sentiment of the text. Valence predictions of the transformer model are very reactive to positive and negative sentiment content, as well as negations, but not to intensifiers or reducers, while none of those linguistic features impact arousal or dominance. These findings show that transformers can successfully leverage linguistic information to improve their valence predictions, and that linguistic analysis should be included in their testing."
Text-To-Speech Data Augmentation for Low Resource Speech Recognition,"Nowadays, the main problem of deep learning techniques used in the development of automatic speech recognition (ASR) models is the lack of transcribed data. The goal of this research is to propose a new data augmentation method to improve ASR models for agglutinative and low-resource languages. This novel data augmentation method generates both synthetic text and synthetic audio. Some experiments were conducted using the corpus of the Quechua language, which is an agglutinative and low-resource language. In this study, a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model was applied to generate synthetic text, in addition to generating synthetic speech using a text-to-speech (TTS) model for Quechua. The results show that the new data augmentation method works well to improve the ASR model for Quechua. In this research, an 8.73% improvement in the word-error-rate (WER) of the ASR model is obtained using a combination of synthetic text and synthetic speech."
Filter-based Discriminative Autoencoders for Children Speech Recognition,"Children speech recognition is indispensable but challenging due to the diversity of children's speech. In this paper, we propose a filter-based discriminative autoencoder for acoustic modeling. To filter out the influence of various speaker types and pitches, auxiliary information of the speaker and pitch features is input into the encoder together with the acoustic features to generate phonetic embeddings. In the training phase, the decoder uses the auxiliary information and the phonetic embedding extracted by the encoder to reconstruct the input acoustic features. The autoencoder is trained by simultaneously minimizing the ASR loss and feature reconstruction error. The framework can make the phonetic embedding purer, resulting in more accurate senone (triphone-state) scores. Evaluated on the test set of the CMU Kids corpus, our system achieves a 7.8% relative WER reduction compared to the baseline system. In the domain adaptation experiment, our system also outperforms the baseline system on the British-accent PF-STAR task."
CTA-RNN: Channel and Temporal-wise Attention RNN Leveraging Pre-trained ASR Embeddings for Speech Emotion Recognition,"Previous research has looked into ways to improve speech emotion recognition (SER) by utilizing both acoustic and linguistic cues of speech. However, the potential association between state-of-the-art ASR models and the SER task has yet to be investigated. In this paper, we propose a novel channel and temporal-wise attention RNN (CTA-RNN) architecture based on the intermediate representations of pre-trained ASR models. Specifically, the embeddings of a large-scale pre-trained end-to-end ASR encoder contain both acoustic and linguistic information, as well as the ability to generalize to different speakers, making them well suited for downstream SER task. To further exploit the embeddings from different layers of the ASR encoder, we propose a novel CTA-RNN architecture to capture the emotional salient parts of embeddings in both the channel and temporal directions. We evaluate our approach on two popular benchmark datasets, IEMOCAP and MSP-IMPROV, using both within-corpus and cross-corpus settings. Experimental results show that our proposed method can achieve excellent performance in terms of accuracy and robustness."
Analyzing the factors affecting usefulness of Self-Supervised Pre-trained Representations for Speech Recognition,"Self-supervised learning (SSL) to learn high-level speech representations has been a popular approach to building Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems in low-resource settings. However, the common assumption made in literature is that a considerable amount of unlabeled data is available for the same domain or language that can be leveraged for SSL pre-training, which we acknowledge is not feasible in a real-world setting. In this paper, as part of the Interspeech Gram Vaani ASR challenge, we try to study the effect of domain, language, dataset size, and other aspects of our upstream pre-training SSL data on the final performance low-resource downstream ASR task. We also build on the continued pre-training paradigm to study the effect of prior knowledge possessed by models trained using SSL. Extensive experiments and studies reveal that the performance of ASR systems is susceptible to the data used for SSL pre-training. Their performance improves with an increase in similarity and volume of pre-training data. We believe our work will be helpful to the speech community in building better ASR systems in low-resource settings and steer research towards improving generalization in SSL-based pre-training for speech systems."
Neural Architecture Search for Speech Emotion Recognition,"Deep neural networks have brought significant advancements to speech emotion recognition (SER). However, the architecture design in SER is mainly based on expert knowledge and empirical (trial-and-error) evaluations, which is time-consuming and resource intensive. In this paper, we propose to apply neural architecture search (NAS) techniques to automatically configure the SER models. To accelerate the candidate architecture optimization, we propose a uniform path dropout strategy to encourage all candidate architecture operations to be equally optimized. Experimental results of two different neural structures on IEMOCAP show that NAS can improve SER performance (54.89\% to 56.28\%) while maintaining model parameter sizes. The proposed dropout strategy also shows superiority over the previous approaches."
A Comparative Study on Speaker-attributed Automatic Speech Recognition in Multi-party Meetings,"In this paper, we conduct a comparative study on speaker-attributed automatic speech recognition (SA-ASR) in the multi-party meeting scenario, a topic with increasing attention in meeting rich transcription. Specifically, three approaches are evaluated in this study. The first approach, FD-SOT, consists of a frame-level diarization model to identify speakers and a multi-talker ASR to recognize utterances. The speaker-attributed transcriptions are obtained by aligning the diarization results and recognized hypotheses. However, such an alignment strategy may suffer from erroneous timestamps due to the modular independence, severely hindering the model performance. Therefore, we propose the second approach, WD-SOT, to address alignment errors by introducing a word-level diarization model, which can get rid of such timestamp alignment dependency. To further mitigate the alignment issues, we propose the third approach, TS-ASR, which trains a target-speaker separation module and an ASR module jointly. By comparing various strategies for each SA-ASR approach, experimental results on a real meeting scenario corpus, AliMeeting, reveal that the WD-SOT approach achieves 10.7% relative reduction on averaged speaker-dependent character error rate (SD-CER), compared with the FD-SOT approach. In addition, the TS-ASR approach also outperforms the FD-SOT approach and brings 16.5% relative average SD-CER reduction."
Effectiveness of text to speech pseudo labels for forced alignment and cross lingual pretrained models for low resource speech recognition,"In the recent years end to end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have achieved promising results given sufficient resources. Even for languages where not a lot of labelled data is available, state of the art E2E ASR systems can be developed by pretraining on huge amounts of high resource languages and finetune on low resource languages. For a lot of low resource languages the current approaches are still challenging, since in many cases labelled data is not available in open domain. In this paper we present an approach to create labelled data for Maithili, Bhojpuri and Dogri by utilising pseudo labels from text to speech for forced alignment. The created data was inspected for quality and then further used to train a transformer based wav2vec 2.0 ASR model. All data and models are available in open domain."
Speech Emotion Recognition using Multi-task learning and a multimodal dynamic fusion network,"Emotion Recognition (ER) aims to classify human utterances into different emotion categories. Based on early-fusion and self-attention-based multimodal interaction between text and acoustic modalities, in this paper, we propose MMER, a multimodal multitask learning approach for ER from individual utterances in isolation. Our proposed MMER leverages a multimodal dynamic fusion network that adds minimal parameters over an existing speech encoder to leverage the semantic and syntactic properties hidden in text. Experiments on the IEMOCAP benchmark show that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance. In addition, strong baselines and ablation studies prove the effectiveness of our proposed approach. We make our code publicly available on GitHub."
An Empirical Study of Language Model Integration for Transducer based Speech Recognition,"Utilizing text-only data with an external language model (ELM) in end-to-end RNN-Transducer (RNN-T) for speech recognition is challenging. Recently, a class of methods such as density ratio (DR) and internal language model estimation (ILME) have been developed, outperforming the classic shallow fusion (SF) method. The basic idea behind these methods is that RNN-T posterior should first subtract the implicitly learned internal language model (ILM) prior, in order to integrate the ELM. While recent studies suggest that RNN-T only learns some low-order language model information, the DR method uses a well-trained neural language model with full context, which may be inappropriate for the estimation of ILM and deteriorate the integration performance. Based on the DR method, we propose a low-order density ratio method (LODR) by replacing the estimation with a low-order weak language model. Extensive empirical experiments are conducted on both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios on English LibriSpeech & Tedlium-2 and Chinese WenetSpeech & AISHELL-1 datasets. It is shown that LODR consistently outperforms SF in all tasks, while performing generally close to ILME and better than DR in most tests."
Exploiting Single-Channel Speech for Multi-Channel End-to-End Speech Recognition: A Comparative Study,"Recently, the end-to-end training approach for multi-channel ASR has shown its effectiveness, which usually consists of a beamforming front-end and a recognition back-end. However, the end-to-end training becomes more difficult due to the integration of multiple modules, particularly considering that multi-channel speech data recorded in real environments are limited in size. This raises the demand to exploit the single-channel data for multi-channel end-to-end ASR. In this paper, we systematically compare the performance of three schemes to exploit external single-channel data for multi-channel end-to-end ASR, namely back-end pre-training, data scheduling, and data simulation, under different settings such as the sizes of the single-channel data and the choices of the front-end. Extensive experiments on CHiME-4 and AISHELL-4 datasets demonstrate that while all three methods improve the multi-channel end-to-end speech recognition performance, data simulation outperforms the other two, at the cost of longer training time. Data scheduling outperforms back-end pre-training marginally but nearly consistently, presumably because that in the pre-training stage, the back-end tends to overfit on the single-channel data, especially when the single-channel data size is small."
Is Word Error Rate a good evaluation metric for Speech Recognition in Indic Languages?,"We propose a new method for the calculation of error rates in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). This new metric is for languages that contain half characters and where the same character can be written in different forms. We implement our methodology in Hindi which is one of the main languages from Indic context and we think this approach is scalable to other similar languages containing a large character set. We call our metrics Alternate Word Error Rate (AWER) and Alternate Character Error Rate (ACER).  We train our ASR models using wav2vec 2.0\cite{baevski2020wav2vec} for Indic languages. Additionally we use language models to improve our model performance. Our results show a significant improvement in analyzing the error rates at word and character level and the interpretability of the ASR system is improved upto 3\% in AWER and 7\% in ACER for Hindi. Our experiments suggest that in languages which have complex pronunciation, there are multiple ways of writing words without changing their meaning. In such cases AWER and ACER will be more useful rather than WER and CER as metrics. Further, we open source a new benchmarking dataset of 21 hours for Hindi with the new metric scripts."
Improving Speech Recognition for Indic Languages using Language Model,We study the effect of applying a language model (LM) on the output of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems for Indic languages. We fine-tune wav2vec 2.0 models for 18 Indic languages and adjust the results with language models trained on text derived from a variety of sources. Our findings demonstrate that the average Character Error Rate (CER) decreases by over 28 \% and the average Word Error Rate (WER) decreases by about 36 \% after decoding with LM. We show that a large LM may not provide a substantial improvement as compared to a diverse one. We also demonstrate that high quality transcriptions can be obtained on domain-specific data without retraining the ASR model and show results on biomedical domain.
Code Switched and Code Mixed Speech Recognition for Indic languages,Training multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems is challenging because acoustic and lexical information is typically language specific. Training multilingual system for Indic languages is even more tougher due to lack of open source datasets and results on different approaches. We compare the performance of end to end multilingual speech recognition system to the performance of monolingual models conditioned on language identification (LID). The decoding information from a multilingual model is used for language identification and then combined with monolingual models to get an improvement of 50% WER across languages. We also propose a similar technique to solve the Code Switched problem and achieve a WER of 21.77 and 28.27 over Hindi-English and Bengali-English respectively. Our work talks on how transformer based ASR especially wav2vec 2.0 can be applied in developing multilingual ASR and code switched ASR for Indic languages.
4-bit Conformer with Native Quantization Aware Training for Speech Recognition,"Reducing the latency and model size has always been a significant research problem for live Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) application scenarios. Along this direction, model quantization has become an increasingly popular approach to compress neural networks and reduce computation cost. Most of the existing practical ASR systems apply post-training 8-bit quantization. To achieve a higher compression rate without introducing additional performance regression, in this study, we propose to develop 4-bit ASR models with native quantization aware training, which leverages native integer operations to effectively optimize both training and inference. We conducted two experiments on state-of-the-art Conformer-based ASR models to evaluate our proposed quantization technique. First, we explored the impact of different precisions for both weight and activation quantization on the LibriSpeech dataset, and obtained a lossless 4-bit Conformer model with 5.8x size reduction compared to the float32 model. Following this, we for the first time investigated and revealed the viability of 4-bit quantization on a practical ASR system that is trained with large-scale datasets, and produced a lossless Conformer ASR model with mixed 4-bit and 8-bit weights that has 5x size reduction compared to the float32 model."
Unsupervised Text-to-Speech Synthesis by Unsupervised Automatic Speech Recognition,"An unsupervised text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) system learns to generate speech waveforms corresponding to any written sentence in a language by observing: 1) a collection of untranscribed speech waveforms in that language; 2) a collection of texts written in that language without access to any transcribed speech. Developing such a system can significantly improve the availability of speech technology to languages without a large amount of parallel speech and text data. This paper proposes an unsupervised TTS system based on an alignment module that outputs pseudo-text and another synthesis module that uses pseudo-text for training and real text for inference. Our unsupervised system can achieve comparable performance to the supervised system in seven languages with about 10-20 hours of speech each. A careful study on the effect of text units and vocoders has also been conducted to better understand what factors may affect unsupervised TTS performance. The samples generated by our models can be found at https://cactuswiththoughts.github.io/UnsupTTS-Demo, and our code can be found at https://github.com/lwang114/UnsupTTS."
Integrating Lattice-Free MMI into End-to-End Speech Recognition,"In automatic speech recognition (ASR) research, discriminative criteria have achieved superior performance in DNN-HMM systems. Given this success, the adoption of discriminative criteria is promising to boost the performance of end-to-end (E2E) ASR systems. With this motivation, previous works have introduced the minimum Bayesian risk (MBR, one of the discriminative criteria) into E2E ASR systems. However, the effectiveness and efficiency of the MBR-based methods are compromised: the MBR criterion is only used in system training, which creates a mismatch between training and decoding; the on-the-fly decoding process in MBR-based methods results in the need for pre-trained models and slow training speeds. To this end, novel algorithms are proposed in this work to integrate another widely used discriminative criterion, lattice-free maximum mutual information (LF-MMI), into E2E ASR systems not only in the training stage but also in the decoding process. The proposed LF-MMI training and decoding methods show their effectiveness on two widely used E2E frameworks: Attention-Based Encoder-Decoders (AEDs) and Neural Transducers (NTs). Compared with MBR-based methods, the proposed LF-MMI method: maintains the consistency between training and decoding; eschews the on-the-fly decoding process; trains from randomly initialized models with superior training efficiency. Experiments suggest that the LF-MMI method outperforms its MBR counterparts and consistently leads to statistically significant performance improvements on various frameworks and datasets from 30 hours to 14.3k hours. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on Aishell-1 (CER 4.10%) and Aishell-2 (CER 5.02%) datasets. Code is released."
Dynamic Latency for CTC-Based Streaming Automatic Speech Recognition With Emformer,"An inferior performance of the streaming automatic speech recognition models versus non-streaming model is frequently seen due to the absence of future context. In order to improve the performance of the streaming model and reduce the computational complexity, a frame-level model using efficient augment memory transformer block and dynamic latency training method is employed for streaming automatic speech recognition in this paper. The long-range history context is stored into the augment memory bank as a complement to the limited history context used in the encoder. Key and value are cached by a cache mechanism and reused for next chunk to reduce computation. Afterwards, a dynamic latency training method is proposed to obtain better performance and support low and high latency inference simultaneously. Our experiments are conducted on benchmark 960h LibriSpeech data set. With an average latency of 640ms, our model achieves a relative WER reduction of 6.0% on test-clean and 3.0% on test-other versus the truncate chunk-wise Transformer."
Locality Matters: A Locality-Biased Linear Attention for Automatic Speech Recognition,"Conformer has shown a great success in automatic speech recognition (ASR) on many public benchmarks. One of its crucial drawbacks is the quadratic time-space complexity with respect to the input sequence length, which prohibits the model to scale-up as well as process longer input audio sequences. To solve this issue, numerous linear attention methods have been proposed. However, these methods often have limited performance on ASR as they treat tokens equally in modeling, neglecting the fact that the neighbouring tokens are often more connected than the distanced tokens. In this paper, we take this fact into account and propose a new locality-biased linear attention for Conformer. It not only achieves higher accuracy than the vanilla Conformer, but also enjoys linear space-time computational complexity. To be specific, we replace the softmax attention with a locality-biased linear attention (LBLA) mechanism in Conformer blocks. The LBLA contains a kernel function to ensure the linear complexities and a cosine reweighing matrix to impose more weights on neighbouring tokens. Extensive experiments on the LibriSpeech corpus show that by introducing this locality bias to the Conformer, our method achieves a lower word error rate with more than 22% inference speed."
A Dataset for Speech Emotion Recognition in Greek Theatrical Plays,"Machine learning methodologies can be adopted in cultural applications and propose new ways to distribute or even present the cultural content to the public. For instance, speech analytics can be adopted to automatically generate subtitles in theatrical plays, in order to (among other purposes) help people with hearing loss. Apart from a typical speech-to-text transcription with Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) can be used to automatically predict the underlying emotional content of speech dialogues in theatrical plays, and thus to provide a deeper understanding how the actors utter their lines. However, real-world datasets from theatrical plays are not available in the literature. In this work we present GreThE, the Greek Theatrical Emotion dataset, a new publicly available data collection for speech emotion recognition in Greek theatrical plays. The dataset contains utterances from various actors and plays, along with respective valence and arousal annotations. Towards this end, multiple annotators have been asked to provide their input for each speech recording and inter-annotator agreement is taken into account in the final ground truth generation. In addition, we discuss the results of some indicative experiments that have been conducted with machine and deep learning frameworks, using the dataset, along with some widely used databases in the field of speech emotion recognition."
WeNet 2.0: More Productive End-to-End Speech Recognition Toolkit,"Recently, we made available WeNet, a production-oriented end-to-end speech recognition toolkit, which introduces a unified two-pass (U2) framework and a built-in runtime to address the streaming and non-streaming decoding modes in a single model. To further improve ASR performance and facilitate various production requirements, in this paper, we present WeNet 2.0 with four important updates. (1) We propose U2++, a unified two-pass framework with bidirectional attention decoders, which includes the future contextual information by a right-to-left attention decoder to improve the representative ability of the shared encoder and the performance during the rescoring stage. (2) We introduce an n-gram based language model and a WFST-based decoder into WeNet 2.0, promoting the use of rich text data in production scenarios. (3) We design a unified contextual biasing framework, which leverages user-specific context (e.g., contact lists) to provide rapid adaptation ability for production and improves ASR accuracy in both with-LM and without-LM scenarios. (4) We design a unified IO to support large-scale data for effective model training. In summary, the brand-new WeNet 2.0 achieves up to 10\% relative recognition performance improvement over the original WeNet on various corpora and makes available several important production-oriented features."
Investigating Self-supervised Pretraining Frameworks for Pathological Speech Recognition,"We investigate the performance of self-supervised pretraining frameworks on pathological speech datasets used for automatic speech recognition (ASR). Modern end-to-end models require thousands of hours of data to train well, but only a small number of pathological speech datasets are publicly available. A proven solution to this problem is by first pretraining the model on a huge number of healthy speech datasets and then fine-tuning it on the pathological speech datasets. One new pretraining framework called self-supervised learning (SSL) trains a network using only speech data, providing more flexibility in training data requirements and allowing more speech data to be used in pretraining. We investigate SSL frameworks such as the wav2vec 2.0 and WavLM models using different setups and compare their performance with different supervised pretraining setups, using two types of pathological speech, namely, Japanese electrolaryngeal and English dysarthric. Our results show that although SSL has shown success with minimally resourced healthy speech, we do not find this to be the case with pathological speech. The best supervised setup outperforms the best SSL setup by 13.9% character error rate in electrolaryngeal speech and 16.8% word error rate in dysarthric speech."
Speech Emotion Recognition with Co-Attention based Multi-level Acoustic Information,"Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) aims to help the machine to understand human's subjective emotion from only audio information. However, extracting and utilizing comprehensive in-depth audio information is still a challenging task. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end speech emotion recognition system using multi-level acoustic information with a newly designed co-attention module. We firstly extract multi-level acoustic information, including MFCC, spectrogram, and the embedded high-level acoustic information with CNN, BiLSTM and wav2vec2, respectively. Then these extracted features are treated as multimodal inputs and fused by the proposed co-attention mechanism. Experiments are carried on the IEMOCAP dataset, and our model achieves competitive performance with two different speaker-independent cross-validation strategies. Our code is available on GitHub."
Noise-robust Speech Recognition with 10 Minutes Unparalleled In-domain Data,"Noise-robust speech recognition systems require large amounts of training data including noisy speech data and corresponding transcripts to achieve state-of-the-art performances in face of various practical environments. However, such plenty of in-domain data is not always available in the real-life world. In this paper, we propose a generative adversarial network to simulate noisy spectrum from the clean spectrum (Simu-GAN), where only 10 minutes of unparalleled in-domain noisy speech data is required as labels. Furthermore, we also propose a dual-path speech recognition system to improve the robustness of the system under noisy conditions. Experimental results show that the proposed speech recognition system achieves 7.3% absolute improvement with simulated noisy data by Simu-GAN over the best baseline in terms of word error rate (WER)."
Mel Frequency Spectral Domain Defenses against Adversarial Attacks on Speech Recognition Systems,"A variety of recent works have looked into defenses for deep neural networks against adversarial attacks particularly within the image processing domain. Speech processing applications such as automatic speech recognition (ASR) are increasingly relying on deep learning models, and so are also prone to adversarial attacks. However, many of the defenses explored for ASR simply adapt the image-domain defenses, which may not provide optimal robustness. This paper explores speech specific defenses using the mel spectral domain, and introduces a novel defense method called 'mel domain noise flooding' (MDNF). MDNF applies additive noise to the mel spectrogram of a speech utterance prior to re-synthesising the audio signal. We test the defenses against strong white-box adversarial attacks such as projected gradient descent (PGD) and Carlini-Wagner (CW) attacks, and show better robustness compared to a randomized smoothing baseline across strong threat models."
Analysis of EEG frequency bands for Envisioned Speech Recognition,"The use of Automatic speech recognition (ASR) interfaces have become increasingly popular in daily life for use in interaction and control of electronic devices. The interfaces currently being used are not feasible for a variety of users such as those suffering from a speech disorder, locked-in syndrome, paralysis or people with utmost privacy requirements. In such cases, an interface that can identify envisioned speech using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals can be of great benefit. Various works targeting this problem have been done in the past. However, there has been limited work in identifying the frequency bands (δ, θ, α, β, γ) of the EEG signal that contribute towards envisioned speech recognition. Therefore, in this work, we aim to analyze the significance of different EEG frequency bands and signals obtained from different lobes of the brain and their contribution towards recognizing envisioned speech. Signals obtained from different lobes and bandpass filtered for different frequency bands are fed to a spatio-temporal deep learning architecture with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The performance is evaluated on a publicly available dataset comprising of three classification tasks - digit, character and images. We obtain a classification accuracy of 85.93\%, 87.27\% and 87.51\% for the three tasks respectively. The code for the implementation has been made available at https://github.com/ayushayt/ImaginedSpeechRecognition."
Continuous Metric Learning For Transferable Speech Emotion Recognition and Embedding Across Low-resource Languages,"Speech emotion recognition~(SER) refers to the technique of inferring the emotional state of an individual from speech signals. SERs continue to garner interest due to their wide applicability. Although the domain is mainly founded on signal processing, machine learning, and deep learning, generalizing over languages continues to remain a challenge. However, developing generalizable and transferable models are critical due to a lack of sufficient resources in terms of data and labels for languages beyond the most commonly spoken ones. To improve performance over languages, we propose a denoising autoencoder with semi-supervision using a continuous metric loss based on either activation or valence. The novelty of this work lies in our proposal of continuous metric learning, which is among the first proposals on the topic to the best of our knowledge. Furthermore, to address the lack of activation and valence labels in the transfer datasets, we annotate the signal samples with activation and valence levels corresponding to a dimensional model of emotions, which were then used to evaluate the quality of the embedding over the transfer datasets. We show that the proposed semi-supervised model consistently outperforms the baseline unsupervised method, which is a conventional denoising autoencoder, in terms of emotion classification accuracy as well as correlation with respect to the dimensional variables. Further evaluation of classification accuracy with respect to the reference, a BERT based speech representation model, shows that the proposed method is comparable to the reference method in classifying specific emotion classes at a much lower complexity."
Dual-Path Style Learning for End-to-End Noise-Robust Speech Recognition,"Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems degrade significantly in face of noisy conditions. Recently, speech enhancement (SE) has been introduced as front-end module to reduce noise and improve speech quality for ASR, but it would also suppress some important speech information, i.e., over-suppression problem. To alleviate this, we propose a dual-path style learning approach for end-to-end noise-robust automatic speech recognition (DPSL-ASR). Specifically, we first introduce clean speech feature along with the fused feature from previously proposed IFF-Net as dual-path inputs to recover the over-suppressed information. Then, we propose a style learning method to map the fused feature close to clean feature, in order to learn latent speech information from the latter, i.e., clean ""speech style"". Furthermore, we employ consistency loss to minimize the distance of ASR outputs in two paths to improve noise-robustness. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves relative word error rate (WER) reductions of 10.6% and 8.6% over the best IFF-Net baseline, on RATS Channel-A and CHiME-4 1-Channel Track datasets, respectively. Visualizations of intermediate embeddings indicate that DPSL-ASR can recover abundant over-suppressed information in enhanced speech. Our code is available at GitHub: https://github.com/YUCHEN005/DPSL-ASR."
On-the-fly Feature Based Speaker Adaptation for Dysarthric and Elderly Speech Recognition,"Automatic recognition of dysarthric and elderly speech highly challenging tasks to date. Speaker-level heterogeneity attributed to accent or gender commonly found in normal speech, when aggregated with age and speech impairment severity, create large diversity among speakers. Speaker adaptation techniques play a crucial role in personalization of ASR systems for such users. Their mobility issues limit the amount of speaker-level data available for model based adaptation. To this end, this paper investigates two novel forms of feature based on-the-fly rapid speaker adaptation approaches. The first is based on speaker-level variance regularized spectral basis embedding (SBEVR) features, while the other uses on-the-fly learning hidden unit contributions (LHUC) transforms conditioned on speaker-level spectral features. Experiments conducted on the UASpeech dysarthric and DimentiaBank Pitt elderly speech datasets suggest the proposed SBEVR features based adaptation statistically significantly outperform both the baseline on-the-fly i-Vector adapted hybrid TDNN/DNN systems by up to 2.48% absolute (7.92% relative) reduction in word error rate (WER), and offline batch mode model based LHUC adaptation using all speaker-level data by 0.78% absolute (2.41% relative) in WER reduction."
"Listen, Adapt, Better WER: Source-free Single-utterance Test-time Adaptation for Automatic Speech Recognition","Although deep learning-based end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has shown remarkable performance in recent years, it suffers severe performance regression on test samples drawn from different data distributions. Test-time Adaptation (TTA), previously explored in the computer vision area, aims to adapt the model trained on source domains to yield better predictions for test samples, often out-of-domain, without accessing the source data. Here, we propose the Single-Utterance Test-time Adaptation (SUTA) framework for ASR, which is the first TTA study on ASR to our best knowledge. The single-utterance TTA is a more realistic setting that does not assume test data are sampled from identical distribution and does not delay on-demand inference due to pre-collection for the batch of adaptation data. SUTA consists of unsupervised objectives with an efficient adaptation strategy. Empirical results demonstrate that SUTA effectively improves the performance of the source ASR model evaluated on multiple out-of-domain target corpora and in-domain test samples."
Speech-enhanced and Noise-aware Networks for Robust Speech Recognition,"Compensation for channel mismatch and noise interference is essential for robust automatic speech recognition. Enhanced speech has been introduced into the multi-condition training of acoustic models to improve their generalization ability. In this paper, a noise-aware training framework based on two cascaded neural structures is proposed to jointly optimize speech enhancement and speech recognition. The feature enhancement module is composed of a multi-task autoencoder, where noisy speech is decomposed into clean speech and noise. By concatenating its enhanced, noise-aware, and noisy features for each frame, the acoustic-modeling module maps each feature-augmented frame into a triphone state by optimizing the lattice-free maximum mutual information and cross entropy between the predicted and actual state sequences. On top of the factorized time delay neural network (TDNN-F) and its convolutional variant (CNN-TDNNF), both with SpecAug, the two proposed systems achieve word error rate (WER) of 3.90% and 3.55%, respectively, on the Aurora-4 task. Compared with the best existing systems that use bigram and trigram language models for decoding, the proposed CNN-TDNNF-based system achieves a relative WER reduction of 15.20% and 33.53%, respectively. In addition, the proposed CNN-TDNNF-based system also outperforms the baseline CNN-TDNNF system on the AMI task."
Chain-based Discriminative Autoencoders for Speech Recognition,"In our previous work, we proposed a discriminative autoencoder (DcAE) for speech recognition. DcAE combines two training schemes into one. First, since DcAE aims to learn encoder-decoder mappings, the squared error between the reconstructed speech and the input speech is minimized. Second, in the code layer, frame-based phonetic embeddings are obtained by minimizing the categorical cross-entropy between ground truth labels and predicted triphone-state scores. DcAE is developed based on the Kaldi toolkit by treating various TDNN models as encoders. In this paper, we further propose three new versions of DcAE. First, a new objective function that considers both categorical cross-entropy and mutual information between ground truth and predicted triphone-state sequences is used. The resulting DcAE is called a chain-based DcAE (c-DcAE). For application to robust speech recognition, we further extend c-DcAE to hierarchical and parallel structures, resulting in hc-DcAE and pc-DcAE. In these two models, both the error between the reconstructed noisy speech and the input noisy speech and the error between the enhanced speech and the reference clean speech are taken into the objective function. Experimental results on the WSJ and Aurora-4 corpora show that our DcAE models outperform baseline systems."
EmotionNAS: Two-stream Architecture Search for Speech Emotion Recognition,"Speech emotion recognition (SER) is a crucial research topic in human-computer interactions. Existing works are mainly based on manually designed models. Despite their great success, these methods heavily rely on historical experience, which are time-consuming but cannot exhaust all possible structures. To address this problem, we propose a neural architecture search (NAS) based framework for SER, called ""EmotionNAS"". We take spectrogram and wav2vec features as the inputs, followed with NAS to optimize the network structure for these features separately. We further incorporate complementary information in these features through decision-level fusion. Experimental results on IEMOCAP demonstrate that our method succeeds over existing state-of-the-art strategies on SER."
Impact of Dataset on Acoustic Models for Automatic Speech Recognition,"In Automatic Speech Recognition, GMM-HMM had been widely used for acoustic modelling. With the current advancement of deep learning, the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) from acoustic models has been replaced with Deep Neural Network, namely DNN-HMM Acoustic Models. The GMM models are widely used to create the alignments of the training data for the hybrid deep neural network model, thus making it an important task to create accurate alignments. Many factors such as training dataset size, training data augmentation, model hyperparameters, etc., affect the model learning. Traditionally in machine learning, larger datasets tend to have better performance, while smaller datasets tend to trigger over-fitting. The collection of speech data and their accurate transcriptions is a significant challenge that varies over different languages, and in most cases, it might be limited to big organizations. Moreover, in the case of available large datasets, training a model using such data requires additional time and computing resources, which may not be available. While the data about the accuracy of state-of-the-art ASR models on open-source datasets are published, the study about the impact of the size of a dataset on acoustic models is not readily available. This work aims to investigate the impact of dataset size variations on the performance of various GMM-HMM Acoustic Models and their respective computational costs."
Computing Optimal Location of Microphone for Improved Speech Recognition,"It was shown in our earlier work that the measurement error in the microphone position affected the room impulse response (RIR) which in turn affected the single-channel close microphone and multi-channel distant microphone speech recognition. In this paper, as an extension, we systematically study to identify the optimal location of the microphone, given an approximate and hence erroneous location of the microphone in 3D space. The primary idea is to use Monte-Carlo technique to generate a large number of random microphone positions around the erroneous microphone position and select the microphone position that results in the best performance of a general purpose automatic speech recognition (gp-asr). We experiment with clean and noisy speech and show that the optimal location of the microphone is unique and is affected by noise."
Automatic Speech Recognition for Speech Assessment of Persian Preschool Children,"Preschool evaluation is crucial because it gives teachers and parents influential knowledge about children's growth and development. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the necessity of online assessment for preschool children. One of the areas that should be tested is their ability to speak. Employing an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system would not help since they are pre-trained on voices that differ from children's in terms of frequency and amplitude. Because most of these are pre-trained with data in a specific range of amplitude, their objectives do not make them ready for voices in different amplitudes. To overcome this issue, we added a new objective to the masking objective of the Wav2Vec 2.0 model called Random Frequency Pitch (RFP). In addition, we used our newly introduced dataset to fine-tune our model for Meaningless Words (MW) and Rapid Automatic Naming (RAN) tests. Using masking in concatenation with RFP outperforms the masking objective of Wav2Vec 2.0 by reaching a Word Error Rate (WER) of 1.35. Our new approach reaches a WER of 6.45 on the Persian section of the CommonVoice dataset. Furthermore, our novel methodology produces positive outcomes in zero- and few-shot scenarios."
Modeling speech recognition and synthesis simultaneously: Encoding and decoding lexical and sublexical semantic information into speech with no direct access to speech data,"Human speakers encode information into raw speech which is then decoded by the listeners. This complex relationship between encoding (production) and decoding (perception) is often modeled separately. Here, we test how encoding and decoding of lexical semantic information can emerge automatically from raw speech in unsupervised generative deep convolutional networks that combine the production and perception principles of speech. We introduce, to our knowledge, the most challenging objective in unsupervised lexical learning: a network that must learn unique representations for lexical items with no direct access to training data. We train several models (ciwGAN and fiwGAN arXiv:2006.02951) and test how the networks classify acoustic lexical items in unobserved test data. Strong evidence in favor of lexical learning and a causal relationship between latent codes and meaningful sublexical units emerge. The architecture that combines the production and perception principles is thus able to learn to decode unique information from raw acoustic data without accessing real training data directly. We propose a technique to explore lexical (holistic) and sublexical (featural) learned representations in the classifier network. The results bear implications for unsupervised speech technology, as well as for unsupervised semantic modeling as language models increasingly bypass text and operate from raw acoustics."
Enhancing Speech Recognition Decoding via Layer Aggregation,"Recently proposed speech recognition systems are designed to predict using representations generated by their top layers, employing greedy decoding which isolates each timestep from the rest of the sequence. Aiming for improved performance, a beam search algorithm is frequently utilized and a language model is incorporated to assist with ranking the top candidates. In this work, we experiment with several speech recognition models and find that logits predicted using the top layers may hamper beam search from achieving optimal results. Specifically, we show that fined-tuned Wav2Vec 2.0 and HuBERT yield highly confident predictions, and hypothesize that the predictions are based on local information and may not take full advantage of the information encoded in intermediate layers. To this end, we perform a layer analysis to reveal and visualize how predictions evolve throughout the inference flow. We then propose a prediction method that aggregates the top M layers, potentially leveraging useful information encoded in intermediate layers and relaxing model confidence. We showcase the effectiveness of our approach via beam search decoding, conducting our experiments on Librispeech test and dev sets and achieving WER, and CER reduction of up to 10% and 22%, respectively."
Exploiting Cross Domain Acoustic-to-articulatory Inverted Features For Disordered Speech Recognition,"Articulatory features are inherently invariant to acoustic signal distortion and have been successfully incorporated into automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems for normal speech. Their practical application to disordered speech recognition is often limited by the difficulty in collecting such specialist data from impaired speakers. This paper presents a cross-domain acoustic-to-articulatory (A2A) inversion approach that utilizes the parallel acoustic-articulatory data of the 15-hour TORGO corpus in model training before being cross-domain adapted to the 102.7-hour UASpeech corpus and to produce articulatory features. Mixture density networks based neural A2A inversion models were used. A cross-domain feature adaptation network was also used to reduce the acoustic mismatch between the TORGO and UASpeech data. On both tasks, incorporating the A2A generated articulatory features consistently outperformed the baseline hybrid DNN/TDNN, CTC and Conformer based end-to-end systems constructed using acoustic features only. The best multi-modal system incorporating video modality and the cross-domain articulatory features as well as data augmentation and learning hidden unit contributions (LHUC) speaker adaptation produced the lowest published word error rate (WER) of 24.82% on the 16 dysarthric speakers of the benchmark UASpeech task."
Similarity and Content-based Phonetic Self Attention for Speech Recognition,"Transformer-based speech recognition models have achieved great success due to the self-attention (SA) mechanism that utilizes every frame in the feature extraction process. Especially, SA heads in lower layers capture various phonetic characteristics by the query-key dot product, which is designed to compute the pairwise relationship between frames. In this paper, we propose a variant of SA to extract more representative phonetic features. The proposed phonetic self-attention (phSA) is composed of two different types of phonetic attention; one is similarity-based and the other is content-based. In short, similarity-based attention captures the correlation between frames while content-based attention only considers each frame without being affected by other frames. We identify which parts of the original dot product equation are related to two different attention patterns and improve each part with simple modifications. Our experiments on phoneme classification and speech recognition show that replacing SA with phSA for lower layers improves the recognition performance without increasing the latency and the parameter size."
Neural Predictor for Black-Box Adversarial Attacks on Speech Recognition,"Recent works have revealed the vulnerability of automatic speech recognition (ASR) models to adversarial examples (AEs), i.e., small perturbations that cause an error in the transcription of the audio signal. Studying audio adversarial attacks is therefore the first step towards robust ASR. Despite the significant progress made in attacking audio examples, the black-box attack remains challenging because only the hard-label information of transcriptions is provided. Due to this limited information, existing black-box methods often require an excessive number of queries to attack a single audio example. In this paper, we introduce NP-Attack, a neural predictor-based method, which progressively evolves the search towards a small adversarial perturbation. Given a perturbation direction, our neural predictor directly estimates the smallest perturbation that causes a mistranscription. In particular, it enables NP-Attack to accurately learn promising perturbation directions via gradient-based optimization. Experimental results show that NP-Attack achieves competitive results with other state-of-the-art black-box adversarial attacks while requiring a significantly smaller number of queries. The code of NP-Attack is available online."
Representative Subset Selection for Efficient Fine-Tuning in Self-Supervised Speech Recognition,"Self-supervised speech recognition models require considerable labeled training data for learning high-fidelity representations for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) which is computationally demanding and time-consuming. We consider the task of identifying an optimal subset of data for efficient fine-tuning in self-supervised speech models for ASR. We discover that the dataset pruning strategies used in vision tasks for sampling the most informative examples do not perform better than random subset selection on fine-tuning self-supervised ASR. We then present the COWERAGE algorithm for representative subset selection in self-supervised ASR. COWERAGE is based on our finding that ensuring the coverage of examples based on training Word Error Rate (WER) in the early training epochs leads to better generalization performance. Extensive experiments with the wav2vec 2.0 and HuBERT model on TIMIT, Librispeech, and LJSpeech datasets show the effectiveness of COWERAGE and its transferability across models, with up to 17% relative WER improvement over existing dataset pruning methods and random sampling. We also demonstrate that the coverage of training instances in terms of WER values ensures the inclusion of phonemically diverse examples, leading to better test accuracy in self-supervised speech recognition models."
Semi-FedSER: Semi-supervised Learning for Speech Emotion Recognition On Federated Learning using Multiview Pseudo-Labeling,"Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) application is frequently associated with privacy concerns as it often acquires and transmits speech data at the client-side to remote cloud platforms for further processing. These speech data can reveal not only speech content and affective information but the speaker's identity, demographic traits, and health status. Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning algorithm that coordinates clients to train a model collaboratively without sharing local data. This algorithm shows enormous potential for SER applications as sharing raw speech or speech features from a user's device is vulnerable to privacy attacks. However, a major challenge in FL is limited availability of high-quality labeled data samples. In this work, we propose a semi-supervised federated learning framework, Semi-FedSER, that utilizes both labeled and unlabeled data samples to address the challenge of limited labeled data samples in FL. We show that our Semi-FedSER can generate desired SER performance even when the local label rate l=20 using two SER benchmark datasets: IEMOCAP and MSP-Improv."
Leveraging Unimodal Self-Supervised Learning for Multimodal Audio-Visual Speech Recognition,"Training Transformer-based models demands a large amount of data, while obtaining aligned and labelled data in multimodality is rather cost-demanding, especially for audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR). Thus it makes a lot of sense to make use of unlabelled unimodal data. On the other side, although the effectiveness of large-scale self-supervised learning is well established in both audio and visual modalities, how to integrate those pre-trained models into a multimodal scenario remains underexplored. In this work, we successfully leverage unimodal self-supervised learning to promote the multimodal AVSR. In particular, audio and visual front-ends are trained on large-scale unimodal datasets, then we integrate components of both front-ends into a larger multimodal framework which learns to recognize parallel audio-visual data into characters through a combination of CTC and seq2seq decoding. We show that both components inherited from unimodal self-supervised learning cooperate well, resulting in that the multimodal framework yields competitive results through fine-tuning. Our model is experimentally validated on both word-level and sentence-level tasks. Especially, even without an external language model, our proposed model raises the state-of-the-art performances on the widely accepted Lip Reading Sentences 2 (LRS2) dataset by a large margin, with a relative improvement of 30%."
Dawn of the transformer era in speech emotion recognition: closing the valence gap,"Recent advances in transformer-based architectures which are pre-trained in self-supervised manner have shown great promise in several machine learning tasks. In the audio domain, such architectures have also been successfully utilised in the field of speech emotion recognition (SER). However, existing works have not evaluated the influence of model size and pre-training data on downstream performance, and have shown limited attention to generalisation, robustness, fairness, and efficiency. The present contribution conducts a thorough analysis of these aspects on several pre-trained variants of wav2vec 2.0 and HuBERT that we fine-tuned on the dimensions arousal, dominance, and valence of MSP-Podcast, while additionally using IEMOCAP and MOSI to test cross-corpus generalisation. To the best of our knowledge, we obtain the top performance for valence prediction without use of explicit linguistic information, with a concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of .638 on MSP-Podcast. Furthermore, our investigations reveal that transformer-based architectures are more robust to small perturbations compared to a CNN-based baseline and fair with respect to biological sex groups, but not towards individual speakers. Finally, we are the first to show that their extraordinary success on valence is based on implicit linguistic information learnt during fine-tuning of the transformer layers, which explains why they perform on-par with recent multimodal approaches that explicitly utilise textual information. Our findings collectively paint the following picture: transformer-based architectures constitute the new state-of-the-art in SER, but further advances are needed to mitigate remaining robustness and individual speaker issues. To make our findings reproducible, we release the best performing model to the community."
Modelling word learning and recognition using visually grounded speech,"Background: Computational models of speech recognition often assume that the set of target words is already given. This implies that these models do not learn to recognise speech from scratch without prior knowledge and explicit supervision. Visually grounded speech models learn to recognise speech without prior knowledge by exploiting statistical dependencies between spoken and visual input. While it has previously been shown that visually grounded speech models learn to recognise the presence of words in the input, we explicitly investigate such a model as a model of human speech recognition.  Methods: We investigate the time-course of word recognition as simulated by the model using a gating paradigm to test whether its recognition is affected by well-known word-competition effects in human speech processing. We furthermore investigate whether vector quantisation, a technique for discrete representation learning, aids the model in the discovery and recognition of words.  Results/Conclusion: Our experiments show that the model is able to recognise nouns in isolation and even learns to properly differentiate between plural and singular nouns. We also find that recognition is influenced by word competition from the word-initial cohort and neighbourhood density, mirroring word competition effects in human speech comprehension. Lastly, we find no evidence that vector quantisation is helpful in discovering and recognising words. Our gating experiments even show that the vector quantised model requires more of the input sequence for correct recognition."
Attacks as Defenses: Designing Robust Audio CAPTCHAs Using Attacks on Automatic Speech Recognition Systems,"Audio CAPTCHAs are supposed to provide a strong defense for online resources; however, advances in speech-to-text mechanisms have rendered these defenses ineffective. Audio CAPTCHAs cannot simply be abandoned, as they are specifically named by the W3C as important enablers of accessibility. Accordingly, demonstrably more robust audio CAPTCHAs are important to the future of a secure and accessible Web. We look to recent literature on attacks on speech-to-text systems for inspiration for the construction of robust, principle-driven audio defenses. We begin by comparing 20 recent attack papers, classifying and measuring their suitability to serve as the basis of new ""robust to transcription"" but ""easy for humans to understand"" CAPTCHAs. After showing that none of these attacks alone are sufficient, we propose a new mechanism that is both comparatively intelligible (evaluated through a user study) and hard to automatically transcribe (i.e., P({\rm transcription}) = 4 \times 10^{-5}). Finally, we demonstrate that our audio samples have a high probability of being detected as CAPTCHAs when given to speech-to-text systems (P({\rm evasion}) = 1.77 \times 10^{-4}). In so doing, we not only demonstrate a CAPTCHA that is approximately four orders of magnitude more difficult to crack, but that such systems can be designed based on the insights gained from attack papers using the differences between the ways that humans and computers process audio."
Sentence-Select: Large-Scale Language Model Data Selection for Rare-Word Speech Recognition,"Language model fusion helps smart assistants recognize words which are rare in acoustic data but abundant in text-only corpora (typed search logs). However, such corpora have properties that hinder downstream performance, including being (1) too large, (2) beset with domain-mismatched content, and (3) heavy-headed rather than heavy-tailed (excessively many duplicate search queries such as ""weather""). We show that three simple strategies for selecting language modeling data can dramatically improve rare-word recognition without harming overall performance. First, to address the heavy-headedness, we downsample the data according to a soft log function, which tunably reduces high frequency (head) sentences. Second, to encourage rare-word exposure, we explicitly filter for words rare in the acoustic data. Finally, we tackle domain-mismatch via perplexity-based contrastive selection, filtering for examples matched to the target domain. We down-select a large corpus of web search queries by a factor of 53x and achieve better LM perplexities than without down-selection. When shallow-fused with a state-of-the-art, production speech engine, our LM achieves WER reductions of up to 24% relative on rare-word sentences (without changing overall WER) compared to a baseline LM trained on the raw corpus. These gains are further validated through favorable side-by-side evaluations on live voice search traffic."
A practical framework for multi-domain speech recognition and an instance sampling method to neural language modeling,"Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems used on smart phones or vehicles are usually required to process speech queries from very different domains. In such situations, a vanilla ASR system usually fails to perform well on every domain. This paper proposes a multi-domain ASR framework for Tencent Map, a navigation app used on smart phones and in-vehicle infotainment systems. The proposed framework consists of three core parts: a basic ASR module to generate n-best lists of a speech query, a text classification module to determine which domain the speech query belongs to, and a reranking module to rescore n-best lists using domain-specific language models. In addition, an instance sampling based method to training neural network language models (NNLMs) is proposed to address the data imbalance problem in multi-domain ASR. In experiments, the proposed framework was evaluated on navigation domain and music domain, since navigating and playing music are two main features of Tencent Map. Compared to a general ASR system, the proposed framework achieves a relative 13% \sim 22% character error rate reduction on several test sets collected from Tencent Map and our in-car voice assistant."
Robust Federated Learning Against Adversarial Attacks for Speech Emotion Recognition,"Due to the development of machine learning and speech processing, speech emotion recognition has been a popular research topic in recent years. However, the speech data cannot be protected when it is uploaded and processed on servers in the internet-of-things applications of speech emotion recognition. Furthermore, deep neural networks have proven to be vulnerable to human-indistinguishable adversarial perturbations. The adversarial attacks generated from the perturbations may result in deep neural networks wrongly predicting the emotional states. We propose a novel federated adversarial learning framework for protecting both data and deep neural networks. The proposed framework consists of i) federated learning for data privacy, and ii) adversarial training at the training stage and randomisation at the testing stage for model robustness. The experiments show that our proposed framework can effectively protect the speech data locally and improve the model robustness against a series of adversarial attacks."
Korean Tokenization for Beam Search Rescoring in Speech Recognition,"The performance of automatic speech recognition (ASR) models can be greatly improved by proper beam-search decoding with external language model (LM). There has been an increasing interest in Korean speech recognition, but not many studies have been focused on the decoding procedure. In this paper, we propose a Korean tokenization method for neural network-based LM used for Korean ASR. Although the common approach is to use the same tokenization method for external LM as the ASR model, we show that it may not be the best choice for Korean. We propose a new tokenization method that inserts a special token, SkipTC, when there is no trailing consonant in a Korean syllable. By utilizing the proposed SkipTC token, the input sequence for LM becomes very regularly patterned so that the LM can better learn the linguistic characteristics. Our experiments show that the proposed approach achieves a lower word error rate compared to the same LM model without SkipTC. In addition, we are the first to report the ASR performance for the recently introduced large-scale 7,600h Korean speech dataset."
Improving CTC-based speech recognition via knowledge transferring from pre-trained language models,"Recently, end-to-end automatic speech recognition models based on connectionist temporal classification (CTC) have achieved impressive results, especially when fine-tuned from wav2vec2.0 models. Due to the conditional independence assumption, CTC-based models are always weaker than attention-based encoder-decoder models and require the assistance of external language models (LMs). To solve this issue, we propose two knowledge transferring methods that leverage pre-trained LMs, such as BERT and GPT2, to improve CTC-based models. The first method is based on representation learning, in which the CTC-based models use the representation produced by BERT as an auxiliary learning target. The second method is based on joint classification learning, which combines GPT2 for text modeling with a hybrid CTC/attention architecture. Experiment on AISHELL-1 corpus yields a character error rate (CER) of 4.2% on the test set. When compared to the vanilla CTC-based models fine-tuned from the wav2vec2.0 models, our knowledge transferring method reduces CER by 16.1% relatively without external LMs."
Attention-based Region of Interest (ROI) Detection for Speech Emotion Recognition,"Automatic emotion recognition for real-life appli-cations is a challenging task. Human emotion expressions aresubtle, and can be conveyed by a combination of several emo-tions. In most existing emotion recognition studies, each audioutterance/video clip is labelled/classified in its entirety. However,utterance/clip-level labelling and classification can be too coarseto capture the subtle intra-utterance/clip temporal dynamics. Forexample, an utterance/video clip usually contains only a fewemotion-salient regions and many emotionless regions. In thisstudy, we propose to use attention mechanism in deep recurrentneural networks to detection the Regions-of-Interest (ROI) thatare more emotionally salient in human emotional speech/video,and further estimate the temporal emotion dynamics by aggre-gating those emotionally salient regions-of-interest. We comparethe ROI from audio and video and analyse them. We comparethe performance of the proposed attention networks with thestate-of-the-art LSTM models on multi-class classification task ofrecognizing six basic human emotions, and the proposed attentionmodels exhibit significantly better performance. Furthermore, theattention weight distribution can be used to interpret how anutterance can be expressed as a mixture of possible emotions."
Towards Contextual Spelling Correction for Customization of End-to-end Speech Recognition Systems,"Contextual biasing is an important and challenging task for end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems, which aims to achieve better recognition performance by biasing the ASR system to particular context phrases such as person names, music list, proper nouns, etc. Existing methods mainly include contextual LM biasing and adding bias encoder into end-to-end ASR models. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to do contextual biasing by adding a contextual spelling correction model on top of the end-to-end ASR system. We incorporate contextual information into a sequence-to-sequence spelling correction model with a shared context encoder. Our proposed model includes two different mechanisms: autoregressive (AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR). We propose filtering algorithms to handle large-size context lists, and performance balancing mechanisms to control the biasing degree of the model. We demonstrate the proposed model is a general biasing solution which is domain-insensitive and can be adopted in different scenarios. Experiments show that the proposed method achieves as much as 51% relative word error rate (WER) reduction over ASR system and outperforms traditional biasing methods. Compared to the AR solution, the proposed NAR model reduces model size by 43.2% and speeds up inference by 2.1 times."
A Conformer Based Acoustic Model for Robust Automatic Speech Recognition,"This study addresses robust automatic speech recognition (ASR) by introducing a Conformer-based acoustic model. The proposed model builds on the wide residual bi-directional long short-term memory network (WRBN) with utterance-wise dropout and iterative speaker adaptation, but employs a Conformer encoder instead of the recurrent network. The Conformer encoder uses a convolution-augmented attention mechanism for acoustic modeling. The proposed system is evaluated on the monaural ASR task of the CHiME-4 corpus. Coupled with utterance-wise normalization and speaker adaptation, our model achieves 6.25\% word error rate, which outperforms WRBN by 8.4\% relatively. In addition, the proposed Conformer-based model is 18.3\% smaller in model size and reduces total training time by 79.6\%."
Visual Speech Recognition for Multiple Languages in the Wild,"Visual speech recognition (VSR) aims to recognize the content of speech based on lip movements, without relying on the audio stream. Advances in deep learning and the availability of large audio-visual datasets have led to the development of much more accurate and robust VSR models than ever before. However, these advances are usually due to the larger training sets rather than the model design. Here we demonstrate that designing better models is equally as important as using larger training sets. We propose the addition of prediction-based auxiliary tasks to a VSR model, and highlight the importance of hyperparameter optimization and appropriate data augmentations. We show that such a model works for different languages and outperforms all previous methods trained on publicly available datasets by a large margin. It even outperforms models that were trained on non-publicly available datasets containing up to to 21 times more data. We show, furthermore, that using additional training data, even in other languages or with automatically generated transcriptions, results in further improvement."
A Survey of Multilingual Models for Automatic Speech Recognition,"Although Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems have achieved human-like performance for a few languages, the majority of the world's languages do not have usable systems due to the lack of large speech datasets to train these models. Cross-lingual transfer is an attractive solution to this problem, because low-resource languages can potentially benefit from higher-resource languages either through transfer learning, or being jointly trained in the same multilingual model. The problem of cross-lingual transfer has been well studied in ASR, however, recent advances in Self Supervised Learning are opening up avenues for unlabeled speech data to be used in multilingual ASR models, which can pave the way for improved performance on low-resource languages. In this paper, we survey the state of the art in multilingual ASR models that are built with cross-lingual transfer in mind. We present best practices for building multilingual models from research across diverse languages and techniques, discuss open questions and provide recommendations for future work."
Towards Better Meta-Initialization with Task Augmentation for Kindergarten-aged Speech Recognition,"Children's automatic speech recognition (ASR) is always difficult due to, in part, the data scarcity problem, especially for kindergarten-aged kids. When data are scarce, the model might overfit to the training data, and hence good starting points for training are essential. Recently, meta-learning was proposed to learn model initialization (MI) for ASR tasks of different languages. This method leads to good performance when the model is adapted to an unseen language. However, MI is vulnerable to overfitting on training tasks (learner overfitting). It is also unknown whether MI generalizes to other low-resource tasks. In this paper, we validate the effectiveness of MI in children's ASR and attempt to alleviate the problem of learner overfitting. To achieve model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML), we regard children's speech at each age as a different task. In terms of learner overfitting, we propose a task-level augmentation method by simulating new ages using frequency warping techniques. Detailed experiments are conducted to show the impact of task augmentation on each age for kindergarten-aged speech. As a result, our approach achieves a relative word error rate (WER) improvement of 51% over the baseline system with no augmentation or initialization."
Adversarial Attacks on Speech Recognition Systems for Mission-Critical Applications: A Survey,"A Machine-Critical Application is a system that is fundamentally necessary to the success of specific and sensitive operations such as search and recovery, rescue, military, and emergency management actions. Recent advances in Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, voice recognition, and speech processing technologies have naturally allowed the development and deployment of speech-based conversational interfaces to interact with various machine-critical applications. While these conversational interfaces have allowed users to give voice commands to carry out strategic and critical activities, their robustness to adversarial attacks remains uncertain and unclear. Indeed, Adversarial Artificial Intelligence (AI) which refers to a set of techniques that attempt to fool machine learning models with deceptive data, is a growing threat in the AI and machine learning research community, in particular for machine-critical applications. The most common reason of adversarial attacks is to cause a malfunction in a machine learning model. An adversarial attack might entail presenting a model with inaccurate or fabricated samples as it's training data, or introducing maliciously designed data to deceive an already trained model. While focusing on speech recognition for machine-critical applications, in this paper, we first review existing speech recognition techniques, then, we investigate the effectiveness of adversarial attacks and defenses against these systems, before outlining research challenges, defense recommendations, and future work. This paper is expected to serve researchers and practitioners as a reference to help them in understanding the challenges, position themselves and, ultimately, help them to improve existing models of speech recognition for mission-critical applications. Keywords: Mission-Critical Applications, Adversarial AI, Speech Recognition Systems."
VADOI:Voice-Activity-Detection Overlapping Inference For End-to-end Long-form Speech Recognition,"While end-to-end models have shown great success on the Automatic Speech Recognition task, performance degrades severely when target sentences are long-form. The previous proposed methods, (partial) overlapping inference are shown to be effective on long-form decoding. For both methods, word error rate (WER) decreases monotonically when overlapping percentage decreases. Setting aside computational cost, the setup with 50% overlapping during inference can achieve the best performance. However, a lower overlapping percentage has an advantage of fast inference speed. In this paper, we first conduct comprehensive experiments comparing overlapping inference and partial overlapping inference with various configurations. We then propose Voice-Activity-Detection Overlapping Inference to provide a trade-off between WER and computation cost. Results show that the proposed method can achieve a 20% relative computation cost reduction on Librispeech and Microsoft Speech Language Translation long-form corpus while maintaining the WER performance when comparing to the best performing overlapping inference algorithm. We also propose Soft-Match to compensate for similar words mis-aligned problem."
Speaker Adaptation Using Spectro-Temporal Deep Features for Dysarthric and Elderly Speech Recognition,"Despite the rapid progress of automatic speech recognition (ASR) technologies targeting normal speech in recent decades, accurate recognition of dysarthric and elderly speech remains highly challenging tasks to date. Sources of heterogeneity commonly found in normal speech including accent or gender, when further compounded with the variability over age and speech pathology severity level, create large diversity among speakers. To this end, speaker adaptation techniques play a key role in personalization of ASR systems for such users. Motivated by the spectro-temporal level differences between dysarthric, elderly and normal speech that systematically manifest in articulatory imprecision, decreased volume and clarity, slower speaking rates and increased dysfluencies, novel spectrotemporal subspace basis deep embedding features derived using SVD speech spectrum decomposition are proposed in this paper to facilitate auxiliary feature based speaker adaptation of state-of-the-art hybrid DNN/TDNN and end-to-end Conformer speech recognition systems. Experiments were conducted on four tasks: the English UASpeech and TORGO dysarthric speech corpora; the English DementiaBank Pitt and Cantonese JCCOCC MoCA elderly speech datasets. The proposed spectro-temporal deep feature adapted systems outperformed baseline i-Vector and xVector adaptation by up to 2.63% absolute (8.63% relative) reduction in word error rate (WER). Consistent performance improvements were retained after model based speaker adaptation using learning hidden unit contributions (LHUC) was further applied. The best speaker adapted system using the proposed spectral basis embedding features produced the lowest published WER of 25.05% on the UASpeech test set of 16 dysarthric speakers."
The PCG-AIID System for L3DAS22 Challenge: MIMO and MISO convolutional recurrent Network for Multi Channel Speech Enhancement and Speech Recognition,"This paper described the PCG-AIID system for L3DAS22 challenge in Task 1: 3D speech enhancement in office reverberant environment. We proposed a two-stage framework to address multi-channel speech denoising and dereverberation. In the first stage, a multiple input and multiple output (MIMO) network is applied to remove background noise while maintaining the spatial characteristics of multi-channel signals. In the second stage, a multiple input and single output (MISO) network is applied to enhance the speech from desired direction and post-filtering. As a result, our system ranked 3rd place in ICASSP2022 L3DAS22 challenge and significantly outperforms the baseline system, while achieving 3.2% WER and 0.972 STOI on the blind test-set."
Curriculum optimization for low-resource speech recognition,"Modern end-to-end speech recognition models show astonishing results in transcribing audio signals into written text. However, conventional data feeding pipelines may be sub-optimal for low-resource speech recognition, which still remains a challenging task. We propose an automated curriculum learning approach to optimize the sequence of training examples based on both the progress of the model while training and prior knowledge about the difficulty of the training examples. We introduce a new difficulty measure called compression ratio that can be used as a scoring function for raw audio in various noise conditions. The proposed method improves speech recognition Word Error Rate performance by up to 33% relative over the baseline system"
AISHELL-NER: Named Entity Recognition from Chinese Speech,"Named Entity Recognition (NER) from speech is among Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) tasks, aiming to extract semantic information from the speech signal. NER from speech is usually made through a two-step pipeline that consists of (1) processing the audio using an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system and (2) applying an NER tagger to the ASR outputs. Recent works have shown the capability of the End-to-End (E2E) approach for NER from English and French speech, which is essentially entity-aware ASR. However, due to the many homophones and polyphones that exist in Chinese, NER from Chinese speech is effectively a more challenging task. In this paper, we introduce a new dataset AISEHLL-NER for NER from Chinese speech. Extensive experiments are conducted to explore the performance of several state-of-the-art methods. The results demonstrate that the performance could be improved by combining entity-aware ASR and pretrained NER tagger, which can be easily applied to the modern SLU pipeline. The dataset is publicly available at github.com/Alibaba-NLP/AISHELL-NER."
Mitigating Closed-model Adversarial Examples with Bayesian Neural Modeling for Enhanced End-to-End Speech Recognition,"In this work, we aim to enhance the system robustness of end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) against adversarially-noisy speech examples. We focus on a rigorous and empirical ""closed-model adversarial robustness"" setting (e.g., on-device or cloud applications). The adversarial noise is only generated by closed-model optimization (e.g., evolutionary and zeroth-order estimation) without accessing gradient information of a targeted ASR model directly. We propose an advanced Bayesian neural network (BNN) based adversarial detector, which could model latent distributions against adaptive adversarial perturbation with divergence measurement. We further simulate deployment scenarios of RNN Transducer, Conformer, and wav2vec-2.0 based ASR systems with the proposed adversarial detection system. Leveraging the proposed BNN based detection system, we improve detection rate by +2.77 to +5.42% (relative +3.03 to +6.26%) and reduce the word error rate by 5.02 to 7.47% on LibriSpeech datasets compared to the current model enhancement methods against the adversarial speech examples."
MLP-ASR: Sequence-length agnostic all-MLP architectures for speech recognition,"We propose multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-based architectures suitable for variable length input. MLP-based architectures, recently proposed for image classification, can only be used for inputs of a fixed, pre-defined size. However, many types of data are naturally variable in length, for example, acoustic signals. We propose three approaches to extend MLP-based architectures for use with sequences of arbitrary length. The first one uses a circular convolution applied in the Fourier domain, the second applies a depthwise convolution, and the final relies on a shift operation. We evaluate the proposed architectures on an automatic speech recognition task with the Librispeech and Tedlium2 corpora. The best proposed MLP-based architectures improves WER by 1.0 / 0.9%, 0.9 / 0.5% on Librispeech dev-clean/dev-other, test-clean/test-other set, and 0.8 / 1.1% on Tedlium2 dev/test set using 86.4% the size of self-attention-based architecture."
Conversational Speech Recognition By Learning Conversation-level Characteristics,"Conversational automatic speech recognition (ASR) is a task to recognize conversational speech including multiple speakers. Unlike sentence-level ASR, conversational ASR can naturally take advantages from specific characteristics of conversation, such as role preference and topical coherence. This paper proposes a conversational ASR model which explicitly learns conversation-level characteristics under the prevalent end-to-end neural framework. The highlights of the proposed model are twofold. First, a latent variational module (LVM) is attached to a conformer-based encoder-decoder ASR backbone to learn role preference and topical coherence. Second, a topic model is specifically adopted to bias the outputs of the decoder to words in the predicted topics. Experiments on two Mandarin conversational ASR tasks show that the proposed model achieves a maximum 12% relative character error rate (CER) reduction."
Learning Contextually Fused Audio-visual Representations for Audio-visual Speech Recognition,"With the advance in self-supervised learning for audio and visual modalities, it has become possible to learn a robust audio-visual speech representation. This would be beneficial for improving the audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) performance, as the multi-modal inputs contain more fruitful information in principle. In this paper, based on existing self-supervised representation learning methods for audio modality, we therefore propose an audio-visual representation learning approach. The proposed approach explores both the complementarity of audio-visual modalities and long-term context dependency using a transformer-based fusion module and a flexible masking strategy. After pre-training, the model is able to extract fused representations required by AVSR. Without loss of generality, it can be applied to single-modal tasks, e.g. audio/visual speech recognition by simply masking out one modality in the fusion module. The proposed pre-trained model is evaluated on speech recognition and lipreading tasks using one or two modalities, where the superiority is revealed."
Improving Automatic Speech Recognition for Non-Native English with Transfer Learning and Language Model Decoding,"ASR systems designed for native English (L1) usually underperform on non-native English (L2). To address this performance gap, \textbf{(i)} we extend our previous work to investigate fine-tuning of a pre-trained wav2vec 2.0 model \cite{baevski2020wav2vec,xu2021self} under a rich set of L1 and L2 training conditions. We further \textbf{(ii)} incorporate language model decoding in the ASR system, along with the fine-tuning method. Quantifying gains acquired from each of these two approaches separately and an error analysis allows us to identify different sources of improvement within our models. We find that while the large self-trained wav2vec 2.0 may be internalizing sufficient decoding knowledge for clean L1 speech \cite{xu2021self}, this does not hold for L2 speech and accounts for the utility of employing language model decoding on L2 data."
ASRPU: A Programmable Accelerator for Low-Power Automatic Speech Recognition,"The outstanding accuracy achieved by modern Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems is enabling them to quickly become a mainstream technology. ASR is essential for many applications, such as speech-based assistants, dictation systems and real-time language translation. However, highly accurate ASR systems are computationally expensive, requiring on the order of billions of arithmetic operations to decode each second of audio, which conflicts with a growing interest in deploying ASR on edge devices. On these devices, hardware acceleration is key for achieving acceptable performance. However, ASR is a rich and fast-changing field, and thus, any overly specialized hardware accelerator may quickly become obsolete.  In this paper, we tackle those challenges by proposing ASRPU, a programmable accelerator for on-edge ASR. ASRPU contains a pool of general-purpose cores that execute small pieces of parallel code. Each of these programs computes one part of the overall decoder (e.g. a layer in a neural network). The accelerator automates some carefully chosen parts of the decoder to simplify the programming without sacrificing generality. We provide an analysis of a modern ASR system implemented on ASRPU and show that this architecture can achieve real-time decoding with a very low power budget."
Speech Emotion Recognition using Self-Supervised Features,"Self-supervised pre-trained features have consistently delivered state-of-art results in the field of natural language processing (NLP); however, their merits in the field of speech emotion recognition (SER) still need further investigation. In this paper we introduce a modular End-to- End (E2E) SER system based on an Upstream + Downstream architecture paradigm, which allows easy use/integration of a large variety of self-supervised features. Several SER experiments for predicting categorical emotion classes from the IEMOCAP dataset are performed. These experiments investigate interactions among fine-tuning of self-supervised feature models, aggregation of frame-level features into utterance-level features and back-end classification networks. The proposed monomodal speechonly based system not only achieves SOTA results, but also brings light to the possibility of powerful and well finetuned self-supervised acoustic features that reach results similar to the results achieved by SOTA multimodal systems using both Speech and Text modalities."
A two-step approach to leverage contextual data: speech recognition in air-traffic communications,"Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), as the assistance of speech communication between pilots and air-traffic controllers, can significantly reduce the complexity of the task and increase the reliability of transmitted information. ASR application can lead to a lower number of incidents caused by misunderstanding and improve air traffic management (ATM) efficiency. Evidently, high accuracy predictions, especially, of key information, i.e., callsigns and commands, are required to minimize the risk of errors. We prove that combining the benefits of ASR and Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to make use of surveillance data (i.e. additional modality) helps to considerably improve the recognition of callsigns (named entity). In this paper, we investigate a two-step callsign boosting approach: (1) at the 1 step (ASR), weights of probable callsign n-grams are reduced in G.fst and/or in the decoding FST (lattices), (2) at the 2 step (NLP), callsigns extracted from the improved recognition outputs with Named Entity Recognition (NER) are correlated with the surveillance data to select the most suitable one. Boosting callsign n-grams with the combination of ASR and NLP methods eventually leads up to 53.7% of an absolute, or 60.4% of a relative, improvement in callsign recognition."
Efficient Adapter Transfer of Self-Supervised Speech Models for Automatic Speech Recognition,"Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a powerful tool that allows learning of underlying representations from unlabeled data. Transformer based models such as wav2vec 2.0 and HuBERT are leading the field in the speech domain. Generally these models are fine-tuned on a small amount of labeled data for a downstream task such as Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). This involves re-training the majority of the model for each task. Adapters are small lightweight modules which are commonly used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) to adapt pre-trained models to new tasks. In this paper we propose applying adapters to wav2vec 2.0 to reduce the number of parameters required for downstream ASR tasks, and increase scalability of the model to multiple tasks or languages. Using adapters we can perform ASR while training fewer than 10% of parameters per task compared to full fine-tuning with little degradation of performance. Ablations show that applying adapters into just the top few layers of the pre-trained network gives similar performance to full transfer, supporting the theory that higher pre-trained layers encode more phonemic information, and further optimizing efficiency."
Privacy-preserving Speech Emotion Recognition through Semi-Supervised Federated Learning,"Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) refers to the recognition of human emotions from natural speech. If done accurately, it can offer a number of benefits in building human-centered context-aware intelligent systems. Existing SER approaches are largely centralized, without considering users' privacy. Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm dealing with decentralization of privacy-sensitive personal data. In this paper, we present a privacy-preserving and data-efficient SER approach by utilizing the concept of FL. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first federated SER approach, which utilizes self-training learning in conjunction with federated learning to exploit both labeled and unlabeled on-device data. Our experimental evaluations on the IEMOCAP dataset shows that our federated approach can learn generalizable SER models even under low availability of data labels and highly non-i.i.d. distributions. We show that our approach with as few as 10% labeled data, on average, can improve the recognition rate by 8.67% compared to the fully-supervised federated counterparts."
Self-supervised Learning with Random-projection Quantizer for Speech Recognition,"We present a simple and effective self-supervised learning approach for speech recognition. The approach learns a model to predict the masked speech signals, in the form of discrete labels generated with a random-projection quantizer. In particular the quantizer projects speech inputs with a randomly initialized matrix, and does a nearest-neighbor lookup in a randomly-initialized codebook. Neither the matrix nor the codebook is updated during self-supervised learning. Since the random-projection quantizer is not trained and is separated from the speech recognition model, the design makes the approach flexible and is compatible with universal speech recognition architecture. On LibriSpeech our approach achieves similar word-error-rates as previous work using self-supervised learning with non-streaming models, and provides lower word-error-rates and latency than wav2vec 2.0 and w2v-BERT with streaming models. On multilingual tasks the approach also provides significant improvement over wav2vec 2.0 and w2v-BERT."
The RoyalFlush System of Speech Recognition for M2MeT Challenge,"This paper describes our RoyalFlush system for the track of multi-speaker automatic speech recognition (ASR) in the M2MeT challenge. We adopted the serialized output training (SOT) based multi-speakers ASR system with large-scale simulation data. Firstly, we investigated a set of front-end methods, including multi-channel weighted predicted error (WPE), beamforming, speech separation, speech enhancement and so on, to process training, validation and test sets. But we only selected WPE and beamforming as our frontend methods according to their experimental results. Secondly, we made great efforts in the data augmentation for multi-speaker ASR, mainly including adding noise and reverberation, overlapped speech simulation, multi-channel speech simulation, speed perturbation, front-end processing, and so on, which brought us a great performance improvement. Finally, in order to make full use of the performance complementary of different model architecture, we trained the standard conformer based joint CTC/Attention (Conformer) and U2++ ASR model with a bidirectional attention decoder, a modification of Conformer, to fuse their results. Comparing with the official baseline system, our system got a 12.22% absolute Character Error Rate (CER) reduction on the validation set and 12.11% on the test set."
Joint Speech Recognition and Audio Captioning,"Speech samples recorded in both indoor and outdoor environments are often contaminated with secondary audio sources. Most end-to-end monaural speech recognition systems either remove these background sounds using speech enhancement or train noise-robust models. For better model interpretability and holistic understanding, we aim to bring together the growing field of automated audio captioning (AAC) and the thoroughly studied automatic speech recognition (ASR). The goal of AAC is to generate natural language descriptions of contents in audio samples. We propose several approaches for end-to-end joint modeling of ASR and AAC tasks and demonstrate their advantages over traditional approaches, which model these tasks independently. A major hurdle in evaluating our proposed approach is the lack of labeled audio datasets with both speech transcriptions and audio captions. Therefore we also create a multi-task dataset by mixing the clean speech Wall Street Journal corpus with multiple levels of background noises chosen from the AudioCaps dataset. We also perform extensive experimental evaluation and show improvements of our proposed methods as compared to existing state-of-the-art ASR and AAC methods."
Speaker Normalization for Self-supervised Speech Emotion Recognition,"Large speech emotion recognition datasets are hard to obtain, and small datasets may contain biases. Deep-net-based classifiers, in turn, are prone to exploit those biases and find shortcuts such as speaker characteristics. These shortcuts usually harm a model's ability to generalize. To address this challenge, we propose a gradient-based adversary learning framework that learns a speech emotion recognition task while normalizing speaker characteristics from the feature representation. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on both speaker-independent and speaker-dependent settings and obtain new state-of-the-art results on the challenging IEMOCAP dataset."
RescoreBERT: Discriminative Speech Recognition Rescoring with BERT,"Second-pass rescoring is an important component in automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems that is used to improve the outputs from a first-pass decoder by implementing a lattice rescoring or n-best re-ranking. While pretraining with a masked language model (MLM) objective has received great success in various natural language understanding (NLU) tasks, it has not gained traction as a rescoring model for ASR. Specifically, training a bidirectional model like BERT on a discriminative objective such as minimum WER (MWER) has not been explored. Here we show how to train a BERT-based rescoring model with MWER loss, to incorporate the improvements of a discriminative loss into fine-tuning of deep bidirectional pretrained models for ASR. Specifically, we propose a fusion strategy that incorporates the MLM into the discriminative training process to effectively distill knowledge from a pretrained model. We further propose an alternative discriminative loss. This approach, which we call RescoreBERT, reduces WER by 6.6%/3.4% relative on the LibriSpeech clean/other test sets over a BERT baseline without discriminative objective. We also evaluate our method on an internal dataset from a conversational agent and find that it reduces both latency and WER (by 3 to 8% relative) over an LSTM rescoring model."
Visualizing Automatic Speech Recognition -- Means for a Better Understanding?,"Automatic speech recognition (ASR) is improving ever more at mimicking human speech processing. The functioning of ASR, however, remains to a large extent obfuscated by the complex structure of the deep neural networks (DNNs) they are based on. In this paper, we show how so-called attribution methods, that we import from image recognition and suitably adapt to handle audio data, can help to clarify the working of ASR. Taking DeepSpeech, an end-to-end model for ASR, as a case study, we show how these techniques help to visualize which features of the input are the most influential in determining the output. We focus on three visualization techniques: Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), Saliency Maps, and Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP). We compare these methods and discuss potential further applications, such as in the detection of adversarial examples."
Language Dependencies in Adversarial Attacks on Speech Recognition Systems,"Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems are ubiquitously present in our daily devices. They are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where manipulated input samples fool the ASR system's recognition. While adversarial examples for various English ASR systems have already been analyzed, there exists no inter-language comparative vulnerability analysis. We compare the attackability of a German and an English ASR system, taking Deepspeech as an example. We investigate if one of the language models is more susceptible to manipulations than the other. The results of our experiments suggest statistically significant differences between English and German in terms of computational effort necessary for the successful generation of adversarial examples. This result encourages further research in language-dependent characteristics in the robustness analysis of ASR."
Improving End-to-End Contextual Speech Recognition with Fine-Grained Contextual Knowledge Selection,"Nowadays, most methods in end-to-end contextual speech recognition bias the recognition process towards contextual knowledge. Since all-neural contextual biasing methods rely on phrase-level contextual modeling and attention-based relevance modeling, they may encounter confusion between similar context-specific phrases, which hurts predictions at the token level. In this work, we focus on mitigating confusion problems with fine-grained contextual knowledge selection (FineCoS). In FineCoS, we introduce fine-grained knowledge to reduce the uncertainty of token predictions. Specifically, we first apply phrase selection to narrow the range of phrase candidates, and then conduct token attention on the tokens in the selected phrase candidates. Moreover, we re-normalize the attention weights of most relevant phrases in inference to obtain more focused phrase-level contextual representations, and inject position information to better discriminate phrases or tokens. On LibriSpeech and an in-house 160,000-hour dataset, we explore the proposed methods based on a controllable all-neural biasing method, collaborative decoding (ColDec). The proposed methods provide at most 6.1% relative word error rate reduction on LibriSpeech and 16.4% relative character error rate reduction on the in-house dataset over ColDec."
Reducing language context confusion for end-to-end code-switching automatic speech recognition,"Code-switching deals with alternative languages in communication process. Training end-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems for code-switching is especially challenging as code-switching training data are always insufficient to combat the increased multilingual context confusion due to the presence of more than one language. We propose a language-related attention mechanism to reduce multilingual context confusion for the E2E code-switching ASR model based on the Equivalence Constraint (EC) Theory. The linguistic theory requires that any monolingual fragment that occurs in the code-switching sentence must occur in one of the monolingual sentences. The theory establishes a bridge between monolingual data and code-switching data. We leverage this linguistics theory to design the code-switching E2E ASR model. The proposed model efficiently transfers language knowledge from rich monolingual data to improve the performance of the code-switching ASR model. We evaluate our model on ASRU 2019 Mandarin-English code-switching challenge dataset. Compared to the baseline model, our proposed model achieves a 17.12% relative error reduction."
Neural-FST Class Language Model for End-to-End Speech Recognition,"We propose Neural-FST Class Language Model (NFCLM) for end-to-end speech recognition, a novel method that combines neural network language models (NNLMs) and finite state transducers (FSTs) in a mathematically consistent framework. Our method utilizes a background NNLM which models generic background text together with a collection of domain-specific entities modeled as individual FSTs. Each output token is generated by a mixture of these components; the mixture weights are estimated with a separately trained neural decider. We show that NFCLM significantly outperforms NNLM by 15.8% relative in terms of Word Error Rate. NFCLM achieves similar performance as traditional NNLM and FST shallow fusion while being less prone to overbiasing and 12 times more compact, making it more suitable for on-device usage."
Sentiment-Aware Automatic Speech Recognition pre-training for enhanced Speech Emotion Recognition,"We propose a novel multi-task pre-training method for Speech Emotion Recognition (SER). We pre-train SER model simultaneously on Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and sentiment classification tasks to make the acoustic ASR model more ``emotion aware''. We generate targets for the sentiment classification using text-to-sentiment model trained on publicly available data. Finally, we fine-tune the acoustic ASR on emotion annotated speech data. We evaluated the proposed approach on the MSP-Podcast dataset, where we achieved the best reported concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of 0.41 for valence prediction."
Synthesizing Dysarthric Speech Using Multi-talker TTS for Dysarthric Speech Recognition,"Dysarthria is a motor speech disorder often characterized by reduced speech intelligibility through slow, uncoordinated control of speech production muscles. Automatic Speech recognition (ASR) systems may help dysarthric talkers communicate more effectively. To have robust dysarthria-specific ASR, sufficient training speech is required, which is not readily available. Recent advances in Text-To-Speech (TTS) synthesis multi-speaker end-to-end TTS systems suggest the possibility of using synthesis for data augmentation. In this paper, we aim to improve multi-speaker end-to-end TTS systems to synthesize dysarthric speech for improved training of a dysarthria-specific DNN-HMM ASR. In the synthesized speech, we add dysarthria severity level and pause insertion mechanisms to other control parameters such as pitch, energy, and duration. Results show that a DNN-HMM model trained on additional synthetic dysarthric speech achieves WER improvement of 12.2% compared to the baseline, the addition of the severity level and pause insertion controls decrease WER by 6.5%, showing the effectiveness of adding these parameters. Audio samples are available at"
Discovering Phonetic Inventories with Crosslingual Automatic Speech Recognition,"The high cost of data acquisition makes Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model training problematic for most existing languages, including languages that do not even have a written script, or for which the phone inventories remain unknown. Past works explored multilingual training, transfer learning, as well as zero-shot learning in order to build ASR systems for these low-resource languages. While it has been shown that the pooling of resources from multiple languages is helpful, we have not yet seen a successful application of an ASR model to a language unseen during training. A crucial step in the adaptation of ASR from seen to unseen languages is the creation of the phone inventory of the unseen language. The ultimate goal of our work is to build the phone inventory of a language unseen during training in an unsupervised way without any knowledge about the language. In this paper, we 1) investigate the influence of different factors (i.e., model architecture, phonotactic model, type of speech representation) on phone recognition in an unknown language; 2) provide an analysis of which phones transfer well across languages and which do not in order to understand the limitations of and areas for further improvement for automatic phone inventory creation; and 3) present different methods to build a phone inventory of an unseen language in an unsupervised way. To that end, we conducted mono-, multi-, and crosslingual experiments on a set of 13 phonetically diverse languages and several in-depth analyses. We found a number of universal phone tokens (IPA symbols) that are well-recognized cross-linguistically. Through a detailed analysis of results, we conclude that unique sounds, similar sounds, and tone languages remain a major challenge for phonetic inventory discovery."
Transformer-Based Video Front-Ends for Audio-Visual Speech Recognition for Single and Multi-Person Video,"Audio-visual automatic speech recognition (AV-ASR) extends speech recognition by introducing the video modality as an additional source of information. In this work, the information contained in the motion of the speaker's mouth is used to augment the audio features. The video modality is traditionally processed with a 3D convolutional neural network (e.g. 3D version of VGG). Recently, image transformer networks arXiv:2010.11929 demonstrated the ability to extract rich visual features for image classification tasks. Here, we propose to replace the 3D convolution with a video transformer to extract visual features. We train our baselines and the proposed model on a large scale corpus of YouTube videos. The performance of our approach is evaluated on a labeled subset of YouTube videos as well as on the LRS3-TED public corpus. Our best video-only model obtains 31.4% WER on YTDEV18 and 17.0% on LRS3-TED, a 10% and 15% relative improvements over our convolutional baseline. We achieve the state of the art performance of the audio-visual recognition on the LRS3-TED after fine-tuning our model (1.6% WER). In addition, in a series of experiments on multi-person AV-ASR, we obtained an average relative reduction of 2% over our convolutional video frontend."
Improving non-autoregressive end-to-end speech recognition with pre-trained acoustic and language models,"While Transformers have achieved promising results in end-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR), their autoregressive (AR) structure becomes a bottleneck for speeding up the decoding process. For real-world deployment, ASR systems are desired to be highly accurate while achieving fast inference. Non-autoregressive (NAR) models have become a popular alternative due to their fast inference speed, but they still fall behind AR systems in recognition accuracy. To fulfill the two demands, in this paper, we propose a NAR CTC/attention model utilizing both pre-trained acoustic and language models: wav2vec2.0 and BERT. To bridge the modality gap between speech and text representations obtained from the pre-trained models, we design a novel modality conversion mechanism, which is more suitable for logographic languages. During inference, we employ a CTC branch to generate a target length, which enables the BERT to predict tokens in parallel. We also design a cache-based CTC/attention joint decoding method to improve the recognition accuracy while keeping the decoding speed fast. Experimental results show that the proposed NAR model greatly outperforms our strong wav2vec2.0 CTC baseline (15.1% relative CER reduction on AISHELL-1). The proposed NAR model significantly surpasses previous NAR systems on the AISHELL-1 benchmark and shows a potential for English tasks."
Data and knowledge-driven approaches for multilingual training to improve the performance of speech recognition systems of Indian languages,"We propose data and knowledge-driven approaches for multilingual training of the automated speech recognition (ASR) system for a target language by pooling speech data from multiple source languages. Exploiting the acoustic similarities between Indian languages, we implement two approaches. In phone/senone mapping, deep neural network (DNN) learns to map senones or phones from one language to the others, and the transcriptions of the source languages are modified such that they can be used along with the target language data to train and fine-tune the target language ASR system. In the other approach, we model the acoustic information for all the languages simultaneously by training a multitask DNN (MTDNN) to predict the senones of each language in different output layers. The cross-entropy loss and the weight update procedure are modified such that only the shared layers and the output layer responsible for predicting the senone classes of a language are updated during training, if the feature vector belongs to that particular language. In the low-resource setting (LRS), 40 hours of transcribed data each for Tamil, Telugu and Gujarati languages are used for training. The DNN based senone mapping technique gives relative improvements in word error rates (WER) of 9.66%, 7.2% and 15.21% over the baseline system for Tamil, Gujarati and Telugu languages, respectively. In medium-resourced setting (MRS), 160, 275 and 135 hours of data for Tamil, Kannada and Hindi languages are used, where, the same technique gives better relative improvements of 13.94%, 10.28% and 27.24% for Tamil, Kannada and Hindi, respectively. The MTDNN with senone mapping based training in LRS, gives higher relative WER improvements of 15.0%, 17.54% and 16.06%, respectively for Tamil, Gujarati and Telugu, whereas in MRS, we see improvements of 21.24% 21.05% and 30.17% for Tamil, Kannada and Hindi languages, respectively."
Investigation of Deep Neural Network Acoustic Modelling Approaches for Low Resource Accented Mandarin Speech Recognition,"The Mandarin Chinese language is known to be strongly influenced by a rich set of regional accents, while Mandarin speech with each accent is quite low resource. Hence, an important task in Mandarin speech recognition is to appropriately model the acoustic variabilities imposed by accents. In this paper, an investigation of implicit and explicit use of accent information on a range of deep neural network (DNN) based acoustic modelling techniques is conducted. Meanwhile, approaches of multi-accent modelling including multi-style training, multi-accent decision tree state tying, DNN tandem and multi-level adaptive network (MLAN) tandem hidden Markov model (HMM) modelling are combined and compared in this paper. On a low resource accented Mandarin speech recognition task consisting of four regional accents, an improved MLAN tandem HMM systems explicitly leveraging the accent information was proposed and significantly outperformed the baseline accent independent DNN tandem systems by 0.8%-1.5% absolute (6%-9% relative) in character error rate after sequence level discriminative training and adaptation."
Variational Auto-Encoder Based Variability Encoding for Dysarthric Speech Recognition,"Dysarthric speech recognition is a challenging task due to acoustic variability and limited amount of available data. Diverse conditions of dysarthric speakers account for the acoustic variability, which make the variability difficult to be modeled precisely. This paper presents a variational auto-encoder based variability encoder (VAEVE) to explicitly encode such variability for dysarthric speech. The VAEVE makes use of both phoneme information and low-dimensional latent variable to reconstruct the input acoustic features, thereby the latent variable is forced to encode the phoneme-independent variability. Stochastic gradient variational Bayes algorithm is applied to model the distribution for generating variability encodings, which are further used as auxiliary features for DNN acoustic modeling. Experiment results conducted on the UASpeech corpus show that the VAEVE based variability encodings have complementary effect to the learning hidden unit contributions (LHUC) speaker adaptation. The systems using variability encodings consistently outperform the comparable baseline systems without using them, and""  obtain absolute word error rate (WER) reduction by up to 2.2% on dysarthric speech with ""Very lowintelligibility level, and up to 2% on the ""Mixed"" type of dysarthric speech with diverse or uncertain conditions."
A Noise-Robust Self-supervised Pre-training Model Based Speech Representation Learning for Automatic Speech Recognition,"Wav2vec2.0 is a popular self-supervised pre-training framework for learning speech representations in the context of automatic speech recognition (ASR). It was shown that wav2vec2.0 has a good robustness against the domain shift, while the noise robustness is still unclear. In this work, we therefore first analyze the noise robustness of wav2vec2.0 via experiments. We observe that wav2vec2.0 pre-trained on noisy data can obtain good representations and thus improve the ASR performance on the noisy test set, which however brings a performance degradation on the clean test set. To avoid this issue, in this work we propose an enhanced wav2vec2.0 model. Specifically, the noisy speech and the corresponding clean version are fed into the same feature encoder, where the clean speech provides training targets for the model. Experimental results reveal that the proposed method can not only improve the ASR performance on the noisy test set which surpasses the original wav2vec2.0, but also ensure a tiny performance decrease on the clean test set. In addition, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated under different types of noise conditions."
Unsupervised Personalization of an Emotion Recognition System: The Unique Properties of the Externalization of Valence in Speech,"The prediction of valence from speech is an important, but challenging problem. The externalization of valence in speech has speaker-dependent cues, which contribute to performances that are often significantly lower than the prediction of other emotional attributes such as arousal and dominance. A practical approach to improve valence prediction from speech is to adapt the models to the target speakers in the test set. Adapting a speech emotion recognition (SER) system to a particular speaker is a hard problem, especially with deep neural networks (DNNs), since it requires optimizing millions of parameters. This study proposes an unsupervised approach to address this problem by searching for speakers in the train set with similar acoustic patterns as the speaker in the test set. Speech samples from the selected speakers are used to create the adaptation set. This approach leverages transfer learning using pre-trained models, which are adapted with these speech samples. We propose three alternative adaptation strategies: unique speaker, oversampling and weighting approaches. These methods differ on the use of the adaptation set in the personalization of the valence models. The results demonstrate that a valence prediction model can be efficiently personalized with these unsupervised approaches, leading to relative improvements as high as 13.52%."
Human and Automatic Speech Recognition Performance on German Oral History Interviews,"Automatic speech recognition systems have accomplished remarkable improvements in transcription accuracy in recent years. On some domains, models now achieve near-human performance. However, transcription performance on oral history has not yet reached human accuracy. In the present work, we investigate how large this gap between human and machine transcription still is. For this purpose, we analyze and compare transcriptions of three humans on a new oral history data set. We estimate a human word error rate of 8.7% for recent German oral history interviews with clean acoustic conditions. For comparison with recent machine transcription accuracy, we present experiments on the adaptation of an acoustic model achieving near-human performance on broadcast speech. We investigate the influence of different adaptation data on robustness and generalization for clean and noisy oral history interviews. We optimize our acoustic models by 5 to 8% relative for this task and achieve 23.9% WER on noisy and 15.6% word error rate on clean oral history interviews."
Comparative Study of Acoustic Echo Cancellation Algorithms for Speech Recognition System in Noisy Environment,"Traditionally, adaptive filters have been deployed to achieve AEC by estimating the acoustic echo response using algorithms such as the Normalized Least-Mean-Square (NLMS) algorithm. Several approaches have been proposed over recent years to improve the performance of the standard NLMS algorithm in various ways for AEC. These include algorithms based on Time Domain, Frequency Domain, Fourier Transform, Wavelet Transform Adaptive Schemes, Proportionate Schemes, Proportionate Adaptive Filters, Combination Schemes, Block Based Combination, Sub band Adaptive Filtering, Uniform Over Sampled DFT Filter Banks, Sub band Over-Sampled DFT Filter Banks, Volterra Filters, Variable Step-Size (VSS) algorithms, Data Reusing Techniques, Partial Update Adaptive Filtering Techniques and Sub band (SAF) Schemes. These approaches aim to address issues in echo cancellation including the performance with noisy input signals, Time-Varying echo paths and computational complexity. In contrast to these approaches, Sparse Adaptive algorithms have been developed specifically to address the performance of adaptive filters in sparse system identification. In this paper we have discussed some AEC algorithms followed by comparative study with respective to step-size, convergence and performance."
Recent Progress in the CUHK Dysarthric Speech Recognition System,"Despite the rapid progress of automatic speech recognition (ASR) technologies in the past few decades, recognition of disordered speech remains a highly challenging task to date. Disordered speech presents a wide spectrum of challenges to current data intensive deep neural networks (DNNs) based ASR technologies that predominantly target normal speech. This paper presents recent research efforts at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) to improve the performance of disordered speech recognition systems on the largest publicly available UASpeech dysarthric speech corpus. A set of novel modelling techniques including neural architectural search, data augmentation using spectra-temporal perturbation, model based speaker adaptation and cross-domain generation of visual features within an audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) system framework were employed to address the above challenges. The combination of these techniques produced the lowest published word error rate (WER) of 25.21% on the UASpeech test set 16 dysarthric speakers, and an overall WER reduction of 5.4% absolute (17.6% relative) over the CUHK 2018 dysarthric speech recognition system featuring a 6-way DNN system combination and cross adaptation of out-of-domain normal speech data trained systems. Bayesian model adaptation further allows rapid adaptation to individual dysarthric speakers to be performed using as little as 3.06 seconds of speech. The efficacy of these techniques were further demonstrated on a CUDYS Cantonese dysarthric speech recognition task."
Investigation of Data Augmentation Techniques for Disordered Speech Recognition,"Disordered speech recognition is a highly challenging task. The underlying neuro-motor conditions of people with speech disorders, often compounded with co-occurring physical disabilities, lead to the difficulty in collecting large quantities of speech required for system development. This paper investigates a set of data augmentation techniques for disordered speech recognition, including vocal tract length perturbation (VTLP), tempo perturbation and speed perturbation. Both normal and disordered speech were exploited in the augmentation process. Variability among impaired speakers in both the original and augmented data was modeled using learning hidden unit contributions (LHUC) based speaker adaptive training. The final speaker adapted system constructed using the UASpeech corpus and the best augmentation approach based on speed perturbation produced up to 2.92% absolute (9.3% relative) word error rate (WER) reduction over the baseline system without data augmentation, and gave an overall WER of 26.37% on the test set containing 16 dysarthric speakers."
Spectro-Temporal Deep Features for Disordered Speech Assessment and Recognition,"Automatic recognition of disordered speech remains a highly challenging task to date. Sources of variability commonly found in normal speech including accent, age or gender, when further compounded with the underlying causes of speech impairment and varying severity levels, create large diversity among speakers. To this end, speaker adaptation techniques play a vital role in current speech recognition systems. Motivated by the spectro-temporal level differences between disordered and normal speech that systematically manifest in articulatory imprecision, decreased volume and clarity, slower speaking rates and increased dysfluencies, novel spectro-temporal subspace basis embedding deep features derived by SVD decomposition of speech spectrum are proposed to facilitate both accurate speech intelligibility assessment and auxiliary feature based speaker adaptation of state-of-the-art hybrid DNN and end-to-end disordered speech recognition systems. Experiments conducted on the UASpeech corpus suggest the proposed spectro-temporal deep feature adapted systems consistently outperformed baseline i-Vector adaptation by up to 2.63% absolute (8.6% relative) reduction in word error rate (WER) with or without data augmentation. Learning hidden unit contribution (LHUC) based speaker adaptation was further applied. The final speaker adapted system using the proposed spectral basis embedding features gave an overall WER of 25.6% on the UASpeech test set of 16 dysarthric speakers"
The Effectiveness of Time Stretching for Enhancing Dysarthric Speech for Improved Dysarthric Speech Recognition,"In this paper, we investigate several existing and a new state-of-the-art generative adversarial network-based (GAN) voice conversion method for enhancing dysarthric speech for improved dysarthric speech recognition. We compare key components of existing methods as part of a rigorous ablation study to find the most effective solution to improve dysarthric speech recognition. We find that straightforward signal processing methods such as stationary noise removal and vocoder-based time stretching lead to dysarthric speech recognition results comparable to those obtained when using state-of-the-art GAN-based voice conversion methods as measured using a phoneme recognition task. Additionally, our proposed solution of a combination of MaskCycleGAN-VC and time stretched enhancement is able to improve the phoneme recognition results for certain dysarthric speakers compared to our time stretched baseline."
Learning to Enhance or Not: Neural Network-Based Switching of Enhanced and Observed Signals for Overlapping Speech Recognition,"The combination of a deep neural network (DNN) -based speech enhancement (SE) front-end and an automatic speech recognition (ASR) back-end is a widely used approach to implement overlapping speech recognition. However, the SE front-end generates processing artifacts that can degrade the ASR performance. We previously found that such performance degradation can occur even under fully overlapping conditions, depending on the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To mitigate the degradation, we introduced a rule-based method to switch the ASR input between the enhanced and observed signals, which showed promising results. However, the rule's optimality was unclear because it was heuristically designed and based only on SIR and SNR values. In this work, we propose a DNN-based switching method that directly estimates whether ASR will perform better on the enhanced or observed signals. We also introduce soft-switching that computes a weighted sum of the enhanced and observed signals for ASR input, with weights given by the switching model's output posteriors. The proposed learning-based switching showed performance comparable to that of rule-based oracle switching. The soft-switching further improved the ASR performance and achieved a relative character error rate reduction of up to 23 % as compared with the conventional method."
CI-AVSR: A Cantonese Audio-Visual Speech Dataset for In-car Command Recognition,"With the rise of deep learning and intelligent vehicle, the smart assistant has become an essential in-car component to facilitate driving and provide extra functionalities. In-car smart assistants should be able to process general as well as car-related commands and perform corresponding actions, which eases driving and improves safety. However, there is a data scarcity issue for low resource languages, hindering the development of research and applications. In this paper, we introduce a new dataset, Cantonese In-car Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (CI-AVSR), for in-car command recognition in the Cantonese language with both video and audio data. It consists of 4,984 samples (8.3 hours) of 200 in-car commands recorded by 30 native Cantonese speakers. Furthermore, we augment our dataset using common in-car background noises to simulate real environments, producing a dataset 10 times larger than the collected one. We provide detailed statistics of both the clean and the augmented versions of our dataset. Moreover, we implement two multimodal baselines to demonstrate the validity of CI-AVSR. Experiment results show that leveraging the visual signal improves the overall performance of the model. Although our best model can achieve a considerable quality on the clean test set, the speech recognition quality on the noisy data is still inferior and remains as an extremely challenging task for real in-car speech recognition systems. The dataset and code will be released at https://github.com/HLTCHKUST/CI-AVSR."
A study on cross-corpus speech emotion recognition and data augmentation,"Models that can handle a wide range of speakers and acoustic conditions are essential in speech emotion recognition (SER). Often, these models tend to show mixed results when presented with speakers or acoustic conditions that were not visible during training. This paper investigates the impact of cross-corpus data complementation and data augmentation on the performance of SER models in matched (test-set from same corpus) and mismatched (test-set from different corpus) conditions. Investigations using six emotional speech corpora that include single and multiple speakers as well as variations in emotion style (acted, elicited, natural) and recording conditions are presented. Observations show that, as expected, models trained on single corpora perform best in matched conditions while performance decreases between 10-40% in mismatched conditions, depending on corpus specific features. Models trained on mixed corpora can be more stable in mismatched contexts, and the performance reductions range from 1 to 8% when compared with single corpus models in matched conditions. Data augmentation yields additional gains up to 4% and seem to benefit mismatched conditions more than matched ones."
Textual Data Augmentation for Arabic-English Code-Switching Speech Recognition,"The pervasiveness of intra-utterance code-switching (CS) in spoken content requires that speech recognition (ASR) systems handle mixed language. Designing a CS-ASR system has many challenges, mainly due to data scarcity, grammatical structure complexity, and domain mismatch. The most common method for addressing CS is to train an ASR system with the available transcribed CS speech, along with monolingual data. In this work, we propose a zero-shot learning methodology for CS-ASR by augmenting the monolingual data with artificially generating CS text. We based our approach on random lexical replacements and Equivalence Constraint (EC) while exploiting aligned translation pairs to generate random and grammatically valid CS content. Our empirical results show a 65.5% relative reduction in language model perplexity, and 7.7% in ASR WER on two ecologically valid CS test sets. The human evaluation of the generated text using EC suggests that more than 80% is of adequate quality."
Automatic Speech Recognition Datasets in Cantonese: A Survey and New Dataset,"Automatic speech recognition (ASR) on low resource languages improves the access of linguistic minorities to technological advantages provided by artificial intelligence (AI). In this paper, we address the problem of data scarcity for the Hong Kong Cantonese language by creating a new Cantonese dataset. Our dataset, Multi-Domain Cantonese Corpus (MDCC), consists of 73.6 hours of clean read speech paired with transcripts, collected from Cantonese audiobooks from Hong Kong. It comprises philosophy, politics, education, culture, lifestyle and family domains, covering a wide range of topics. We also review all existing Cantonese datasets and analyze them according to their speech type, data source, total size and availability. We further conduct experiments with Fairseq S2T Transformer, a state-of-the-art ASR model, on the biggest existing dataset, Common Voice zh-HK, and our proposed MDCC, and the results show the effectiveness of our dataset. In addition, we create a powerful and robust Cantonese ASR model by applying multi-dataset learning on MDCC and Common Voice zh-HK."
Improving Mandarin End-to-End Speech Recognition with Word N-gram Language Model,"Despite the rapid progress of end-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR), it has been shown that incorporating external language models (LMs) into the decoding can further improve the recognition performance of E2E ASR systems. To align with the modeling units adopted in E2E ASR systems, subword-level (e.g., characters, BPE) LMs are usually used to cooperate with current E2E ASR systems. However, the use of subword-level LMs will ignore the word-level information, which may limit the strength of the external LMs in E2E ASR. Although several methods have been proposed to incorporate word-level external LMs in E2E ASR, these methods are mainly designed for languages with clear word boundaries such as English and cannot be directly applied to languages like Mandarin, in which each character sequence can have multiple corresponding word sequences. To this end, we propose a novel decoding algorithm where a word-level lattice is constructed on-the-fly to consider all possible word sequences for each partial hypothesis. Then, the LM score of the hypothesis is obtained by intersecting the generated lattice with an external word N-gram LM. The proposed method is examined on both Attention-based Encoder-Decoder (AED) and Neural Transducer (NT) frameworks. Experiments suggest that our method consistently outperforms subword-level LMs, including N-gram LM and neural network LM. We achieve state-of-the-art results on both Aishell-1 (CER 4.18%) and Aishell-2 (CER 5.06%) datasets and reduce CER by 14.8% relatively on a 21K-hour Mandarin dataset."
Robust Self-Supervised Audio-Visual Speech Recognition,"Audio-based automatic speech recognition (ASR) degrades significantly in noisy environments and is particularly vulnerable to interfering speech, as the model cannot determine which speaker to transcribe. Audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) systems improve robustness by complementing the audio stream with the visual information that is invariant to noise and helps the model focus on the desired speaker. However, previous AVSR work focused solely on the supervised learning setup; hence the progress was hindered by the amount of labeled data available. In this work, we present a self-supervised AVSR framework built upon Audio-Visual HuBERT (AV-HuBERT), a state-of-the-art audio-visual speech representation learning model. On the largest available AVSR benchmark dataset LRS3, our approach outperforms prior state-of-the-art by ~50% (28.0% vs. 14.1%) using less than 10% of labeled data (433hr vs. 30hr) in the presence of babble noise, while reducing the WER of an audio-based model by over 75% (25.8% vs. 5.8%) on average."
Multi-Dialect Arabic Speech Recognition,"This paper presents the design and development of multi-dialect automatic speech recognition for Arabic. Deep neural networks are becoming an effective tool to solve sequential data problems, particularly, adopting an end-to-end training of the system. Arabic speech recognition is a complex task because of the existence of multiple dialects, non-availability of large corpora, and missing vocalization. Thus, the first contribution of this work is the development of a large multi-dialectal corpus with either full or at least partially vocalized transcription. Additionally, the open-source corpus has been gathered from multiple sources that bring non-standard Arabic alphabets in transcription which are normalized by defining a common character-set. The second contribution is the development of a framework to train an acoustic model achieving state-of-the-art performance. The network architecture comprises of a combination of convolutional and recurrent layers. The spectrogram features of the audio data are extracted in the frequency vs time domain and fed in the network. The output frames, produced by the recurrent model, are further trained to align the audio features with its corresponding transcription sequences. The sequence alignment is performed using a beam search decoder with a tetra-gram language model. The proposed system achieved a 14% error rate which outperforms previous systems."
Bilingual Speech Recognition by Estimating Speaker Geometry from Video Data,"Speech recognition is very challenging in student learning environments that are characterized by significant cross-talk and background noise. To address this problem, we present a bilingual speech recognition system that uses an interactive video analysis system to estimate the 3D speaker geometry for realistic audio simulations. We demonstrate the use of our system in generating a complex audio dataset that contains significant cross-talk and background noise that approximate real-life classroom recordings. We then test our proposed system with real-life recordings.  In terms of the distance of the speakers from the microphone, our interactive video analysis system obtained a better average error rate of 10.83% compared to 33.12% for a baseline approach. Our proposed system gave an accuracy of 27.92% that is 1.5% better than Google Speech-to-text on the same dataset. In terms of 9 important keywords, our approach gave an average sensitivity of 38% compared to 24% for Google Speech-to-text, while both methods maintained high average specificity of 90% and 92%.  On average, sensitivity improved from 24% to 38% for our proposed approach. On the other hand, specificity remained high for both methods (90% to 92%)."
Attribute Inference Attack of Speech Emotion Recognition in Federated Learning Settings,"Speech emotion recognition (SER) processes speech signals to detect and characterize expressed perceived emotions. Many SER application systems often acquire and transmit speech data collected at the client-side to remote cloud platforms for inference and decision making. However, speech data carry rich information not only about emotions conveyed in vocal expressions, but also other sensitive demographic traits such as gender, age and language background. Consequently, it is desirable for SER systems to have the ability to classify emotion constructs while preventing unintended/improper inferences of sensitive and demographic information. Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm that coordinates clients to train a model collaboratively without sharing their local data. This training approach appears secure and can improve privacy for SER. However, recent works have demonstrated that FL approaches are still vulnerable to various privacy attacks like reconstruction attacks and membership inference attacks. Although most of these have focused on computer vision applications, such information leakages exist in the SER systems trained using the FL technique. To assess the information leakage of SER systems trained using FL, we propose an attribute inference attack framework that infers sensitive attribute information of the clients from shared gradients or model parameters, corresponding to the FedSGD and the FedAvg training algorithms, respectively. As a use case, we empirically evaluate our approach for predicting the client's gender information using three SER benchmark datasets: IEMOCAP, CREMA-D, and MSP-Improv. We show that the attribute inference attack is achievable for SER systems trained using FL. We further identify that most information leakage possibly comes from the first layer in the SER model."
Multi-Variant Consistency based Self-supervised Learning for Robust Automatic Speech Recognition,"Automatic speech recognition (ASR) has shown rapid advances in recent years but still degrades significantly in far-field and noisy environments. The recent development of self-supervised learning (SSL) technology can improve the ASR performance by pre-training the model with additional unlabeled speech and the SSL pre-trained model has achieved the state-of-the-art result on several speech benchmarks. Nevertheless, most of the previous SSL methods ignore the influence of the background noise or reverberation, which is crucial to deploying ASR systems in real-world speech applications. This study addresses the robust ASR by introducing a multi-variant consistency (MVC) based SSL method that adapts to different environments. The MVC-SSL is a robust SSL pre-training method designed for noisy and distant-talking speech in real-world applications. Compared to the previous SSL method, the MVC-SSL can calculate the contrastive loss among audios from different acoustic conditions or channels and can learn invariant representations with the change in the environment or the recording equipment. We also explore different SSL training pipelines to balance the noisy distant-talking speech and extra high resource clean speech. We evaluate the proposed method on the commercially-motivated dataset, CHiME-4, and the meeting dataset, AMI. With the help of the MVC-SSL and appropriate training pipeline, we can achieve up to 30% relative word error rate reductions over the baseline wav2vec2.0, one of the most successful SSL methods for ASR."
Mixed Precision of Quantization of Transformer Language Models for Speech Recognition,"State-of-the-art neural language models represented by Transformers are becoming increasingly complex and expensive for practical applications. Low-bit deep neural network quantization techniques provides a powerful solution to dramatically reduce their model size. Current low-bit quantization methods are based on uniform precision and fail to account for the varying performance sensitivity at different parts of the system to quantization errors. To this end, novel mixed precision DNN quantization methods are proposed in this paper. The optimal local precision settings are automatically learned using two techniques. The first is based on a quantization sensitivity metric in the form of Hessian trace weighted quantization perturbation. The second is based on mixed precision Transformer architecture search. Alternating direction methods of multipliers (ADMM) are used to efficiently train mixed precision quantized DNN systems. Experiments conducted on Penn Treebank (PTB) and a Switchboard corpus trained LF-MMI TDNN system suggest the proposed mixed precision Transformer quantization techniques achieved model size compression ratios of up to 16 times over the full precision baseline with no recognition performance degradation. When being used to compress a larger full precision Transformer LM with more layers, overall word error rate (WER) reductions up to 1.7% absolute (18% relative) were obtained."
Mixed Precision Low-bit Quantization of Neural Network Language Models for Speech Recognition,"State-of-the-art language models (LMs) represented by long-short term memory recurrent neural networks (LSTM-RNNs) and Transformers are becoming increasingly complex and expensive for practical applications. Low-bit neural network quantization provides a powerful solution to dramatically reduce their model size. Current quantization methods are based on uniform precision and fail to account for the varying performance sensitivity at different parts of LMs to quantization errors. To this end, novel mixed precision neural network LM quantization methods are proposed in this paper. The optimal local precision choices for LSTM-RNN and Transformer based neural LMs are automatically learned using three techniques. The first two approaches are based on quantization sensitivity metrics in the form of either the KL-divergence measured between full precision and quantized LMs, or Hessian trace weighted quantization perturbation that can be approximated efficiently using matrix free techniques. The third approach is based on mixed precision neural architecture search. In order to overcome the difficulty in using gradient descent methods to directly estimate discrete quantized weights, alternating direction methods of multipliers (ADMM) are used to efficiently train quantized LMs. Experiments were conducted on state-of-the-art LF-MMI CNN-TDNN systems featuring speed perturbation, i-Vector and learning hidden unit contribution (LHUC) based speaker adaptation on two tasks: Switchboard telephone speech and AMI meeting transcription. The proposed mixed precision quantization techniques achieved ""lossless"" quantization on both tasks, by producing model size compression ratios of up to approximately 16 times over the full precision LSTM and Transformer baseline LMs, while incurring no statistically significant word error rate increase."
Voice Quality and Pitch Features in Transformer-Based Speech Recognition,"Jitter and shimmer measurements have shown to be carriers of voice quality and prosodic information which enhance the performance of tasks like speaker recognition, diarization or automatic speech recognition (ASR). However, such features have been seldom used in the context of neural-based ASR, where spectral features often prevail. In this work, we study the effects of incorporating voice quality and pitch features altogether and separately to a Transformer-based ASR model, with the intuition that the attention mechanisms might exploit latent prosodic traits. For doing so, we propose separated convolutional front-ends for prosodic and spectral features, showing that this architectural choice yields better results than simple concatenation of such pitch and voice quality features to mel-spectrogram filterbanks. Furthermore, we find mean Word Error Rate relative reductions of up to 5.6% with the LibriSpeech benchmark. Such findings motivate further research on the application of prosody knowledge for increasing the robustness of Transformer-based ASR."
Integrating Knowledge in End-to-End Automatic Speech Recognition for Mandarin-English Code-Switching,"Code-Switching (CS) is a common linguistic phenomenon in multilingual communities that consists of switching between languages while speaking. This paper presents our investigations on end-to-end speech recognition for Mandarin-English CS speech. We analyse different CS specific issues such as the properties mismatches between languages in a CS language pair, the unpredictable nature of switching points, and the data scarcity problem. We exploit and improve the state-of-the-art end-to-end system by merging nonlinguistic symbols, by integrating language identification using hierarchical softmax, by modeling sub-word units, by artificially lowering the speaking rate, and by augmenting data using speed perturbed technique and several monolingual datasets to improve the final performance not only on CS speech but also on monolingual benchmarks in order to make the system more applicable on real life settings. Finally, we explore the effect of different language model integration methods on the performance of the proposed model. Our experimental results reveal that all the proposed techniques improve the recognition performance. The best combined system improves the baseline system by up to 35% relatively in terms of mixed error rate and delivers acceptable performance on monolingual benchmarks."
Multi-turn RNN-T for streaming recognition of multi-party speech,"Automatic speech recognition (ASR) of single channel far-field recordings with an unknown number of speakers is traditionally tackled by cascaded modules. Recent research shows that end-to-end (E2E) multi-speaker ASR models can achieve superior recognition accuracy compared to modular systems. However, these models do not ensure real-time applicability due to their dependency on full audio context. This work takes real-time applicability as the first priority in model design and addresses a few challenges in previous work on multi-speaker recurrent neural network transducer (MS-RNN-T). First, we introduce on-the-fly overlapping speech simulation during training, yielding 14% relative word error rate (WER) improvement on LibriSpeechMix test set. Second, we propose a novel multi-turn RNN-T (MT-RNN-T) model with an overlap-based target arrangement strategy that generalizes to an arbitrary number of speakers without changes in the model architecture. We investigate the impact of the maximum number of speakers seen during training on MT-RNN-T performance on LibriCSS test set, and report 28% relative WER improvement over the two-speaker MS-RNN-T. Third, we experiment with a rich transcription strategy for joint recognition and segmentation of multi-party speech. Through an in-depth analysis, we discuss potential pitfalls of the proposed system as well as promising future research directions."
Investigation of Densely Connected Convolutional Networks with Domain Adversarial Learning for Noise Robust Speech Recognition,"We investigate densely connected convolutional networks (DenseNets) and their extension with domain adversarial training for noise robust speech recognition. DenseNets are very deep, compact convolutional neural networks which have demonstrated incredible improvements over the state-of-the-art results in computer vision. Our experimental results reveal that DenseNets are more robust against noise than other neural network based models such as deep feed forward neural networks and convolutional neural networks. Moreover, domain adversarial learning can further improve the robustness of DenseNets against both, known and unknown noise conditions."
Linguistic and Gender Variation in Speech Emotion Recognition using Spectral Features,"This work explores the effect of gender and linguistic-based vocal variations on the accuracy of emotive expression classification. Emotive expressions are considered from the perspective of spectral features in speech (Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficient, Melspectrogram, Spectral Contrast). Emotions are considered from the perspective of Basic Emotion Theory. A convolutional neural network is utilised to classify emotive expressions in emotive audio datasets in English, German, and Italian. Vocal variations for spectral features assessed by (i) a comparative analysis identifying suitable spectral features, (ii) the classification performance for mono, multi and cross-lingual emotive data and (iii) an empirical evaluation of a machine learning model to assess the effects of gender and linguistic variation on classification accuracy. The results showed that spectral features provide a potential avenue for increasing emotive expression classification. Additionally, the accuracy of emotive expression classification was high within mono and cross-lingual emotive data, but poor in multi-lingual data. Similarly, there were differences in classification accuracy between gender populations. These results demonstrate the importance of accounting for population differences to enable accurate speech emotion recognition."
Continual Learning for Monolingual End-to-End Automatic Speech Recognition,"Adapting Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models to new domains results in a deterioration of performance on the original domain(s), a phenomenon called Catastrophic Forgetting (CF). Even monolingual ASR models cannot be extended to new accents, dialects, topics, etc. without suffering from CF, making them unable to be continually enhanced without storing all past data. Fortunately, Continual Learning (CL) methods, which aim to enable continual adaptation while overcoming CF, can be used. In this paper, we implement an extensive number of CL methods for End-to-End ASR and test and compare their ability to extend a monolingual Hybrid CTC-Transformer model across four new tasks. We find that the best performing CL method closes the gap between the fine-tuned model (lower bound) and the model trained jointly on all tasks (upper bound) by more than 40%, while requiring access to only 0.6% of the original data."
JTubeSpeech: corpus of Japanese speech collected from YouTube for speech recognition and speaker verification,"In this paper, we construct a new Japanese speech corpus called ""JTubeSpeech."" Although recent end-to-end learning requires large-size speech corpora, open-sourced such corpora for languages other than English have not yet been established. In this paper, we describe the construction of a corpus from YouTube videos and subtitles for speech recognition and speaker verification. Our method can automatically filter the videos and subtitles with almost no language-dependent processes. We consistently employ Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)-based techniques for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and a speaker variation-based method for automatic speaker verification (ASV). We build 1) a large-scale Japanese ASR benchmark with more than 1,300 hours of data and 2) 900 hours of data for Japanese ASV."
Self-Supervised Learning for speech recognition with Intermediate layer supervision,"Recently, pioneer work finds that speech pre-trained models can solve full-stack speech processing tasks, because the model utilizes bottom layers to learn speaker-related information and top layers to encode content-related information. Since the network capacity is limited, we believe the speech recognition performance could be further improved if the model is dedicated to audio content information learning. To this end, we propose Intermediate Layer Supervision for Self-Supervised Learning (ILS-SSL), which forces the model to concentrate on content information as much as possible by adding an additional SSL loss on the intermediate layers. Experiments on LibriSpeech test-other set show that our method outperforms HuBERT significantly, which achieves a 23.5%/11.6% relative word error rate reduction in the w/o language model setting for base/large models. Detailed analysis shows the bottom layers of our model have a better correlation with phonetic units, which is consistent with our intuition and explains the success of our method for ASR."
Speech frame implementation for speech analysis and recognition,"Distinctive features of the created speech frame are: the ability to take into account the emotional state of the speaker, sup-port for working with diseases of the speech-forming tract of speakers and the presence of manual segmentation of a num-ber of speech signals. In addition, the system is focused on Russian-language speech material, unlike most analogs."
Robustifying automatic speech recognition by extracting slowly varying features,"In the past few years, it has been shown that deep learning systems are highly vulnerable under attacks with adversarial examples. Neural-network-based automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems are no exception. Targeted and untargeted attacks can modify an audio input signal in such a way that humans still recognise the same words, while ASR systems are steered to predict a different transcription. In this paper, we propose a defense mechanism against targeted adversarial attacks consisting in removing fast-changing features from the audio signals, either by applying slow feature analysis, a low-pass filter, or both, before feeding the input to the ASR system. We perform an empirical analysis of hybrid ASR models trained on data pre-processed in such a way. While the resulting models perform quite well on benign data, they are significantly more robust against targeted adversarial attacks: Our final, proposed model shows a performance on clean data similar to the baseline model, while being more than four times more robust."
Improving Hybrid CTC/Attention End-to-end Speech Recognition with Pretrained Acoustic and Language Model,"Recently, self-supervised pretraining has achieved impressive results in end-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR). However, the dominant sequence-to-sequence (S2S) E2E model is still hard to fully utilize the self-supervised pre-training methods because its decoder is conditioned on acoustic representation thus cannot be pretrained separately. In this paper, we propose a pretrained Transformer (Preformer) S2S ASR architecture based on hybrid CTC/attention E2E models to fully utilize the pretrained acoustic models (AMs) and language models (LMs). In our framework, the encoder is initialized with a pretrained AM (wav2vec2.0). The Preformer leverages CTC as an auxiliary task during training and inference. Furthermore, we design a one-cross decoder (OCD), which relaxes the dependence on acoustic representations so that it can be initialized with pretrained LM (DistilGPT2). Experiments are conducted on the AISHELL-1 corpus and achieve a 4.6\% character error rate (CER) on the test set. Compared with our vanilla hybrid CTC/attention Transformer baseline, our proposed CTC/attention-based Preformer yields 27\% relative CER reduction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to utilize both pretrained AM and LM in a S2S ASR system."
PM-MMUT: Boosted Phone-Mask Data Augmentation using Multi-Modeling Unit Training for Phonetic-Reduction-Robust E2E Speech Recognition,"Consonant and vowel reduction are often encountered in speech, which might cause performance degradation in automatic speech recognition (ASR). Our recently proposed learning strategy based on masking, Phone Masking Training (PMT), alleviates the impact of such phenomenon in Uyghur ASR. Although PMT achieves remarkably improvements, there still exists room for further gains due to the granularity mismatch between the masking unit of PMT (phoneme) and the modeling unit (word-piece). To boost the performance of PMT, we propose multi-modeling unit training (MMUT) architecture fusion with PMT (PM-MMUT). The idea of MMUT framework is to split the Encoder into two parts including acoustic feature sequences to phoneme-level representation (AF-to-PLR) and phoneme-level representation to word-piece-level representation (PLR-to-WPLR). It allows AF-to-PLR to be optimized by an intermediate phoneme-based CTC loss to learn the rich phoneme-level context information brought by PMT. Experimental results on Uyghur ASR show that the proposed approaches outperform obviously the pure PMT. We also conduct experiments on the 960-hour Librispeech benchmark using ESPnet1, which achieves about 10% relative WER reduction on all the test set without LM fusion comparing with the latest official ESPnet1 pre-trained model."
Improving Speech Recognition on Noisy Speech via Speech Enhancement with Multi-Discriminators CycleGAN,"This paper presents our latest investigations on improving automatic speech recognition for noisy speech via speech enhancement. We propose a novel method named Multi-discriminators CycleGAN to reduce noise of input speech and therefore improve the automatic speech recognition performance. Our proposed method leverages the CycleGAN framework for speech enhancement without any parallel data and improve it by introducing multiple discriminators that check different frequency areas. Furthermore, we show that training multiple generators on homogeneous subset of the training data is better than training one generator on all the training data. We evaluate our method on CHiME-3 data set and observe up to 10.03% relatively WER improvement on the development set and up to 14.09% on the evaluation set."
Directed Speech Separation for Automatic Speech Recognition of Long Form Conversational Speech,"Many of the recent advances in speech separation are primarily aimed at synthetic mixtures of short audio utterances with high degrees of overlap. Most of these approaches need an additional stitching step to stitch the separated speech chunks for long form audio. Since most of the approaches involve Permutation Invariant training (PIT), the order of separated speech chunks is nondeterministic and leads to difficulty in accurately stitching homogenous speaker chunks for downstream tasks like Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). Also, most of these models are trained with synthetic mixtures and do not generalize to real conversational data. In this paper, we propose a speaker conditioned separator trained on speaker embeddings extracted directly from the mixed signal using an over-clustering based approach. This model naturally regulates the order of the separated chunks without the need for an additional stitching step. We also introduce a data sampling strategy with real and synthetic mixtures which generalizes well to real conversation speech. With this model and data sampling technique, we show significant improvements in speaker-attributed word error rate (SA-WER) on Hub5 data."
Building a great multi-lingual teacher with sparsely-gated mixture of experts for speech recognition,"The sparsely-gated Mixture of Experts (MoE) can magnify a network capacity with a little computational complexity. In this work, we investigate how multi-lingual Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) networks can be scaled up with a simple routing algorithm in order to achieve better accuracy. More specifically, we apply the sparsely-gated MoE technique to two types of networks: Sequence-to-Sequence Transformer (S2S-T) and Transformer Transducer (T-T). We demonstrate through a set of ASR experiments on multiple language data that the MoE networks can reduce the relative word error rates by 16.3% and 4.6% with the S2S-T and T-T, respectively. Moreover, we thoroughly investigate the effect of the MoE on the T-T architecture in various conditions: streaming mode, non-streaming mode, the use of language ID and the label decoder with the MoE."
An Ensemble 1D-CNN-LSTM-GRU Model with Data Augmentation for Speech Emotion Recognition,"In this paper, we propose an ensemble of deep neural networks along with data augmentation (DA) learned using effective speech-based features to recognize emotions from speech. Our ensemble model is built on three deep neural network-based models. These neural networks are built using the basic local feature acquiring blocks (LFAB) which are consecutive layers of dilated 1D Convolutional Neural networks followed by the max pooling and batch normalization layers. To acquire the long-term dependencies in speech signals further two variants are proposed by adding Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) layers respectively. All three network models have consecutive fully connected layers before the final softmax layer for classification. The ensemble model uses a weighted average to provide the final classification. We have utilized five standard benchmark datasets: TESS, EMO-DB, RAVDESS, SAVEE, and CREMA-D for evaluation. We have performed DA by injecting Additive White Gaussian Noise, pitch shifting, and stretching the signal level to generalize the models, and thus increasing the accuracy of the models and reducing the overfitting as well. We handcrafted five categories of features: Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, Log Mel-Scaled Spectrogram, Zero-Crossing Rate, Chromagram, and statistical Root Mean Square Energy value from each audio sample. These features are used as the input to the LFAB blocks that further extract the hidden local features which are then fed to either fully connected layers or to LSTM or GRU based on the model type to acquire the additional long-term contextual representations. LFAB followed by GRU or LSTM results in better performance compared to the baseline model. The ensemble model achieves the state-of-the-art weighted average accuracy in all the datasets."
A study on native American English speech recognition by Indian listeners with varying word familiarity level,"In this study, listeners of varied Indian nativities are asked to listen and recognize TIMIT utterances spoken by American speakers. We have three kinds of responses from each listener while they recognize an utterance: 1. Sentence difficulty ratings, 2. Speaker difficulty ratings, and 3. Transcription of the utterance. From these transcriptions, word error rate (WER) is calculated and used as a metric to evaluate the similarity between the recognized and the original sentences.The sentences selected in this study are categorized into three groups: Easy, Medium and Hard, based on the frequency ofoccurrence of the words in them. We observe that the sentence, speaker difficulty ratings and the WERs increase from easy to hard categories of sentences. We also compare the human speech recognition performance with that using three automatic speech recognition (ASR) under following three combinations of acoustic model (AM) and language model(LM): ASR1) AM trained with recordings from speakers of Indian origin and LM built on TIMIT text, ASR2) AM using recordings from native American speakers and LM built ontext from LIBRI speech corpus, and ASR3) AM using recordings from native American speakers and LM build on LIBRI speech and TIMIT text. We observe that HSR performance is similar to that of ASR1 whereas ASR3 achieves the best performance. Speaker nativity wise analysis shows that utterances from speakers of some nativity are more difficult to recognize by Indian listeners compared to few other nativities"
Sequential Randomized Smoothing for Adversarially Robust Speech Recognition,"While Automatic Speech Recognition has been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, defenses against these attacks are still lagging. Existing, naive defenses can be partially broken with an adaptive attack. In classification tasks, the Randomized Smoothing paradigm has been shown to be effective at defending models. However, it is difficult to apply this paradigm to ASR tasks, due to their complexity and the sequential nature of their outputs. Our paper overcomes some of these challenges by leveraging speech-specific tools like enhancement and ROVER voting to design an ASR model that is robust to perturbations. We apply adaptive versions of state-of-the-art attacks, such as the Imperceptible ASR attack, to our model, and show that our strongest defense is robust to all attacks that use inaudible noise, and can only be broken with very high distortion."
Consistent Training and Decoding For End-to-end Speech Recognition Using Lattice-free MMI,"Recently, End-to-End (E2E) frameworks have achieved remarkable results on various Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) tasks. However, Lattice-Free Maximum Mutual Information (LF-MMI), as one of the discriminative training criteria that show superior performance in hybrid ASR systems, is rarely adopted in E2E ASR frameworks. In this work, we propose a novel approach to integrate LF-MMI criterion into E2E ASR frameworks in both training and decoding stages. The proposed approach shows its effectiveness on two of the most widely used E2E frameworks including Attention-Based Encoder-Decoders (AEDs) and Neural Transducers (NTs). Experiments suggest that the introduction of the LF-MMI criterion consistently leads to significant performance improvements on various datasets and different E2E ASR frameworks. The best of our models achieves competitive CER of 4.1\% / 4.4\% on Aishell-1 dev/test set; we also achieve significant error reduction on Aishell-2 and Librispeech datasets over strong baselines."
Catch Me If You Can: Blackbox Adversarial Attacks on Automatic Speech Recognition using Frequency Masking,"Automatic speech recognition (ASR) models are prevalent, particularly in applications for voice navigation and voice control of domestic appliances. The computational core of ASRs are deep neural networks (DNNs) that have been shown to be susceptible to adversarial perturbations; easily misused by attackers to generate malicious outputs. To help test the security and robustnesss of ASRS, we propose techniques that generate blackbox (agnostic to the DNN), untargeted adversarial attacks that are portable across ASRs. This is in contrast to existing work that focuses on whitebox targeted attacks that are time consuming and lack portability.  Our techniques generate adversarial attacks that have no human audible difference by manipulating the audio signal using a psychoacoustic model that maintains the audio perturbations below the thresholds of human perception. We evaluate portability and effectiveness of our techniques using three popular ASRs and two input audio datasets using the metrics - Word Error Rate (WER) of output transcription, Similarity to original audio, attack Success Rate on different ASRs and Detection score by a defense system. We found our adversarial attacks were portable across ASRs, not easily detected by a state-of-the-art defense system, and had significant difference in output transcriptions while sounding similar to original audio."
Do We Still Need Automatic Speech Recognition for Spoken Language Understanding?,"Spoken language understanding (SLU) tasks are usually solved by first transcribing an utterance with automatic speech recognition (ASR) and then feeding the output to a text-based model. Recent advances in self-supervised representation learning for speech data have focused on improving the ASR component. We investigate whether representation learning for speech has matured enough to replace ASR in SLU. We compare learned speech features from wav2vec 2.0, state-of-the-art ASR transcripts, and the ground truth text as input for a novel speech-based named entity recognition task, a cardiac arrest detection task on real-world emergency calls and two existing SLU benchmarks. We show that learned speech features are superior to ASR transcripts on three classification tasks. For machine translation, ASR transcripts are still the better choice. We highlight the intrinsic robustness of wav2vec 2.0 representations to out-of-vocabulary words as key to better performance."
Mixed Precision DNN Qunatization for Overlapped Speech Separation and Recognition,"Recognition of overlapped speech has been a highly challenging task to date. State-of-the-art multi-channel speech separation system are becoming increasingly complex and expensive for practical applications. To this end, low-bit neural network quantization provides a powerful solution to dramatically reduce their model size. However, current quantization methods are based on uniform precision and fail to account for the varying performance sensitivity at different model components to quantization errors. In this paper, novel mixed precision DNN quantization methods are proposed by applying locally variable bit-widths to individual TCN components of a TF masking based multi-channel speech separation system. The optimal local precision settings are automatically learned using three techniques. The first two approaches utilize quantization sensitivity metrics based on either the mean square error (MSE) loss function curvature, or the KL-divergence measured between full precision and quantized separation models. The third approach is based on mixed precision neural architecture search. Experiments conducted on the LRS3-TED corpus simulated overlapped speech data suggest that the proposed mixed precision quantization techniques consistently outperform the uniform precision baseline speech separation systems of comparable bit-widths in terms of SI-SNR and PESQ scores as well as word error rate (WER) reductions up to 2.88% absolute (8% relative)."
Romanian Speech Recognition Experiments from the ROBIN Project,"One of the fundamental functionalities for accepting a socially assistive robot is its communication capabilities with other agents in the environment. In the context of the ROBIN project, situational dialogue through voice interaction with a robot was investigated. This paper presents different speech recognition experiments with deep neural networks focusing on producing fast (under 100ms latency from the network itself), while still reliable models. Even though one of the key desired characteristics is low latency, the final deep neural network model achieves state of the art results for recognizing Romanian language, obtaining a 9.91% word error rate (WER), when combined with a language model, thus improving over the previous results while offering at the same time an improved runtime performance. Additionally, we explore two modules for correcting the ASR output (hyphen and capitalization restoration and unknown words correction), targeting the ROBIN project's goals (dialogue in closed micro-worlds). We design a modular architecture based on APIs allowing an integration engine (either in the robot or external) to chain together the available modules as needed. Finally, we test the proposed design by integrating it in the RELATE platform and making the ASR service available to web users by either uploading a file or recording new speech."
A Case Study on the Independence of Speech Emotion Recognition in Bangla and English Languages using Language-Independent Prosodic Features,"A language agnostic approach to recognizing emotions from speech remains an incomplete and challenging task. In this paper, we performed a step-by-step comparative analysis of Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) using Bangla and English languages to assess whether distinguishing emotions from speech is independent of language. Six emotions were categorized for this study, such as - happy, angry, neutral, sad, disgust, and fear. We employed three Emotional Speech Sets (ESS), of which the first two were developed by native Bengali speakers in Bangla and English languages separately. The third was a subset of the Toronto Emotional Speech Set (TESS), which was developed by native English speakers from Canada. We carefully selected language-independent prosodic features, adopted a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, and conducted three experiments to carry out our proposition. In the first experiment, we measured the performance of the three speech sets individually, followed by the second experiment, where different ESS pairs were integrated to analyze the impact on SER. Finally, we measured the recognition rate by training and testing the model with different speech sets in the third experiment. Although this study reveals that SER in Bangla and English languages is mostly language-independent, some disparities were observed while recognizing emotional states like disgust and fear in these two languages. Moreover, our investigations revealed that non-native speakers convey emotions through speech, much like expressing themselves in their native tongue."
Attention based end to end Speech Recognition for Voice Search in Hindi and English,"We describe here our work with automatic speech recognition (ASR) in the context of voice search functionality on the Flipkart e-Commerce platform. Starting with the deep learning architecture of Listen-Attend-Spell (LAS), we build upon and expand the model design and attention mechanisms to incorporate innovative approaches including multi-objective training, multi-pass training, and external rescoring using language models and phoneme based losses. We report a relative WER improvement of 15.7% on top of state-of-the-art LAS models using these modifications. Overall, we report an improvement of 36.9% over the phoneme-CTC system. The paper also provides an overview of different components that can be tuned in a LAS-based system."
Multimodal Emotion Recognition with High-level Speech and Text Features,"Automatic emotion recognition is one of the central concerns of the Human-Computer Interaction field as it can bridge the gap between humans and machines. Current works train deep learning models on low-level data representations to solve the emotion recognition task. Since emotion datasets often have a limited amount of data, these approaches may suffer from overfitting, and they may learn based on superficial cues. To address these issues, we propose a novel cross-representation speech model, inspired by disentanglement representation learning, to perform emotion recognition on wav2vec 2.0 speech features. We also train a CNN-based model to recognize emotions from text features extracted with Transformer-based models. We further combine the speech-based and text-based results with a score fusion approach. Our method is evaluated on the IEMOCAP dataset in a 4-class classification problem, and it surpasses current works on speech-only, text-only, and multimodal emotion recognition."
Semi-supervised transfer learning for language expansion of end-to-end speech recognition models to low-resource languages,"In this paper, we propose a three-stage training methodology to improve the speech recognition accuracy of low-resource languages. We explore and propose an effective combination of techniques such as transfer learning, encoder freezing, data augmentation using Text-To-Speech (TTS), and Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL). To improve the accuracy of a low-resource Italian ASR, we leverage a well-trained English model, unlabeled text corpus, and unlabeled audio corpus using transfer learning, TTS augmentation, and SSL respectively. In the first stage, we use transfer learning from a well-trained English model. This primarily helps in learning the acoustic information from a resource-rich language. This stage achieves around 24% relative Word Error Rate (WER) reduction over the baseline. In stage two, We utilize unlabeled text data via TTS data-augmentation to incorporate language information into the model. We also explore freezing the acoustic encoder at this stage. TTS data augmentation helps us further reduce the WER by ~ 21% relatively. Finally, In stage three we reduce the WER by another 4% relative by using SSL from unlabeled audio data. Overall, our two-pass speech recognition system with a Monotonic Chunkwise Attention (MoChA) in the first pass and a full-attention in the second pass achieves a WER reduction of ~ 42% relative to the baseline."
A comparison of streaming models and data augmentation methods for robust speech recognition,"In this paper, we present a comparative study on the robustness of two different online streaming speech recognition models: Monotonic Chunkwise Attention (MoChA) and Recurrent Neural Network-Transducer (RNN-T). We explore three recently proposed data augmentation techniques, namely, multi-conditioned training using an acoustic simulator, Vocal Tract Length Perturbation (VTLP) for speaker variability, and SpecAugment. Experimental results show that unidirectional models are in general more sensitive to noisy examples in the training set. It is observed that the final performance of the model depends on the proportion of training examples processed by data augmentation techniques. MoChA models generally perform better than RNN-T models. However, we observe that training of MoChA models seems to be more sensitive to various factors such as the characteristics of training sets and the incorporation of additional augmentations techniques. On the other hand, RNN-T models perform better than MoChA models in terms of latency, inference time, and the stability of training. Additionally, RNN-T models are generally more robust against noise and reverberation. All these advantages make RNN-T models a better choice for streaming on-device speech recognition compared to MoChA models."
Towards Measuring Fairness in Speech Recognition: Casual Conversations Dataset Transcriptions,"It is well known that many machine learning systems demonstrate bias towards specific groups of individuals. This problem has been studied extensively in the Facial Recognition area, but much less so in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). This paper presents initial Speech Recognition results on ""Casual Conversations"" -- a publicly released 846 hour corpus designed to help researchers evaluate their computer vision and audio models for accuracy across a diverse set of metadata, including age, gender, and skin tone. The entire corpus has been manually transcribed, allowing for detailed ASR evaluations across these metadata. Multiple ASR models are evaluated, including models trained on LibriSpeech, 14,000 hour transcribed, and over 2 million hour untranscribed social media videos. Significant differences in word error rate across gender and skin tone are observed at times for all models. We are releasing human transcripts from the Casual Conversations dataset to encourage the community to develop a variety of techniques to reduce these statistical biases."
The People's Speech: A Large-Scale Diverse English Speech Recognition Dataset for Commercial Usage,"The People's Speech is a free-to-download 30,000-hour and growing supervised conversational English speech recognition dataset licensed for academic and commercial usage under CC-BY-SA (with a CC-BY subset). The data is collected via searching the Internet for appropriately licensed audio data with existing transcriptions. We describe our data collection methodology and release our data collection system under the Apache 2.0 license. We show that a model trained on this dataset achieves a 9.98% word error rate on Librispeech's test-clean test set.Finally, we discuss the legal and ethical issues surrounding the creation of a sizable machine learning corpora and plans for continued maintenance of the project under MLCommons's sponsorship."
Unsupervised Speech Enhancement with speech recognition embedding and disentanglement losses,"Speech enhancement has recently achieved great success with various deep learning methods. However, most conventional speech enhancement systems are trained with supervised methods that impose two significant challenges. First, a majority of training datasets for speech enhancement systems are synthetic. When mixing clean speech and noisy corpora to create the synthetic datasets, domain mismatches occur between synthetic and real-world recordings of noisy speech or audio. Second, there is a trade-off between increasing speech enhancement performance and degrading speech recognition (ASR) performance. Thus, we propose an unsupervised loss function to tackle those two problems. Our function is developed by extending the MixIT loss function with speech recognition embedding and disentanglement loss. Our results show that the proposed function effectively improves the speech enhancement performance compared to a baseline trained in a supervised way on the noisy VoxCeleb dataset. While fully unsupervised training is unable to exceed the corresponding baseline, with joint super- and unsupervised training, the system is able to achieve similar speech quality and better ASR performance than the best supervised baseline."
Integrated Semantic and Phonetic Post-correction for Chinese Speech Recognition,"Due to the recent advances of natural language processing, several works have applied the pre-trained masked language model (MLM) of BERT to the post-correction of speech recognition. However, existing pre-trained models only consider the semantic correction while the phonetic features of words is neglected. The semantic-only post-correction will consequently decrease the performance since homophonic errors are fairly common in Chinese ASR. In this paper, we proposed a novel approach to collectively exploit the contextualized representation and the phonetic information between the error and its replacing candidates to alleviate the error rate of Chinese ASR. Our experiment results on real world speech recognition datasets showed that our proposed method has evidently lower CER than the baseline model, which utilized a pre-trained BERT MLM as the corrector."
Biologically inspired speech emotion recognition,"Conventional feature-based classification methods do not apply well to automatic recognition of speech emotions, mostly because the precise set of spectral and prosodic features that is required to identify the emotional state of a speaker has not been determined yet. This paper presents a method that operates directly on the speech signal, thus avoiding the problematic step of feature extraction. Furthermore, this method combines the strengths of the classical source-filter model of human speech production with those of the recently introduced liquid state machine (LSM), a biologically-inspired spiking neural network (SNN). The source and vocal tract components of the speech signal are first separated and converted into perceptually relevant spectral representations. These representations are then processed separately by two reservoirs of neurons. The output of each reservoir is reduced in dimensionality and fed to a final classifier. This method is shown to provide very good classification performance on the Berlin Database of Emotional Speech (Emo-DB). This seems a very promising framework for solving efficiently many other problems in speech processing."
Speech Emotion Recognition System by Quaternion Nonlinear Echo State Network,"The echo state network (ESN) is a powerful and efficient tool for displaying dynamic data. However, many existing ESNs have limitations for properly modeling high-dimensional data. The most important limitation of these networks is the high memory consumption due to their reservoir structure, which has prevented the increase of reservoir units and the maximum use of special capabilities of this type of network. One way to solve this problem is to use quaternion algebra. Because quaternions have four different dimensions, high-dimensional data are easily represented and, using Hamilton multiplication, with fewer parameters than real numbers, make external relations between the multidimensional features easier. In addition to the memory problem in the ESN network, the linear output of the ESN network poses an indescribable limit to its processing capacity, as it cannot effectively utilize higher-order statistics of features provided by the nonlinear dynamics of reservoir neurons. In this research, a new structure based on ESN is presented, in which quaternion algebra is used to compress the network data with the simple split function, and the output linear combiner is replaced by a multidimensional bilinear filter. This filter will be used for nonlinear calculations of the output layer of the ESN. In addition, the two-dimensional principal component analysis technique is used to reduce the number of data transferred to the bilinear filter. In this study, the coefficients and the weights of the quaternion nonlinear ESN (QNESN) are optimized using the genetic algorithm. In order to prove the effectiveness of the proposed model compared to the previous methods, experiments for speech emotion recognition have been performed on EMODB, SAVEE, and IEMOCAP speech emotional datasets. Comparisons show that the proposed QNESN network performs better than the ESN and most currently SER systems."
Speech Emotion Recognition Using Deep Sparse Auto-Encoder Extreme Learning Machine with a New Weighting Scheme and Spectro-Temporal Features Along with Classical Feature Selection and A New Quantum-Inspired Dimension Reduction Method,"Affective computing is very important in the relationship between man and machine. In this paper, a system for speech emotion recognition (SER) based on speech signal is proposed, which uses new techniques in different stages of processing. The system consists of three stages: feature extraction, feature selection, and finally feature classification. In the first stage, a complex set of long-term statistics features is extracted from both the speech signal and the glottal-waveform signal using a combination of new and diverse features such as prosodic, spectral, and spectro-temporal features. One of the challenges of the SER systems is to distinguish correlated emotions. These features are good discriminators for speech emotions and increase the SER's ability to recognize similar and different emotions. This feature vector with a large number of dimensions naturally has redundancy. In the second stage, using classical feature selection techniques as well as a new quantum-inspired technique to reduce the feature vector dimensionality, the number of feature vector dimensions is reduced. In the third stage, the optimized feature vector is classified by a weighted deep sparse extreme learning machine (ELM) classifier. The classifier performs classification in three steps: sparse random feature learning, orthogonal random projection using the singular value decomposition (SVD) technique, and discriminative classification in the last step using the generalized Tikhonov regularization technique. Also, many existing emotional datasets suffer from the problem of data imbalanced distribution, which in turn increases the classification error and decreases system performance. In this paper, a new weighting method has also been proposed to deal with class imbalance, which is more efficient than existing weighting methods. The proposed method is evaluated on three standard emotional databases."
Retrieving Speaker Information from Personalized Acoustic Models for Speech Recognition,"The widespread of powerful personal devices capable of collecting voice of their users has opened the opportunity to build speaker adapted speech recognition system (ASR) or to participate to collaborative learning of ASR. In both cases, personalized acoustic models (AM), i.e. fine-tuned AM with specific speaker data, can be built. A question that naturally arises is whether the dissemination of personalized acoustic models can leak personal information. In this paper, we show that it is possible to retrieve the gender of the speaker, but also his identity, by just exploiting the weight matrix changes of a neural acoustic model locally adapted to this speaker. Incidentally we observe phenomena that may be useful towards explainability of deep neural networks in the context of speech processing. Gender can be identified almost surely using only the first layers and speaker verification performs well when using middle-up layers. Our experimental study on the TED-LIUM 3 dataset with HMM/TDNN models shows an accuracy of 95% for gender detection, and an Equal Error Rate of 9.07% for a speaker verification task by only exploiting the weights from personalized models that could be exchanged instead of user data."
Privacy attacks for automatic speech recognition acoustic models in a federated learning framework,"This paper investigates methods to effectively retrieve speaker information from the personalized speaker adapted neural network acoustic models (AMs) in automatic speech recognition (ASR). This problem is especially important in the context of federated learning of ASR acoustic models where a global model is learnt on the server based on the updates received from multiple clients. We propose an approach to analyze information in neural network AMs based on a neural network footprint on the so-called Indicator dataset. Using this method, we develop two attack models that aim to infer speaker identity from the updated personalized models without access to the actual users' speech data. Experiments on the TED-LIUM 3 corpus demonstrate that the proposed approaches are very effective and can provide equal error rate (EER) of 1-2%."
Effective Cross-Utterance Language Modeling for Conversational Speech Recognition,"Conversational speech normally is embodied with loose syntactic structures at the utterance level but simultaneously exhibits topical coherence relations across consecutive utterances. Prior work has shown that capturing longer context information with a recurrent neural network or long short-term memory language model (LM) may suffer from the recent bias while excluding the long-range context. In order to capture the long-term semantic interactions among words and across utterances, we put forward disparate conversation history fusion methods for language modeling in automatic speech recognition (ASR) of conversational speech. Furthermore, a novel audio-fusion mechanism is introduced, which manages to fuse and utilize the acoustic embeddings of a current utterance and the semantic content of its corresponding conversation history in a cooperative way. To flesh out our ideas, we frame the ASR N-best hypothesis rescoring task as a prediction problem, leveraging BERT, an iconic pre-trained LM, as the ingredient vehicle to facilitate selection of the oracle hypothesis from a given N-best hypothesis list. Empirical experiments conducted on the AMI benchmark dataset seem to demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of our methods in relation to some current top-of-line methods. The proposed methods not only achieve significant inference time reduction but also improve the ASR performance for conversational speech."
Context-Aware Transformer Transducer for Speech Recognition,"End-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems often have difficulty recognizing uncommon words, that appear infrequently in the training data. One promising method, to improve the recognition accuracy on such rare words, is to latch onto personalized/contextual information at inference. In this work, we present a novel context-aware transformer transducer (CATT) network that improves the state-of-the-art transformer-based ASR system by taking advantage of such contextual signals. Specifically, we propose a multi-head attention-based context-biasing network, which is jointly trained with the rest of the ASR sub-networks. We explore different techniques to encode contextual data and to create the final attention context vectors. We also leverage both BLSTM and pretrained BERT based models to encode contextual data and guide the network training. Using an in-house far-field dataset, we show that CATT, using a BERT based context encoder, improves the word error rate of the baseline transformer transducer and outperforms an existing deep contextual model by 24.2% and 19.4% respectively."
"A Fine-tuned Wav2vec 2.0/HuBERT Benchmark For Speech Emotion Recognition, Speaker Verification and Spoken Language Understanding","Speech self-supervised models such as wav2vec 2.0 and HuBERT are making revolutionary progress in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). However, they have not been totally proven to produce better performance on tasks other than ASR. In this work, we explored partial fine-tuning and entire fine-tuning on wav2vec 2.0 and HuBERT pre-trained models for three non-ASR speech tasks: Speech Emotion Recognition, Speaker Verification and Spoken Language Understanding. With simple proposed downstream frameworks, the best scores reached 79.58% weighted accuracy on speaker-dependent setting and 73.01% weighted accuracy on speaker-independent setting for Speech Emotion Recognition on IEMOCAP, 2.36% equal error rate for Speaker Verification on VoxCeleb1, 89.38% accuracy for Intent Classification and 78.92% F1 for Slot Filling on SLURP, showing the strength of fine-tuned wav2vec 2.0 and HuBERT on learning prosodic, voice-print and semantic representations."
Speech recognition for air traffic control via feature learning and end-to-end training,"In this work, we propose a new automatic speech recognition (ASR) system based on feature learning and an end-to-end training procedure for air traffic control (ATC) systems. The proposed model integrates the feature learning block, recurrent neural network (RNN), and connectionist temporal classification loss to build an end-to-end ASR model. Facing the complex environments of ATC speech, instead of the handcrafted features, a learning block is designed to extract informative features from raw waveforms for acoustic modeling. Both the SincNet and 1D convolution blocks are applied to process the raw waveforms, whose outputs are concatenated to the RNN layers for the temporal modeling. Thanks to the ability to learn representations from raw waveforms, the proposed model can be optimized in a complete end-to-end manner, i.e., from waveform to text. Finally, the multilingual issue in the ATC domain is also considered to achieve the ASR task by constructing a combined vocabulary of Chinese characters and English letters. The proposed approach is validated on a multilingual real-world corpus (ATCSpeech), and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms other baselines, achieving a 6.9\% character error rate."
Recent Advances in End-to-End Automatic Speech Recognition,"Recently, the speech community is seeing a significant trend of moving from deep neural network based hybrid modeling to end-to-end (E2E) modeling for automatic speech recognition (ASR). While E2E models achieve the state-of-the-art results in most benchmarks in terms of ASR accuracy, hybrid models are still used in a large proportion of commercial ASR systems at the current time. There are lots of practical factors that affect the production model deployment decision. Traditional hybrid models, being optimized for production for decades, are usually good at these factors. Without providing excellent solutions to all these factors, it is hard for E2E models to be widely commercialized. In this paper, we will overview the recent advances in E2E models, focusing on technologies addressing those challenges from the industry's perspective."
SNRi Target Training for Joint Speech Enhancement and Recognition,"Speech enhancement (SE) is used as a frontend in speech applications including automatic speech recognition (ASR) and telecommunication. A difficulty in using the SE frontend is that the appropriate noise reduction level differs depending on applications and/or noise characteristics. In this study, we propose ""signal-to-noise ratio improvement (SNRi) target training""; the SE frontend is trained to output a signal whose SNRi is controlled by an auxiliary scalar input. In joint training with a backend, the target SNRi value is estimated by an auxiliary network. By training all networks to minimize the backend task loss, we can estimate the appropriate noise reduction level for each noisy input in a data-driven scheme. Our experiments showed that the SNRi target training enables control of the output SNRi. In addition, the proposed joint training relatively reduces word error rate by 4.0\% and 5.7\% compared to a Conformer-based standard ASR model and conventional SE-ASR joint training model, respectively. Furthermore, by analyzing the predicted target SNRi, we observed the jointly trained network automatically controls the target SNRi according to noise characteristics. Audio demos are available in our demo page: google.github.io/df-conformer/snri_target/."
Speech Emotion Recognition Using Quaternion Convolutional Neural Networks,"Although speech recognition has become a widespread technology, inferring emotion from speech signals still remains a challenge. To address this problem, this paper proposes a quaternion convolutional neural network (QCNN) based speech emotion recognition (SER) model in which Mel-spectrogram features of speech signals are encoded in an RGB quaternion domain. We show that our QCNN based SER model outperforms other real-valued methods in the Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song (RAVDESS, 8-classes) dataset, achieving, to the best of our knowledge, state-of-the-art results. The QCNN also achieves comparable results with the state-of-the-art methods in the Interactive Emotional Dyadic Motion Capture (IEMOCAP 4-classes) and Berlin EMO-DB (7-classes) datasets. Specifically, the model achieves an accuracy of 77.87\%, 70.46\%, and 88.78\% for the RAVDESS, IEMOCAP, and EMO-DB datasets, respectively. In addition, our results show that the quaternion unit structure is better able to encode internal dependencies to reduce its model size significantly compared to other methods."
Speaker conditioning of acoustic models using affine transformation for multi-speaker speech recognition,"This study addresses the problem of single-channel Automatic Speech Recognition of a target speaker within an overlap speech scenario. In the proposed method, the hidden representations in the acoustic model are modulated by speaker auxiliary information to recognize only the desired speaker. Affine transformation layers are inserted into the acoustic model network to integrate speaker information with the acoustic features. The speaker conditioning process allows the acoustic model to perform computation in the context of target-speaker auxiliary information. The proposed speaker conditioning method is a general approach and can be applied to any acoustic model architecture. Here, we employ speaker conditioning on a ResNet acoustic model. Experiments on the WSJ corpus show that the proposed speaker conditioning method is an effective solution to fuse speaker auxiliary information with acoustic features for multi-speaker speech recognition, achieving +9% and +20% relative WER reduction for clean and overlap speech scenarios, respectively, compared to the original ResNet acoustic model baseline."
Pseudo-Labeling for Massively Multilingual Speech Recognition,"Semi-supervised learning through pseudo-labeling has become a staple of state-of-the-art monolingual speech recognition systems. In this work, we extend pseudo-labeling to massively multilingual speech recognition with 60 languages. We propose a simple pseudo-labeling recipe that works well even with low-resource languages: train a supervised multilingual model, fine-tune it with semi-supervised learning on a target language, generate pseudo-labels for that language, and train a final model using pseudo-labels for all languages, either from scratch or by fine-tuning. Experiments on the labeled Common Voice and unlabeled VoxPopuli datasets show that our recipe can yield a model with better performance for many languages that also transfers well to LibriSpeech."
Revisiting joint decoding based multi-talker speech recognition with DNN acoustic model,"In typical multi-talker speech recognition systems, a neural network-based acoustic model predicts senone state posteriors for each speaker. These are later used by a single-talker decoder which is applied on each speaker-specific output stream separately. In this work, we argue that such a scheme is sub-optimal and propose a principled solution that decodes all speakers jointly. We modify the acoustic model to predict joint state posteriors for all speakers, enabling the network to express uncertainty about the attribution of parts of the speech signal to the speakers. We employ a joint decoder that can make use of this uncertainty together with higher-level language information. For this, we revisit decoding algorithms used in factorial generative models in early multi-talker speech recognition systems. In contrast with these early works, we replace the GMM acoustic model with DNN, which provides greater modeling power and simplifies part of the inference. We demonstrate the advantage of joint decoding in proof of concept experiments on a mixed-TIDIGITS dataset."
Combining Unsupervised and Text Augmented Semi-Supervised Learning for Low Resourced Autoregressive Speech Recognition,"Recent advances in unsupervised representation learning have demonstrated the impact of pretraining on large amounts of read speech. We adapt these techniques for domain adaptation in low-resource -- both in terms of data and compute -- conversational and broadcast domains. Moving beyond CTC, we pretrain state-of-the-art Conformer models in an unsupervised manner. While the unsupervised approach outperforms traditional semi-supervised training, the techniques are complementary. Combining the techniques is a 5% absolute improvement in WER, averaged over all conditions, compared to semi-supervised training alone. Additional text data is incorporated through external language models. By using CTC-based decoding, we are better able to take advantage of the additional text data. When used as a transcription model, it allows the Conformer model to better incorporate the knowledge from the language model through semi-supervised training than shallow fusion. Final performance is an additional 2% better absolute when using CTC-based decoding for semi-supervised training compared to shallow fusion."
CORAA: a large corpus of spontaneous and prepared speech manually validated for speech recognition in Brazilian Portuguese,"Automatic Speech recognition (ASR) is a complex and challenging task. In recent years, there have been significant advances in the area. In particular, for the Brazilian Portuguese (BP) language, there were about 376 hours public available for ASR task until the second half of 2020. With the release of new datasets in early 2021, this number increased to 574 hours. The existing resources, however, are composed of audios containing only read and prepared speech. There is a lack of datasets including spontaneous speech, which are essential in different ASR applications. This paper presents CORAA (Corpus of Annotated Audios) v1. with 290.77 hours, a publicly available dataset for ASR in BP containing validated pairs (audio-transcription). CORAA also contains European Portuguese audios (4.69 hours). We also present a public ASR model based on Wav2Vec 2.0 XLSR-53 and fine-tuned over CORAA. Our model achieved a Word Error Rate of 24.18% on CORAA test set and 20.08% on Common Voice test set. When measuring the Character Error Rate, we obtained 11.02% and 6.34% for CORAA and Common Voice, respectively. CORAA corpora were assembled to both improve ASR models in BP with phenomena from spontaneous speech and motivate young researchers to start their studies on ASR for Portuguese. All the corpora are publicly available at https://github.com/nilc-nlp/CORAA under the CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license."
Fusing ASR Outputs in Joint Training for Speech Emotion Recognition,"Alongside acoustic information, linguistic features based on speech transcripts have been proven useful in Speech Emotion Recognition (SER). However, due to the scarcity of emotion labelled data and the difficulty of recognizing emotional speech, it is hard to obtain reliable linguistic features and models in this research area. In this paper, we propose to fuse Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) outputs into the pipeline for joint training SER. The relationship between ASR and SER is understudied, and it is unclear what and how ASR features benefit SER. By examining various ASR outputs and fusion methods, our experiments show that in joint ASR-SER training, incorporating both ASR hidden and text output using a hierarchical co-attention fusion approach improves the SER performance the most. On the IEMOCAP corpus, our approach achieves 63.4% weighted accuracy, which is close to the baseline results achieved by combining ground-truth transcripts. In addition, we also present novel word error rate analysis on IEMOCAP and layer-difference analysis of the Wav2vec 2.0 model to better understand the relationship between ASR and SER."
End-to-End Speech Emotion Recognition: Challenges of Real-Life Emergency Call Centers Data Recordings,"Recognizing a speaker's emotion from their speech can be a key element in emergency call centers. End-to-end deep learning systems for speech emotion recognition now achieve equivalent or even better results than conventional machine learning approaches. In this paper, in order to validate the performance of our neural network architecture for emotion recognition from speech, we first trained and tested it on the widely used corpus accessible by the community, IEMOCAP. We then used the same architecture as the real life corpus, CEMO, composed of 440 dialogs (2h16m) from 485 speakers. The most frequent emotions expressed by callers in these real life emergency dialogues are fear, anger and positive emotions such as relief. In the IEMOCAP general topic conversations, the most frequent emotions are sadness, anger and happiness. Using the same end-to-end deep learning architecture, an Unweighted Accuracy Recall (UA) of 63% is obtained on IEMOCAP and a UA of 45.6% on CEMO, each with 4 classes. Using only 2 classes (Anger, Neutral), the results for CEMO are 76.9% UA compared to 81.1% UA for IEMOCAP. We expect that these encouraging results with CEMO can be improved by combining the audio channel with the linguistic channel. Real-life emotions are clearly more complex than acted ones, mainly due to the large diversity of emotional expressions of speakers. Index Terms-emotion detection, end-to-end deep learning architecture, call center, real-life database, complex emotions."
Optimizing Alignment of Speech and Language Latent Spaces for End-to-End Speech Recognition and Understanding,"The advances in attention-based encoder-decoder (AED) networks have brought great progress to end-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR). One way to further improve the performance of AED-based E2E ASR is to introduce an extra text encoder for leveraging extensive text data and thus capture more context-aware linguistic information. However, this approach brings a mismatch problem between the speech encoder and the text encoder due to the different units used for modeling. In this paper, we propose an embedding aligner and modality switch training to better align the speech and text latent spaces. The embedding aligner is a shared linear projection between text encoder and speech encoder trained by masked language modeling (MLM) loss and connectionist temporal classification (CTC), respectively. The modality switch training randomly swaps speech and text embeddings based on the forced alignment result to learn a joint representation space. Experimental results show that our proposed approach achieves a relative 14% to 19% word error rate (WER) reduction on Librispeech ASR task. We further verify its effectiveness on spoken language understanding (SLU), i.e., an absolute 2.5% to 2.8% F1 score improvement on SNIPS slot filling task."
Synt++: Utilizing Imperfect Synthetic Data to Improve Speech Recognition,"With recent advances in speech synthesis, synthetic data is becoming a viable alternative to real data for training speech recognition models. However, machine learning with synthetic data is not trivial due to the gap between the synthetic and the real data distributions. Synthetic datasets may contain artifacts that do not exist in real data such as structured noise, content errors, or unrealistic speaking styles. Moreover, the synthesis process may introduce a bias due to uneven sampling of the data manifold. We propose two novel techniques during training to mitigate the problems due to the distribution gap: (i) a rejection sampling algorithm and (ii) using separate batch normalization statistics for the real and the synthetic samples. We show that these methods significantly improve the training of speech recognition models using synthetic data. We evaluate the proposed approach on keyword detection and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) tasks, and observe up to 18% and 13% relative error reduction, respectively, compared to naively using the synthetic data."
Learning Domain Specific Language Models for Automatic Speech Recognition through Machine Translation,"Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems have been gaining popularity in the recent years for their widespread usage in smart phones and speakers. Building ASR systems for task-specific scenarios is subject to the availability of utterances that adhere to the style of the task as well as the language in question. In our work, we target such a scenario wherein task-specific text data is available in a language that is different from the target language in which an ASR Language Model (LM) is expected. We use Neural Machine Translation (NMT) as an intermediate step to first obtain translations of the task-specific text data. We then train LMs on the 1-best and N-best translations and study ways to improve on such a baseline LM. We develop a procedure to derive word confusion networks from NMT beam search graphs and evaluate LMs trained on these confusion networks. With experiments on the WMT20 chat translation task dataset, we demonstrate that NMT confusion networks can help to reduce the perplexity of both n-gram and recurrent neural network LMs compared to those trained only on N-best translations."
Private Language Model Adaptation for Speech Recognition,"Speech model adaptation is crucial to handle the discrepancy between server-side proxy training data and actual data received on local devices of users. With the use of federated learning (FL), we introduce an efficient approach on continuously adapting neural network language models (NNLMs) on private devices with applications on automatic speech recognition (ASR). To address the potential speech transcription errors in the on-device training corpus, we perform empirical studies on comparing various strategies of leveraging token-level confidence scores to improve the NNLM quality in the FL settings. Experiments show that compared with no model adaptation, the proposed method achieves relative 2.6% and 10.8% word error rate (WER) reductions on two speech evaluation datasets, respectively. We also provide analysis in evaluating privacy guarantees of our presented procedure."
Multi-Modal Pre-Training for Automated Speech Recognition,"Traditionally, research in automated speech recognition has focused on local-first encoding of audio representations to predict the spoken phonemes in an utterance. Unfortunately, approaches relying on such hyper-local information tend to be vulnerable to both local-level corruption (such as audio-frame drops, or loud noises) and global-level noise (such as environmental noise, or background noise) that has not been seen during training. In this work, we introduce a novel approach which leverages a self-supervised learning technique based on masked language modeling to compute a global, multi-modal encoding of the environment in which the utterance occurs. We then use a new deep-fusion framework to integrate this global context into a traditional ASR method, and demonstrate that the resulting method can outperform baseline methods by up to 7% on Librispeech; gains on internal datasets range from 6% (on larger models) to 45% (on smaller models)."
AequeVox: Automated Fairness Testing of Speech Recognition Systems,"Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems have become ubiquitous. They can be found in a variety of form factors and are increasingly important in our daily lives. As such, ensuring that these systems are equitable to different subgroups of the population is crucial. In this paper, we introduce, AequeVox, an automated testing framework for evaluating the fairness of ASR systems. AequeVox simulates different environments to assess the effectiveness of ASR systems for different populations. In addition, we investigate whether the chosen simulations are comprehensible to humans. We further propose a fault localization technique capable of identifying words that are not robust to these varying environments. Both components of AequeVox are able to operate in the absence of ground truth data.  We evaluated AequeVox on speech from four different datasets using three different commercial ASRs. Our experiments reveal that non-native English, female and Nigerian English speakers generate 109%, 528.5% and 156.9% more errors, on average than native English, male and UK Midlands speakers, respectively. Our user study also reveals that 82.9% of the simulations (employed through speech transformations) had a comprehensibility rating above seven (out of ten), with the lowest rating being 6.78. This further validates the fairness violations discovered by AequeVox. Finally, we show that the non-robust words, as predicted by the fault localization technique embodied in AequeVox, show 223.8% more errors than the predicted robust words across all ASRs."
Speech Pattern based Black-box Model Watermarking for Automatic Speech Recognition,"As an effective method for intellectual property (IP) protection, model watermarking technology has been applied on a wide variety of deep neural networks (DNN), including speech classification models. However, how to design a black-box watermarking scheme for automatic speech recognition (ASR) models is still an unsolved problem, which is a significant demand for protecting remote ASR Application Programming Interface (API) deployed in cloud servers. Due to conditional independence assumption and label-detection-based evasion attack risk of ASR models, the black-box model watermarking scheme for speech classification models cannot apply to ASR models. In this paper, we propose the first black-box model watermarking framework for protecting the IP of ASR models. Specifically, we synthesize trigger audios by spreading the speech clips of model owners over the entire input audios and labeling the trigger audios with the stego texts, which hides the authorship information with linguistic steganography. Experiments on the state-of-the-art open-source ASR system DeepSpeech demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed watermarking scheme, which is robust against five kinds of attacks and has little impact on accuracy."
ViraPart: A Text Refinement Framework for Automatic Speech Recognition and Natural Language Processing Tasks in Persian,"The Persian language is an inflectional subject-object-verb language. This fact makes Persian a more uncertain language. However, using techniques such as Zero-Width Non-Joiner (ZWNJ) recognition, punctuation restoration, and Persian Ezafe construction will lead us to a more understandable and precise language. In most of the works in Persian, these techniques are addressed individually. Despite that, we believe that for text refinement in Persian, all of these tasks are necessary. In this work, we proposed a ViraPart framework that uses embedded ParsBERT in its core for text clarifications. First, used the BERT variant for Persian following by a classifier layer for classification procedures. Next, we combined models outputs to output cleartext. In the end, the proposed model for ZWNJ recognition, punctuation restoration, and Persian Ezafe construction performs the averaged F1 macro scores of 96.90%, 92.13%, and 98.50%, respectively. Experimental results show that our proposed approach is very effective in text refinement for the Persian language."
Multilingual Speech Recognition using Knowledge Transfer across Learning Processes,"Multilingual end-to-end(E2E) models have shown a great potential in the expansion of the language coverage in the realm of automatic speech recognition(ASR). In this paper, we aim to enhance the multilingual ASR performance in two ways, 1)studying the impact of feeding a one-hot vector identifying the language, 2)formulating the task with a meta-learning objective combined with self-supervised learning (SSL). We associate every language with a distinct task manifold and attempt to improve the performance by transferring knowledge across learning processes itself as compared to transferring through final model parameters. We employ this strategy on a dataset comprising of 6 languages for an in-domain ASR task, by minimizing an objective related to expected gradient path length. Experimental results reveal the best pre-training strategy resulting in 3.55% relative reduction in overall WER. A combination of LEAP and SSL yields 3.51% relative reduction in overall WER when using language ID."
Continual learning using lattice-free MMI for speech recognition,"Continual learning (CL), or domain expansion, recently became a popular topic for automatic speech recognition (ASR) acoustic modeling because practical systems have to be updated frequently in order to work robustly on types of speech not observed during initial training. While sequential adaptation allows tuning a system to a new domain, it may result in performance degradation on the old domains due to catastrophic forgetting. In this work we explore regularization-based CL for neural network acoustic models trained with the lattice-free maximum mutual information (LF-MMI) criterion. We simulate domain expansion by incrementally adapting the acoustic model on different public datasets that include several accents and speaking styles. We investigate two well-known CL techniques, elastic weight consolidation (EWC) and learning without forgetting (LWF), which aim to reduce forgetting by preserving model weights or network outputs. We additionally introduce a sequence-level LWF regularization, which exploits posteriors from the denominator graph of LF-MMI to further reduce forgetting. Empirical results show that the proposed sequence-level LWF can improve the best average word error rate across all domains by up to 9.4% relative compared with using regular LWF."
On Language Model Integration for RNN Transducer based Speech Recognition,"The mismatch between an external language model (LM) and the implicitly learned internal LM (ILM) of RNN-Transducer (RNN-T) can limit the performance of LM integration such as simple shallow fusion. A Bayesian interpretation suggests to remove this sequence prior as ILM correction. In this work, we study various ILM correction-based LM integration methods formulated in a common RNN-T framework. We provide a decoding interpretation on two major reasons for performance improvement with ILM correction, which is further experimentally verified with detailed analysis. We also propose an exact-ILM training framework by extending the proof given in the hybrid autoregressive transducer, which enables a theoretical justification for other ILM approaches. Systematic comparison is conducted for both in-domain and cross-domain evaluation on the Librispeech and TED-LIUM Release 2 corpora, respectively. Our proposed exact-ILM training can further improve the best ILM method."
Multistage linguistic conditioning of convolutional layers for speech emotion recognition,"In this contribution, we investigate the effectiveness of deep fusion of text and audio features for categorical and dimensional speech emotion recognition (SER). We propose a novel, multistage fusion method where the two information streams are integrated in several layers of a deep neural network (DNN), and contrast it with a single-stage one where the streams are merged in a single point. Both methods depend on extracting summary linguistic embeddings from a pre-trained BERT model, and conditioning one or more intermediate representations of a convolutional model operating on log-Mel spectrograms. Experiments on the MSP-Podcast and IEMOCAP datasets demonstrate that the two fusion methods clearly outperform a shallow (late) fusion baseline and their unimodal constituents, both in terms of quantitative performance and qualitative behaviour. Overall, our multistage fusion shows better quantitative performance, surpassing alternatives on most of our evaluations. This illustrates the potential of multistage fusion in better assimilating text and audio information."
Exploring Wav2vec 2.0 fine-tuning for improved speech emotion recognition,"While Wav2Vec 2.0 has been proposed for speech recognition (ASR), it can also be used for speech emotion recognition (SER); its performance can be significantly improved using different fine-tuning strategies. Two baseline methods, vanilla fine-tuning (V-FT) and task adaptive pretraining (TAPT) are first presented. We show that V-FT is able to outperform state-of-the-art models on the IEMOCAP dataset. TAPT, an existing NLP fine-tuning strategy, further improves the performance on SER. We also introduce a novel fine-tuning method termed P-TAPT, which modifies the TAPT objective to learn contextualized emotion representations. Experiments show that P-TAPT performs better than TAPT, especially under low-resource settings. Compared to prior works in this literature, our top-line system achieved a 7.4\% absolute improvement in unweighted accuracy (UA) over the state-of-the-art performance on IEMOCAP. Our code is publicly available."
Word Order Does Not Matter For Speech Recognition,"In this paper, we study training of automatic speech recognition system in a weakly supervised setting where the order of words in transcript labels of the audio training data is not known. We train a word-level acoustic model which aggregates the distribution of all output frames using LogSumExp operation and uses a cross-entropy loss to match with the ground-truth words distribution. Using the pseudo-labels generated from this model on the training set, we then train a letter-based acoustic model using Connectionist Temporal Classification loss. Our system achieves 2.3%/4.6% on test-clean/test-other subsets of LibriSpeech, which closely matches with the supervised baseline's performance."
SRU++: Pioneering Fast Recurrence with Attention for Speech Recognition,"The Transformer architecture has been well adopted as a dominant architecture in most sequence transduction tasks including automatic speech recognition (ASR), since its attention mechanism excels in capturing long-range dependencies. While models built solely upon attention can be better parallelized than regular RNN, a novel network architecture, SRU++, was recently proposed. By combining the fast recurrence and attention mechanism, SRU++ exhibits strong capability in sequence modeling and achieves near-state-of-the-art results in various language modeling and machine translation tasks with improved compute efficiency. In this work, we present the advantages of applying SRU++ in ASR tasks by comparing with Conformer across multiple ASR benchmarks and study how the benefits can be generalized to long-form speech inputs. On the popular LibriSpeech benchmark, our SRU++ model achieves 2.0% / 4.7% WER on test-clean / test-other, showing competitive performances compared with the state-of-the-art Conformer encoder under the same set-up. Specifically, SRU++ can surpass Conformer on long-form speech input with a large margin, based on our analysis."
Evaluating User Perception of Speech Recognition System Quality with Semantic Distance Metric,"Measuring automatic speech recognition (ASR) system quality is critical for creating user-satisfying voice-driven applications. Word Error Rate (WER) has been traditionally used to evaluate ASR system quality; however, it sometimes correlates poorly with user perception/judgement of transcription quality. This is because WER weighs every word equally and does not consider semantic correctness which has a higher impact on user perception. In this work, we propose evaluating ASR output hypotheses quality with SemDist that can measure semantic correctness by using the distance between the semantic vectors of the reference and hypothesis extracted from a pre-trained language model. Our experimental results of 71K and 36K user annotated ASR output quality show that SemDist achieves higher correlation with user perception than WER. We also show that SemDist has higher correlation with downstream Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks than WER."
Internal Language Model Adaptation with Text-Only Data for End-to-End Speech Recognition,"Text-only adaptation of an end-to-end (E2E) model remains a challenging task for automatic speech recognition (ASR). Language model (LM) fusion-based approaches require an additional external LM during inference, significantly increasing the computation cost. To overcome this, we propose an internal LM adaptation (ILMA) of the E2E model using text-only data. Trained with audio-transcript pairs, an E2E model implicitly learns an internal LM that characterizes the token sequence probability which is approximated by the E2E model output after zeroing out the encoder contribution. During ILMA, we fine-tune the internal LM, i.e., the E2E components excluding the encoder, to minimize a cross-entropy loss. To make ILMA effective, it is essential to train the E2E model with an internal LM loss besides the standard E2E loss. Furthermore, we propose to regularize ILMA by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the output distributions of the adapted and unadapted internal LMs. ILMA is the most effective when we update only the last linear layer of the joint network. ILMA enables a fast text-only adaptation of the E2E model without increasing the run-time computational cost. Experimented with 30K-hour trained transformer transducer models, ILMA achieves up to 34.9% relative word error rate reduction from the unadapted baseline."
Interactive Feature Fusion for End-to-End Noise-Robust Speech Recognition,"Speech enhancement (SE) aims to suppress the additive noise from a noisy speech signal to improve the speech's perceptual quality and intelligibility. However, the over-suppression phenomenon in the enhanced speech might degrade the performance of downstream automatic speech recognition (ASR) task due to the missing latent information. To alleviate such problem, we propose an interactive feature fusion network (IFF-Net) for noise-robust speech recognition to learn complementary information from the enhanced feature and original noisy feature. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves absolute word error rate (WER) reduction of 4.1% over the best baseline on RATS Channel-A corpus. Our further analysis indicates that the proposed IFF-Net can complement some missing information in the over-suppressed enhanced feature."
Streaming Transformer Transducer Based Speech Recognition Using Non-Causal Convolution,"This paper improves the streaming transformer transducer for speech recognition by using non-causal convolution. Many works apply the causal convolution to improve streaming transformer ignoring the lookahead context. We propose to use non-causal convolution to process the center block and lookahead context separately. This method leverages the lookahead context in convolution and maintains similar training and decoding efficiency. Given the similar latency, using the non-causal convolution with lookahead context gives better accuracy than causal convolution, especially for open-domain dictation scenarios. Besides, this paper applies talking-head attention and a novel history context compression scheme to further improve the performance. The talking-head attention improves the multi-head self-attention by transferring information among different heads. The history context compression method introduces more extended history context compactly. On our in-house data, the proposed methods improve a small Emformer baseline with lookahead context by relative WERR 5.1\%, 14.5\%, 8.4\% on open-domain dictation, assistant general scenarios, and assistant calling scenarios, respectively."
K-Wav2vec 2.0: Automatic Speech Recognition based on Joint Decoding of Graphemes and Syllables,"Wav2vec 2.0 is an end-to-end framework of self-supervised learning for speech representation that is successful in automatic speech recognition (ASR), but most of the work on the topic has been developed with a single language: English. Therefore, it is unclear whether the self-supervised framework is effective in recognizing other languages with different writing systems, such as Korean which uses the Hangul having a unique writing system. In this paper, we present K-Wav2Vec 2.0, which is a modified version of Wav2vec 2.0 designed for Korean automatic speech recognition by exploring and optimizing various factors of the original Wav2vec 2.0. In fine-tuning, we propose a multi-task hierarchical architecture to reflect the Korean writing structure. Moreover, a joint decoder is applied to alleviate the problem of words existing outside of the vocabulary. In pre-training, we attempted the cross-lingual transfer of the pre-trained model by further pre-training the English Wav2vec 2.0 on a Korean dataset, considering limited resources. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method yields the best performance on both Korean ASR datasets: Ksponspeech (a large-scale Korean speech corpus) and Clovacall (a call-based dialog corpus). Further pre-training is also effective in language adaptation, leading to large improvements without additional data."
Wav2vec-Switch: Contrastive Learning from Original-noisy Speech Pairs for Robust Speech Recognition,"The goal of self-supervised learning (SSL) for automatic speech recognition (ASR) is to learn good speech representations from a large amount of unlabeled speech for the downstream ASR task. However, most SSL frameworks do not consider noise robustness which is crucial for real-world applications. In this paper we propose wav2vec-Switch, a method to encode noise robustness into contextualized representations of speech via contrastive learning. Specifically, we feed original-noisy speech pairs simultaneously into the wav2vec 2.0 network. In addition to the existing contrastive learning task, we switch the quantized representations of the original and noisy speech as additional prediction targets of each other. By doing this, it enforces the network to have consistent predictions for the original and noisy speech, thus allows to learn contextualized representation with noise robustness. Our experiments on synthesized and real noisy data show the effectiveness of our method: it achieves 2.9--4.9% relative word error rate (WER) reduction on the synthesized noisy LibriSpeech data without deterioration on the original data, and 5.7% on CHiME-4 real 1-channel noisy data compared to a data augmentation baseline even with a strong language model for decoding. Our results on CHiME-4 can match or even surpass those with well-designed speech enhancement components."
Have best of both worlds: two-pass hybrid and E2E cascading framework for speech recognition,"Hybrid and end-to-end (E2E) systems have their individual advantages, with different error patterns in the speech recognition results. By jointly modeling audio and text, the E2E model performs better in matched scenarios and scales well with a large amount of paired audio-text training data. The modularized hybrid model is easier for customization, and better to make use of a massive amount of unpaired text data. This paper proposes a two-pass hybrid and E2E cascading (HEC) framework to combine the hybrid and E2E model in order to take advantage of both sides, with hybrid in the first pass and E2E in the second pass. We show that the proposed system achieves 8-10% relative word error rate reduction with respect to each individual system. More importantly, compared with the pure E2E system, we show the proposed system has the potential to keep the advantages of hybrid system, e.g., customization and segmentation capabilities. We also show the second pass E2E model in HEC is robust with respect to the change in the first pass hybrid model."
Personalized Automatic Speech Recognition Trained on Small Disordered Speech Datasets,"This study investigates the performance of personalized automatic speech recognition (ASR) for recognizing disordered speech using small amounts of per-speaker adaptation data. We trained personalized models for 195 individuals with different types and severities of speech impairment with training sets ranging in size from <1 minute to 18-20 minutes of speech data. Word error rate (WER) thresholds were selected to determine Success Percentage (the percentage of personalized models reaching the target WER) in different application scenarios. For the home automation scenario, 79% of speakers reached the target WER with 18-20 minutes of speech; but even with only 3-4 minutes of speech, 63% of speakers reached the target WER. Further evaluation found similar improvement on test sets with conversational and out-of-domain, unprompted phrases. Our results demonstrate that with only a few minutes of recordings, individuals with disordered speech could benefit from personalized ASR."
An Exploration of Self-Supervised Pretrained Representations for End-to-End Speech Recognition,"Self-supervised pretraining on speech data has achieved a lot of progress. High-fidelity representation of the speech signal is learned from a lot of untranscribed data and shows promising performance. Recently, there are several works focusing on evaluating the quality of self-supervised pretrained representations on various tasks without domain restriction, e.g. SUPERB. However, such evaluations do not provide a comprehensive comparison among many ASR benchmark corpora. In this paper, we focus on the general applications of pretrained speech representations, on advanced end-to-end automatic speech recognition (E2E-ASR) models. We select several pretrained speech representations and present the experimental results on various open-source and publicly available corpora for E2E-ASR. Without any modification of the back-end model architectures or training strategy, some of the experiments with pretrained representations, e.g., WSJ, WSJ0-2mix with HuBERT, reach or outperform current state-of-the-art (SOTA) recognition performance. Moreover, we further explore more scenarios for whether the pretraining representations are effective, such as the cross-language or overlapped speech. The scripts, configuratons and the trained models have been released in ESPnet to let the community reproduce our experiments and improve them."
Data Augmentation with Locally-time Reversed Speech for Automatic Speech Recognition,"Psychoacoustic studies have shown that locally-time reversed (LTR) speech, i.e., signal samples time-reversed within a short segment, can be accurately recognised by human listeners. This study addresses the question of how well a state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) system would perform on LTR speech. The underlying objective is to explore the feasibility of deploying LTR speech in the training of end-to-end (E2E) ASR models, as an attempt to data augmentation for improving the recognition performance. The investigation starts with experiments to understand the effect of LTR speech on general-purpose ASR. LTR speech with reversed segment duration of 5 ms - 50 ms is rendered and evaluated. For ASR training data augmentation with LTR speech, training sets are created by combining natural speech with different partitions of LTR speech. The efficacy of data augmentation is confirmed by ASR results on speech corpora in various languages and speaking styles. ASR on LTR speech with reversed segment duration of 15 ms - 30 ms is found to have lower error rate than with other segment duration. Data augmentation with these LTR speech achieves satisfactory and consistent improvement on ASR performance."
Arabic Speech Emotion Recognition Employing Wav2vec2.0 and HuBERT Based on BAVED Dataset,"Recently, there have been tremendous research outcomes in the fields of speech recognition and natural language processing. This is due to the well-developed multi-layers deep learning paradigms such as wav2vec2.0, Wav2vecU, WavBERT, and HuBERT that provide better representation learning and high information capturing. Such paradigms run on hundreds of unlabeled data, then fine-tuned on a small dataset for specific tasks. This paper introduces a deep learning constructed emotional recognition model for Arabic speech dialogues. The developed model employs the state of the art audio representations include wav2vec2.0 and HuBERT. The experiment and performance results of our model overcome the previous known outcomes."
SCaLa: Supervised Contrastive Learning for End-to-End Speech Recognition,"End-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models are usually trained to optimize the loss of the whole token sequence, while neglecting explicit phonemic-granularity supervision. This could result in recognition errors due to similar-phoneme confusion or phoneme reduction. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel framework based on Supervised Contrastive Learning (SCaLa) to enhance phonemic representation learning for end-to-end ASR systems. Specifically, we extend the self-supervised Masked Contrastive Predictive Coding (MCPC) to a fully-supervised setting, where the supervision is applied in the following way. First, SCaLa masks variable-length encoder features according to phoneme boundaries given phoneme forced-alignment extracted from a pre-trained acoustic model; it then predicts the masked features via contrastive learning. The forced-alignment can provide phoneme labels to mitigate the noise introduced by positive-negative pairs in self-supervised MCPC. Experiments on reading and spontaneous speech datasets show that our proposed approach achieves 2.8 and 1.4 points Character Error Rate (CER) absolute reductions compared to the baseline, respectively."
Improving Pseudo-label Training For End-to-end Speech Recognition Using Gradient Mask,"In the recent trend of semi-supervised speech recognition, both self-supervised representation learning and pseudo-labeling have shown promising results. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to combine their ideas for end-to-end speech recognition model. Without any extra loss function, we utilize the Gradient Mask to optimize the model when training on pseudo-label. This method forces the speech recognition model to predict from the masked input to learn strong acoustic representation and make training robust to label noise. In our semi-supervised experiments, the method can improve the model performance when training on pseudo-label and our method achieved competitive results comparing with other semi-supervised approaches on the Librispeech 100 hours experiments."
Explaining the Attention Mechanism of End-to-End Speech Recognition Using Decision Trees,"The attention mechanism has largely improved the performance of end-to-end speech recognition systems. However, the underlying behaviours of attention is not yet clearer. In this study, we use decision trees to explain how the attention mechanism impact itself in speech recognition. The results indicate that attention levels are largely impacted by their previous states rather than the encoder and decoder patterns. Additionally, the default attention mechanism seems to put more weights on closer states, but behaves poorly on modelling long-term dependencies of attention states."
Input Length Matters: Improving RNN-T and MWER Training for Long-form Telephony Speech Recognition,"End-to-end models have achieved state-of-the-art results on several automatic speech recognition tasks. However, they perform poorly when evaluated on long-form data, e.g., minutes long conversational telephony audio. One reason the model fails on long-form speech is that it has only seen short utterances during training. In this paper we study the effect of training utterance length on the word error rate (WER) for RNN-transducer (RNN-T) model. We compare two widely used training objectives, log loss (or RNN-T loss) and minimum word error rate (MWER) loss. We conduct experiments on telephony datasets in four languages. Our experiments show that for both losses, the WER on long-form speech reduces substantially as the training utterance length increases. The average relative WER gain is 15.7% for log loss and 8.8% for MWER loss. When training on short utterances, MWER loss leads to a lower WER than the log loss. Such difference between the two losses diminishes when the input length increases."
Enabling On-Device Training of Speech Recognition Models with Federated Dropout,"Federated learning can be used to train machine learning models on the edge on local data that never leave devices, providing privacy by default. This presents a challenge pertaining to the communication and computation costs associated with clients' devices. These costs are strongly correlated with the size of the model being trained, and are significant for state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition models.  We propose using federated dropout to reduce the size of client models while training a full-size model server-side. We provide empirical evidence of the effectiveness of federated dropout, and propose a novel approach to vary the dropout rate applied at each layer. Furthermore, we find that federated dropout enables a set of smaller sub-models within the larger model to independently have low word error rates, making it easier to dynamically adjust the size of the model deployed for inference."
Mandarin-English Code-switching Speech Recognition with Self-supervised Speech Representation Models,"Code-switching (CS) is common in daily conversations where more than one language is used within a sentence. The difficulties of CS speech recognition lie in alternating languages and the lack of transcribed data. Therefore, this paper uses the recently successful self-supervised learning (SSL) methods to leverage many unlabeled speech data without CS. We show that hidden representations of SSL models offer frame-level language identity even if the models are trained with English speech only. Jointly training CTC and language identification modules with self-supervised speech representations improves CS speech recognition performance. Furthermore, using multilingual speech data for pre-training obtains the best CS speech recognition."
SERAB: A multi-lingual benchmark for speech emotion recognition,"Recent developments in speech emotion recognition (SER) often leverage deep neural networks (DNNs). Comparing and benchmarking different DNN models can often be tedious due to the use of different datasets and evaluation protocols. To facilitate the process, here, we present the Speech Emotion Recognition Adaptation Benchmark (SERAB), a framework for evaluating the performance and generalization capacity of different approaches for utterance-level SER. The benchmark is composed of nine datasets for SER in six languages. Since the datasets have different sizes and numbers of emotional classes, the proposed setup is particularly suitable for estimating the generalization capacity of pre-trained DNN-based feature extractors. We used the proposed framework to evaluate a selection of standard hand-crafted feature sets and state-of-the-art DNN representations. The results highlight that using only a subset of the data included in SERAB can result in biased evaluation, while compliance with the proposed protocol can circumvent this issue."
WenetSpeech: A 10000+ Hours Multi-domain Mandarin Corpus for Speech Recognition,"In this paper, we present WenetSpeech, a multi-domain Mandarin corpus consisting of 10000+ hours high-quality labeled speech, 2400+ hours weakly labeled speech, and about 10000 hours unlabeled speech, with 22400+ hours in total. We collect the data from YouTube and Podcast, which covers a variety of speaking styles, scenarios, domains, topics, and noisy conditions. An optical character recognition (OCR) based method is introduced to generate the audio/text segmentation candidates for the YouTube data on its corresponding video captions, while a high-quality ASR transcription system is used to generate audio/text pair candidates for the Podcast data. Then we propose a novel end-to-end label error detection approach to further validate and filter the candidates. We also provide three manually labelled high-quality test sets along with WenetSpeech for evaluation -- Dev for cross-validation purpose in training, Test_Net, collected from Internet for matched test, and Test\_Meeting, recorded from real meetings for more challenging mismatched test. Baseline systems trained with WenetSpeech are provided for three popular speech recognition toolkits, namely Kaldi, ESPnet, and WeNet, and recognition results on the three test sets are also provided as benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, WenetSpeech is the current largest open-sourced Mandarin speech corpus with transcriptions, which benefits research on production-level speech recognition."
Improving Confidence Estimation on Out-of-Domain Data for End-to-End Speech Recognition,"As end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) models reach promising performance, various downstream tasks rely on good confidence estimators for these systems. Recent research has shown that model-based confidence estimators have a significant advantage over using the output softmax probabilities. If the input data to the speech recogniser is from mismatched acoustic and linguistic conditions, the ASR performance and the corresponding confidence estimators may exhibit severe degradation. Since confidence models are often trained on the same in-domain data as the ASR, generalising to out-of-domain (OOD) scenarios is challenging. By keeping the ASR model untouched, this paper proposes two approaches to improve the model-based confidence estimators on OOD data: using pseudo transcriptions and an additional OOD language model. With an ASR model trained on LibriSpeech, experiments show that the proposed methods can greatly improve the confidence metrics on TED-LIUM and Switchboard datasets while preserving in-domain performance. Furthermore, the improved confidence estimators are better calibrated on OOD data and can provide a much more reliable criterion for data selection."
Back from the future: bidirectional CTC decoding using future information in speech recognition,"In this paper, we propose a simple but effective method to decode the output of Connectionist Temporal Classifier (CTC) model using a bi-directional neural language model. The bidirectional language model uses the future as well as the past information in order to predict the next output in the sequence. The proposed method based on bi-directional beam search takes advantage of the CTC greedy decoding output to represent the noisy future information. Experiments on the Librispeechdataset demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method compared to baselines using unidirectional decoding. In particular, the boost inaccuracy is most apparent at the start of a sequence which is the most erroneous part for existing systems based on unidirectional decoding."
End-To-End Label Uncertainty Modeling for Speech-based Arousal Recognition Using Bayesian Neural Networks,"Emotions are subjective constructs. Recent end-to-end speech emotion recognition systems are typically agnostic to the subjective nature of emotions, despite their state-of-the-art performance. In this work, we introduce an end-to-end Bayesian neural network architecture to capture the inherent subjectivity in the arousal dimension of emotional expressions. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to use Bayesian neural networks for speech emotion recognition. At training, the network learns a distribution of weights to capture the inherent uncertainty related to subjective arousal annotations. To this end, we introduce a loss term that enables the model to be explicitly trained on a distribution of annotations, rather than training them exclusively on mean or gold-standard labels. We evaluate the proposed approach on the AVEC'16 dataset. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of the results reveals that the proposed model can aptly capture the distribution of subjective arousal annotations, with state-of-the-art results in mean and standard deviation estimations for uncertainty modeling."
Spell my name: keyword boosted speech recognition,"Recognition of uncommon words such as names and technical terminology is important to understanding conversations in context. However, the ability to recognise such words remains a challenge in modern automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems.  In this paper, we propose a simple but powerful ASR decoding method that can better recognise these uncommon keywords, which in turn enables better readability of the results. The method boosts the probabilities of given keywords in a beam search based on acoustic model predictions. The method does not require any training in advance.  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on the LibriSpeeech test sets and also internal data of real-world conversations. Our method significantly boosts keyword accuracy on the test sets, while maintaining the accuracy of the other words, and as well as providing significant qualitative improvements. This method is applicable to other tasks such as machine translation, or wherever unseen and difficult keywords need to be recognised in beam search."
Towards efficient end-to-end speech recognition with biologically-inspired neural networks,"Automatic speech recognition (ASR) is a capability which enables a program to process human speech into a written form. Recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to high-accuracy ASR systems based on deep neural networks, such as the recurrent neural network transducer (RNN-T). However, the core components and the performed operations of these approaches depart from the powerful biological counterpart, i.e., the human brain. On the other hand, the current developments in biologically-inspired ASR models, based on spiking neural networks (SNNs), lag behind in terms of accuracy and focus primarily on small scale applications. In this work, we revisit the incorporation of biologically-plausible models into deep learning and we substantially enhance their capabilities, by taking inspiration from the diverse neural and synaptic dynamics found in the brain. In particular, we introduce neural connectivity concepts emulating the axo-somatic and the axo-axonic synapses. Based on this, we propose novel deep learning units with enriched neuro-synaptic dynamics and integrate them into the RNN-T architecture. We demonstrate for the first time, that a biologically realistic implementation of a large-scale ASR model can yield competitive performance levels compared to the existing deep learning models. Specifically, we show that such an implementation bears several advantages, such as a reduced computational cost and a lower latency, which are critical for speech recognition applications."
Fast Contextual Adaptation with Neural Associative Memory for On-Device Personalized Speech Recognition,"Fast contextual adaptation has shown to be effective in improving Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) of rare words and when combined with an on-device personalized training, it can yield an even better recognition result. However, the traditional re-scoring approaches based on an external language model is prone to diverge during the personalized training. In this work, we introduce a model-based end-to-end contextual adaptation approach that is decoder-agnostic and amenable to on-device personalization. Our on-device simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the traditional re-scoring technique by 12% relative WER and 15.7% entity mention specific F1-score in a continues personalization scenario."
Building a Noisy Audio Dataset to Evaluate Machine Learning Approaches for Automatic Speech Recognition Systems,"Automatic speech recognition systems are part of people's daily lives, embedded in personal assistants and mobile phones, helping as a facilitator for human-machine interaction while allowing access to information in a practically intuitive way. Such systems are usually implemented using machine learning techniques, especially with deep neural networks. Even with its high performance in the task of transcribing text from speech, few works address the issue of its recognition in noisy environments and, usually, the datasets used do not contain noisy audio examples, while only mitigating this issue using data augmentation techniques. This work aims to present the process of building a dataset of noisy audios, in a specific case of degenerated audios due to interference, commonly present in radio transmissions. Additionally, we present initial results of a classifier that uses such data for evaluation, indicating the benefits of using this dataset in the recognizer's training process. Such recognizer achieves an average result of 0.4116 in terms of character error rate in the noisy set (SNR = 30)."
Significance of Data Augmentation for Improving Cleft Lip and Palate Speech Recognition,"The automatic recognition of pathological speech, particularly from children with any articulatory impairment, is a challenging task due to various reasons. The lack of available domain specific data is one such obstacle that hinders its usage for different speech-based applications targeting pathological speakers. In line with the challenge, in this work, we investigate a few data augmentation techniques to simulate training data for improving the children speech recognition considering the case of cleft lip and palate (CLP) speech. The augmentation techniques explored in this study, include vocal tract length perturbation (VTLP), reverberation, speaking rate, pitch modification, and speech feature modification using cycle consistent adversarial networks (CycleGAN). Our study finds that the data augmentation methods significantly improve the CLP speech recognition performance, which is more evident when we used feature modification using CycleGAN, VTLP and reverberation based methods. More specifically, the results from this study show that our systems produce an improved phone error rate compared to the systems without data augmentation."
Speech Technology for Everyone: Automatic Speech Recognition for Non-Native English with Transfer Learning,"To address the performance gap of English ASR models on L2 English speakers, we evaluate fine-tuning of pretrained wav2vec 2.0 models (Baevski et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2021) on L2-ARCTIC, a non-native English speech corpus (Zhao et al., 2018) under different training settings. We compare \textbf{(a)} models trained with a combination of diverse accents to ones trained with only specific accents and \textbf{(b)} results from different single-accent models. Our experiments demonstrate the promise of developing ASR models for non-native English speakers, even with small amounts of L2 training data and even without a language model. Our models also excel in the zero-shot setting where we train on multiple L2 datasets and test on a blind L2 test set."
FastCorrect 2: Fast Error Correction on Multiple Candidates for Automatic Speech Recognition,"Error correction is widely used in automatic speech recognition (ASR) to post-process the generated sentence, and can further reduce the word error rate (WER). Although multiple candidates are generated by an ASR system through beam search, current error correction approaches can only correct one sentence at a time, failing to leverage the voting effect from multiple candidates to better detect and correct error tokens. In this work, we propose FastCorrect 2, an error correction model that takes multiple ASR candidates as input for better correction accuracy. FastCorrect 2 adopts non-autoregressive generation for fast inference, which consists of an encoder that processes multiple source sentences and a decoder that generates the target sentence in parallel from the adjusted source sentence, where the adjustment is based on the predicted duration of each source token. However, there are some issues when handling multiple source sentences. First, it is non-trivial to leverage the voting effect from multiple source sentences since they usually vary in length. Thus, we propose a novel alignment algorithm to maximize the degree of token alignment among multiple sentences in terms of token and pronunciation similarity. Second, the decoder can only take one adjusted source sentence as input, while there are multiple source sentences. Thus, we develop a candidate predictor to detect the most suitable candidate for the decoder. Experiments on our inhouse dataset and AISHELL-1 show that FastCorrect 2 can further reduce the WER over the previous correction model with single candidate by 3.2% and 2.6%, demonstrating the effectiveness of leveraging multiple candidates in ASR error correction. FastCorrect 2 achieves better performance than the cascaded re-scoring and correction pipeline and can serve as a unified post-processing module for ASR."
BigSSL: Exploring the Frontier of Large-Scale Semi-Supervised Learning for Automatic Speech Recognition,"We summarize the results of a host of efforts using giant automatic speech recognition (ASR) models pre-trained using large, diverse unlabeled datasets containing approximately a million hours of audio. We find that the combination of pre-training, self-training and scaling up model size greatly increases data efficiency, even for extremely large tasks with tens of thousands of hours of labeled data. In particular, on an ASR task with 34k hours of labeled data, by fine-tuning an 8 billion parameter pre-trained Conformer model we can match state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance with only 3% of the training data and significantly improve SoTA with the full training set. We also report on the universal benefits gained from using big pre-trained and self-trained models for a large set of downstream tasks that cover a wide range of speech domains and span multiple orders of magnitudes of dataset sizes, including obtaining SoTA performance on many public benchmarks. In addition, we utilize the learned representation of pre-trained networks to achieve SoTA results on non-ASR tasks."
Challenges and Opportunities of Speech Recognition for Bengali Language,"Speech recognition is a fascinating process that offers the opportunity to interact and command the machine in the field of human-computer interactions. Speech recognition is a language-dependent system constructed directly based on the linguistic and textual properties of any language. Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems are currently being used to translate speech to text flawlessly. Although ASR systems are being strongly executed in international languages, ASR systems' implementation in the Bengali language has not reached an acceptable state. In this research work, we sedulously disclose the current status of the Bengali ASR system's research endeavors. In what follows, we acquaint the challenges that are mostly encountered while constructing a Bengali ASR system. We split the challenges into language-dependent and language-independent challenges and guide how the particular complications may be overhauled. Following a rigorous investigation and highlighting the challenges, we conclude that Bengali ASR systems require specific construction of ASR architectures based on the Bengali language's grammatical and phonetic structure."
Topic Model Robustness to Automatic Speech Recognition Errors in Podcast Transcripts,"For a multilingual podcast streaming service, it is critical to be able to deliver relevant content to all users independent of language. Podcast content relevance is conventionally determined using various metadata sources. However, with the increasing quality of speech recognition in many languages, utilizing automatic transcriptions to provide better content recommendations becomes possible. In this work, we explore the robustness of a Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic model when applied to transcripts created by an automatic speech recognition engine. Specifically, we explore how increasing transcription noise influences topics obtained from transcriptions in Danish; a low resource language. First, we observe a baseline of cosine similarity scores between topic embeddings from automatic transcriptions and the descriptions of the podcasts written by the podcast creators. We then observe how the cosine similarities decrease as transcription noise increases and conclude that even when automatic speech recognition transcripts are erroneous, it is still possible to obtain high-quality topic embeddings from the transcriptions."
Scenario Aware Speech Recognition: Advancements for Apollo Fearless Steps & CHiME-4 Corpora,"In this study, we propose to investigate triplet loss for the purpose of an alternative feature representation for ASR. We consider a general non-semantic speech representation, which is trained with a self-supervised criteria based on triplet loss called TRILL, for acoustic modeling to represent the acoustic characteristics of each audio. This strategy is then applied to the CHiME-4 corpus and CRSS-UTDallas Fearless Steps Corpus, with emphasis on the 100-hour challenge corpus which consists of 5 selected NASA Apollo-11 channels. An analysis of the extracted embeddings provides the foundation needed to characterize training utterances into distinct groups based on acoustic distinguishing properties. Moreover, we also demonstrate that triplet-loss based embedding performs better than i-Vector in acoustic modeling, confirming that the triplet loss is more effective than a speaker feature. With additional techniques such as pronunciation and silence probability modeling, plus multi-style training, we achieve a +5.42% and +3.18% relative WER improvement for the development and evaluation sets of the Fearless Steps Corpus. To explore generalization, we further test the same technique on the 1 channel track of CHiME-4 and observe a +11.90% relative WER improvement for real test data."
Audio-Visual Speech Recognition is Worth 32\times32\times8 Voxels,"Audio-visual automatic speech recognition (AV-ASR) introduces the video modality into the speech recognition process, often by relying on information conveyed by the motion of the speaker's mouth. The use of the video signal requires extracting visual features, which are then combined with the acoustic features to build an AV-ASR system [1]. This is traditionally done with some form of 3D convolutional network (e.g. VGG) as widely used in the computer vision community. Recently, image transformers [2] have been introduced to extract visual features useful for image classification tasks. In this work, we propose to replace the 3D convolutional visual front-end with a video transformer front-end. We train our systems on a large-scale dataset composed of YouTube videos and evaluate performance on the publicly available LRS3-TED set, as well as on a large set of YouTube videos. On a lip-reading task, the transformer-based front-end shows superior performance compared to a strong convolutional baseline. On an AV-ASR task, the transformer front-end performs as well as (or better than) the convolutional baseline. Fine-tuning our model on the LRS3-TED training set matches previous state of the art. Thus, we experimentally show the viability of the convolution-free model for AV-ASR."
Wav-BERT: Cooperative Acoustic and Linguistic Representation Learning for Low-Resource Speech Recognition,"Unifying acoustic and linguistic representation learning has become increasingly crucial to transfer the knowledge learned on the abundance of high-resource language data for low-resource speech recognition. Existing approaches simply cascade pre-trained acoustic and language models to learn the transfer from speech to text. However, how to solve the representation discrepancy of speech and text is unexplored, which hinders the utilization of acoustic and linguistic information. Moreover, previous works simply replace the embedding layer of the pre-trained language model with the acoustic features, which may cause the catastrophic forgetting problem. In this work, we introduce Wav-BERT, a cooperative acoustic and linguistic representation learning method to fuse and utilize the contextual information of speech and text. Specifically, we unify a pre-trained acoustic model (wav2vec 2.0) and a language model (BERT) into an end-to-end trainable framework. A Representation Aggregation Module is designed to aggregate acoustic and linguistic representation, and an Embedding Attention Module is introduced to incorporate acoustic information into BERT, which can effectively facilitate the cooperation of two pre-trained models and thus boost the representation learning. Extensive experiments show that our Wav-BERT significantly outperforms the existing approaches and achieves state-of-the-art performance on low-resource speech recognition."
Hybrid Data Augmentation and Deep Attention-based Dilated Convolutional-Recurrent Neural Networks for Speech Emotion Recognition,"Speech emotion recognition (SER) has been one of the significant tasks in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) applications. However, it is hard to choose the optimal features and deal with imbalance labeled data. In this article, we investigate hybrid data augmentation (HDA) methods to generate and balance data based on traditional and generative adversarial networks (GAN) methods. To evaluate the effectiveness of HDA methods, a deep learning framework namely (ADCRNN) is designed by integrating deep dilated convolutional-recurrent neural networks with an attention mechanism. Besides, we choose 3D log Mel-spectrogram (MelSpec) features as the inputs for the deep learning framework. Furthermore, we reconfigure a loss function by combining a softmax loss and a center loss to classify the emotions. For validating our proposed methods, we use the EmoDB dataset that consists of several emotions with imbalanced samples. Experimental results prove that the proposed methods achieve better accuracy than the state-of-the-art methods on the EmoDB with 87.12% and 88.47% for the traditional and GAN-based methods, respectively."
Dual-Encoder Architecture with Encoder Selection for Joint Close-Talk and Far-Talk Speech Recognition,"In this paper, we propose a dual-encoder ASR architecture for joint modeling of close-talk (CT) and far-talk (FT) speech, in order to combine the advantages of CT and FT devices for better accuracy. The key idea is to add an encoder selection network to choose the optimal input source (CT or FT) and the corresponding encoder. We use a single-channel encoder for CT speech and a multi-channel encoder with Spatial Filtering neural beamforming for FT speech, which are jointly trained with the encoder selection. We validate our approach on both attention-based and RNN Transducer end-to-end ASR systems. The experiments are done with conversational speech from a medical use case, which is recorded simultaneously with a CT device and a microphone array. Our results show that the proposed dual-encoder architecture obtains up to 9% relative WER reduction when using both CT and FT input, compared to the best single-encoder system trained and tested in matched condition."
FSER: Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Speech Emotion Recognition,"Using mel-spectrograms over conventional MFCCs features, we assess the abilities of convolutional neural networks to accurately recognize and classify emotions from speech data. We introduce FSER, a speech emotion recognition model trained on four valid speech databases, achieving a high-classification accuracy of 95,05\%, over 8 different emotion classes: anger, anxiety, calm, disgust, happiness, neutral, sadness, surprise. On each benchmark dataset, FSER outperforms the best models introduced so far, achieving a state-of-the-art performance. We show that FSER stays reliable, independently of the language, sex identity, and any other external factor. Additionally, we describe how FSER could potentially be used to improve mental and emotional health care and how our analysis and findings serve as guidelines and benchmarks for further works in the same direction."
Utterance-level neural confidence measure for end-to-end children speech recognition,"Confidence measure is a performance index of particular importance for automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems deployed in real-world scenarios. In the present study, utterance-level neural confidence measure (NCM) in end-to-end automatic speech recognition (E2E ASR) is investigated. The E2E system adopts the joint CTC-attention Transformer architecture. The prediction of NCM is formulated as a task of binary classification, i.e., accept/reject the input utterance, based on a set of predictor features acquired during the ASR decoding process. The investigation is focused on evaluating and comparing the efficacies of predictor features that are derived from different internal and external modules of the E2E system. Experiments are carried out on children speech, for which state-of-the-art ASR systems show less than satisfactory performance and robust confidence measure is particularly useful. It is noted that predictor features related to acoustic information of speech play a more important role in estimating confidence measure than those related to linguistic information. N-best score features show significantly better performance than single-best ones. It has also been shown that the metrics of EER and AUC are not appropriate to evaluate the NCM of a mismatched ASR with significant performance gap."
Improving Accent Identification and Accented Speech Recognition Under a Framework of Self-supervised Learning,"Recently, self-supervised pre-training has gained success in automatic speech recognition (ASR). However, considering the difference between speech accents in real scenarios, how to identify accents and use accent features to improve ASR is still challenging. In this paper, we employ the self-supervised pre-training method for both accent identification and accented speech recognition tasks. For the former task, a standard deviation constraint loss (SDC-loss) based end-to-end (E2E) architecture is proposed to identify accents under the same language. As for accented speech recognition task, we design an accent-dependent ASR system, which can utilize additional accent input features. Furthermore, we propose a frame-level accent feature, which is extracted based on the proposed accent identification model and can be dynamically adjusted. We pre-train our models using 960 hours unlabeled LibriSpeech dataset and fine-tune them on AESRC2020 speech dataset. The experimental results show that our proposed accent-dependent ASR system is significantly ahead of the AESRC2020 baseline and achieves 6.5\% relative word error rate (WER) reduction compared with our accent-independent ASR system."
Performance-Efficiency Trade-offs in Unsupervised Pre-training for Speech Recognition,"This paper is a study of performance-efficiency trade-offs in pre-trained models for automatic speech recognition (ASR). We focus on wav2vec 2.0, and formalize several architecture designs that influence both the model performance and its efficiency. Putting together all our observations, we introduce SEW (Squeezed and Efficient Wav2vec), a pre-trained model architecture with significant improvements along both performance and efficiency dimensions across a variety of training setups. For example, under the 100h-960h semi-supervised setup on LibriSpeech, SEW achieves a 1.9x inference speedup compared to wav2vec 2.0, with a 13.5% relative reduction in word error rate. With a similar inference time, SEW reduces word error rate by 25-50% across different model sizes."
Non-autoregressive Transformer with Unified Bidirectional Decoder for Automatic Speech Recognition,"Non-autoregressive (NAR) transformer models have been studied intensively in automatic speech recognition (ASR), and a substantial part of NAR transformer models is to use the casual mask to limit token dependencies. However, the casual mask is designed for the left-to-right decoding process of the non-parallel autoregressive (AR) transformer, which is inappropriate for the parallel NAR transformer since it ignores the right-to-left contexts. Some models are proposed to utilize right-to-left contexts with an extra decoder, but these methods increase the model complexity. To tackle the above problems, we propose a new non-autoregressive transformer with a unified bidirectional decoder (NAT-UBD), which can simultaneously utilize left-to-right and right-to-left contexts. However, direct use of bidirectional contexts will cause information leakage, which means the decoder output can be affected by the character information from the input of the same position. To avoid information leakage, we propose a novel attention mask and modify vanilla queries, keys, and values matrices for NAT-UBD. Experimental results verify that NAT-UBD can achieve character error rates (CERs) of 5.0%/5.5% on the Aishell1 dev/test sets, outperforming all previous NAR transformer models. Moreover, NAT-UBD can run 49.8x faster than the AR transformer baseline when decoding in a single step."
Large-vocabulary Audio-visual Speech Recognition in Noisy Environments,"Audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) can effectively and significantly improve the recognition rates of small-vocabulary systems, compared to their audio-only counterparts. For large-vocabulary systems, however, there are still many difficulties, such as unsatisfactory video recognition accuracies, that make it hard to improve over audio-only baselines. In this paper, we specifically consider such scenarios, focusing on the large-vocabulary task of the LRS2 database, where audio-only performance is far superior to video-only accuracies, making this an interesting and challenging setup for multi-modal integration.  To address the inherent difficulties, we propose a new fusion strategy: a recurrent integration network is trained to fuse the state posteriors of multiple single-modality models, guided by a set of model-based and signal-based stream reliability measures. During decoding, this network is used for stream integration within a hybrid recognizer, where it can thus cope with the time-variant reliability and information content of its multiple feature inputs.  We compare the results with end-to-end AVSR systems as well as with competitive hybrid baseline models, finding that the new fusion strategy shows superior results, on average even outperforming oracle dynamic stream weighting, which has so far marked the -- realistically unachievable -- upper bound for standard stream weighting. Even though the pure lipreading performance is low, audio-visual integration is helpful under all -- clean, noisy, and reverberant -- conditions. On average, the new system achieves a relative word error rate reduction of 42.18\% compared to the audio-only model, pointing at a high effectiveness of the proposed integration approach."
Self-Attention Channel Combinator Frontend for End-to-End Multichannel Far-field Speech Recognition,"When a sufficiently large far-field training data is presented, jointly optimizing a multichannel frontend and an end-to-end (E2E) Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) backend shows promising results. Recent literature has shown traditional beamformer designs, such as MVDR (Minimum Variance Distortionless Response) or fixed beamformers can be successfully integrated as the frontend into an E2E ASR system with learnable parameters. In this work, we propose the self-attention channel combinator (SACC) ASR frontend, which leverages the self-attention mechanism to combine multichannel audio signals in the magnitude spectral domain. Experiments conducted on a multichannel playback test data shows that the SACC achieved a 9.3% WERR compared to a state-of-the-art fixed beamformer-based frontend, both jointly optimized with a ContextNet-based ASR backend. We also demonstrate the connection between the SACC and the traditional beamformers, and analyze the intermediate outputs of the SACC."
Accounting for Variations in Speech Emotion Recognition with Nonparametric Hierarchical Neural Network,"In recent years, deep-learning-based speech emotion recognition models have outperformed classical machine learning models. Previously, neural network designs, such as Multitask Learning, have accounted for variations in emotional expressions due to demographic and contextual factors. However, existing models face a few constraints: 1) they rely on a clear definition of domains (e.g. gender, noise condition, etc.) and the availability of domain labels; 2) they often attempt to learn domain-invariant features while emotion expressions can be domain-specific. In the present study, we propose the Nonparametric Hierarchical Neural Network (NHNN), a lightweight hierarchical neural network model based on Bayesian nonparametric clustering. In comparison to Multitask Learning approaches, the proposed model does not require domain/task labels. In our experiments, the NHNN models generally outperform the models with similar levels of complexity and state-of-the-art models in within-corpus and cross-corpus tests. Through clustering analysis, we show that the NHNN models are able to learn group-specific features and bridge the performance gap between groups."
DeepEMO: Deep Learning for Speech Emotion Recognition,"We proposed the industry level deep learning approach for speech emotion recognition task. In industry, carefully proposed deep transfer learning technology shows real results due to mostly low amount of training data availability, machine training cost, and specialized learning on dedicated AI tasks. The proposed speech recognition framework, called DeepEMO, consists of two main pipelines such that preprocessing to extract efficient main features and deep transfer learning model to train and recognize. Main source code is in https://github.com/enkhtogtokh/deepemo repository"
Multilingual Speech Recognition for Low-Resource Indian Languages using Multi-Task conformer,"Transformers have recently become very popular for sequence-to-sequence applications such as machine translation and speech recognition. In this work, we propose a multi-task learning-based transformer model for low-resource multilingual speech recognition for Indian languages. Our proposed model consists of a conformer [1] encoder and two parallel transformer decoders. We use a phoneme decoder (PHN-DEC) for the phoneme recognition task and a grapheme decoder (GRP-DEC) to predict grapheme sequence. We consider the phoneme recognition task as an auxiliary task for our multi-task learning framework. We jointly optimize the network for both phoneme and grapheme recognition tasks using Joint CTC-Attention [2] training. We use a conditional decoding scheme to inject the language information into the model before predicting the grapheme sequence. Our experiments show that our proposed approach can obtain significant improvement over previous approaches [4]. We also show that our conformer-based dual-decoder approach outperforms both the transformer-based dual-decoder approach and single decoder approach. Finally, We compare monolingual ASR models with our proposed multilingual ASR approach."
A Dual-Decoder Conformer for Multilingual Speech Recognition,"Transformer-based models have recently become very popular for sequence-to-sequence applications such as machine translation and speech recognition. This work proposes a dual-decoder transformer model for low-resource multilingual speech recognition for Indian languages. Our proposed model consists of a Conformer [1] encoder, two parallel transformer decoders, and a language classifier. We use a phoneme decoder (PHN-DEC) for the phoneme recognition task and a grapheme decoder (GRP-DEC) to predict grapheme sequence along with language information. We consider phoneme recognition and language identification as auxiliary tasks in the multi-task learning framework. We jointly optimize the network for phoneme recognition, grapheme recognition, and language identification tasks with Joint CTC-Attention [2] training. Our experiments show that we can obtain a significant reduction in WER over the baseline approaches. We also show that our dual-decoder approach obtains significant improvement over the single decoder approach."
Few-shot Learning in Emotion Recognition of Spontaneous Speech Using a Siamese Neural Network with Adaptive Sample Pair Formation,"Speech-based machine learning (ML) has been heralded as a promising solution for tracking prosodic and spectrotemporal patterns in real-life that are indicative of emotional changes, providing a valuable window into one's cognitive and mental state. Yet, the scarcity of labelled data in ambulatory studies prevents the reliable training of ML models, which usually rely on ""data-hungry"" distribution-based learning. Leveraging the abundance of labelled speech data from acted emotions, this paper proposes a few-shot learning approach for automatically recognizing emotion in spontaneous speech from a small number of labelled samples. Few-shot learning is implemented via a metric learning approach through a siamese neural network, which models the relative distance between samples rather than relying on learning absolute patterns of the corresponding distributions of each emotion. Results indicate the feasibility of the proposed metric learning in recognizing emotions from spontaneous speech in four datasets, even with a small amount of labelled samples. They further demonstrate superior performance of the proposed metric learning compared to commonly used adaptation methods, including network fine-tuning and adversarial learning. Findings from this work provide a foundation for the ambulatory tracking of human emotion in spontaneous speech contributing to the real-life assessment of mental health degradation."
Efficient conformer: Progressive downsampling and grouped attention for automatic speech recognition,"The recently proposed Conformer architecture has shown state-of-the-art performances in Automatic Speech Recognition by combining convolution with attention to model both local and global dependencies. In this paper, we study how to reduce the Conformer architecture complexity with a limited computing budget, leading to a more efficient architecture design that we call Efficient Conformer. We introduce progressive downsampling to the Conformer encoder and propose a novel attention mechanism named grouped attention, allowing us to reduce attention complexity from O(n^{2}d) to O(n^{2}d / g) for sequence length n, hidden dimension d and group size parameter g. We also experiment the use of strided multi-head self-attention as a global downsampling operation. Our experiments are performed on the LibriSpeech dataset with CTC and RNN-Transducer losses. We show that within the same computing budget, the proposed architecture achieves better performances with faster training and decoding compared to the Conformer. Our 13M parameters CTC model achieves competitive WERs of 3.6%/9.0% without using a language model and 2.7%/6.7% with an external n-gram language model on the test-clean/test-other sets while being 29% faster than our CTC Conformer baseline at inference and 36% faster to train."
Exploring Retraining-Free Speech Recognition for Intra-sentential Code-Switching,"In this paper, we present our initial efforts for building a code-switching (CS) speech recognition system leveraging existing acoustic models (AMs) and language models (LMs), i.e., no training required, and specifically targeting intra-sentential switching. To achieve such an ambitious goal, new mechanisms for foreign pronunciation generation and language model (LM) enrichment have been devised. Specifically, we have designed an automatic approach to obtain high quality pronunciation of foreign language (FL) words in the native language (NL) phoneme set using existing acoustic phone decoders and an LSTM-based grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) model. Improved accented pronunciations have thus been obtained by learning foreign pronunciations directly from data. Furthermore, a code-switching LM was deployed by converting the original NL LM into a CS LM using translated word pairs and borrowing statistics for the NL LM. Experimental evidence clearly demonstrates that our approach better deals with accented foreign pronunciations than techniques based on human labeling. Moreover, our best system achieves a 55.5% relative word error rate reduction from 34.4%, obtained with a conventional monolingual ASR system, to 15.3% on an intra-sentential CS task without harming the monolingual recognition accuracy."
Tree-constrained Pointer Generator for End-to-end Contextual Speech Recognition,"Contextual knowledge is important for real-world automatic speech recognition (ASR) applications. In this paper, a novel tree-constrained pointer generator (TCPGen) component is proposed that incorporates such knowledge as a list of biasing words into both attention-based encoder-decoder and transducer end-to-end ASR models in a neural-symbolic way. TCPGen structures the biasing words into an efficient prefix tree to serve as its symbolic input and creates a neural shortcut between the tree and the final ASR output distribution to facilitate recognising biasing words during decoding. Systems were trained and evaluated on the Librispeech corpus where biasing words were extracted at the scales of an utterance, a chapter, or a book to simulate different application scenarios. Experimental results showed that TCPGen consistently improved word error rates (WERs) compared to the baselines, and in particular, achieved significant WER reductions on the biasing words. TCPGen is highly efficient: it can handle 5,000 biasing words and distractors and only add a small overhead to memory use and computation cost."
Adversarial Example Devastation and Detection on Speech Recognition System by Adding Random Noise,"An automatic speech recognition (ASR) system based on a deep neural network is vulnerable to attack by an adversarial example, especially if the command-dependent ASR fails. A defense method against adversarial examples is proposed to improve the robustness and security of the ASR system. We propose an algorithm of devastation and detection on adversarial examples that can attack current advanced ASR systems. We choose an advanced text- and command-dependent ASR system as our target, generating adversarial examples by an optimization-based attack on text-dependent ASR and the GA-based algorithm on command-dependent ASR. The method is based on input transformation of adversarial examples. Different random intensities and kinds of noise are added to adversarial examples to devastate the perturbation previously added to normal examples. Experimental results show that the method performs well. For the devastation of examples, the original speech similarity after adding noise can reach 99.68%, the similarity of adversarial examples can reach zero, and the detection rate of adversarial examples can reach 94%."
Multi-Channel Transformer Transducer for Speech Recognition,"Multi-channel inputs offer several advantages over single-channel, to improve the robustness of on-device speech recognition systems. Recent work on multi-channel transformer, has proposed a way to incorporate such inputs into end-to-end ASR for improved accuracy. However, this approach is characterized by a high computational complexity, which prevents it from being deployed in on-device systems. In this paper, we present a novel speech recognition model, Multi-Channel Transformer Transducer (MCTT), which features end-to-end multi-channel training, low computation cost, and low latency so that it is suitable for streaming decoding in on-device speech recognition. In a far-field in-house dataset, our MCTT outperforms stagewise multi-channel models with transformer-transducer up to 6.01% relative WER improvement (WERR). In addition, MCTT outperforms the multi-channel transformer up to 11.62% WERR, and is 15.8 times faster in terms of inference speed. We further show that we can improve the computational cost of MCTT by constraining the future and previous context in attention computations."
Investigations on Speech Recognition Systems for Low-Resource Dialectal Arabic-English Code-Switching Speech,"Code-switching (CS), defined as the mixing of languages in conversations, has become a worldwide phenomenon. The prevalence of CS has been recently met with a growing demand and interest to build CS ASR systems. In this paper, we present our work on code-switched Egyptian Arabic-English automatic speech recognition (ASR). We first contribute in filling the huge gap in resources by collecting, analyzing and publishing our spontaneous CS Egyptian Arabic-English speech corpus. We build our ASR systems using DNN-based hybrid and Transformer-based end-to-end models. In this paper, we present a thorough comparison between both approaches under the setting of a low-resource, orthographically unstandardized, and morphologically rich language pair. We show that while both systems give comparable overall recognition results, each system provides complementary sets of strength points. We show that recognition can be improved by combining the outputs of both systems. We propose several effective system combination approaches, where hypotheses of both systems are merged on sentence- and word-levels. Our approaches result in overall WER relative improvement of 4.7%, over a baseline performance of 32.1% WER. In the case of intra-sentential CS sentences, we achieve WER relative improvement of 4.8%. Our best performing system achieves 30.6% WER on ArzEn test set."
Grammar Based Speaker Role Identification for Air Traffic Control Speech Recognition,"Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) for air traffic control is generally trained by pooling Air Traffic Controller (ATCO) and pilot data into one set. This is motivated by the fact that pilot's voice communications are more scarce than ATCOs. Due to this data imbalance and other reasons (e.g., varying acoustic conditions), the speech from ATCOs is usually recognized more accurately than from pilots. Automatically identifying the speaker roles is a challenging task, especially in the case of the noisy voice recordings collected using Very High Frequency (VHF) receivers or due to the unavailability of the push-to-talk (PTT) signal, i.e., both audio channels are mixed. In this work, we propose to (1) automatically segment the ATCO and pilot data based on an intuitive approach exploiting ASR transcripts and (2) subsequently consider an automatic recognition of ATCOs' and pilots' voice as two separate tasks. Our work is performed on VHF audio data with high noise levels, i.e., signal-to-noise (SNR) ratios below 15 dB, as this data is recognized to be helpful for various speech-based machine-learning tasks. Specifically, for the speaker role identification task, the module is represented by a simple yet efficient knowledge-based system exploiting a grammar defined by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). The system accepts text as the input, either manually verified annotations or automatically generated transcripts. The developed approach provides an average accuracy in speaker role identification of about 83%. Finally, we show that training an acoustic model for ASR tasks separately (i.e., separate models for ATCOs and pilots) or using a multitask approach is well suited for the noisy data and outperforms the traditional ASR system where all data is pooled together."
4-bit Quantization of LSTM-based Speech Recognition Models,"We investigate the impact of aggressive low-precision representations of weights and activations in two families of large LSTM-based architectures for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR): hybrid Deep Bidirectional LSTM - Hidden Markov Models (DBLSTM-HMMs) and Recurrent Neural Network - Transducers (RNN-Ts). Using a 4-bit integer representation, a naïve quantization approach applied to the LSTM portion of these models results in significant Word Error Rate (WER) degradation. On the other hand, we show that minimal accuracy loss is achievable with an appropriate choice of quantizers and initializations. In particular, we customize quantization schemes depending on the local properties of the network, improving recognition performance while limiting computational time. We demonstrate our solution on the Switchboard (SWB) and CallHome (CH) test sets of the NIST Hub5-2000 evaluation. DBLSTM-HMMs trained with 300 or 2000 hours of SWB data achieves <0.5% and <1% average WER degradation, respectively. On the more challenging RNN-T models, our quantization strategy limits degradation in 4-bit inference to 1.3%."
Automatic Speech Recognition And Limited Vocabulary: A Survey,"Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is an active field of research due to its large number of applications and the proliferation of interfaces or computing devices that can support speech processing. However, the bulk of applications are based on well-resourced languages that overshadow under-resourced ones. Yet, ASR represents an undeniable means to promote such languages, especially when designing human-to-human or human-to-machine systems involving illiterate people. An approach to design an ASR system targeting under-resourced languages is to start with a limited vocabulary. ASR using a limited vocabulary is a subset of the speech recognition problem that focuses on the recognition of a small number of words or sentences. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive view of mechanisms behind ASR systems as well as techniques, tools, projects, recent contributions, and possible future directions in ASR using a limited vocabulary. This work consequently provides a way forward when designing an ASR system using limited vocabulary. Although an emphasis is put on limited vocabulary, most of the tools and techniques reported in this survey can be applied to ASR systems in general."
"Adapting GPT, GPT-2 and BERT Language Models for Speech Recognition","Language models (LMs) pre-trained on massive amounts of text, in particular bidirectional encoder representations from Transformers (BERT), generative pre-training (GPT), and GPT-2, have become a key technology for many natural language processing tasks. In this paper, we present results using fine-tuned GPT, GPT-2, and their combination for automatic speech recognition (ASR). Unlike unidirectional LM GPT and GPT-2, BERT is bidirectional whose direct product of the output probabilities is no longer a valid language prior probability. A conversion method is proposed to compute the correct language prior probability based on bidirectional LM outputs in a mathematically exact way. Experimental results on the widely used AMI and Switchboard ASR tasks showed that the combination of the fine-tuned GPT and GPT-2 outperformed the combination of three neural LMs with different architectures trained from scratch on the in-domain text by up to a 12% relative word error rate reduction (WERR). Furthermore, on the AMI corpus, the proposed conversion for language prior probabilities enables BERT to obtain an extra 3% relative WERR, and the combination of BERT, GPT and GPT-2 results in further improvements."
A Light-weight contextual spelling correction model for customizing transducer-based speech recognition systems,"It's challenging to customize transducer-based automatic speech recognition (ASR) system with context information which is dynamic and unavailable during model training. In this work, we introduce a light-weight contextual spelling correction model to correct context-related recognition errors in transducer-based ASR systems. We incorporate the context information into the spelling correction model with a shared context encoder and use a filtering algorithm to handle large-size context lists. Experiments show that the model improves baseline ASR model performance with about 50% relative word error rate reduction, which also significantly outperforms the baseline method such as contextual LM biasing. The model also shows excellent performance for out-of-vocabulary terms not seen during training."
Dereverberation of Autoregressive Envelopes for Far-field Speech Recognition,"The task of speech recognition in far-field environments is adversely affected by the reverberant artifacts that elicit as the temporal smearing of the sub-band envelopes. In this paper, we develop a neural model for speech dereverberation using the long-term sub-band envelopes of speech. The sub-band envelopes are derived using frequency domain linear prediction (FDLP) which performs an autoregressive estimation of the Hilbert envelopes. The neural dereverberation model estimates the envelope gain which when applied to reverberant signals suppresses the late reflection components in the far-field signal. The dereverberated envelopes are used for feature extraction in speech recognition. Further, the sequence of steps involved in envelope dereverberation, feature extraction and acoustic modeling for ASR can be implemented as a single neural processing pipeline which allows the joint learning of the dereverberation network and the acoustic model. Several experiments are performed on the REVERB challenge dataset, CHiME-3 dataset and VOiCES dataset. In these experiments, the joint learning of envelope dereverberation and acoustic model yields significant performance improvements over the baseline ASR system based on log-mel spectrogram as well as other past approaches for dereverberation (average relative improvements of 10-24% over the baseline system). A detailed analysis on the choice of hyper-parameters and the cost function involved in envelope dereverberation is also provided."
StarGAN-VC+ASR: StarGAN-based Non-Parallel Voice Conversion Regularized by Automatic Speech Recognition,"Preserving the linguistic content of input speech is essential during voice conversion (VC). The star generative adversarial network-based VC method (StarGAN-VC) is a recently developed method that allows non-parallel many-to-many VC. Although this method is powerful, it can fail to preserve the linguistic content of input speech when the number of available training samples is extremely small. To overcome this problem, we propose the use of automatic speech recognition to assist model training, to improve StarGAN-VC, especially in low-resource scenarios.  Experimental results show that using our proposed method, StarGAN-VC can retain more linguistic information than vanilla StarGAN-VC."
Time-Frequency Localization Using Deep Convolutional Maxout Neural Network in Persian Speech Recognition,"In this paper, a CNN-based structure for the time-frequency localization of information is proposed for Persian speech recognition. Research has shown that the receptive fields' spectrotemporal plasticity of some neurons in mammals' primary auditory cortex and midbrain makes localization facilities improve recognition performance. Over the past few years, much work has been done to localize time-frequency information in ASR systems, using the spatial or temporal immutability properties of methods such as HMMs, TDNNs, CNNs, and LSTM-RNNs. However, most of these models have large parameter volumes and are challenging to train. For this purpose, we have presented a structure called Time-Frequency Convolutional Maxout Neural Network (TFCMNN) in which parallel time-domain and frequency-domain 1D-CMNNs are applied simultaneously and independently to the spectrogram, and then their outputs are concatenated and applied jointly to a fully connected Maxout network for classification. To improve the performance of this structure, we have used newly developed methods and models such as Dropout, maxout, and weight normalization. Two sets of experiments were designed and implemented on the FARSDAT dataset to evaluate the performance of this model compared to conventional 1D-CMNN models. According to the experimental results, the average recognition score of TFCMNN models is about 1.6% higher than the average of conventional 1D-CMNN models. In addition, the average training time of the TFCMNN models is about 17 hours lower than the average training time of traditional models. Therefore, as proven in other sources, time-frequency localization in ASR systems increases system accuracy and speeds up the training process."
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation in Speech Recognition using Phonetic Features,"Automatic speech recognition is a difficult problem in pattern recognition because several sources of variability exist in the speech input like the channel variations, the input might be clean or noisy, the speakers may have different accent and variations in the gender, etc. As a result, domain adaptation is important in speech recognition where we train the model for a particular source domain and test it on a different target domain. In this paper, we propose a technique to perform unsupervised gender-based domain adaptation in speech recognition using phonetic features. The experiments are performed on the TIMIT dataset and there is a considerable decrease in the phoneme error rate using the proposed approach."
Improved Speech Emotion Recognition using Transfer Learning and Spectrogram Augmentation,"Automatic speech emotion recognition (SER) is a challenging task that plays a crucial role in natural human-computer interaction. One of the main challenges in SER is data scarcity, i.e., insufficient amounts of carefully labeled data to build and fully explore complex deep learning models for emotion classification. This paper aims to address this challenge using a transfer learning strategy combined with spectrogram augmentation. Specifically, we propose a transfer learning approach that leverages a pre-trained residual network (ResNet) model including a statistics pooling layer from speaker recognition trained using large amounts of speaker-labeled data. The statistics pooling layer enables the model to efficiently process variable-length input, thereby eliminating the need for sequence truncation which is commonly used in SER systems. In addition, we adopt a spectrogram augmentation technique to generate additional training data samples by applying random time-frequency masks to log-mel spectrograms to mitigate overfitting and improve the generalization of emotion recognition models. We evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach on the interactive emotional dyadic motion capture (IEMOCAP) dataset. Experimental results indicate that the transfer learning and spectrogram augmentation approaches improve the SER performance, and when combined achieve state-of-the-art results."
"Dyn-ASR: Compact, Multilingual Speech Recognition via Spoken Language and Accent Identification","Running automatic speech recognition (ASR) on edge devices is non-trivial due to resource constraints, especially in scenarios that require supporting multiple languages. We propose a new approach to enable multilingual speech recognition on edge devices. This approach uses both language identification and accent identification to select one of multiple monolingual ASR models on-the-fly, each fine-tuned for a particular accent. Initial results for both recognition performance and resource usage are promising with our approach using less than 1/12th of the memory consumed by other solutions."
Amortized Neural Networks for Low-Latency Speech Recognition,"We introduce Amortized Neural Networks (AmNets), a compute cost- and latency-aware network architecture particularly well-suited for sequence modeling tasks. We apply AmNets to the Recurrent Neural Network Transducer (RNN-T) to reduce compute cost and latency for an automatic speech recognition (ASR) task. The AmNets RNN-T architecture enables the network to dynamically switch between encoder branches on a frame-by-frame basis. Branches are constructed with variable levels of compute cost and model capacity. Here, we achieve variable compute for two well-known candidate techniques: one using sparse pruning and the other using matrix factorization. Frame-by-frame switching is determined by an arbitrator network that requires negligible compute overhead. We present results using both architectures on LibriSpeech data and show that our proposed architecture can reduce inference cost by up to 45\% and latency to nearly real-time without incurring a loss in accuracy."
"A Study of Multilingual End-to-End Speech Recognition for Kazakh, Russian, and English","We study training a single end-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) model for three languages used in Kazakhstan: Kazakh, Russian, and English. We first describe the development of multilingual E2E ASR based on Transformer networks and then perform an extensive assessment on the aforementioned languages. We also compare two variants of output grapheme set construction: combined and independent. Furthermore, we evaluate the impact of LMs and data augmentation techniques on the recognition performance of the multilingual E2E ASR. In addition, we present several datasets for training and evaluation purposes. Experiment results show that the multilingual models achieve comparable performances to the monolingual baselines with a similar number of parameters. Our best monolingual and multilingual models achieved 20.9% and 20.5% average word error rates on the combined test set, respectively. To ensure the reproducibility of our experiments and results, we share our training recipes, datasets, and pre-trained models."
The Role of Phonetic Units in Speech Emotion Recognition,"We propose a method for emotion recognition through emotiondependent speech recognition using Wav2vec 2.0. Our method achieved a significant improvement over most previously reported results on IEMOCAP, a benchmark emotion dataset. Different types of phonetic units are employed and compared in terms of accuracy and robustness of emotion recognition within and across datasets and languages. Models of phonemes, broad phonetic classes, and syllables all significantly outperform the utterance model, demonstrating that phonetic units are helpful and should be incorporated in speech emotion recognition. The best performance is from using broad phonetic classes. Further research is needed to investigate the optimal set of broad phonetic classes for the task of emotion recognition. Finally, we found that Wav2vec 2.0 can be fine-tuned to recognize coarser-grained or larger phonetic units than phonemes, such as broad phonetic classes and syllables."
Automatic recognition of suprasegmentals in speech,"This study reports our efforts to improve automatic recognition of suprasegmentals by fine-tuning wav2vec 2.0 with CTC, a method that has been successful in automatic speech recognition. We demonstrate that the method can improve the state-of-the-art on automatic recognition of syllables, tones, and pitch accents. Utilizing segmental information, by employing tonal finals or tonal syllables as recognition units, can significantly improve Mandarin tone recognition. Language models are helpful when tonal syllables are used as recognition units, but not helpful when tones are recognition units. Finally, Mandarin tone recognition can benefit from English phoneme recognition by combining the two tasks in fine-tuning wav2vec 2.0."
Adversarial Data Augmentation for Disordered Speech Recognition,"Automatic recognition of disordered speech remains a highly challenging task to date. The underlying neuro-motor conditions, often compounded with co-occurring physical disabilities, lead to the difficulty in collecting large quantities of impaired speech required for ASR system development. To this end, data augmentation techniques play a vital role in current disordered speech recognition systems. In contrast to existing data augmentation techniques only modifying the speaking rate or overall shape of spectral contour, fine-grained spectro-temporal differences between disordered and normal speech are modelled using deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGAN) during data augmentation to modify normal speech spectra into those closer to disordered speech. Experiments conducted on the UASpeech corpus suggest the proposed adversarial data augmentation approach consistently outperformed the baseline augmentation methods using tempo or speed perturbation on a state-of-the-art hybrid DNN system. An overall word error rate (WER) reduction up to 3.05\% (9.7\% relative) was obtained over the baseline system using no data augmentation. The final learning hidden unit contribution (LHUC) speaker adapted system using the best adversarial augmentation approach gives an overall WER of 25.89% on the UASpeech test set of 16 dysarthric speakers."
The History of Speech Recognition to the Year 2030,"The decade from 2010 to 2020 saw remarkable improvements in automatic speech recognition. Many people now use speech recognition on a daily basis, for example to perform voice search queries, send text messages, and interact with voice assistants like Amazon Alexa and Siri by Apple. Before 2010 most people rarely used speech recognition. Given the remarkable changes in the state of speech recognition over the previous decade, what can we expect over the coming decade? I attempt to forecast the state of speech recognition research and applications by the year 2030. While the changes to general speech recognition accuracy will not be as dramatic as in the previous decade, I suggest we have an exciting decade of progress in speech technology ahead of us."
USC: An Open-Source Uzbek Speech Corpus and Initial Speech Recognition Experiments,"We present a freely available speech corpus for the Uzbek language and report preliminary automatic speech recognition (ASR) results using both the deep neural network hidden Markov model (DNN-HMM) and end-to-end (E2E) architectures. The Uzbek speech corpus (USC) comprises 958 different speakers with a total of 105 hours of transcribed audio recordings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first open-source Uzbek speech corpus dedicated to the ASR task. To ensure high quality, the USC has been manually checked by native speakers. We first describe the design and development procedures of the USC, and then explain the conducted ASR experiments in detail. The experimental results demonstrate promising results for the applicability of the USC for ASR. Specifically, 18.1% and 17.4% word error rates were achieved on the validation and test sets, respectively. To enable experiment reproducibility, we share the USC dataset, pre-trained models, and training recipes in our GitHub repository."
Improving Word Recognition in Speech Transcriptions by Decision-level Fusion of Stemming and Two-way Phoneme Pruning,"We introduce an unsupervised approach for correcting highly imperfect speech transcriptions based on a decision-level fusion of stemming and two-way phoneme pruning. Transcripts are acquired from videos by extracting audio using Ffmpeg framework and further converting audio to text transcript using Google API. In the benchmark LRW dataset, there are 500 word categories, and 50 videos per class in mp4 format. All videos consist of 29 frames (each 1.16 s long) and the word appears in the middle of the video. In our approach we tried to improve the baseline accuracy from 9.34% by using stemming, phoneme extraction, filtering and pruning. After applying the stemming algorithm to the text transcript and evaluating the results, we achieved 23.34% accuracy in word recognition. To convert words to phonemes we used the Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) pronouncing dictionary that provides a phonetic mapping of English words to their pronunciations. A two-way phoneme pruning is proposed that comprises of the two non-sequential steps: 1) filtering and pruning the phonemes containing vowels and plosives 2) filtering and pruning the phonemes containing vowels and fricatives. After obtaining results of stemming and two-way phoneme pruning, we applied decision-level fusion and that led to an improvement of word recognition rate upto 32.96%."
Differentiable Allophone Graphs for Language-Universal Speech Recognition,"Building language-universal speech recognition systems entails producing phonological units of spoken sound that can be shared across languages. While speech annotations at the language-specific phoneme or surface levels are readily available, annotations at a universal phone level are relatively rare and difficult to produce. In this work, we present a general framework to derive phone-level supervision from only phonemic transcriptions and phone-to-phoneme mappings with learnable weights represented using weighted finite-state transducers, which we call differentiable allophone graphs. By training multilingually, we build a universal phone-based speech recognition model with interpretable probabilistic phone-to-phoneme mappings for each language. These phone-based systems with learned allophone graphs can be used by linguists to document new languages, build phone-based lexicons that capture rich pronunciation variations, and re-evaluate the allophone mappings of seen language. We demonstrate the aforementioned benefits of our proposed framework with a system trained on 7 diverse languages."
Brazilian Portuguese Speech Recognition Using Wav2vec 2.0,"Deep learning techniques have been shown to be efficient in various tasks, especially in the development of speech recognition systems, that is, systems that aim to transcribe an audio sentence in a sequence of written words. Despite the progress in the area, speech recognition can still be considered difficult, especially for languages lacking available data, such as Brazilian Portuguese (BP). In this sense, this work presents the development of an public Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system using only open available audio data, from the fine-tuning of the Wav2vec 2.0 XLSR-53 model pre-trained in many languages, over BP data. The final model presents an average word error rate of 12.4% over 7 different datasets (10.5% when applying a language model). According to our knowledge, the obtained error is the lowest among open end-to-end (E2E) ASR models for BP."
Using Deep Learning Techniques and Inferential Speech Statistics for AI Synthesised Speech Recognition,"The recent developments in technology have re-warded us with amazing audio synthesis models like TACOTRON and WAVENETS. On the other side, it poses greater threats such as speech clones and deep fakes, that may go undetected. To tackle these alarming situations, there is an urgent need to propose models that can help discriminate a synthesized speech from an actual human speech and also identify the source of such a synthesis. Here, we propose a model based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network (BiRNN) that helps to achieve both the aforementioned objectives. The temporal dependencies present in AI synthesized speech are exploited using Bidirectional RNN and CNN. The model outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches by classifying the AI synthesized audio from real human speech with an error rate of 1.9% and detecting the underlying architecture with an accuracy of 97%."
Semantic Communications for Speech Recognition,"The traditional communications transmit all the source date represented by bits, regardless of the content of source and the semantic information required by the receiver. However, in some applications, the receiver only needs part of the source data that represents critical semantic information, which prompts to transmit the application-related information, especially when bandwidth resources are limited. In this paper, we consider a semantic communication system for speech recognition by designing the transceiver as an end-to-end (E2E) system. Particularly, a deep learning (DL)-enabled semantic communication system, named DeepSC-SR, is developed to learn and extract text-related semantic features at the transmitter, which motivates the system to transmit much less than the source speech data without performance degradation. Moreover, in order to facilitate the proposed DeepSC-SR for dynamic channel environments, we investigate a robust model to cope with various channel environments without requiring retraining. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed DeepSC-SR outperforms the traditional communication systems in terms of the speech recognition metrics, such as character-error-rate and word-error-rate, and is more robust to channel variations, especially in the low signal-to-noise (SNR) regime."
CarneliNet: Neural Mixture Model for Automatic Speech Recognition,"End-to-end automatic speech recognition systems have achieved great accuracy by using deeper and deeper models. However, the increased depth comes with a larger receptive field that can negatively impact model performance in streaming scenarios. We propose an alternative approach that we call Neural Mixture Model. The basic idea is to introduce a parallel mixture of shallow networks instead of a very deep network. To validate this idea we design CarneliNet -- a CTC-based neural network composed of three mega-blocks. Each mega-block consists of multiple parallel shallow sub-networks based on 1D depthwise-separable convolutions. We evaluate the model on LibriSpeech, MLS and AISHELL-2 datasets and achieved close to state-of-the-art results for CTC-based models. Finally, we demonstrate that one can dynamically reconfigure the number of parallel sub-networks to accommodate the computational requirements without retraining."
A baseline model for computationally inexpensive speech recognition for Kazakh using the Coqui STT framework,"Mobile devices are transforming the way people interact with computers, and speech interfaces to applications are ever more important. Automatic Speech Recognition systems recently published are very accurate, but often require powerful machinery (specialised Graphical Processing Units) for inference, which makes them impractical to run on commodity devices, especially in streaming mode. Impressed by the accuracy of, but dissatisfied with the inference times of the baseline Kazakh ASR model of (Khassanov et al.,2021) when not using a GPU, we trained a new baseline acoustic model (on the same dataset as the aforementioned paper) and three language models for use with the Coqui STT framework. Results look promising, but further epochs of training and parameter sweeping or, alternatively, limiting the vocabulary that the ASR system must support, is needed to reach a production-level accuracy."
Conformer-based End-to-end Speech Recognition With Rotary Position Embedding,"Transformer-based end-to-end speech recognition models have received considerable attention in recent years due to their high training speed and ability to model a long-range global context. Position embedding in the transformer architecture is indispensable because it provides supervision for dependency modeling between elements at different positions in the input sequence. To make use of the time order of the input sequence, many works inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the element into the input sequence. In this work, we investigate various position embedding methods in the convolution-augmented transformer (conformer) and adopt a novel implementation named rotary position embedding (RoPE). RoPE encodes absolute positional information into the input sequence by a rotation matrix, and then naturally incorporates explicit relative position information into a self-attention module. To evaluate the effectiveness of the RoPE method, we conducted experiments on AISHELL-1 and LibriSpeech corpora. Results show that the conformer enhanced with RoPE achieves superior performance in the speech recognition task. Specifically, our model achieves a relative word error rate reduction of 8.70% and 7.27% over the conformer on test-clean and test-other sets of the LibriSpeech corpus respectively."
End-to-End Rich Transcription-Style Automatic Speech Recognition with Semi-Supervised Learning,"We propose a semi-supervised learning method for building end-to-end rich transcription-style automatic speech recognition (RT-ASR) systems from small-scale rich transcription-style and large-scale common transcription-style datasets. In spontaneous speech tasks, various speech phenomena such as fillers, word fragments, laughter and coughs, etc. are often included. While common transcriptions do not give special awareness to these phenomena, rich transcriptions explicitly convert them into special phenomenon tokens as well as textual tokens. In previous studies, the textual and phenomenon tokens were simultaneously estimated in an end-to-end manner. However, it is difficult to build accurate RT-ASR systems because large-scale rich transcription-style datasets are often unavailable. To solve this problem, our training method uses a limited rich transcription-style dataset and common transcription-style dataset simultaneously. The Key process in our semi-supervised learning is to convert the common transcription-style dataset into a pseudo-rich transcription-style dataset. To this end, we introduce style tokens which control phenomenon tokens are generated or not into transformer-based autoregressive modeling. We use this modeling for generating the pseudo-rich transcription-style datasets and for building RT-ASR system from the pseudo and original datasets. Our experiments on spontaneous ASR tasks showed the effectiveness of the proposed method."
Multilingual and crosslingual speech recognition using phonological-vector based phone embeddings,"The use of phonological features (PFs) potentially allows language-specific phones to remain linked in training, which is highly desirable for information sharing for multilingual and crosslingual speech recognition methods for low-resourced languages. A drawback suffered by previous methods in using phonological features is that the acoustic-to-PF extraction in a bottom-up way is itself difficult. In this paper, we propose to join phonology driven phone embedding (top-down) and deep neural network (DNN) based acoustic feature extraction (bottom-up) to calculate phone probabilities. The new method is called JoinAP (Joining of Acoustics and Phonology). Remarkably, no inversion from acoustics to phonological features is required for speech recognition. For each phone in the IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) table, we encode its phonological features to a phonological-vector, and then apply linear or nonlinear transformation of the phonological-vector to obtain the phone embedding. A series of multilingual and crosslingual (both zero-shot and few-shot) speech recognition experiments are conducted on the CommonVoice dataset (German, French, Spanish and Italian) and the AISHLL-1 dataset (Mandarin), and demonstrate the superiority of JoinAP with nonlinear phone embeddings over both JoinAP with linear phone embeddings and the traditional method with flat phone embeddings."
Improving Speech Recognition Accuracy of Local POI Using Geographical Models,"Nowadays voice search for points of interest (POI) is becoming increasingly popular. However, speech recognition for local POI has remained to be a challenge due to multi-dialect and massive POI. This paper improves speech recognition accuracy for local POI from two aspects. Firstly, a geographic acoustic model (Geo-AM) is proposed. The Geo-AM deals with multi-dialect problem using dialect-specific input feature and dialect-specific top layer. Secondly, a group of geo-specific language models (Geo-LMs) are integrated into our speech recognition system to improve recognition accuracy of long tail and homophone POI. During decoding, specific language models are selected on demand according to users' geographic location. Experiments show that the proposed Geo-AM achieves 6.5%\sim10.1% relative character error rate (CER) reduction on an accent testset and the proposed Geo-AM and Geo-LM totally achieve over 18.7% relative CER reduction on Tencent Map task."
Advancing CTC-CRF Based End-to-End Speech Recognition with Wordpieces and Conformers,"Automatic speech recognition systems have been largely improved in the past few decades and current systems are mainly hybrid-based and end-to-end-based. The recently proposed CTC-CRF framework inherits the data-efficiency of the hybrid approach and the simplicity of the end-to-end approach. In this paper, we further advance CTC-CRF based ASR technique with explorations on modeling units and neural architectures. Specifically, we investigate techniques to enable the recently developed wordpiece modeling units and Conformer neural networks to be succesfully applied in CTC-CRFs. Experiments are conducted on two English datasets (Switchboard, Librispeech) and a German dataset from CommonVoice. Experimental results suggest that (i) Conformer can improve the recognition performance significantly; (ii) Wordpiece-based systems perform slightly worse compared with phone-based systems for the target language with a low degree of grapheme-phoneme correspondence (e.g. English), while the two systems can perform equally strong when such degree of correspondence is high for the target language (e.g. German)."
Instant One-Shot Word-Learning for Context-Specific Neural Sequence-to-Sequence Speech Recognition,"Neural sequence-to-sequence systems deliver state-of-the-art performance for automatic speech recognition (ASR). When using appropriate modeling units, e.g., byte-pair encoded characters, these systems are in principal open vocabulary systems. In practice, however, they often fail to recognize words not seen during training, e.g., named entities, numbers or technical terms. To alleviate this problem we supplement an end-to-end ASR system with a word/phrase memory and a mechanism to access this memory to recognize the words and phrases correctly. After the training of the ASR system, and when it has already been deployed, a relevant word can be added or subtracted instantly without the need for further training. In this paper we demonstrate that through this mechanism our system is able to recognize more than 85% of newly added words that it previously failed to recognize compared to a strong baseline."
Arabic Code-Switching Speech Recognition using Monolingual Data,"Code-switching in automatic speech recognition (ASR) is an important challenge due to globalization. Recent research in multilingual ASR shows potential improvement over monolingual systems. We study key issues related to multilingual modeling for ASR through a series of large-scale ASR experiments. Our innovative framework deploys a multi-graph approach in the weighted finite state transducers (WFST) framework. We compare our WFST decoding strategies with a transformer sequence to sequence system trained on the same data. Given a code-switching scenario between Arabic and English languages, our results show that the WFST decoding approaches were more suitable for the intersentential code-switching datasets. In addition, the transformer system performed better for intrasentential code-switching task. With this study, we release an artificially generated development and test sets, along with ecological code-switching test set, to benchmark the ASR performance."
Cross-Modal Transformer-Based Neural Correction Models for Automatic Speech Recognition,"We propose a cross-modal transformer-based neural correction models that refines the output of an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system so as to exclude ASR errors. Generally, neural correction models are composed of encoder-decoder networks, which can directly model sequence-to-sequence mapping problems. The most successful method is to use both input speech and its ASR output text as the input contexts for the encoder-decoder networks. However, the conventional method cannot take into account the relationships between these two different modal inputs because the input contexts are separately encoded for each modal. To effectively leverage the correlated information between the two different modal inputs, our proposed models encode two different contexts jointly on the basis of cross-modal self-attention using a transformer. We expect that cross-modal self-attention can effectively capture the relationships between two different modals for refining ASR hypotheses. We also introduce a shallow fusion technique to efficiently integrate the first-pass ASR model and our proposed neural correction model. Experiments on Japanese natural language ASR tasks demonstrated that our proposed models achieve better ASR performance than conventional neural correction models."
Unified Autoregressive Modeling for Joint End-to-End Multi-Talker Overlapped Speech Recognition and Speaker Attribute Estimation,"In this paper, we present a novel modeling method for single-channel multi-talker overlapped automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Fully neural network based end-to-end models have dramatically improved the performance of multi-taker overlapped ASR tasks. One promising approach for end-to-end modeling is autoregressive modeling with serialized output training in which transcriptions of multiple speakers are recursively generated one after another. This enables us to naturally capture relationships between speakers. However, the conventional modeling method cannot explicitly take into account the speaker attributes of individual utterances such as gender and age information. In fact, the performance deteriorates when each speaker is the same gender or is close in age. To address this problem, we propose unified autoregressive modeling for joint end-to-end multi-talker overlapped ASR and speaker attribute estimation. Our key idea is to handle gender and age estimation tasks within the unified autoregressive modeling. In the proposed method, transformer-based autoregressive model recursively generates not only textual tokens but also attribute tokens of each speaker. This enables us to effectively utilize speaker attributes for improving multi-talker overlapped ASR. Experiments on Japanese multi-talker overlapped ASR tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."
Relaxed Attention: A Simple Method to Boost Performance of End-to-End Automatic Speech Recognition,"Recently, attention-based encoder-decoder (AED) models have shown high performance for end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) across several tasks. Addressing overconfidence in such models, in this paper we introduce the concept of relaxed attention, which is a simple gradual injection of a uniform distribution to the encoder-decoder attention weights during training that is easily implemented with two lines of code. We investigate the effect of relaxed attention across different AED model architectures and two prominent ASR tasks, Wall Street Journal (WSJ) and Librispeech. We found that transformers trained with relaxed attention outperform the standard baseline models consistently during decoding with external language models. On WSJ, we set a new benchmark for transformer-based end-to-end speech recognition with a word error rate of 3.65%, outperforming state of the art (4.20%) by 13.1% relative, while introducing only a single hyperparameter."
Dual Causal/Non-Causal Self-Attention for Streaming End-to-End Speech Recognition,"Attention-based end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have recently demonstrated state-of-the-art results for numerous tasks. However, the application of self-attention and attention-based encoder-decoder models remains challenging for streaming ASR, where each word must be recognized shortly after it was spoken. In this work, we present the dual causal/non-causal self-attention (DCN) architecture, which in contrast to restricted self-attention prevents the overall context to grow beyond the look-ahead of a single layer when used in a deep architecture. DCN is compared to chunk-based and restricted self-attention using streaming transformer and conformer architectures, showing improved ASR performance over restricted self-attention and competitive ASR results compared to chunk-based self-attention, while providing the advantage of frame-synchronous processing. Combined with triggered attention, the proposed streaming end-to-end ASR systems obtained state-of-the-art results on the LibriSpeech, HKUST, and Switchboard ASR tasks."
Supervised Contrastive Learning for Accented Speech Recognition,"Neural network based speech recognition systems suffer from performance degradation due to accented speech, especially unfamiliar accents. In this paper, we study the supervised contrastive learning framework for accented speech recognition. To build different views (similar ""positive"" data samples) for contrastive learning, three data augmentation techniques including noise injection, spectrogram augmentation and TTS-same-sentence generation are further investigated. From the experiments on the Common Voice dataset, we have shown that contrastive learning helps to build data-augmentation invariant and pronunciation invariant representations, which significantly outperforms traditional joint training methods in both zero-shot and full-shot settings. Experiments show that contrastive learning can improve accuracy by 3.66% (zero-shot) and 3.78% (full-shot) on average, comparing to the joint training method."
Interactive decoding of words from visual speech recognition models,"This work describes an interactive decoding method to improve the performance of visual speech recognition systems using user input to compensate for the inherent ambiguity of the task. Unlike most phoneme-to-word decoding pipelines, which produce phonemes and feed these through a finite state transducer, our method instead expands words in lockstep, facilitating the insertion of interaction points at each word position. Interaction points enable us to solicit input during decoding, allowing users to interactively direct the decoding process. We simulate the behavior of user input using an oracle to give an automated evaluation, and show promise for the use of this method for text input."
"Alzheimer's Dementia Recognition Using Acoustic, Lexical, Disfluency and Speech Pause Features Robust to Noisy Inputs","We present two multimodal fusion-based deep learning models that consume ASR transcribed speech and acoustic data simultaneously to classify whether a speaker in a structured diagnostic task has Alzheimer's Disease and to what degree, evaluating the ADReSSo challenge 2021 data. Our best model, a BiLSTM with highway layers using words, word probabilities, disfluency features, pause information, and a variety of acoustic features, achieves an accuracy of 84% and RSME error prediction of 4.26 on MMSE cognitive scores. While predicting cognitive decline is more challenging, our models show improvement using the multimodal approach and word probabilities, disfluency and pause information over word-only models. We show considerable gains for AD classification using multimodal fusion and gating, which can effectively deal with noisy inputs from acoustic features and ASR hypotheses."
Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation Method for Automatic Cued Speech Recognition,"Cued Speech (CS) is a visual communication system for the deaf or hearing impaired people. It combines lip movements with hand cues to obtain a complete phonetic repertoire. Current deep learning based methods on automatic CS recognition suffer from a common problem, which is the data scarcity. Until now, there are only two public single speaker datasets for French (238 sentences) and British English (97 sentences). In this work, we propose a cross-modal knowledge distillation method with teacher-student structure, which transfers audio speech information to CS to overcome the limited data problem. Firstly, we pretrain a teacher model for CS recognition with a large amount of open source audio speech data, and simultaneously pretrain the feature extractors for lips and hands using CS data. Then, we distill the knowledge from teacher model to the student model with frame-level and sequence-level distillation strategies. Importantly, for frame-level, we exploit multi-task learning to weigh losses automatically, to obtain the balance coefficient. Besides, we establish a five-speaker British English CS dataset for the first time. The proposed method is evaluated on French and British English CS datasets, showing superior CS recognition performance to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) by a large margin."
Key-Sparse Transformer for Multimodal Speech Emotion Recognition,"Speech emotion recognition is a challenging research topic that plays a critical role in human-computer interaction. Multimodal inputs further improve the performance as more emotional information is used. However, existing studies learn all the information in the sample while only a small portion of it is about emotion. The redundant information will become noises and limit the system performance. In this paper, a key-sparse Transformer is proposed for efficient emotion recognition by focusing more on emotion related information. The proposed method is evaluated on the IEMOCAP and LSSED. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art approaches."
On-Device Personalization of Automatic Speech Recognition Models for Disordered Speech,"While current state-of-the-art Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems achieve high accuracy on typical speech, they suffer from significant performance degradation on disordered speech and other atypical speech patterns. Personalization of ASR models, a commonly applied solution to this problem, is usually performed in a server-based training environment posing problems around data privacy, delayed model-update times, and communication cost for copying data and models between mobile device and server infrastructure. In this paper, we present an approach to on-device based ASR personalization with very small amounts of speaker-specific data. We test our approach on a diverse set of 100 speakers with disordered speech and find median relative word error rate improvement of 71% with only 50 short utterances required per speaker. When tested on a voice-controlled home automation platform, on-device personalized models show a median task success rate of 81%, compared to only 40% of the unadapted models."
An Improved Single Step Non-autoregressive Transformer for Automatic Speech Recognition,"Non-autoregressive mechanisms can significantly decrease inference time for speech transformers, especially when the single step variant is applied. Previous work on CTC alignment-based single step non-autoregressive transformer (CASS-NAT) has shown a large real time factor (RTF) improvement over autoregressive transformers (AT). In this work, we propose several methods to improve the accuracy of the end-to-end CASS-NAT, followed by performance analyses. First, convolution augmented self-attention blocks are applied to both the encoder and decoder modules. Second, we propose to expand the trigger mask (acoustic boundary) for each token to increase the robustness of CTC alignments. In addition, iterated loss functions are used to enhance the gradient update of low-layer parameters. Without using an external language model, the WERs of the improved CASS-NAT, when using the three methods, are 3.1%/7.2% on Librispeech test clean/other sets and the CER is 5.4% on the Aishell1 test set, achieving a 7%~21% relative WER/CER improvement. For the analyses, we plot attention weight distributions in the decoders to visualize the relationships between token-level acoustic embeddings. When the acoustic embeddings are visualized, we find that they have a similar behavior to word embeddings, which explains why the improved CASS-NAT performs similarly to AT."
"Multi-modal fusion with gating using audio, lexical and disfluency features for Alzheimer's Dementia recognition from spontaneous speech","This paper is a submission to the Alzheimer's Dementia Recognition through Spontaneous Speech (ADReSS) challenge, which aims to develop methods that can assist in the automated prediction of severity of Alzheimer's Disease from speech data. We focus on acoustic and natural language features for cognitive impairment detection in spontaneous speech in the context of Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis and the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score prediction. We proposed a model that obtains unimodal decisions from different LSTMs, one for each modality of text and audio, and then combines them using a gating mechanism for the final prediction. We focused on sequential modelling of text and audio and investigated whether the disfluencies present in individuals' speech relate to the extent of their cognitive impairment. Our results show that the proposed classification and regression schemes obtain very promising results on both development and test sets. This suggests Alzheimer's Disease can be detected successfully with sequence modeling of the speech data of medical sessions."
Collaborative Training of Acoustic Encoders for Speech Recognition,"On-device speech recognition requires training models of different sizes for deploying on devices with various computational budgets. When building such different models, we can benefit from training them jointly to take advantage of the knowledge shared between them. Joint training is also efficient since it reduces the redundancy in the training procedure's data handling operations. We propose a method for collaboratively training acoustic encoders of different sizes for speech recognition. We use a sequence transducer setup where different acoustic encoders share a common predictor and joiner modules. The acoustic encoders are also trained using co-distillation through an auxiliary task for frame level chenone prediction, along with the transducer loss. We perform experiments using the LibriSpeech corpus and demonstrate that the collaboratively trained acoustic encoders can provide up to a 11% relative improvement in the word error rate on both the test partitions."
Momentum Pseudo-Labeling for Semi-Supervised Speech Recognition,"Pseudo-labeling (PL) has been shown to be effective in semi-supervised automatic speech recognition (ASR), where a base model is self-trained with pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled data. While PL can be further improved by iteratively updating pseudo-labels as the model evolves, most of the previous approaches involve inefficient retraining of the model or intricate control of the label update. We present momentum pseudo-labeling (MPL), a simple yet effective strategy for semi-supervised ASR. MPL consists of a pair of online and offline models that interact and learn from each other, inspired by the mean teacher method. The online model is trained to predict pseudo-labels generated on the fly by the offline model. The offline model maintains a momentum-based moving average of the online model. MPL is performed in a single training process and the interaction between the two models effectively helps them reinforce each other to improve the ASR performance. We apply MPL to an end-to-end ASR model based on the connectionist temporal classification. The experimental results demonstrate that MPL effectively improves over the base model and is scalable to different semi-supervised scenarios with varying amounts of data or domain mismatch."
Silent Speech and Emotion Recognition from Vocal Tract Shape Dynamics in Real-Time MRI,"Speech sounds of spoken language are obtained by varying configuration of the articulators surrounding the vocal tract. They contain abundant information that can be utilized to better understand the underlying mechanism of human speech production. We propose a novel deep neural network-based learning framework that understands acoustic information in the variable-length sequence of vocal tract shaping during speech production, captured by real-time magnetic resonance imaging (rtMRI), and translate it into text. The proposed framework comprises of spatiotemporal convolutions, a recurrent network, and the connectionist temporal classification loss, trained entirely end-to-end. On the USC-TIMIT corpus, the model achieved a 40.6% PER at sentence-level, much better compared to the existing models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that demonstrates the recognition of entire spoken sentence based on an individual's articulatory motions captured by rtMRI video. We also performed an analysis of variations in the geometry of articulation in each sub-regions of the vocal tract (i.e., pharyngeal, velar and dorsal, hard palate, labial constriction region) with respect to different emotions and genders. Results suggest that each sub-regions distortion is affected by both emotion and gender."
Dialectal Speech Recognition and Translation of Swiss German Speech to Standard German Text: Microsoft's Submission to SwissText 2021,"This paper describes the winning approach in the Shared Task 3 at SwissText 2021 on Swiss German Speech to Standard German Text, a public competition on dialect recognition and translation. Swiss German refers to the multitude of Alemannic dialects spoken in the German-speaking parts of Switzerland. Swiss German differs significantly from standard German in pronunciation, word inventory and grammar. It is mostly incomprehensible to native German speakers. Moreover, it lacks a standardized written script. To solve the challenging task, we propose a hybrid automatic speech recognition system with a lexicon that incorporates translations, a 1st pass language model that deals with Swiss German particularities, a transfer-learned acoustic model and a strong neural language model for 2nd pass rescoring. Our submission reaches 46.04% BLEU on a blind conversational test set and outperforms the second best competitor by a 12% relative margin."
Multi-channel Opus compression for far-field automatic speech recognition with a fixed bitrate budget,"Automatic speech recognition (ASR) in the cloud allows the use of larger models and more powerful multi-channel signal processing front-ends compared to on-device processing. However, it also adds an inherent latency due to the transmission of the audio signal, especially when transmitting multiple channels of a microphone array. One way to reduce the network bandwidth requirements is client-side compression with a lossy codec such as Opus. However, this compression can have a detrimental effect especially on multi-channel ASR front-ends, due to the distortion and loss of spatial information introduced by the codec. In this publication, we propose an improved approach for the compression of microphone array signals based on Opus, using a modified joint channel coding approach and additionally introducing a multi-channel spatial decorrelating transform to reduce redundancy in the transmission. We illustrate the effect of the proposed approach on the spatial information retained in multi-channel signals after compression, and evaluate the performance on far-field ASR with a multi-channel beamforming front-end. We demonstrate that our approach can lead to a 37.5 % bitrate reduction or a 5.1 % relative word error rate reduction for a fixed bitrate budget in a seven channel setup."
SynthASR: Unlocking Synthetic Data for Speech Recognition,"End-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) models have recently demonstrated superior performance over the traditional hybrid ASR models. Training an E2E ASR model requires a large amount of data which is not only expensive but may also raise dependency on production data. At the same time, synthetic speech generated by the state-of-the-art text-to-speech (TTS) engines has advanced to near-human naturalness. In this work, we propose to utilize synthetic speech for ASR training (SynthASR) in applications where data is sparse or hard to get for ASR model training. In addition, we apply continual learning with a novel multi-stage training strategy to address catastrophic forgetting, achieved by a mix of weighted multi-style training, data augmentation, encoder freezing, and parameter regularization. In our experiments conducted on in-house datasets for a new application of recognizing medication names, training ASR RNN-T models with synthetic audio via the proposed multi-stage training improved the recognition performance on new application by more than 65% relative, without degradation on existing general applications. Our observations show that SynthASR holds great promise in training the state-of-the-art large-scale E2E ASR models for new applications while reducing the costs and dependency on production data."
Kaizen: Continuously improving teacher using Exponential Moving Average for semi-supervised speech recognition,"In this paper, we introduce the Kaizen framework that uses a continuously improving teacher to generate pseudo-labels for semi-supervised speech recognition (ASR). The proposed approach uses a teacher model which is updated as the exponential moving average (EMA) of the student model parameters. We demonstrate that it is critical for EMA to be accumulated with full-precision floating point. The Kaizen framework can be seen as a continuous version of the iterative pseudo-labeling approach for semi-supervised training. It is applicable for different training criteria, and in this paper we demonstrate its effectiveness for frame-level hybrid hidden Markov model-deep neural network (HMM-DNN) systems as well as sequence-level Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) based models.  For large scale real-world unsupervised public videos in UK English and Italian languages the proposed approach i) shows more than 10% relative word error rate (WER) reduction over standard teacher-student training; ii) using just 10 hours of supervised data and a large amount of unsupervised data closes the gap to the upper-bound supervised ASR system that uses 650h or 2700h respectively."
CoDERT: Distilling Encoder Representations with Co-learning for Transducer-based Speech Recognition,"We propose a simple yet effective method to compress an RNN-Transducer (RNN-T) through the well-known knowledge distillation paradigm. We show that the transducer's encoder outputs naturally have a high entropy and contain rich information about acoustically similar word-piece confusions. This rich information is suppressed when combined with the lower entropy decoder outputs to produce the joint network logits. Consequently, we introduce an auxiliary loss to distill the encoder logits from a teacher transducer's encoder, and explore training strategies where this encoder distillation works effectively. We find that tandem training of teacher and student encoders with an inplace encoder distillation outperforms the use of a pre-trained and static teacher transducer. We also report an interesting phenomenon we refer to as implicit distillation, that occurs when the teacher and student encoders share the same decoder. Our experiments show 5.37-8.4% relative word error rate reductions (WERR) on in-house test sets, and 5.05-6.18% relative WERRs on LibriSpeech test sets."
Using heterogeneity in semi-supervised transcription hypotheses to improve code-switched speech recognition,"Modeling code-switched speech is an important problem in automatic speech recognition (ASR). Labeled code-switched data are rare, so monolingual data are often used to model code-switched speech. These monolingual data may be more closely matched to one of the languages in the code-switch pair. We show that such asymmetry can bias prediction toward the better-matched language and degrade overall model performance. To address this issue, we propose a semi-supervised approach for code-switched ASR. We consider the case of English-Mandarin code-switching, and the problem of using monolingual data to build bilingual ""transcription models'' for annotation of unlabeled code-switched data. We first build multiple transcription models so that their individual predictions are variously biased toward either English or Mandarin. We then combine these biased transcriptions using confidence-based selection. This strategy generates a superior transcript for semi-supervised training, and obtains a 19% relative improvement compared to a semi-supervised system that relies on a transcription model built with only the best-matched monolingual data."
Cross-utterance Reranking Models with BERT and Graph Convolutional Networks for Conversational Speech Recognition,"How to effectively incorporate cross-utterance information cues into a neural language model (LM) has emerged as one of the intriguing issues for automatic speech recognition (ASR). Existing research efforts on improving contextualization of an LM typically regard previous utterances as a sequence of additional input and may fail to capture complex global structural dependencies among these utterances. In view of this, we in this paper seek to represent the historical context information of an utterance as graph-structured data so as to distill cross-utterances, global word interaction relationships. To this end, we apply a graph convolutional network (GCN) on the resulting graph to obtain the corresponding GCN embeddings of historical words. GCN has recently found its versatile applications on social-network analysis, text summarization, and among others due mainly to its ability of effectively capturing rich relational information among elements. However, GCN remains largely underexplored in the context of ASR, especially for dealing with conversational speech. In addition, we frame ASR N-best reranking as a prediction problem, leveraging bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) as the vehicle to not only seize the local intrinsic word regularity patterns inherent in a candidate hypothesis but also incorporate the cross-utterance, historical word interaction cues distilled by GCN for promoting performance. Extensive experiments conducted on the AMI benchmark dataset seem to confirm the pragmatic utility of our methods, in relation to some current top-of-the-line methods."
"PARP: Prune, Adjust and Re-Prune for Self-Supervised Speech Recognition","Self-supervised speech representation learning (speech SSL) has demonstrated the benefit of scale in learning rich representations for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) with limited paired data, such as wav2vec 2.0. We investigate the existence of sparse subnetworks in pre-trained speech SSL models that achieve even better low-resource ASR results. However, directly applying widely adopted pruning methods such as the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) is suboptimal in the computational cost needed. Moreover, we show that the discovered subnetworks yield minimal performance gain compared to the original dense network. We present Prune-Adjust-Re-Prune (PARP), which discovers and finetunes subnetworks for much better performance, while only requiring a single downstream ASR finetuning run. PARP is inspired by our surprising observation that subnetworks pruned for pre-training tasks need merely a slight adjustment to achieve a sizeable performance boost in downstream ASR tasks. Extensive experiments on low-resource ASR verify (1) sparse subnetworks exist in mono-lingual/multi-lingual pre-trained speech SSL, and (2) the computational advantage and performance gain of PARP over baseline pruning methods. In particular, on the 10min Librispeech split without LM decoding, PARP discovers subnetworks from wav2vec 2.0 with an absolute 10.9%/12.6% WER decrease compared to the full model. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of PARP via: cross-lingual pruning without any phone recognition degradation, the discovery of a multi-lingual subnetwork for 10 spoken languages in 1 finetuning run, and its applicability to pre-trained BERT/XLNet for natural language tasks."
Balanced End-to-End Monolingual pre-training for Low-Resourced Indic Languages Code-Switching Speech Recognition,"The success in designing Code-Switching (CS) ASR often depends on the availability of the transcribed CS resources. Such dependency harms the development of ASR in low-resourced languages such as Bengali and Hindi. In this paper, we exploit the transfer learning approach to design End-to-End (E2E) CS ASR systems for the two low-resourced language pairs using different monolingual speech data and a small set of noisy CS data. We trained the CS-ASR, following two steps: (i) building a robust bilingual ASR system using a convolution-augmented transformer (Conformer) based acoustic model and n-gram language model, and (ii) fine-tuned the entire E2E ASR with limited noisy CS data. We tested our method on MUCS 2021 challenge and achieved 3rd place in the CS track. We then tested the proposed method using noisy CS data released for Hindi-English and Bengali-English pairs in Multilingual and Code-Switching ASR Challenges for Low Resource Indian Languages (MUCS 2021) and achieved 3rd place in the CS track. Unlike, the leading two systems that benefited from crawling YouTube and learning transliteration pairs, our proposed transfer learning approach focused on using only the limited CS data with no data-cleaning or data re-segmentation. Our approach achieved 14.1% relative gain in word error rate (WER) in Hindi-English and 27.1% in Bengali-English. We provide detailed guidelines on the steps to finetune the self-attention based model for limited data for ASR. Moreover, we release the code and recipe used in this paper."
Automatic Speech Recognition in Sanskrit: A New Speech Corpus and Modelling Insights,"Automatic speech recognition (ASR) in Sanskrit is interesting, owing to the various linguistic peculiarities present in the language. The Sanskrit language is lexically productive, undergoes euphonic assimilation of phones at the word boundaries and exhibits variations in spelling conventions and in pronunciations. In this work, we propose the first large scale study of automatic speech recognition (ASR) in Sanskrit, with an emphasis on the impact of unit selection in Sanskrit ASR. In this work, we release a 78 hour ASR dataset for Sanskrit, which faithfully captures several of the linguistic characteristics expressed by the language. We investigate the role of different acoustic model and language model units in ASR systems for Sanskrit. We also propose a new modelling unit, inspired by the syllable level unit selection, that captures character sequences from one vowel in the word to the next vowel. We also highlight the importance of choosing graphemic representations for Sanskrit and show the impact of this choice on word error rates (WER). Finally, we extend these insights from Sanskrit ASR for building ASR systems in two other Indic languages, Gujarati and Telugu. For both these languages, our experimental results show that the use of phonetic based graphemic representations in ASR results in performance improvements as compared to ASR systems that use native scripts."
U2++: Unified Two-pass Bidirectional End-to-end Model for Speech Recognition,"The unified streaming and non-streaming two-pass (U2) end-to-end model for speech recognition has shown great performance in terms of streaming capability, accuracy, real-time factor (RTF), and latency. In this paper, we present U2++, an enhanced version of U2 to further improve the accuracy. The core idea of U2++ is to use the forward and the backward information of the labeling sequences at the same time at training to learn richer information, and combine the forward and backward prediction at decoding to give more accurate recognition results. We also proposed a new data augmentation method called SpecSub to help the U2++ model to be more accurate and robust. Our experiments show that, compared with U2, U2++ shows faster convergence at training, better robustness to the decoding method, as well as consistent 5\% - 8\% word error rate reduction gain over U2. On the experiment of AISHELL-1, we achieve a 4.63\% character error rate (CER) with a non-streaming setup and 5.05\% with a streaming setup with 320ms latency by U2++. To the best of our knowledge, 5.05\% is the best-published streaming result on the AISHELL-1 test set."
A Comparative Study on Neural Architectures and Training Methods for Japanese Speech Recognition,"End-to-end (E2E) modeling is advantageous for automatic speech recognition (ASR) especially for Japanese since word-based tokenization of Japanese is not trivial, and E2E modeling is able to model character sequences directly. This paper focuses on the latest E2E modeling techniques, and investigates their performances on character-based Japanese ASR by conducting comparative experiments. The results are analyzed and discussed in order to understand the relative advantages of long short-term memory (LSTM), and Conformer models in combination with connectionist temporal classification, transducer, and attention-based loss functions. Furthermore, the paper investigates on effectivity of the recent training techniques such as data augmentation (SpecAugment), variational noise injection, and exponential moving average. The best configuration found in the paper achieved the state-of-the-art character error rates of 4.1%, 3.2%, and 3.5% for Corpus of Spontaneous Japanese (CSJ) eval1, eval2, and eval3 tasks, respectively. The system is also shown to be computationally efficient thanks to the efficiency of Conformer transducers."
Unsupervised Automatic Speech Recognition: A Review,"Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems can be trained to achieve remarkable performance given large amounts of manually transcribed speech, but large labeled data sets can be difficult or expensive to acquire for all languages of interest. In this paper, we review the research literature to identify models and ideas that could lead to fully unsupervised ASR, including unsupervised segmentation of the speech signal, unsupervised mapping from speech segments to text, and semi-supervised models with nominal amounts of labeled examples. The objective of the study is to identify the limitations of what can be learned from speech data alone and to understand the minimum requirements for speech recognition. Identifying these limitations would help optimize the resources and efforts in ASR development for low-resource languages."
Raw Waveform Encoder with Multi-Scale Globally Attentive Locally Recurrent Networks for End-to-End Speech Recognition,"End-to-end speech recognition generally uses hand-engineered acoustic features as input and excludes the feature extraction module from its joint optimization. To extract learnable and adaptive features and mitigate information loss, we propose a new encoder that adopts globally attentive locally recurrent (GALR) networks and directly takes raw waveform as input. We observe improved ASR performance and robustness by applying GALR on different window lengths to aggregate fine-grain temporal information into multi-scale acoustic features. Experiments are conducted on a benchmark dataset AISHELL-2 and two large-scale Mandarin speech corpus of 5,000 hours and 21,000 hours. With faster speed and comparable model size, our proposed multi-scale GALR waveform encoder achieved consistent character error rate reductions (CERRs) from 7.9% to 28.1% relative over strong baselines, including Conformer and TDNN-Conformer. In particular, our approach demonstrated notable robustness than the traditional handcrafted features and outperformed the baseline MFCC-based TDNN-Conformer model by a 15.2% CERR on a music-mixed real-world speech test set."
Efficient Speech Emotion Recognition Using Multi-Scale CNN and Attention,"Emotion recognition from speech is a challenging task. Re-cent advances in deep learning have led bi-directional recur-rent neural network (Bi-RNN) and attention mechanism as astandard method for speech emotion recognition, extractingand attending multi-modal features - audio and text, and thenfusing them for downstream emotion classification tasks. Inthis paper, we propose a simple yet efficient neural networkarchitecture to exploit both acoustic and lexical informationfrom speech. The proposed framework using multi-scale con-volutional layers (MSCNN) to obtain both audio and text hid-den representations. Then, a statistical pooling unit (SPU)is used to further extract the features in each modality. Be-sides, an attention module can be built on top of the MSCNN-SPU (audio) and MSCNN (text) to further improve the perfor-mance. Extensive experiments show that the proposed modeloutperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on IEMOCAPdataset with four emotion categories (i.e., angry, happy, sadand neutral) in both weighted accuracy (WA) and unweightedaccuracy (UA), with an improvement of 5.0% and 5.2% respectively under the ASR setting."
Data Augmentation Methods for End-to-end Speech Recognition on Distant-Talk Scenarios,"Although end-to-end automatic speech recognition (E2E ASR) has achieved great performance in tasks that have numerous paired data, it is still challenging to make E2E ASR robust against noisy and low-resource conditions. In this study, we investigated data augmentation methods for E2E ASR in distant-talk scenarios. E2E ASR models are trained on the series of CHiME challenge datasets, which are suitable tasks for studying robustness against noisy and spontaneous speech. We propose to use three augmentation methods and thier combinations: 1) data augmentation using text-to-speech (TTS) data, 2) cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (Cycle-GAN) augmentation trained to map two different audio characteristics, the one of clean speech and of noisy recordings, to match the testing condition, and 3) pseudo-label augmentation provided by the pretrained ASR module for smoothing label distributions. Experimental results using the CHiME-6/CHiME-4 datasets show that each augmentation method individually improves the accuracy on top of the conventional SpecAugment; further improvements are obtained by combining these approaches. We achieved 4.3\% word error rate (WER) reduction, which was more significant than that of the SpecAugment, when we combine all three augmentations for the CHiME-6 task."
Minimum Word Error Rate Training with Language Model Fusion for End-to-End Speech Recognition,"Integrating external language models (LMs) into end-to-end (E2E) models remains a challenging task for domain-adaptive speech recognition. Recently, internal language model estimation (ILME)-based LM fusion has shown significant word error rate (WER) reduction from Shallow Fusion by subtracting a weighted internal LM score from an interpolation of E2E model and external LM scores during beam search. However, on different test sets, the optimal LM interpolation weights vary over a wide range and have to be tuned extensively on well-matched validation sets. In this work, we perform LM fusion in the minimum WER (MWER) training of an E2E model to obviate the need for LM weights tuning during inference. Besides MWER training with Shallow Fusion (MWER-SF), we propose a novel MWER training with ILME (MWER-ILME) where the ILME-based fusion is conducted to generate N-best hypotheses and their posteriors. Additional gradient is induced when internal LM is engaged in MWER-ILME loss computation. During inference, LM weights pre-determined in MWER training enable robust LM integrations on test sets from different domains. Experimented with 30K-hour trained transformer transducers, MWER-ILME achieves on average 8.8% and 5.8% relative WER reductions from MWER and MWER-SF training, respectively, on 6 different test sets"
Attention-based Contextual Language Model Adaptation for Speech Recognition,"Language modeling (LM) for automatic speech recognition (ASR) does not usually incorporate utterance level contextual information. For some domains like voice assistants, however, additional context, such as the time at which an utterance was spoken, provides a rich input signal. We introduce an attention mechanism for training neural speech recognition language models on both text and non-linguistic contextual data. When applied to a large de-identified dataset of utterances collected by a popular voice assistant platform, our method reduces perplexity by 7.0% relative over a standard LM that does not incorporate contextual information. When evaluated on utterances extracted from the long tail of the dataset, our method improves perplexity by 9.0% relative over a standard LM and by over 2.8% relative when compared to a state-of-the-art model for contextual LM."
Should We Always Separate?: Switching Between Enhanced and Observed Signals for Overlapping Speech Recognition,"Although recent advances in deep learning technology improved automatic speech recognition (ASR), it remains difficult to recognize speech when it overlaps other people's voices. Speech separation or extraction is often used as a front-end to ASR to handle such overlapping speech. However, deep neural network-based speech enhancement can generate `processing artifacts' as a side effect of the enhancement, which degrades ASR performance. For example, it is well known that single-channel noise reduction for non-speech noise (non-overlapping speech) often does not improve ASR. Likewise, the processing artifacts may also be detrimental to ASR in some conditions when processing overlapping speech with a separation/extraction method, although it is usually believed that separation/extraction improves ASR. In order to answer the question `Do we always have to separate/extract speech from mixtures?', we analyze ASR performance on observed and enhanced speech at various noise and interference conditions, and show that speech enhancement degrades ASR under some conditions even for overlapping speech. Based on these findings, we propose a simple switching algorithm between observed and enhanced speech based on the estimated signal-to-interference ratio and signal-to-noise ratio. We demonstrated experimentally that such a simple switching mechanism can improve recognition performance when processing artifacts are detrimental to ASR."
CrossASR++: A Modular Differential Testing Framework for Automatic Speech Recognition,"Developers need to perform adequate testing to ensure the quality of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. However, manually collecting required test cases is tedious and time-consuming. Our recent work proposes CrossASR, a differential testing method for ASR systems. This method first utilizes Text-to-Speech (TTS) to generate audios from texts automatically and then feed these audios into different ASR systems for cross-referencing to uncover failed test cases. It also leverages a failure estimator to find failing test cases more efficiently. Such a method is inherently self-improvable: the performance can increase by leveraging more advanced TTS and ASR systems. So in this accompanying tool demo paper, we devote more engineering and propose CrossASR++, an easy-to-use ASR testing tool that can be conveniently extended to incorporate different TTS and ASR systems, and failure estimators. We also make CrossASR++ chunk texts from a given corpus dynamically and enable the estimator to work in a more effective and flexible way. We demonstrate that the new features can help CrossASR++ discover more failed test cases. Using the same TTS and ASR systems, CrossASR++ can uncover 26.2% more failed test cases for 4 ASRs than the original tool. Moreover, by simply adding one more ASR for cross-referencing, we can increase the number of failed test cases uncovered for each of the 4 ASR systems by 25.07%, 39.63%, 20.9\% and 8.17% respectively. We also extend CrossASR++ with 5 additional failure estimators. Compared to worst estimator, the best one can discover 10.41% more failed test cases within the same amount of time."
Multitask Learning for Grapheme-to-Phoneme Conversion of Anglicisms in German Speech Recognition,"Anglicisms are a challenge in German speech recognition. Due to their irregular pronunciation compared to native German words, automatically generated pronunciation dictionaries often include faulty phoneme sequences for Anglicisms. In this work, we propose a multitask sequence-to-sequence approach for grapheme-to-phoneme conversion to improve the phonetization of Anglicisms. We extended a grapheme-to-phoneme model with a classifier to distinguish Anglicisms from native German words. With this approach, the model learns to generate pronunciations differently depending on the classification result. We used our model to create supplementary Anglicism pronunciation dictionaries that are added to an existing German speech recognition model. Tested on a dedicated Anglicism evaluation set, we improved the recognition of Anglicisms compared to a baseline model, reducing the word error rate by 1 % and the Anglicism error rate by 3 %. We show that multitask learning can help solving the challenge of Anglicisms in German speech recognition."
Exploiting Adapters for Cross-lingual Low-resource Speech Recognition,"Cross-lingual speech adaptation aims to solve the problem of leveraging multiple rich-resource languages to build models for a low-resource target language. Since the low-resource language has limited training data, speech recognition models can easily overfit. In this paper, we propose to use adapters to investigate the performance of multiple adapters for parameter-efficient cross-lingual speech adaptation. Based on our previous MetaAdapter that implicitly leverages adapters, we propose a novel algorithms called SimAdapter for explicitly learning knowledge from adapters. Our algorithm leverages adapters which can be easily integrated into the Transformer structure.MetaAdapter leverages meta-learning to transfer the general knowledge from training data to the test language. SimAdapter aims to learn the similarities between the source and target languages during fine-tuning using the adapters. We conduct extensive experiments on five-low-resource languages in Common Voice dataset. Results demonstrate that our MetaAdapter and SimAdapter methods can reduce WER by 2.98% and 2.55% with only 2.5% and 15.5% of trainable parameters compared to the strong full-model fine-tuning baseline. Moreover, we also show that these two novel algorithms can be integrated for better performance with up to 3.55% relative WER reduction."
Unsupervised Speech Recognition,"Despite rapid progress in the recent past, current speech recognition systems still require labeled training data which limits this technology to a small fraction of the languages spoken around the globe. This paper describes wav2vec-U, short for wav2vec Unsupervised, a method to train speech recognition models without any labeled data. We leverage self-supervised speech representations to segment unlabeled audio and learn a mapping from these representations to phonemes via adversarial training. The right representations are key to the success of our method. Compared to the best previous unsupervised work, wav2vec-U reduces the phoneme error rate on the TIMIT benchmark from 26.1 to 11.3. On the larger English Librispeech benchmark, wav2vec-U achieves a word error rate of 5.9 on test-other, rivaling some of the best published systems trained on 960 hours of labeled data from only two years ago. We also experiment on nine other languages, including low-resource languages such as Kyrgyz, Swahili and Tatar."
Mondegreen: A Post-Processing Solution to Speech Recognition Error Correction for Voice Search Queries,"As more and more online search queries come from voice, automatic speech recognition becomes a key component to deliver relevant search results. Errors introduced by automatic speech recognition (ASR) lead to irrelevant search results returned to the user, thus causing user dissatisfaction. In this paper, we introduce an approach, Mondegreen, to correct voice queries in text space without depending on audio signals, which may not always be available due to system constraints or privacy or bandwidth (for example, some ASR systems run on-device) considerations. We focus on voice queries transcribed via several proprietary commercial ASR systems. These queries come from users making internet, or online service search queries. We first present an analysis showing how different the language distribution coming from user voice queries is from that in traditional text corpora used to train off-the-shelf ASR systems. We then demonstrate that Mondegreen can achieve significant improvements in increased user interaction by correcting user voice queries in one of the largest search systems in Google. Finally, we see Mondegreen as complementing existing highly-optimized production ASR systems, which may not be frequently retrained and thus lag behind due to vocabulary drifts."
Robustness of end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition Models -- A Case Study using Mozilla DeepSpeech,"When evaluating the performance of automatic speech recognition models, usually word error rate within a certain dataset is used. Special care must be taken in understanding the dataset in order to report realistic performance numbers. We argue that many performance numbers reported probably underestimate the expected error rate. We conduct experiments controlling for selection bias, gender as well as overlap (between training and test data) in content, voices, and recording conditions. We find that content overlap has the biggest impact, but other factors like gender also play a role."
Speech & Song Emotion Recognition Using Multilayer Perceptron and Standard Vector Machine,"Herein, we have compared the performance of SVM and MLP in emotion recognition using speech and song channels of the RAVDESS dataset. We have undertaken a journey to extract various audio features, identify optimal scaling strategy and hyperparameter for our models. To increase sample size, we have performed audio data augmentation and addressed data imbalance using SMOTE. Our data indicate that optimised SVM outperforms MLP with an accuracy of 82 compared to 75%. Following data augmentation, the performance of both algorithms was identical at ~79%, however, overfitting was evident for the SVM. Our final exploration indicated that the performance of both SVM and MLP were similar in which both resulted in lower accuracy for the speech channel compared to the song channel. Our findings suggest that both SVM and MLP are powerful classifiers for emotion recognition in a vocal-dependent manner."
Listen with Intent: Improving Speech Recognition with Audio-to-Intent Front-End,"Comprehending the overall intent of an utterance helps a listener recognize the individual words spoken. Inspired by this fact, we perform a novel study of the impact of explicitly incorporating intent representations as additional information to improve a recurrent neural network-transducer (RNN-T) based automatic speech recognition (ASR) system. An audio-to-intent (A2I) model encodes the intent of the utterance in the form of embeddings or posteriors, and these are used as auxiliary inputs for RNN-T training and inference. Experimenting with a 50k-hour far-field English speech corpus, this study shows that when running the system in non-streaming mode, where intent representation is extracted from the entire utterance and then used to bias streaming RNN-T search from the start, it provides a 5.56% relative word error rate reduction (WERR). On the other hand, a streaming system using per-frame intent posteriors as extra inputs for the RNN-T ASR system yields a 3.33% relative WERR. A further detailed analysis of the streaming system indicates that our proposed method brings especially good gain on media-playing related intents (e.g. 9.12% relative WERR on PlayMusicIntent)."
Exploring CTC Based End-to-End Techniques for Myanmar Speech Recognition,"In this work, we explore a Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) based end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model for the Myanmar language. A series of experiments is presented on the topology of the model in which the convolutional layers are added and dropped, different depths of bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) layers are used and different label encoding methods are investigated. The experiments are carried out in low-resource scenarios using our recorded Myanmar speech corpus of nearly 26 hours. The best model achieves character error rate (CER) of 4.72% and syllable error rate (SER) of 12.38% on the test set."
Attention-based Neural Beamforming Layers for Multi-channel Speech Recognition,"Attention-based beamformers have recently been shown to be effective for multi-channel speech recognition. However, they are less capable at capturing local information. In this work, we propose a 2D Conv-Attention module which combines convolution neural networks with attention for beamforming. We apply self- and cross-attention to explicitly model the correlations within and between the input channels. The end-to-end 2D Conv-Attention model is compared with a multi-head self-attention and superdirective-based neural beamformers. We train and evaluate on an in-house multi-channel dataset. The results show a relative improvement of 3.8% in WER by the proposed model over the baseline neural beamformer."
English Accent Accuracy Analysis in a State-of-the-Art Automatic Speech Recognition System,"Nowadays, research in speech technologies has gotten a lot out thanks to recently created public domain corpora that contain thousands of recording hours. These large amounts of data are very helpful for training the new complex models based on deep learning technologies. However, the lack of dialectal diversity in a corpus is known to cause performance biases in speech systems, mainly for underrepresented dialects. In this work, we propose to evaluate a state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) deep learning-based model, using unseen data from a corpus with a wide variety of labeled English accents from different countries around the world. The model has been trained with 44.5K hours of English speech from an open access corpus called Multilingual LibriSpeech, showing remarkable results in popular benchmarks. We test the accuracy of such ASR against samples extracted from another public corpus that is continuously growing, the Common Voice dataset. Then, we present graphically the accuracy in terms of Word Error Rate of each of the different English included accents, showing that there is indeed an accuracy bias in terms of accentual variety, favoring the accents most prevalent in the training corpus."
Deep scattering network for speech emotion recognition,"This paper introduces scattering transform for speech emotion recognition (SER). Scattering transform generates feature representations which remain stable to deformations and shifting in time and frequency without much loss of information. In speech, the emotion cues are spread across time and localised in frequency. The time and frequency invariance characteristic of scattering coefficients provides a representation robust against emotion irrelevant variations e.g., different speakers, language, gender etc. while preserving the variations caused by emotion cues. Hence, such a representation captures the emotion information more efficiently from speech. We perform experiments to compare scattering coefficients with standard mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) over different databases. It is observed that frequency scattering performs better than time-domain scattering and MFCCs. We also investigate layer-wise scattering coefficients to analyse the importance of time shift and deformation stable scalogram and modulation spectrum coefficients for SER. We observe that layer-wise coefficients taken independently also perform better than MFCCs."
What shall we do with an hour of data? Speech recognition for the un- and under-served languages of Common Voice,"This technical report describes the methods and results of a three-week sprint to produce deployable speech recognition models for 31 under-served languages of the Common Voice project. We outline the preprocessing steps, hyperparameter selection, and resulting accuracy on official testing sets. In addition to this we evaluate the models on multiple tasks: closed-vocabulary speech recognition, pre-transcription, forced alignment, and key-word spotting. The following experiments use Coqui STT, a toolkit for training and deployment of neural Speech-to-Text models."
FastCorrect: Fast Error Correction with Edit Alignment for Automatic Speech Recognition,"Error correction techniques have been used to refine the output sentences from automatic speech recognition (ASR) models and achieve a lower word error rate (WER) than original ASR outputs. Previous works usually use a sequence-to-sequence model to correct an ASR output sentence autoregressively, which causes large latency and cannot be deployed in online ASR services. A straightforward solution to reduce latency, inspired by non-autoregressive (NAR) neural machine translation, is to use an NAR sequence generation model for ASR error correction, which, however, comes at the cost of significantly increased ASR error rate. In this paper, observing distinctive error patterns and correction operations (i.e., insertion, deletion, and substitution) in ASR, we propose FastCorrect, a novel NAR error correction model based on edit alignment. In training, FastCorrect aligns each source token from an ASR output sentence to the target tokens from the corresponding ground-truth sentence based on the edit distance between the source and target sentences, and extracts the number of target tokens corresponding to each source token during edition/correction, which is then used to train a length predictor and to adjust the source tokens to match the length of the target sentence for parallel generation. In inference, the token number predicted by the length predictor is used to adjust the source tokens for target sequence generation. Experiments on the public AISHELL-1 dataset and an internal industrial-scale ASR dataset show the effectiveness of FastCorrect for ASR error correction: 1) it speeds up the inference by 6-9 times and maintains the accuracy (8-14% WER reduction) compared with the autoregressive correction model; and 2) it outperforms the popular NAR models adopted in neural machine translation and text edition by a large margin."
Latency-Controlled Neural Architecture Search for Streaming Speech Recognition,"Neural architecture search (NAS) has attracted much attention and has been explored for automatic speech recognition (ASR). In this work, we focus on streaming ASR scenarios and propose the latency-controlled NAS for acoustic modeling. First, based on the vanilla neural architecture, normal cells are altered to causal cells to control the total latency of the architecture. Second, a revised operation space with a smaller receptive field is proposed to generate the final architecture with low latency. Extensive experiments show that: 1) Based on the proposed neural architecture, the neural networks with a medium latency of 550ms (millisecond) and a low latency of 190ms can be learned in the vanilla and revised operation space respectively. 2) For the low latency setting, the evaluation network can achieve more than 19\% (average on the four test sets) relative improvements compared with the hybrid CLDNN baseline, on a 10k-hour large-scale dataset."
Efficient Weight factorization for Multilingual Speech Recognition,"End-to-end multilingual speech recognition involves using a single model training on a compositional speech corpus including many languages, resulting in a single neural network to handle transcribing different languages. Due to the fact that each language in the training data has different characteristics, the shared network may struggle to optimize for all various languages simultaneously. In this paper we propose a novel multilingual architecture that targets the core operation in neural networks: linear transformation functions. The key idea of the method is to assign fast weight matrices for each language by decomposing each weight matrix into a shared component and a language dependent component. The latter is then factorized into vectors using rank-1 assumptions to reduce the number of parameters per language. This efficient factorization scheme is proved to be effective in two multilingual settings with 7 and 27 languages, reducing the word error rates by 26\% and 27\% rel. for two popular architectures LSTM and Transformer, respectively."
"Towards Interpretable and Transferable Speech Emotion Recognition: Latent Representation Based Analysis of Features, Methods and Corpora","In recent years, speech emotion recognition (SER) has been used in wide ranging applications, from healthcare to the commercial sector. In addition to signal processing approaches, methods for SER now also use deep learning techniques. However, generalizing over languages, corpora and recording conditions is still an open challenge in the field. Furthermore, due to the black-box nature of deep learning algorithms, a newer challenge is the lack of interpretation and transparency in the models and the decision making process. This is critical when the SER systems are deployed in applications that influence human lives. In this work we address this gap by providing an in-depth analysis of the decision making process of the proposed SER system. Towards that end, we present low-complexity SER based on undercomplete- and denoising- autoencoders that achieve an average classification accuracy of over 55\% for four-class emotion classification. Following this, we investigate the clustering of emotions in the latent space to understand the influence of the corpora on the model behavior and to obtain a physical interpretation of the latent embedding. Lastly, we explore the role of each input feature towards the performance of the SER."
Performance Evaluation of Deep Convolutional Maxout Neural Network in Speech Recognition,"In this paper, various structures and methods of Deep Artificial Neural Networks (DNN) will be evaluated and compared for the purpose of continuous Persian speech recognition. One of the first models of neural networks used in speech recognition applications were fully connected Neural Networks (FCNNs) and, consequently, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Although these models have better performance compared to GMM / HMM models, they do not have the proper structure to model local speech information. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a good option for modeling the local structure of biological signals, including speech signals. Another issue that Deep Artificial Neural Networks face, is the convergence of networks on training data. The main inhibitor of convergence is the presence of local minima in the process of training. Deep Neural Network Pre-training methods, despite a large amount of computing, are powerful tools for crossing the local minima. But the use of appropriate neuronal models in the network structure seems to be a better solution to this problem. The Rectified Linear Unit neuronal model and the Maxout model are the most suitable neuronal models presented to this date. Several experiments were carried out to evaluate the performance of the methods and structures mentioned. After verifying the proper functioning of these methods, a combination of all models was implemented on FARSDAT speech database for continuous speech recognition. The results obtained from the experiments show that the combined model (CMDNN) improves the performance of ANNs in speech recognition versus the pre-trained fully connected NNs with sigmoid neurons by about 3%."
Streaming end-to-end speech recognition with jointly trained neural feature enhancement,"In this paper, we present a streaming end-to-end speech recognition model based on Monotonic Chunkwise Attention (MoCha) jointly trained with enhancement layers. Even though the MoCha attention enables streaming speech recognition with recognition accuracy comparable to a full attention-based approach, training this model is sensitive to various factors such as the difficulty of training examples, hyper-parameters, and so on. Because of these issues, speech recognition accuracy of a MoCha-based model for clean speech drops significantly when a multi-style training approach is applied. Inspired by Curriculum Learning [1], we introduce two training strategies: Gradual Application of Enhanced Features (GAEF) and Gradual Reduction of Enhanced Loss (GREL). With GAEF, the model is initially trained using clean features. Subsequently, the portion of outputs from the enhancement layers gradually increases. With GREL, the portion of the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss for the enhanced output gradually reduces as training proceeds. In experimental results on the LibriSpeech corpus and noisy far-field test sets, the proposed model with GAEF-GREL training strategies shows significantly better results than the conventional multi-style training approach."
Quantifying and Maximizing the Benefits of Back-End Noise Adaption on Attention-Based Speech Recognition Models,"This work analyzes how attention-based Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) models adapt to noise-augmented speech. We identify crucial components for noise adaptation in BLSTM models by freezing model components during fine-tuning. We first freeze larger model subnetworks and then pursue a fine-grained freezing approach in the encoder after identifying its importance for noise adaptation. The first encoder layer is shown to be crucial for noise adaptation, and the weights are shown to be more important than the other layers. Appreciable accuracy benefits are identified when fine-tuning on a target noisy environment from a model pretrained with noisy speech relative to fine-tuning from a model pretrained with only clean speech when tested on the target noisy environment. For this analysis, we produce our own dataset augmentation tool and it is open-sourced to encourage future efforts in exploring noise adaptation in ASR."
On the limit of English conversational speech recognition,"In our previous work we demonstrated that a single headed attention encoder-decoder model is able to reach state-of-the-art results in conversational speech recognition. In this paper, we further improve the results for both Switchboard 300 and 2000. Through use of an improved optimizer, speaker vector embeddings, and alternative speech representations we reduce the recognition errors of our LSTM system on Switchboard-300 by 4% relative. Compensation of the decoder model with the probability ratio approach allows more efficient integration of an external language model, and we report 5.9% and 11.5% WER on the SWB and CHM parts of Hub5'00 with very simple LSTM models. Our study also considers the recently proposed conformer, and more advanced self-attention based language models. Overall, the conformer shows similar performance to the LSTM; nevertheless, their combination and decoding with an improved LM reaches a new record on Switchboard-300, 5.0% and 10.0% WER on SWB and CHM. Our findings are also confirmed on Switchboard-2000, and a new state of the art is reported, practically reaching the limit of the benchmark."
Deformable TDNN with adaptive receptive fields for speech recognition,"Time Delay Neural Networks (TDNNs) are widely used in both DNN-HMM based hybrid speech recognition systems and recent end-to-end systems. Nevertheless, the receptive fields of TDNNs are limited and fixed, which is not desirable for tasks like speech recognition, where the temporal dynamics of speech are varied and affected by many factors. This paper proposes to use deformable TDNNs for adaptive temporal dynamics modeling in end-to-end speech recognition. Inspired by deformable ConvNets, deformable TDNNs augment the temporal sampling locations with additional offsets and learn the offsets automatically based on the ASR criterion, without additional supervision. Experiments show that deformable TDNNs obtain state-of-the-art results on WSJ benchmarks (1.42\%/3.45\% WER on WSJ eval92/dev93 respectively), outperforming standard TDNNs significantly. Furthermore, we propose the latency control mechanism for deformable TDNNs, which enables deformable TDNNs to do streaming ASR without accuracy degradation."
End-to-End Speech Recognition from Federated Acoustic Models,"Training Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models under federated learning (FL) settings has attracted a lot of attention recently. However, the FL scenarios often presented in the literature are artificial and fail to capture the complexity of real FL systems. In this paper, we construct a challenging and realistic ASR federated experimental setup consisting of clients with heterogeneous data distributions using the French and Italian sets of the CommonVoice dataset, a large heterogeneous dataset containing thousands of different speakers, acoustic environments and noises. We present the first empirical study on attention-based sequence-to-sequence End-to-End (E2E) ASR model with three aggregation weighting strategies -- standard FedAvg, loss-based aggregation and a novel word error rate (WER)-based aggregation, compared in two realistic FL scenarios: cross-silo with 10 clients and cross-device with 2K and 4K clients. Our analysis on E2E ASR from heterogeneous and realistic federated acoustic models provides the foundations for future research and development of realistic FL-based ASR applications."
Using Radio Archives for Low-Resource Speech Recognition: Towards an Intelligent Virtual Assistant for Illiterate Users,"For many of the 700 million illiterate people around the world, speech recognition technology could provide a bridge to valuable information and services. Yet, those most in need of this technology are often the most underserved by it. In many countries, illiterate people tend to speak only low-resource languages, for which the datasets necessary for speech technology development are scarce. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of unsupervised speech representation learning on noisy radio broadcasting archives, which are abundant even in low-resource languages. We make three core contributions. First, we release two datasets to the research community. The first, West African Radio Corpus, contains 142 hours of audio in more than 10 languages with a labeled validation subset. The second, West African Virtual Assistant Speech Recognition Corpus, consists of 10K labeled audio clips in four languages. Next, we share West African wav2vec, a speech encoder trained on the noisy radio corpus, and compare it with the baseline Facebook speech encoder trained on six times more data of higher quality. We show that West African wav2vec performs similarly to the baseline on a multilingual speech recognition task, and significantly outperforms the baseline on a West African language identification task. Finally, we share the first-ever speech recognition models for Maninka, Pular and Susu, languages spoken by a combined 10 million people in over seven countries, including six where the majority of the adult population is illiterate. Our contributions offer a path forward for ethical AI research to serve the needs of those most disadvantaged by the digital divide."
Scene-aware Far-field Automatic Speech Recognition,"We propose a novel method for generating scene-aware training data for far-field automatic speech recognition. We use a deep learning-based estimator to non-intrusively compute the sub-band reverberation time of an environment from its speech samples. We model the acoustic characteristics of a scene with its reverberation time and represent it using a multivariate Gaussian distribution. We use this distribution to select acoustic impulse responses from a large real-world dataset for augmenting speech data. The speech recognition system trained on our scene-aware data consistently outperforms the system trained using many more random acoustic impulse responses on the REVERB and the AMI far-field benchmarks. In practice, we obtain 2.64% absolute improvement in word error rate compared with using training data of the same size with uniformly distributed reverberation times."
Accented Speech Recognition: A Survey,"Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems generalize poorly on accented speech. The phonetic and linguistic variability of accents present hard challenges for ASR systems today in both data collection and modeling strategies. The resulting bias in ASR performance across accents comes at a cost to both users and providers of ASR.  We present a survey of current promising approaches to accented speech recognition and highlight the key challenges in the space. Approaches mostly focus on single model generalization and accent feature engineering. Among the challenges, lack of a standard benchmark makes research and comparison especially difficult."
On the Impact of Word Error Rate on Acoustic-Linguistic Speech Emotion Recognition: An Update for the Deep Learning Era,"Text encodings from automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcripts and audio representations have shown promise in speech emotion recognition (SER) ever since. Yet, it is challenging to explain the effect of each information stream on the SER systems. Further, more clarification is required for analysing the impact of ASR's word error rate (WER) on linguistic emotion recognition per se and in the context of fusion with acoustic information exploitation in the age of deep ASR systems. In order to tackle the above issues, we create transcripts from the original speech by applying three modern ASR systems, including an end-to-end model trained with recurrent neural network-transducer loss, a model with connectionist temporal classification loss, and a wav2vec framework for self-supervised learning. Afterwards, we use pre-trained textual models to extract text representations from the ASR outputs and the gold standard. For extraction and learning of acoustic speech features, we utilise openSMILE, openXBoW, DeepSpectrum, and auDeep. Finally, we conduct decision-level fusion on both information streams -- acoustics and linguistics. Using the best development configuration, we achieve state-of-the-art unweighted average recall values of 73.6\,\% and 73.8\,\% on the speaker-independent development and test partitions of IEMOCAP, respectively."
Fusing information streams in end-to-end audio-visual speech recognition,"End-to-end acoustic speech recognition has quickly gained widespread popularity and shows promising results in many studies. Specifically the joint transformer/CTC model provides very good performance in many tasks. However, under noisy and distorted conditions, the performance still degrades notably. While audio-visual speech recognition can significantly improve the recognition rate of end-to-end models in such poor conditions, it is not obvious how to best utilize any available information on acoustic and visual signal quality and reliability in these models. We thus consider the question of how to optimally inform the transformer/CTC model of any time-variant reliability of the acoustic and visual information streams. We propose a new fusion strategy, incorporating reliability information in a decision fusion net that considers the temporal effects of the attention mechanism. This approach yields significant improvements compared to a state-of-the-art baseline model on the Lip Reading Sentences 2 and 3 (LRS2 and LRS3) corpus. On average, the new system achieves a relative word error rate reduction of 43% compared to the audio-only setup and 31% compared to the audiovisual end-to-end baseline."
Advanced Long-context End-to-end Speech Recognition Using Context-expanded Transformers,"This paper addresses end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) for long audio recordings such as lecture and conversational speeches. Most end-to-end ASR models are designed to recognize independent utterances, but contextual information (e.g., speaker or topic) over multiple utterances is known to be useful for ASR. In our prior work, we proposed a context-expanded Transformer that accepts multiple consecutive utterances at the same time and predicts an output sequence for the last utterance, achieving 5-15% relative error reduction from utterance-based baselines in lecture and conversational ASR benchmarks. Although the results have shown remarkable performance gain, there is still potential to further improve the model architecture and the decoding process. In this paper, we extend our prior work by (1) introducing the Conformer architecture to further improve the accuracy, (2) accelerating the decoding process with a novel activation recycling technique, and (3) enabling streaming decoding with triggered attention. We demonstrate that the extended Transformer provides state-of-the-art end-to-end ASR performance, obtaining a 17.3% character error rate for the HKUST dataset and 12.0%/6.3% word error rates for the Switchboard-300 Eval2000 CallHome/Switchboard test sets. The new decoding method reduces decoding time by more than 50% and further enables streaming ASR with limited accuracy degradation."
Acoustic Data-Driven Subword Modeling for End-to-End Speech Recognition,"Subword units are commonly used for end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR), while a fully acoustic-oriented subword modeling approach is somewhat missing. We propose an acoustic data-driven subword modeling (ADSM) approach that adapts the advantages of several text-based and acoustic-based subword methods into one pipeline. With a fully acoustic-oriented label design and learning process, ADSM produces acoustic-structured subword units and acoustic-matched target sequence for further ASR training. The obtained ADSM labels are evaluated with different end-to-end ASR approaches including CTC, RNN-Transducer and attention models. Experiments on the LibriSpeech corpus show that ADSM clearly outperforms both byte pair encoding (BPE) and pronunciation-assisted subword modeling (PASM) in all cases. Detailed analysis shows that ADSM achieves acoustically more logical word segmentation and more balanced sequence length, and thus, is suitable for both time-synchronous and label-synchronous models. We also briefly describe how to apply acoustic-based subword regularization and unseen text segmentation using ADSM."
Cross-domain Speech Recognition with Unsupervised Character-level Distribution Matching,"End-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) can achieve promising performance with large-scale training data. However, it is known that domain mismatch between training and testing data often leads to a degradation of recognition accuracy. In this work, we focus on the unsupervised domain adaptation for ASR and propose CMatch, a Character-level distribution matching method to perform fine-grained adaptation between each character in two domains. First, to obtain labels for the features belonging to each character, we achieve frame-level label assignment using the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) pseudo labels. Then, we match the character-level distributions using Maximum Mean Discrepancy. We train our algorithm using the self-training technique. Experiments on the Libri-Adapt dataset show that our proposed approach achieves 14.39% and 16.50% relative Word Error Rate (WER) reduction on both cross-device and cross-environment ASR. We also comprehensively analyze the different strategies for frame-level label assignment and Transformer adaptations."
EAT: Enhanced ASR-TTS for Self-supervised Speech Recognition,"Self-supervised ASR-TTS models suffer in out-of-domain data conditions. Here we propose an enhanced ASR-TTS (EAT) model that incorporates two main features: 1) The ASR\rightarrowTTS direction is equipped with a language model reward to penalize the ASR hypotheses before forwarding it to TTS. 2) In the TTS\rightarrowASR direction, a hyper-parameter is introduced to scale the attention context from synthesized speech before sending it to ASR to handle out-of-domain data. Training strategies and the effectiveness of the EAT model are explored under out-of-domain data conditions. The results show that EAT reduces the performance gap between supervised and self-supervised training significantly by absolute 2.6\% and 2.7\% on Librispeech and BABEL respectively."
Speaker Attentive Speech Emotion Recognition,"Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) task has known significant improvements over the last years with the advent of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, even the most successful methods are still rather failing when adaptation to specific speakers and scenarios is needed, inevitably leading to poorer performances when compared to humans. In this paper, we present novel work based on the idea of teaching the emotion recognition network about speaker identity. Our system is a combination of two ACRNN classifiers respectively dedicated to speaker and emotion recognition. The first informs the latter through a Self Speaker Attention (SSA) mechanism that is shown to considerably help to focus on emotional information of the speech signal. Experiments on social attitudes database Att-HACK and IEMOCAP corpus demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and achieve the state-of-the-art performance in terms of unweighted average recall."
Unsupervised low-rank representations for speech emotion recognition,"We examine the use of linear and non-linear dimensionality reduction algorithms for extracting low-rank feature representations for speech emotion recognition. Two feature sets are used, one based on low-level descriptors and their aggregations (IS10) and one modeling recurrence dynamics of speech (RQA), as well as their fusion. We report speech emotion recognition (SER) results for learned representations on two databases using different classification methods. Classification with low-dimensional representations yields performance improvement in a variety of settings. This indicates that dimensionality reduction is an effective way to combat the curse of dimensionality for SER. Visualization of features in two dimensions provides insight into discriminatory abilities of reduced feature sets."
Efficient conformer-based speech recognition with linear attention,"Recently, conformer-based end-to-end automatic speech recognition, which outperforms recurrent neural network based ones, has received much attention. Although the parallel computing of conformer is more efficient than recurrent neural networks, the computational complexity of its dot-product self-attention is quadratic with respect to the length of the input feature. To reduce the computational complexity of the self-attention layer, we propose multi-head linear self-attention for the self-attention layer, which reduces its computational complexity to linear order. In addition, we propose to factorize the feed forward module of the conformer by low-rank matrix factorization, which successfully reduces the number of the parameters by approximate 50% with little performance loss. The proposed model, named linear attention based conformer (LAC), can be trained and inferenced jointly with the connectionist temporal classification objective, which further improves the performance of LAC. To evaluate the effectiveness of LAC, we conduct experiments on the AISHELL-1 and LibriSpeech corpora. Results show that the proposed LAC achieves better performance than 7 recently proposed speech recognition models, and is competitive with the state-of-the-art conformer. Meanwhile, the proposed LAC has a number of parameters of only 50% over the conformer with faster training speed than the latter."
BART based semantic correction for Mandarin automatic speech recognition system,"Although automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems achieved significantly improvements in recent years, spoken language recognition error occurs which can be easily spotted by human beings. Various language modeling techniques have been developed on post recognition tasks like semantic correction. In this paper, we propose a Transformer based semantic correction method with pretrained BART initialization, Experiments on 10000 hours Mandarin speech dataset show that character error rate (CER) can be effectively reduced by 21.7% relatively compared to our baseline ASR system. Expert evaluation demonstrates that actual improvement of our model surpasses what CER indicates."
Improved Conformer-based End-to-End Speech Recognition Using Neural Architecture Search,"Recently neural architecture search(NAS) has been successfully used in image classification, natural language processing, and automatic speech recognition(ASR) tasks for finding the state-of-the-art(SOTA) architectures than those human-designed architectures. NAS can derive a SOTA and data-specific architecture over validation data from a pre-defined search space with a search algorithm. Inspired by the success of NAS in ASR tasks, we propose a NAS-based ASR framework containing one search space and one differentiable search algorithm called Differentiable Architecture Search(DARTS). Our search space follows the convolution-augmented transformer(Conformer) backbone, which is a more expressive ASR architecture than those used in existing NAS-based ASR frameworks. To improve the performance of our method, a regulation method called Dynamic Search Schedule(DSS) is employed. On a widely used Mandarin benchmark AISHELL-1, our best-searched architecture outperforms the baseline Conform model significantly with about 11% CER relative improvement, and our method is proved to be pretty efficient by the search cost comparisons."
Comparing the Benefit of Synthetic Training Data for Various Automatic Speech Recognition Architectures,"Recent publications on automatic-speech-recognition (ASR) have a strong focus on attention encoder-decoder (AED) architectures which tend to suffer from over-fitting in low resource scenarios. One solution to tackle this issue is to generate synthetic data with a trained text-to-speech system (TTS) if additional text is available. This was successfully applied in many publications with AED systems, but only very limited in the context of other ASR architectures. We investigate the effect of varying pre-processing, the speaker embedding and input encoding of the TTS system w.r.t. the effectiveness of the synthesized data for AED-ASR training. Additionally, we also consider internal language model subtraction for the first time, resulting in up to 38% relative improvement. We compare the AED results to a state-of-the-art hybrid ASR system, a monophone based system using connectionist-temporal-classification (CTC) and a monotonic transducer based system. We show that for the later systems the addition of synthetic data has no relevant effect, but they still outperform the AED systems on LibriSpeech-100h. We achieve a final word-error-rate of 3.3%/10.0% with a hybrid system on the clean/noisy test-sets, surpassing any previous state-of-the-art systems on Librispeech-100h that do not include unlabeled audio data."
Innovative Bert-based Reranking Language Models for Speech Recognition,"More recently, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) was proposed and has achieved impressive success on many natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as question answering and language understanding, due mainly to its effective pre-training then fine-tuning paradigm as well as strong local contextual modeling ability. In view of the above, this paper presents a novel instantiation of the BERT-based contextualized language models (LMs) for use in reranking of N-best hypotheses produced by automatic speech recognition (ASR). To this end, we frame N-best hypothesis reranking with BERT as a prediction problem, which aims to predict the oracle hypothesis that has the lowest word error rate (WER) given the N-best hypotheses (denoted by PBERT). In particular, we also explore to capitalize on task-specific global topic information in an unsupervised manner to assist PBERT in N-best hypothesis reranking (denoted by TPBERT). Extensive experiments conducted on the AMI benchmark corpus demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of our methods in comparison to the conventional autoregressive models like the recurrent neural network (RNN) and a recently proposed method that employed BERT to compute pseudo-log-likelihood (PLL) scores for N-best hypothesis reranking."
Accented Speech Recognition Inspired by Human Perception,"While improvements have been made in automatic speech recognition performance over the last several years, machines continue to have significantly lower performance on accented speech than humans. In addition, the most significant improvements on accented speech primarily arise by overwhelming the problem with hundreds or even thousands of hours of data. Humans typically require much less data to adapt to a new accent. This paper explores methods that are inspired by human perception to evaluate possible performance improvements for recognition of accented speech, with a specific focus on recognizing speech with a novel accent relative to that of the training data. Our experiments are run on small, accessible datasets that are available to the research community. We explore four methodologies: pre-exposure to multiple accents, grapheme and phoneme-based pronunciations, dropout (to improve generalization to a novel accent), and the identification of the layers in the neural network that can specifically be associated with accent modeling. Our results indicate that methods based on human perception are promising in reducing WER and understanding how accented speech is modeled in neural networks for novel accents."
Lookup-Table Recurrent Language Models for Long Tail Speech Recognition,"We introduce Lookup-Table Language Models (LookupLM), a method for scaling up the size of RNN language models with only a constant increase in the floating point operations, by increasing the expressivity of the embedding table. In particular, we instantiate an (additional) embedding table which embeds the previous n-gram token sequence, rather than a single token. This allows the embedding table to be scaled up arbitrarily -- with a commensurate increase in performance -- without changing the token vocabulary. Since embeddings are sparsely retrieved from the table via a lookup; increasing the size of the table adds neither extra operations to each forward pass nor extra parameters that need to be stored on limited GPU/TPU memory. We explore scaling n-gram embedding tables up to nearly a billion parameters. When trained on a 3-billion sentence corpus, we find that LookupLM improves long tail log perplexity by 2.44 and long tail WER by 23.4% on a downstream speech recognition task over a standard RNN language model baseline, an improvement comparable to a scaling up the baseline by 6.2x the number of floating point operations."
Language model fusion for streaming end to end speech recognition,"Streaming processing of speech audio is required for many contemporary practical speech recognition tasks. Even with the large corpora of manually transcribed speech data available today, it is impossible for such corpora to cover adequately the long tail of linguistic content that's important for tasks such as open-ended dictation and voice search. We seek to address both the streaming and the tail recognition challenges by using a language model (LM) trained on unpaired text data to enhance the end-to-end (E2E) model. We extend shallow fusion and cold fusion approaches to streaming Recurrent Neural Network Transducer (RNNT), and also propose two new competitive fusion approaches that further enhance the RNNT architecture. Our results on multiple languages with varying training set sizes show that these fusion methods improve streaming RNNT performance through introducing extra linguistic features. Cold fusion works consistently better on streaming RNNT with up to a 8.5% WER improvement."
"AISHELL-4: An Open Source Dataset for Speech Enhancement, Separation, Recognition and Speaker Diarization in Conference Scenario","In this paper, we present AISHELL-4, a sizable real-recorded Mandarin speech dataset collected by 8-channel circular microphone array for speech processing in conference scenario. The dataset consists of 211 recorded meeting sessions, each containing 4 to 8 speakers, with a total length of 120 hours. This dataset aims to bridge the advanced research on multi-speaker processing and the practical application scenario in three aspects. With real recorded meetings, AISHELL-4 provides realistic acoustics and rich natural speech characteristics in conversation such as short pause, speech overlap, quick speaker turn, noise, etc. Meanwhile, accurate transcription and speaker voice activity are provided for each meeting in AISHELL-4. This allows the researchers to explore different aspects in meeting processing, ranging from individual tasks such as speech front-end processing, speech recognition and speaker diarization, to multi-modality modeling and joint optimization of relevant tasks. Given most open source dataset for multi-speaker tasks are in English, AISHELL-4 is the only Mandarin dataset for conversation speech, providing additional value for data diversity in speech community. We also release a PyTorch-based training and evaluation framework as baseline system to promote reproducible research in this field."
WNARS: WFST based Non-autoregressive Streaming End-to-End Speech Recognition,"Recently, attention-based encoder-decoder (AED) end-to-end (E2E) models have drawn more and more attention in the field of automatic speech recognition (ASR). AED models, however, still have drawbacks when deploying in commercial applications. Autoregressive beam search decoding makes it inefficient for high-concurrency applications. It is also inconvenient to integrate external word-level language models. The most important thing is that AED models are difficult for streaming recognition due to global attention mechanism. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, namely WNARS, using hybrid CTC-attention AED models and weighted finite-state transducers (WFST) to solve these problems together. We switch from autoregressive beam search to CTC branch decoding, which performs first-pass decoding with WFST in chunk-wise streaming way. The decoder branch then performs second-pass rescoring on the generated hypotheses non-autoregressively. On the AISHELL-1 task, our WNARS achieves a character error rate of 5.22% with 640ms latency, to the best of our knowledge, which is the state-of-the-art performance for online ASR. Further experiments on our 10,000-hour Mandarin task show the proposed method achieves more than 20% improvements with 50% latency compared to a strong TDNN-BLSTM lattice-free MMI baseline."
Emotion Recognition from Speech Using Wav2vec 2.0 Embeddings,"Emotion recognition datasets are relatively small, making the use of the more sophisticated deep learning approaches challenging. In this work, we propose a transfer learning method for speech emotion recognition where features extracted from pre-trained wav2vec 2.0 models are modeled using simple neural networks. We propose to combine the output of several layers from the pre-trained model using trainable weights which are learned jointly with the downstream model. Further, we compare performance using two different wav2vec 2.0 models, with and without finetuning for speech recognition. We evaluate our proposed approaches on two standard emotion databases IEMOCAP and RAVDESS, showing superior performance compared to results in the literature."
Pushing the Limits of Non-Autoregressive Speech Recognition,"We combine recent advancements in end-to-end speech recognition to non-autoregressive automatic speech recognition. We push the limits of non-autoregressive state-of-the-art results for multiple datasets: LibriSpeech, Fisher+Switchboard and Wall Street Journal. Key to our recipe, we leverage CTC on giant Conformer neural network architectures with SpecAugment and wav2vec2 pre-training. We achieve 1.8%/3.6% WER on LibriSpeech test/test-other sets, 5.1%/9.8% WER on Switchboard, and 3.4% on the Wall Street Journal, all without a language model."
Learning to Rank Microphones for Distant Speech Recognition,"Fully exploiting ad-hoc microphone networks for distant speech recognition is still an open issue. Empirical evidence shows that being able to select the best microphone leads to significant improvements in recognition without any additional effort on front-end processing. Current channel selection techniques either rely on signal, decoder or posterior-based features. Signal-based features are inexpensive to compute but do not always correlate with recognition performance. Instead decoder and posterior-based features exhibit better correlation but require substantial computational resources. In this work, we tackle the channel selection problem by proposing MicRank, a learning to rank framework where a neural network is trained to rank the available channels using directly the recognition performance on the training set. The proposed approach is agnostic with respect to the array geometry and type of recognition back-end. We investigate different learning to rank strategies using a synthetic dataset developed on purpose and the CHiME-6 data. Results show that the proposed approach is able to considerably improve over previous selection techniques, reaching comparable and in some instances better performance than oracle signal-based measures."
Non-autoregressive Mandarin-English Code-switching Speech Recognition,"Mandarin-English code-switching (CS) is frequently used among East and Southeast Asian people. However, the intra-sentence language switching of the two very different languages makes recognizing CS speech challenging. Meanwhile, the recent successful non-autoregressive (NAR) ASR models remove the need for left-to-right beam decoding in autoregressive (AR) models and achieved outstanding performance and fast inference speed, but it has not been applied to Mandarin-English CS speech recognition. This paper takes advantage of the Mask-CTC NAR ASR framework to tackle the CS speech recognition issue. We further propose to change the Mandarin output target of the encoder to Pinyin for faster encoder training and introduce the Pinyin-to-Mandarin decoder to learn contextualized information. Moreover, we use word embedding label smoothing to regularize the decoder with contextualized information and projection matrix regularization to bridge that gap between the encoder and decoder. We evaluate these methods on the SEAME corpus and achieved exciting results."
Dissecting User-Perceived Latency of On-Device E2E Speech Recognition,"As speech-enabled devices such as smartphones and smart speakers become increasingly ubiquitous, there is growing interest in building automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems that can run directly on-device; end-to-end (E2E) speech recognition models such as recurrent neural network transducers and their variants have recently emerged as prime candidates for this task. Apart from being accurate and compact, such systems need to decode speech with low user-perceived latency (UPL), producing words as soon as they are spoken. This work examines the impact of various techniques - model architectures, training criteria, decoding hyperparameters, and endpointer parameters - on UPL. Our analyses suggest that measures of model size (parameters, input chunk sizes), or measures of computation (e.g., FLOPS, RTF) that reflect the model's ability to process input frames are not always strongly correlated with observed UPL. Thus, conventional algorithmic latency measurements might be inadequate in accurately capturing latency observed when models are deployed on embedded devices. Instead, we find that factors affecting token emission latency, and endpointing behavior have a larger impact on UPL. We achieve the best trade-off between latency and word error rate when performing ASR jointly with endpointing, while utilizing the recently proposed alignment regularization mechanism."
Contextualized Streaming End-to-End Speech Recognition with Trie-Based Deep Biasing and Shallow Fusion,"How to leverage dynamic contextual information in end-to-end speech recognition has remained an active research area. Previous solutions to this problem were either designed for specialized use cases that did not generalize well to open-domain scenarios, did not scale to large biasing lists, or underperformed on rare long-tail words. We address these limitations by proposing a novel solution that combines shallow fusion, trie-based deep biasing, and neural network language model contextualization. These techniques result in significant 19.5% relative Word Error Rate improvement over existing contextual biasing approaches and 5.4%-9.3% improvement compared to a strong hybrid baseline on both open-domain and constrained contextualization tasks, where the targets consist of mostly rare long-tail words. Our final system remains lightweight and modular, allowing for quick modification without model re-training."
SpeechStew: Simply Mix All Available Speech Recognition Data to Train One Large Neural Network,"We present SpeechStew, a speech recognition model that is trained on a combination of various publicly available speech recognition datasets: AMI, Broadcast News, Common Voice, LibriSpeech, Switchboard/Fisher, Tedlium, and Wall Street Journal. SpeechStew simply mixes all of these datasets together, without any special re-weighting or re-balancing of the datasets. SpeechStew achieves SoTA or near SoTA results across a variety of tasks, without the use of an external language model. Our results include 9.0\% WER on AMI-IHM, 4.7\% WER on Switchboard, 8.3\% WER on CallHome, and 1.3\% on WSJ, which significantly outperforms prior work with strong external language models. We also demonstrate that SpeechStew learns powerful transfer learning representations. We fine-tune SpeechStew on a noisy low resource speech dataset, CHiME-6. We achieve 38.9\% WER without a language model, which compares to 38.6\% WER to a strong HMM baseline with a language model."
Streaming Multi-talker Speech Recognition with Joint Speaker Identification,"In multi-talker scenarios such as meetings and conversations, speech processing systems are usually required to transcribe the audio as well as identify the speakers for downstream applications. Since overlapped speech is common in this case, conventional approaches usually address this problem in a cascaded fashion that involves speech separation, speech recognition and speaker identification that are trained independently. In this paper, we propose Streaming Unmixing, Recognition and Identification Transducer (SURIT) -- a new framework that deals with this problem in an end-to-end streaming fashion. SURIT employs the recurrent neural network transducer (RNN-T) as the backbone for both speech recognition and speaker identification. We validate our idea on the LibrispeechMix dataset -- a multi-talker dataset derived from Librispeech, and present encouraging results."
"SPGISpeech: 5,000 hours of transcribed financial audio for fully formatted end-to-end speech recognition","In the English speech-to-text (STT) machine learning task, acoustic models are conventionally trained on uncased Latin characters, and any necessary orthography (such as capitalization, punctuation, and denormalization of non-standard words) is imputed by separate post-processing models. This adds complexity and limits performance, as many formatting tasks benefit from semantic information present in the acoustic signal but absent in transcription. Here we propose a new STT task: end-to-end neural transcription with fully formatted text for target labels. We present baseline Conformer-based models trained on a corpus of 5,000 hours of professionally transcribed earnings calls, achieving a CER of 1.7. As a contribution to the STT research community, we release the corpus free for non-commercial use at https://datasets.kensho.com/datasets/scribe."
TSNAT: Two-Step Non-Autoregressvie Transformer Models for Speech Recognition,"The autoregressive (AR) models, such as attention-based encoder-decoder models and RNN-Transducer, have achieved great success in speech recognition. They predict the output sequence conditioned on the previous tokens and acoustic encoded states, which is inefficient on GPUs. The non-autoregressive (NAR) models can get rid of the temporal dependency between the output tokens and predict the entire output tokens in at least one step. However, the NAR model still faces two major problems. On the one hand, there is still a great gap in performance between the NAR models and the advanced AR models. On the other hand, it's difficult for most of the NAR models to train and converge. To address these two problems, we propose a new model named the two-step non-autoregressive transformer(TSNAT), which improves the performance and accelerating the convergence of the NAR model by learning prior knowledge from a parameters-sharing AR model. Furthermore, we introduce the two-stage method into the inference process, which improves the model performance greatly. All the experiments are conducted on a public Chinese mandarin dataset ASIEHLL-1. The results show that the TSNAT can achieve a competitive performance with the AR model and outperform many complicated NAR models."
ExKaldi-RT: A Real-Time Automatic Speech Recognition Extension Toolkit of Kaldi,"This paper describes the ExKaldi-RT online automatic speech recognition (ASR) toolkit that is implemented based on the Kaldi ASR toolkit and Python language. ExKaldi-RT provides tools for building online recognition pipelines. While similar tools are available built on Kaldi, a key feature of ExKaldi-RT that it works on Python, which has an easy-to-use interface that allows online ASR system developers to develop original research, such as by applying neural network-based signal processing and by decoding model trained with deep learning frameworks. We performed benchmark experiments on the minimum LibriSpeech corpus, and it showed that ExKaldi-RT could achieve competitive ASR performance in real-time recognition."
Tusom2021: A Phonetically Transcribed Speech Dataset from an Endangered Language for Universal Phone Recognition Experiments,"There is growing interest in ASR systems that can recognize phones in a language-independent fashion. There is additionally interest in building language technologies for low-resource and endangered languages. However, there is a paucity of realistic data that can be used to test such systems and technologies. This paper presents a publicly available, phonetically transcribed corpus of 2255 utterances (words and short phrases) in the endangered Tangkhulic language East Tusom (no ISO 639-3 code), a Tibeto-Burman language variety spoken mostly in India. Because the dataset is transcribed in terms of phones, rather than phonemes, it is a better match for universal phone recognition systems than many larger (phonemically transcribed) datasets. This paper describes the dataset and the methodology used to produce it. It further presents basic benchmarks of state-of-the-art universal phone recognition systems on the dataset as baselines for future experiments."
Configurable Privacy-Preserving Automatic Speech Recognition,"Voice assistive technologies have given rise to far-reaching privacy and security concerns. In this paper we investigate whether modular automatic speech recognition (ASR) can improve privacy in voice assistive systems by combining independently trained separation, recognition, and discretization modules to design configurable privacy-preserving ASR systems. We evaluate privacy concerns and the effects of applying various state-of-the-art techniques at each stage of the system, and report results using task-specific metrics (i.e. WER, ABX, and accuracy). We show that overlapping speech inputs to ASR systems present further privacy concerns, and how these may be mitigated using speech separation and optimization techniques. Our discretization module is shown to minimize paralinguistics privacy leakage from ASR acoustic models to levels commensurate with random guessing. We show that voice privacy can be configurable, and argue this presents new opportunities for privacy-preserving applications incorporating ASR."
Interactive spatial speech recognition maps based on simulated speech recognition experiments,"In their everyday life, the speech recognition performance of human listeners is influenced by diverse factors, such as the acoustic environment, the talker and listener positions, possibly impaired hearing, and optional hearing devices. Prediction models come closer to considering all required factors simultaneously to predict the individual speech recognition performance in complex acoustic environments. While such predictions may still not be sufficiently accurate for serious applications, they can already be performed and demand an accessible representation. In this contribution, an interactive representation of speech recognition performance is proposed, which focuses on the listeners head orientation and the spatial dimensions of an acoustic scene. A exemplary modeling toolchain, including an acoustic rendering model, a hearing device model, and a listener model, was used to generate a data set for demonstration purposes. Using the spatial speech recognition maps to explore this data set demonstrated the suitability of the approach to observe possibly relevant behavior. The proposed representation provides a suitable target to compare and validate different modeling approaches in ecologically relevant contexts. Eventually, it may serve as a tool to use validated prediction models in the design of spaces and devices which take speech communication into account."
Multi-Encoder Learning and Stream Fusion for Transformer-Based End-to-End Automatic Speech Recognition,"Stream fusion, also known as system combination, is a common technique in automatic speech recognition for traditional hybrid hidden Markov model approaches, yet mostly unexplored for modern deep neural network end-to-end model architectures. Here, we investigate various fusion techniques for the all-attention-based encoder-decoder architecture known as the transformer, striving to achieve optimal fusion by investigating different fusion levels in an example single-microphone setting with fusion of standard magnitude and phase features. We introduce a novel multi-encoder learning method that performs a weighted combination of two encoder-decoder multi-head attention outputs only during training. Employing then only the magnitude feature encoder in inference, we are able to show consistent improvement on Wall Street Journal (WSJ) with language model and on Librispeech, without increase in runtime or parameters. Combining two such multi-encoder trained models by a simple late fusion in inference, we achieve state-of-the-art performance for transformer-based models on WSJ with a significant WER reduction of 19% relative compared to the current benchmark approach."
Adversarial Attacks and Defenses for Speech Recognition Systems,"The ubiquitous presence of machine learning systems in our lives necessitates research into their vulnerabilities and appropriate countermeasures. In particular, we investigate the effectiveness of adversarial attacks and defenses against automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. We select two ASR models - a thoroughly studied DeepSpeech model and a more recent Espresso framework Transformer encoder-decoder model. We investigate two threat models: a denial-of-service scenario where fast gradient-sign method (FGSM) or weak projected gradient descent (PGD) attacks are used to degrade the model's word error rate (WER); and a targeted scenario where a more potent imperceptible attack forces the system to recognize a specific phrase. We find that the attack transferability across the investigated ASR systems is limited. To defend the model, we use two preprocessing defenses: randomized smoothing and WaveGAN-based vocoder, and find that they significantly improve the model's adversarial robustness. We show that a WaveGAN vocoder can be a useful countermeasure to adversarial attacks on ASR systems - even when it is jointly attacked with the ASR, the target phrases' word error rate is high."
Integer-only Zero-shot Quantization for Efficient Speech Recognition,"End-to-end neural network models achieve improved performance on various automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks. However, these models perform poorly on edge hardware due to large memory and computation requirements. While quantizing model weights and/or activations to low-precision can be a promising solution, previous research on quantizing ASR models is limited. In particular, the previous approaches use floating-point arithmetic during inference and thus they cannot fully exploit efficient integer processing units. Moreover, they require training and/or validation data during quantization, which may not be available due to security or privacy concerns. To address these limitations, we propose an integer-only, zero-shot quantization scheme for ASR models. In particular, we generate synthetic data whose runtime statistics resemble the real data, and we use it to calibrate models during quantization. We apply our method to quantize QuartzNet, Jasper, and Conformer and show negligible WER degradation as compared to the full-precision baseline models, even without using any data. Moreover, we achieve up to 2.35x speedup on a T4 GPU and 4x compression rate, with a modest WER degradation of <1% with INT8 quantization."
Enhancing Segment-Based Speech Emotion Recognition by Deep Self-Learning,"Despite the widespread utilization of deep neural networks (DNNs) for speech emotion recognition (SER), they are severely restricted due to the paucity of labeled data for training. Recently, segment-based approaches for SER have been evolving, which train backbone networks on shorter segments instead of whole utterances, and thus naturally augments training examples without additional resources. However, one core challenge remains for segment-based approaches: most emotional corpora do not provide ground-truth labels at the segment level. To supervisely train a segment-based emotion model on such datasets, the most common way assigns each segment the corresponding utterance's emotion label. However, this practice typically introduces noisy (incorrect) labels as emotional information is not uniformly distributed across the whole utterance. On the other hand, DNNs have been shown to easily over-fit a dataset when being trained with noisy labels. To this end, this work proposes a simple and effective deep self-learning (DSL) framework, which comprises a procedure to progressively correct segment-level labels in an iterative learning manner. The DSL method produces dynamically-generated and soft emotion labels, leading to significant performance improvements. Experiments on three well-known emotional corpora demonstrate noticeable gains using the proposed method."
Transformer-based end-to-end speech recognition with residual Gaussian-based self-attention,"Self-attention (SA), which encodes vector sequences according to their pairwise similarity, is widely used in speech recognition due to its strong context modeling ability. However, when applied to long sequence data, its accuracy is reduced. This is caused by the fact that its weighted average operator may lead to the dispersion of the attention distribution, which results in the relationship between adjacent signals ignored. To address this issue, in this paper, we introduce relative-position-awareness self-attention (RPSA). It not only maintains the global-range dependency modeling ability of self-attention, but also improves the localness modeling ability. Because the local window length of the original RPSA is fixed and sensitive to different test data, here we propose Gaussian-based self-attention (GSA) whose window length is learnable and adaptive to the test data automatically. We further generalize GSA to a new residual Gaussian self-attention (resGSA) for the performance improvement. We apply RPSA, GSA, and resGSA to Transformer-based speech recognition respectively. Experimental results on the AISHELL-1 Mandarin speech recognition corpus demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. For example, the resGSA-Transformer achieves a character error rate (CER) of 5.86% on the test set, which is relative 7.8% lower than that of the SA-Transformer. Although the performance of the proposed resGSA-Transformer is only slightly better than that of the RPSA-Transformer, it does not have to tune the window length manually."
Multiple-hypothesis CTC-based semi-supervised adaptation of end-to-end speech recognition,"This paper proposes an adaptation method for end-to-end speech recognition. In this method, multiple automatic speech recognition (ASR) 1-best hypotheses are integrated in the computation of the connectionist temporal classification (CTC) loss function. The integration of multiple ASR hypotheses helps alleviating the impact of errors in the ASR hypotheses to the computation of the CTC loss when ASR hypotheses are used. When being applied in semi-supervised adaptation scenarios where part of the adaptation data do not have labels, the CTC loss of the proposed method is computed from different ASR 1-best hypotheses obtained by decoding the unlabeled adaptation data. Experiments are performed in clean and multi-condition training scenarios where the CTC-based end-to-end ASR systems are trained on Wall Street Journal (WSJ) clean training data and CHiME-4 multi-condition training data, respectively, and tested on Aurora-4 test data. The proposed adaptation method yields 6.6% and 5.8% relative word error rate (WER) reductions in clean and multi-condition training scenarios, respectively, compared to a baseline system which is adapted with part of the adaptation data having manual transcriptions using back-propagation fine-tuning."
Scaling sparsemax based channel selection for speech recognition with ad-hoc microphone arrays,"Recently, speech recognition with ad-hoc microphone arrays has received much attention. It is known that channel selection is an important problem of ad-hoc microphone arrays, however, this topic seems far from explored in speech recognition yet, particularly with a large-scale ad-hoc microphone array. To address this problem, we propose a Scaling Sparsemax algorithm for the channel selection problem of the speech recognition with large-scale ad-hoc microphone arrays. Specifically, we first replace the conventional Softmax operator in the stream attention mechanism of a multichannel end-to-end speech recognition system with Sparsemax, which conducts channel selection by forcing the channel weights of noisy channels to zero. Because Sparsemax punishes the weights of many channels to zero harshly, we propose Scaling Sparsemax which punishes the channels mildly by setting the weights of very noisy channels to zero only. Experimental results with ad-hoc microphone arrays of over 30 channels under the conformer speech recognition architecture show that the proposed Scaling Sparsemax yields a word error rate of over 30% lower than Softmax on simulation data sets, and over 20% lower on semi-real data sets, in test scenarios with both matched and mismatched channel numbers."
Quantifying Bias in Automatic Speech Recognition,"Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems promise to deliver objective interpretation of human speech. Practice and recent evidence suggests that the state-of-the-art (SotA) ASRs struggle with the large variation in speech due to e.g., gender, age, speech impairment, race, and accents. Many factors can cause the bias of an ASR system. Our overarching goal is to uncover bias in ASR systems to work towards proactive bias mitigation in ASR. This paper is a first step towards this goal and systematically quantifies the bias of a Dutch SotA ASR system against gender, age, regional accents and non-native accents. Word error rates are compared, and an in-depth phoneme-level error analysis is conducted to understand where bias is occurring. We primarily focus on bias due to articulation differences in the dataset. Based on our findings, we suggest bias mitigation strategies for ASR development."
Residual Energy-Based Models for End-to-End Speech Recognition,"End-to-end models with auto-regressive decoders have shown impressive results for automatic speech recognition (ASR). These models formulate the sequence-level probability as a product of the conditional probabilities of all individual tokens given their histories. However, the performance of locally normalised models can be sub-optimal because of factors such as exposure bias. Consequently, the model distribution differs from the underlying data distribution. In this paper, the residual energy-based model (R-EBM) is proposed to complement the auto-regressive ASR model to close the gap between the two distributions. Meanwhile, R-EBMs can also be regarded as utterance-level confidence estimators, which may benefit many downstream tasks. Experiments on a 100hr LibriSpeech dataset show that R-EBMs can reduce the word error rates (WERs) by 8.2%/6.7% while improving areas under precision-recall curves of confidence scores by 12.6%/28.4% on test-clean/test-other sets. Furthermore, on a state-of-the-art model using self-supervised learning (wav2vec 2.0), R-EBMs still significantly improves both the WER and confidence estimation performance."
Fine-tuning of Pre-trained End-to-end Speech Recognition with Generative Adversarial Networks,"Adversarial training of end-to-end (E2E) ASR systems using generative adversarial networks (GAN) has recently been explored for low-resource ASR corpora. GANs help to learn the true data representation through a two-player min-max game. However, training an E2E ASR model using a large ASR corpus with a GAN framework has never been explored, because it might take excessively long time due to high-variance gradient updates and face convergence issues. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for fine-tuning a pre-trained ASR model using the GAN objective where the ASR model acts as a generator and a discriminator tries to distinguish the ASR output from the real data. Since the ASR model is pre-trained, we hypothesize that the ASR model output (soft distribution vectors) helps to get higher scores from the discriminator and makes the task of the discriminator harder within our GAN framework, which in turn improves the performance of the ASR model in the fine-tuning stage. Here, the pre-trained ASR model is fine-tuned adversarially against the discriminator using an additional adversarial loss. Experiments on full LibriSpeech dataset show that our proposed approach outperforms baselines and conventional GAN-based adversarial models."
Hallucination of speech recognition errors with sequence to sequence learning,"Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is an imperfect process that results in certain mismatches in ASR output text when compared to plain written text or transcriptions. When plain text data is to be used to train systems for spoken language understanding or ASR, a proven strategy to reduce said mismatch and prevent degradations, is to hallucinate what the ASR outputs would be given a gold transcription. Prior work in this domain has focused on modeling errors at the phonetic level, while using a lexicon to convert the phones to words, usually accompanied by an FST Language model. We present novel end-to-end models to directly predict hallucinated ASR word sequence outputs, conditioning on an input word sequence as well as a corresponding phoneme sequence. This improves prior published results for recall of errors from an in-domain ASR system's transcription of unseen data, as well as an out-of-domain ASR system's transcriptions of audio from an unrelated task, while additionally exploring an in-between scenario when limited characterization data from the test ASR system is obtainable. To verify the extrinsic validity of the method, we also use our hallucinated ASR errors to augment training for a spoken question classifier, finding that they enable robustness to real ASR errors in a downstream task, when scarce or even zero task-specific audio was available at train-time."
Transfer learning from High-Resource to Low-Resource Language Improves Speech Affect Recognition Classification Accuracy,"Speech Affect Recognition is a problem of extracting emotional affects from audio data. Low resource languages corpora are rear and affect recognition is a difficult task in cross-corpus settings. We present an approach in which the model is trained on high resource language and fine-tune to recognize affects in low resource language. We train the model in same corpus setting on SAVEE, EMOVO, Urdu, and IEMOCAP by achieving baseline accuracy of 60.45, 68.05, 80.34, and 56.58 percent respectively. For capturing the diversity of affects in languages cross-corpus evaluations are discussed in detail. We find that accuracy improves by adding the domain target data into the training data. Finally, we show that performance is improved for low resource language speech affect recognition by achieving the UAR OF 69.32 and 68.2 for Urdu and Italian speech affects."
SoK: A Modularized Approach to Study the Security of Automatic Speech Recognition Systems,"With the wide use of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) in applications such as human machine interaction, simultaneous interpretation, audio transcription, etc., its security protection becomes increasingly important. Although recent studies have brought to light the weaknesses of popular ASR systems that enable out-of-band signal attack, adversarial attack, etc., and further proposed various remedies (signal smoothing, adversarial training, etc.), a systematic understanding of ASR security (both attacks and defenses) is still missing, especially on how realistic such threats are and how general existing protection could be. In this paper, we present our systematization of knowledge for ASR security and provide a comprehensive taxonomy for existing work based on a modularized workflow. More importantly, we align the research in this domain with that on security in Image Recognition System (IRS), which has been extensively studied, using the domain knowledge in the latter to help understand where we stand in the former. Generally, both IRS and ASR are perceptual systems. Their similarities allow us to systematically study existing literature in ASR security based on the spectrum of attacks and defense solutions proposed for IRS, and pinpoint the directions of more advanced attacks and the directions potentially leading to more effective protection in ASR. In contrast, their differences, especially the complexity of ASR compared with IRS, help us learn unique challenges and opportunities in ASR security. Particularly, our experimental study shows that transfer learning across ASR models is feasible, even in the absence of knowledge about models (even their types) and training data."
Contextual Biasing of Language Models for Speech Recognition in Goal-Oriented Conversational Agents,"Goal-oriented conversational interfaces are designed to accomplish specific tasks and typically have interactions that tend to span multiple turns adhering to a pre-defined structure and a goal. However, conventional neural language models (NLM) in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems are mostly trained sentence-wise with limited context. In this paper, we explore different ways to incorporate context into a LSTM based NLM in order to model long range dependencies and improve speech recognition. Specifically, we use context carry over across multiple turns and use lexical contextual cues such as system dialog act from Natural Language Understanding (NLU) models and the user provided structure of the chatbot. We also propose a new architecture that utilizes context embeddings derived from BERT on sample utterances provided during inference time. Our experiments show a word error rate (WER) relative reduction of 7% over non-contextual utterance-level NLM rescorers on goal-oriented audio datasets."
Advancing RNN Transducer Technology for Speech Recognition,"We investigate a set of techniques for RNN Transducers (RNN-Ts) that were instrumental in lowering the word error rate on three different tasks (Switchboard 300 hours, conversational Spanish 780 hours and conversational Italian 900 hours). The techniques pertain to architectural changes, speaker adaptation, language model fusion, model combination and general training recipe. First, we introduce a novel multiplicative integration of the encoder and prediction network vectors in the joint network (as opposed to additive). Second, we discuss the applicability of i-vector speaker adaptation to RNN-Ts in conjunction with data perturbation. Third, we explore the effectiveness of the recently proposed density ratio language model fusion for these tasks. Last but not least, we describe the other components of our training recipe and their effect on recognition performance. We report a 5.9% and 12.5% word error rate on the Switchboard and CallHome test sets of the NIST Hub5 2000 evaluation and a 12.7% WER on the Mozilla CommonVoice Italian test set."
An Asynchronous WFST-Based Decoder For Automatic Speech Recognition,"We introduce asynchronous dynamic decoder, which adopts an efficient A* algorithm to incorporate big language models in the one-pass decoding for large vocabulary continuous speech recognition. Unlike standard one-pass decoding with on-the-fly composition decoder which might induce a significant computation overhead, the asynchronous dynamic decoder has a novel design where it has two fronts, with one performing ""exploration"" and the other ""backfill"". The computation of the two fronts alternates in the decoding process, resulting in more effective pruning than the standard one-pass decoding with an on-the-fly composition decoder. Experiments show that the proposed decoder works notably faster than the standard one-pass decoding with on-the-fly composition decoder, while the acceleration will be more obvious with the increment of data complexity."
EmoNet: A Transfer Learning Framework for Multi-Corpus Speech Emotion Recognition,"In this manuscript, the topic of multi-corpus Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is approached from a deep transfer learning perspective. A large corpus of emotional speech data, EmoSet, is assembled from a number of existing SER corpora. In total, EmoSet contains 84181 audio recordings from 26 SER corpora with a total duration of over 65 hours. The corpus is then utilised to create a novel framework for multi-corpus speech emotion recognition, namely EmoNet. A combination of a deep ResNet architecture and residual adapters is transferred from the field of multi-domain visual recognition to multi-corpus SER on EmoSet. Compared against two suitable baselines and more traditional training and transfer settings for the ResNet, the residual adapter approach enables parameter efficient training of a multi-domain SER model on all 26 corpora. A shared model with only 3.5 times the number of parameters of a model trained on a single database leads to increased performance for 21 of the 26 corpora in EmoSet. Measured by McNemar's test, these improvements are further significant for ten datasets at p<0.05 while there are just two corpora that see only significant decreases across the residual adapter transfer experiments. Finally, we make our EmoNet framework publicly available for users and developers at https://github.com/EIHW/EmoNet. EmoNet provides an extensive command line interface which is comprehensively documented and can be used in a variety of multi-corpus transfer learning settings."
XLST: Cross-lingual Self-training to Learn Multilingual Representation for Low Resource Speech Recognition,"In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised multilingual representation learning framework, called cross-lingual self-training (XLST). XLST is able to utilize a small amount of annotated data from high-resource languages to improve the representation learning on multilingual un-annotated data. Specifically, XLST uses a supervised trained model to produce initial representations and another model to learn from them, by maximizing the similarity between output embeddings of these two models. Furthermore, the moving average mechanism and multi-view data augmentation are employed, which are experimentally shown to be crucial to XLST. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted on the CommonVoice corpus to evaluate the effectiveness of XLST. Results on 5 downstream low-resource ASR tasks shows that our multilingual pretrained model achieves relatively 18.6% PER reduction over the state-of-the-art self-supervised method, with leveraging additional 100 hours of annotated English data."
OkwuGbé: End-to-End Speech Recognition for Fon and Igbo,"Language is inherent and compulsory for human communication. Whether expressed in a written or spoken way, it ensures understanding between people of the same and different regions. With the growing awareness and effort to include more low-resourced languages in NLP research, African languages have recently been a major subject of research in machine translation, and other text-based areas of NLP. However, there is still very little comparable research in speech recognition for African languages. Interestingly, some of the unique properties of African languages affecting NLP, like their diacritical and tonal complexities, have a major root in their speech, suggesting that careful speech interpretation could provide more intuition on how to deal with the linguistic complexities of African languages for text-based NLP. OkwuGbé is a step towards building speech recognition systems for African low-resourced languages. Using Fon and Igbo as our case study, we conduct a comprehensive linguistic analysis of each language and describe the creation of end-to-end, deep neural network-based speech recognition models for both languages. We present a state-of-art ASR model for Fon, as well as benchmark ASR model results for Igbo. Our linguistic analyses (for Fon and Igbo) provide valuable insights and guidance into the creation of speech recognition models for other African low-resourced languages, as well as guide future NLP research for Fon and Igbo. The Fon and Igbo models source code have been made publicly available."
Dynamic Acoustic Unit Augmentation With BPE-Dropout for Low-Resource End-to-End Speech Recognition,"With the rapid development of speech assistants, adapting server-intended automatic speech recognition (ASR) solutions to a direct device has become crucial. Researchers and industry prefer to use end-to-end ASR systems for on-device speech recognition tasks. This is because end-to-end systems can be made resource-efficient while maintaining a higher quality compared to hybrid systems. However, building end-to-end models requires a significant amount of speech data. Another challenging task associated with speech assistants is personalization, which mainly lies in handling out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. In this work, we consider building an effective end-to-end ASR system in low-resource setups with a high OOV rate, embodied in Babel Turkish and Babel Georgian tasks. To address the aforementioned problems, we propose a method of dynamic acoustic unit augmentation based on the BPE-dropout technique. It non-deterministically tokenizes utterances to extend the token's contexts and to regularize their distribution for the model's recognition of unseen words. It also reduces the need for optimal subword vocabulary size search. The technique provides a steady improvement in regular and personalized (OOV-oriented) speech recognition tasks (at least 6% relative WER and 25% relative F-score) at no additional computational cost. Owing to the use of BPE-dropout, our monolingual Turkish Conformer established a competitive result with 22.2% character error rate (CER) and 38.9% word error rate (WER), which is close to the best published multilingual system."
Transfer Learning based Speech Affect Recognition in Urdu,"It has been established that Speech Affect Recognition for low resource languages is a difficult task. Here we present a Transfer learning based Speech Affect Recognition approach in which: we pre-train a model for high resource language affect recognition task and fine tune the parameters for low resource language using Deep Residual Network. Here we use standard four data sets to demonstrate that transfer learning can solve the problem of data scarcity for Affect Recognition task. We demonstrate that our approach is efficient by achieving 74.7 percent UAR on RAVDESS as source and Urdu data set as a target. Through an ablation study, we have identified that pre-trained model adds most of the features information, improvement in results and solves less data issues. Using this knowledge, we have also experimented on SAVEE and EMO-DB data set by setting Urdu as target language where only 400 utterances of data is available. This approach achieves high Unweighted Average Recall (UAR) when compared with existing algorithms."
Speech Emotion Recognition using Semantic Information,"Speech emotion recognition is a crucial problem manifesting in a multitude of applications such as human computer interaction and education. Although several advancements have been made in the recent years, especially with the advent of Deep Neural Networks (DNN), most of the studies in the literature fail to consider the semantic information in the speech signal. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that can capture both the semantic and the paralinguistic information in the signal. In particular, our framework is comprised of a semantic feature extractor, that captures the semantic information, and a paralinguistic feature extractor, that captures the paralinguistic information. Both semantic and paraliguistic features are then combined to a unified representation using a novel attention mechanism. The unified feature vector is passed through a LSTM to capture the temporal dynamics in the signal, before the final prediction. To validate the effectiveness of our framework, we use the popular SEWA dataset of the AVEC challenge series and compare with the three winning papers. Our model provides state-of-the-art results in the valence and liking dimensions."
Alignment Knowledge Distillation for Online Streaming Attention-based Speech Recognition,"This article describes an efficient training method for online streaming attention-based encoder-decoder (AED) automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. AED models have achieved competitive performance in offline scenarios by jointly optimizing all components. They have recently been extended to an online streaming framework via models such as monotonic chunkwise attention (MoChA). However, the elaborate attention calculation process is not robust for long-form speech utterances. Moreover, the sequence-level training objective and time-restricted streaming encoder cause a nonnegligible delay in token emission during inference. To address these problems, we propose CTC synchronous training (CTC-ST), in which CTC alignments are leveraged as a reference for token boundaries to enable a MoChA model to learn optimal monotonic input-output alignments. We formulate a purely end-to-end training objective to synchronize the boundaries of MoChA to those of CTC. The CTC model shares an encoder with the MoChA model to enhance the encoder representation. Moreover, the proposed method provides alignment information learned in the CTC branch to the attention-based decoder. Therefore, CTC-ST can be regarded as self-distillation of alignment knowledge from CTC to MoChA. Experimental evaluations on a variety of benchmark datasets show that the proposed method significantly reduces recognition errors and emission latency simultaneously. The robustness to long-form and noisy speech is also demonstrated. We compare CTC-ST with several methods that distill alignment knowledge from a hybrid ASR system and show that the CTC-ST can achieve a comparable tradeoff of accuracy and latency without relying on external alignment information. The best MoChA system shows recognition accuracy comparable to that of RNN-transducer (RNN-T) while achieving lower emission latency."
"Brain Signals to Rescue Aphasia, Apraxia and Dysarthria Speech Recognition","In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based algorithm to improve the performance of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems for aphasia, apraxia, and dysarthria speech by utilizing electroencephalography (EEG) features recorded synchronously with aphasia, apraxia, and dysarthria speech. We demonstrate a significant decoding performance improvement by more than 50\% during test time for isolated speech recognition task and we also provide preliminary results indicating performance improvement for the more challenging continuous speech recognition task by utilizing EEG features. The results presented in this paper show the first step towards demonstrating the possibility of utilizing non-invasive neural signals to design a real-time robust speech prosthetic for stroke survivors recovering from aphasia, apraxia, and dysarthria. Our aphasia, apraxia, and dysarthria speech-EEG data set will be released to the public to help further advance this interesting and crucial research."
Silent versus modal multi-speaker speech recognition from ultrasound and video,"We investigate multi-speaker speech recognition from ultrasound images of the tongue and video images of the lips. We train our systems on imaging data from modal speech, and evaluate on matched test sets of two speaking modes: silent and modal speech. We observe that silent speech recognition from imaging data underperforms compared to modal speech recognition, likely due to a speaking-mode mismatch between training and testing. We improve silent speech recognition performance using techniques that address the domain mismatch, such as fMLLR and unsupervised model adaptation. We also analyse the properties of silent and modal speech in terms of utterance duration and the size of the articulatory space. To estimate the articulatory space, we compute the convex hull of tongue splines, extracted from ultrasound tongue images. Overall, we observe that the duration of silent speech is longer than that of modal speech, and that silent speech covers a smaller articulatory space than modal speech. Although these two properties are statistically significant across speaking modes, they do not directly correlate with word error rates from speech recognition."
MixSpeech: Data Augmentation for Low-resource Automatic Speech Recognition,"In this paper, we propose MixSpeech, a simple yet effective data augmentation method based on mixup for automatic speech recognition (ASR). MixSpeech trains an ASR model by taking a weighted combination of two different speech features (e.g., mel-spectrograms or MFCC) as the input, and recognizing both text sequences, where the two recognition losses use the same combination weight. We apply MixSpeech on two popular end-to-end speech recognition models including LAS (Listen, Attend and Spell) and Transformer, and conduct experiments on several low-resource datasets including TIMIT, WSJ, and HKUST. Experimental results show that MixSpeech achieves better accuracy than the baseline models without data augmentation, and outperforms a strong data augmentation method SpecAugment on these recognition tasks. Specifically, MixSpeech outperforms SpecAugment with a relative PER improvement of 10.6\% on TIMIT dataset, and achieves a strong WER of 4.7\% on WSJ dataset."
Unidirectional Memory-Self-Attention Transducer for Online Speech Recognition,"Self-attention models have been successfully applied in end-to-end speech recognition systems, which greatly improve the performance of recognition accuracy. However, such attention-based models cannot be used in online speech recognition, because these models usually have to utilize a whole acoustic sequences as inputs. A common method is restricting the field of attention sights by a fixed left and right window, which makes the computation costs manageable yet also introduces performance degradation. In this paper, we propose Memory-Self-Attention (MSA), which adds history information into the Restricted-Self-Attention unit. MSA only needs localtime features as inputs, and efficiently models long temporal contexts by attending memory states. Meanwhile, recurrent neural network transducer (RNN-T) has proved to be a great approach for online ASR tasks, because the alignments of RNN-T are local and monotonic. We propose a novel network structure, called Memory-Self-Attention (MSA) Transducer. Both encoder and decoder of the MSA Transducer contain the proposed MSA unit. The experiments demonstrate that our proposed models improve WER results than Restricted-Self-Attention models by 13.5 on WSJ and 7.1 on SWBD datasets relatively, and without much computation costs increase."
Memory-efficient Speech Recognition on Smart Devices,"Recurrent transducer models have emerged as a promising solution for speech recognition on the current and next generation smart devices. The transducer models provide competitive accuracy within a reasonable memory footprint alleviating the memory capacity constraints in these devices. However, these models access parameters from off-chip memory for every input time step which adversely effects device battery life and limits their usability on low-power devices.  We address transducer model's memory access concerns by optimizing their model architecture and designing novel recurrent cell designs. We demonstrate that i) model's energy cost is dominated by accessing model weights from off-chip memory, ii) transducer model architecture is pivotal in determining the number of accesses to off-chip memory and just model size is not a good proxy, iii) our transducer model optimizations and novel recurrent cell reduces off-chip memory accesses by 4.5x and model size by 2x with minimal accuracy impact."
"End-to-End Dereverberation, Beamforming, and Speech Recognition with Improved Numerical Stability and Advanced Frontend","Recently, the end-to-end approach has been successfully applied to multi-speaker speech separation and recognition in both single-channel and multichannel conditions. However, severe performance degradation is still observed in the reverberant and noisy scenarios, and there is still a large performance gap between anechoic and reverberant conditions. In this work, we focus on the multichannel multi-speaker reverberant condition, and propose to extend our previous framework for end-to-end dereverberation, beamforming, and speech recognition with improved numerical stability and advanced frontend subnetworks including voice activity detection like masks. The techniques significantly stabilize the end-to-end training process. The experiments on the spatialized wsj1-2mix corpus show that the proposed system achieves about 35% WER relative reduction compared to our conventional multi-channel E2E ASR system, and also obtains decent speech dereverberation and separation performance (SDR=12.5 dB) in the reverberant multi-speaker condition while trained only with the ASR criterion."
Evolutionary optimization of contexts for phonetic correction in speech recognition systems,"Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is an area of growing academic and commercial interest due to the high demand for applications that use it to provide a natural communication method. It is common for general purpose ASR systems to fail in applications that use a domain-specific language. Various strategies have been used to reduce the error, such as providing a context that modifies the language model and post-processing correction methods. This article explores the use of an evolutionary process to generate an optimized context for a specific application domain, as well as different correction techniques based on phonetic distance metrics. The results show the viability of a genetic algorithm as a tool for context optimization, which, added to a post-processing correction based on phonetic representations, can reduce the errors on the recognized speech."
Generating Human Readable Transcript for Automatic Speech Recognition with Pre-trained Language Model,"Modern Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems can achieve high performance in terms of recognition accuracy. However, a perfectly accurate transcript still can be challenging to read due to disfluency, filter words, and other errata common in spoken communication. Many downstream tasks and human readers rely on the output of the ASR system; therefore, errors introduced by the speaker and ASR system alike will be propagated to the next task in the pipeline. In this work, we propose an ASR post-processing model that aims to transform the incorrect and noisy ASR output into a readable text for humans and downstream tasks. We leverage the Metadata Extraction (MDE) corpus to construct a task-specific dataset for our study. Since the dataset is small, we propose a novel data augmentation method and use a two-stage training strategy to fine-tune the RoBERTa pre-trained model. On the constructed test set, our model outperforms a production two-step pipeline-based post-processing method by a large margin of 13.26 on readability-aware WER (RA-WER) and 17.53 on BLEU metrics. Human evaluation also demonstrates that our method can generate more human-readable transcripts than the baseline method."
The Use of Voice Source Features for Sung Speech Recognition,"In this paper, we ask whether vocal source features (pitch, shimmer, jitter, etc) can improve the performance of automatic sung speech recognition, arguing that conclusions previously drawn from spoken speech studies may not be valid in the sung speech domain. We first use a parallel singing/speaking corpus (NUS-48E) to illustrate differences in sung vs spoken voicing characteristics including pitch range, syllables duration, vibrato, jitter and shimmer. We then use this analysis to inform speech recognition experiments on the sung speech DSing corpus, using a state of the art acoustic model and augmenting conventional features with various voice source parameters. Experiments are run with three standard (increasingly large) training sets, DSing1 (15.1 hours), DSing3 (44.7 hours) and DSing30 (149.1 hours). Pitch combined with degree of voicing produces a significant decrease in WER from 38.1% to 36.7% when training with DSing1 however smaller decreases in WER observed when training with the larger more varied DSing3 and DSing30 sets were not seen to be statistically significant. Voicing quality characteristics did not improve recognition performance although analysis suggests that they do contribute to an improved discrimination between voiced/unvoiced phoneme pairs."
"The Accented English Speech Recognition Challenge 2020: Open Datasets, Tracks, Baselines, Results and Methods","The variety of accents has posed a big challenge to speech recognition. The Accented English Speech Recognition Challenge (AESRC2020) is designed for providing a common testbed and promoting accent-related research. Two tracks are set in the challenge -- English accent recognition (track 1) and accented English speech recognition (track 2). A set of 160 hours of accented English speech collected from 8 countries is released with labels as the training set. Another 20 hours of speech without labels is later released as the test set, including two unseen accents from another two countries used to test the model generalization ability in track 2. We also provide baseline systems for the participants. This paper first reviews the released dataset, track setups, baselines and then summarizes the challenge results and major techniques used in the submissions."
Do End-to-End Speech Recognition Models Care About Context?,"The two most common paradigms for end-to-end speech recognition are connectionist temporal classification (CTC) and attention-based encoder-decoder (AED) models. It has been argued that the latter is better suited for learning an implicit language model. We test this hypothesis by measuring temporal context sensitivity and evaluate how the models perform when we constrain the amount of contextual information in the audio input. We find that the AED model is indeed more context sensitive, but that the gap can be closed by adding self-attention to the CTC model. Furthermore, the two models perform similarly when contextual information is constrained. Finally, in contrast to previous research, our results show that the CTC model is highly competitive on WSJ and LibriSpeech without the help of an external language model."
End-to-End Neural Systems for Automatic Children Speech Recognition: An Empirical Study,"A key desiderata for inclusive and accessible speech recognition technology is ensuring its robust performance to children's speech. Notably, this includes the rapidly advancing neural network based end-to-end speech recognition systems. Children speech recognition is more challenging due to the larger intra-inter speaker variability in terms of acoustic and linguistic characteristics compared to adult speech. Furthermore, the lack of adequate and appropriate children speech resources adds to the challenge of designing robust end-to-end neural architectures. This study provides a critical assessment of automatic children speech recognition through an empirical study of contemporary state-of-the-art end-to-end speech recognition systems. Insights are provided on the aspects of training data requirements, adaptation on children data, and the effect of children age, utterance lengths, different architectures and loss functions for end-to-end systems and role of language models on the speech recognition performance."
AISPEECH-SJTU accent identification system for the Accented English Speech Recognition Challenge,"This paper describes the AISpeech-SJTU system for the accent identification track of the Interspeech-2020 Accented English Speech Recognition Challenge. In this challenge track, only 160-hour accented English data collected from 8 countries and the auxiliary Librispeech dataset are provided for training. To build an accurate and robust accent identification system, we explore the whole system pipeline in detail. First, we introduce the ASR based phone posteriorgram (PPG) feature to accent identification and verify its efficacy. Then, a novel TTS based approach is carefully designed to augment the very limited accent training data for the first time. Finally, we propose the test time augmentation and embedding fusion schemes to further improve the system performance. Our final system is ranked first in the challenge and outperforms all the other participants by a large margin. The submitted system achieves 83.63\% average accuracy on the challenge evaluation data, ahead of the others by more than 10\% in absolute terms."
Gaussian Kernelized Self-Attention for Long Sequence Data and Its Application to CTC-based Speech Recognition,"Self-attention (SA) based models have recently achieved significant performance improvements in hybrid and end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems owing to their flexible context modeling capability. However, it is also known that the accuracy degrades when applying SA to long sequence data. This is mainly due to the length mismatch between the inference and training data because the training data are usually divided into short segments for efficient training. To mitigate this mismatch, we propose a new architecture, which is a variant of the Gaussian kernel, which itself is a shift-invariant kernel. First, we mathematically demonstrate that self-attention with shared weight parameters for queries and keys is equivalent to a normalized kernel function. By replacing this kernel function with the proposed Gaussian kernel, the architecture becomes completely shift-invariant with the relative position information embedded using a frame indexing technique. The proposed Gaussian kernelized SA was applied to connectionist temporal classification (CTC) based ASR. An experimental evaluation with the Corpus of Spontaneous Japanese (CSJ) and TEDLIUM 3 benchmarks shows that the proposed SA achieves a significant improvement in accuracy (e.g., from 24.0% WER to 6.0% in CSJ) in long sequence data without any windowing techniques."
Echo State Speech Recognition,"We propose automatic speech recognition (ASR) models inspired by echo state network (ESN), in which a subset of recurrent neural networks (RNN) layers in the models are randomly initialized and untrained. Our study focuses on RNN-T and Conformer models, and we show that model quality does not drop even when the decoder is fully randomized. Furthermore, such models can be trained more efficiently as the decoders do not require to be updated. By contrast, randomizing encoders hurts model quality, indicating that optimizing encoders and learn proper representations for acoustic inputs are more vital for speech recognition. Overall, we challenge the common practice of training ASR models for all components, and demonstrate that ESN-based models can perform equally well but enable more efficient training and storage than fully-trainable counterparts."
Fundamental Frequency Feature Normalization and Data Augmentation for Child Speech Recognition,"Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems for young children are needed due to the importance of age-appropriate educational technology. Because of the lack of publicly available young child speech data, feature extraction strategies such as feature normalization and data augmentation must be considered to successfully train child ASR systems. This study proposes a novel technique for child ASR using both feature normalization and data augmentation methods based on the relationship between formants and fundamental frequency (f_o). Both the f_o feature normalization and data augmentation techniques are implemented as a frequency shift in the Mel domain. These techniques are evaluated on a child read speech ASR task. Child ASR systems are trained by adapting a BLSTM-based acoustic model trained on adult speech. Using both f_o normalization and data augmentation results in a relative word error rate (WER) improvement of 19.3% over the baseline when tested on the OGI Kids' Speech Corpus, and the resulting child ASR system achieves the best WER currently reported on this corpus."
ATCSpeechNet: A multilingual end-to-end speech recognition framework for air traffic control systems,"In this paper, a multilingual end-to-end framework, called as ATCSpeechNet, is proposed to tackle the issue of translating communication speech into human-readable text in air traffic control (ATC) systems. In the proposed framework, we focus on integrating the multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) into one model, in which an end-to-end paradigm is developed to convert speech waveform into text directly, without any feature engineering or lexicon. In order to make up for the deficiency of the handcrafted feature engineering caused by ATC challenges, a speech representation learning (SRL) network is proposed to capture robust and discriminative speech representations from the raw wave. The self-supervised training strategy is adopted to optimize the SRL network from unlabeled data, and further to predict the speech features, i.e., wave-to-feature. An end-to-end architecture is improved to complete the ASR task, in which a grapheme-based modeling unit is applied to address the multilingual ASR issue. Facing the problem of small transcribed samples in the ATC domain, an unsupervised approach with mask prediction is applied to pre-train the backbone network of the ASR model on unlabeled data by a feature-to-feature process. Finally, by integrating the SRL with ASR, an end-to-end multilingual ASR framework is formulated in a supervised manner, which is able to translate the raw wave into text in one model, i.e., wave-to-text. Experimental results on the ATCSpeech corpus demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves a high performance with a very small labeled corpus and less resource consumption, only 4.20% label error rate on the 58-hour transcribed corpus. Compared to the baseline model, the proposed approach obtains over 100% relative performance improvement which can be further enhanced with the increasing of the size of the transcribed samples."
End-to-End Automatic Speech Recognition with Deep Mutual Learning,"This paper is the first study to apply deep mutual learning (DML) to end-to-end ASR models. In DML, multiple models are trained simultaneously and collaboratively by mimicking each other throughout the training process, which helps to attain the global optimum and prevent models from making over-confident predictions. While previous studies applied DML to simple multi-class classification problems, there are no studies that have used it on more complex sequence-to-sequence mapping problems. For this reason, this paper presents a method to apply DML to state-of-the-art Transformer-based end-to-end ASR models. In particular, we propose to combine DML with recent representative training techniques. i.e., label smoothing, scheduled sampling, and SpecAugment, each of which are essential for powerful end-to-end ASR models. We expect that these training techniques work well with DML because DML has complementary characteristics. We experimented with two setups for Japanese ASR tasks: large-scale modeling and compact modeling. We demonstrate that DML improves the ASR performance of both modeling setups compared with conventional learning methods including knowledge distillation. We also show that combining DML with the existing training techniques effectively improves ASR performance."
Improving speech recognition models with small samples for air traffic control systems,"In the domain of air traffic control (ATC) systems, efforts to train a practical automatic speech recognition (ASR) model always faces the problem of small training samples since the collection and annotation of speech samples are expert- and domain-dependent task. In this work, a novel training approach based on pretraining and transfer learning is proposed to address this issue, and an improved end-to-end deep learning model is developed to address the specific challenges of ASR in the ATC domain. An unsupervised pretraining strategy is first proposed to learn speech representations from unlabeled samples for a certain dataset. Specifically, a masking strategy is applied to improve the diversity of the sample without losing their general patterns. Subsequently, transfer learning is applied to fine-tune a pretrained or other optimized baseline models to finally achieves the supervised ASR task. By virtue of the common terminology used in the ATC domain, the transfer learning task can be regarded as a sub-domain adaption task, in which the transferred model is optimized using a joint corpus consisting of baseline samples and new transcribed samples from the target dataset. This joint corpus construction strategy enriches the size and diversity of the training samples, which is important for addressing the issue of the small transcribed corpus. In addition, speed perturbation is applied to augment the new transcribed samples to further improve the quality of the speech corpus. Three real ATC datasets are used to validate the proposed ASR model and training strategies. The experimental results demonstrate that the ASR performance is significantly improved on all three datasets, with an absolute character error rate only one-third of that achieved through the supervised training. The applicability of the proposed strategies to other ASR approaches is also validated."
Deep Learning based Multi-Source Localization with Source Splitting and its Effectiveness in Multi-Talker Speech Recognition,"Multi-source localization is an important and challenging technique for multi-talker conversation analysis. This paper proposes a novel supervised learning method using deep neural networks to estimate the direction of arrival (DOA) of all the speakers simultaneously from the audio mixture. At the heart of the proposal is a source splitting mechanism that creates source-specific intermediate representations inside the network. This allows our model to give source-specific posteriors as the output unlike the traditional multi-label classification approach. Existing deep learning methods perform a frame level prediction, whereas our approach performs an utterance level prediction by incorporating temporal selection and averaging inside the network to avoid post-processing. We also experiment with various loss functions and show that a variant of earth mover distance (EMD) is very effective in classifying DOA at a very high resolution by modeling inter-class relationships. In addition to using the prediction error as a metric for evaluating our localization model, we also establish its potency as a frontend with automatic speech recognition (ASR) as the downstream task. We convert the estimated DOAs into a feature suitable for ASR and pass it as an additional input feature to a strong multi-channel and multi-talker speech recognition baseline. This added input feature drastically improves the ASR performance and gives a word error rate (WER) of 6.3% on the evaluation data of our simulated noisy two speaker mixtures, while the baseline which doesn't use explicit localization input has a WER of 11.5%. We also perform ASR evaluation on real recordings with the overlapped set of the MC-WSJ-AV corpus in addition to simulated mixtures."
Personalization Strategies for End-to-End Speech Recognition Systems,"The recognition of personalized content, such as contact names, remains a challenging problem for end-to-end speech recognition systems. In this work, we demonstrate how first and second-pass rescoring strategies can be leveraged together to improve the recognition of such words. Following previous work, we use a shallow fusion approach to bias towards recognition of personalized content in the first-pass decoding. We show that such an approach can improve personalized content recognition by up to 16% with minimum degradation on the general use case. We describe a fast and scalable algorithm that enables our biasing models to remain at the word-level, while applying the biasing at the subword level. This has the advantage of not requiring the biasing models to be dependent on any subword symbol table. We also describe a novel second-pass de-biasing approach: used in conjunction with a first-pass shallow fusion that optimizes on oracle WER, we can achieve an additional 14% improvement on personalized content recognition, and even improve accuracy for the general use case by up to 2.5%."
Fast End-to-End Speech Recognition via Non-Autoregressive Models and Cross-Modal Knowledge Transferring from BERT,"Attention-based encoder-decoder (AED) models have achieved promising performance in speech recognition. However, because the decoder predicts text tokens (such as characters or words) in an autoregressive manner, it is difficult for an AED model to predict all tokens in parallel. This makes the inference speed relatively slow. We believe that because the encoder already captures the whole speech utterance, which has the token-level relationship implicitly, we can predict a token without explicitly autoregressive language modeling. When the prediction of a token does not rely on other tokens, the parallel prediction of all tokens in the sequence is realizable. Based on this idea, we propose a non-autoregressive speech recognition model called LASO (Listen Attentively, and Spell Once). The model consists of an encoder, a decoder, and a position dependent summarizer (PDS). The three modules are based on basic attention blocks. The encoder extracts high-level representations from the speech. The PDS uses positional encodings corresponding to tokens to convert the acoustic representations into token-level representations. The decoder further captures token-level relationships with the self-attention mechanism. At last, the probability distribution on the vocabulary is computed for each token position. Therefore, speech recognition is re-formulated as a position-wise classification problem. Further, we propose a cross-modal transfer learning method to refine semantics from a large-scale pre-trained language model BERT for improving the performance."
Jira: a Kurdish Speech Recognition System Designing and Building Speech Corpus and Pronunciation Lexicon,"In this paper, we introduce the first large vocabulary speech recognition system (LVSR) for the Central Kurdish language, named Jira. The Kurdish language is an Indo-European language spoken by more than 30 million people in several countries, but due to the lack of speech and text resources, there is no speech recognition system for this language. To fill this gap, we introduce the first speech corpus and pronunciation lexicon for the Kurdish language. Regarding speech corpus, we designed a sentence collection in which the ratio of di-phones in the collection resembles the real data of the Central Kurdish language. The designed sentences are uttered by 576 speakers in a controlled environment with noise-free microphones (called AsoSoft Speech-Office) and in Telegram social network environment using mobile phones (denoted as AsoSoft Speech-Crowdsourcing), resulted in 43.68 hours of speech. Besides, a test set including 11 different document topics is designed and recorded in two corresponding speech conditions (i.e., Office and Crowdsourcing). Furthermore, a 60K pronunciation lexicon is prepared in this research in which we faced several challenges and proposed solutions for them. The Kurdish language has several dialects and sub-dialects that results in many lexical variations. Our methods for script standardization of lexical variations and automatic pronunciation of the lexicon tokens are presented in detail. To setup the recognition engine, we used the Kaldi toolkit. A statistical tri-gram language model that is extracted from the AsoSoft text corpus is used in the system. Several standard recipes including HMM-based models (i.e., mono, tri1, tr2, tri2, tri3), SGMM, and DNN methods are used to generate the acoustic model. These methods are trained with AsoSoft Speech-Office and AsoSoft Speech-Crowdsourcing and a combination of them. The best performance achieved by the SGMM acoustic model which results in 13.9% of the average word error rate (on different document topics) and 4.9% for the general topic."
Thank you for Attention: A survey on Attention-based Artificial Neural Networks for Automatic Speech Recognition,"Attention is a very popular and effective mechanism in artificial neural network-based sequence-to-sequence models. In this survey paper, a comprehensive review of the different attention models used in developing automatic speech recognition systems is provided. The paper focuses on the development and evolution of attention models for offline and streaming speech recognition within recurrent neural network- and Transformer- based architectures."
Hybrid phonetic-neural model for correction in speech recognition systems,"Automatic speech recognition (ASR) is a relevant area in multiple settings because it provides a natural communication mechanism between applications and users. ASRs often fail in environments that use language specific to particular application domains. Some strategies have been explored to reduce errors in closed ASRs through post-processing, particularly automatic spell checking, and deep learning approaches. In this article, we explore using a deep neural network to refine the results of a phonetic correction algorithm applied to a telesales audio database. The results exhibit a reduction in the word error rate (WER), both in the original transcription and in the phonetic correction, which shows the viability of deep learning models together with post-processing correction strategies to reduce errors made by closed ASRs in specific language domains."
End-to-end Audio-visual Speech Recognition with Conformers,"In this work, we present a hybrid CTC/Attention model based on a ResNet-18 and Convolution-augmented transformer (Conformer), that can be trained in an end-to-end manner. In particular, the audio and visual encoders learn to extract features directly from raw pixels and audio waveforms, respectively, which are then fed to conformers and then fusion takes place via a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). The model learns to recognise characters using a combination of CTC and an attention mechanism. We show that end-to-end training, instead of using pre-computed visual features which is common in the literature, the use of a conformer, instead of a recurrent network, and the use of a transformer-based language model, significantly improve the performance of our model. We present results on the largest publicly available datasets for sentence-level speech recognition, Lip Reading Sentences 2 (LRS2) and Lip Reading Sentences 3 (LRS3), respectively. The results show that our proposed models raise the state-of-the-art performance by a large margin in audio-only, visual-only, and audio-visual experiments."
Contrastive Unsupervised Learning for Speech Emotion Recognition,"Speech emotion recognition (SER) is a key technology to enable more natural human-machine communication. However, SER has long suffered from a lack of public large-scale labeled datasets. To circumvent this problem, we investigate how unsupervised representation learning on unlabeled datasets can benefit SER. We show that the contrastive predictive coding (CPC) method can learn salient representations from unlabeled datasets, which improves emotion recognition performance. In our experiments, this method achieved state-of-the-art concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) performance for all emotion primitives (activation, valence, and dominance) on IEMOCAP. Additionally, on the MSP- Podcast dataset, our method obtained considerable performance improvements compared to baselines."
An Investigation of End-to-End Models for Robust Speech Recognition,"End-to-end models for robust automatic speech recognition (ASR) have not been sufficiently well-explored in prior work. With end-to-end models, one could choose to preprocess the input speech using speech enhancement techniques and train the model using enhanced speech. Another alternative is to pass the noisy speech as input and modify the model architecture to adapt to noisy speech. A systematic comparison of these two approaches for end-to-end robust ASR has not been attempted before. We address this gap and present a detailed comparison of speech enhancement-based techniques and three different model-based adaptation techniques covering data augmentation, multi-task learning, and adversarial learning for robust ASR. While adversarial learning is the best-performing technique on certain noise types, it comes at the cost of degrading clean speech WER. On other relatively stationary noise types, a new speech enhancement technique outperformed all the model-based adaptation techniques. This suggests that knowledge of the underlying noise type can meaningfully inform the choice of adaptation technique."
Fast Classification Learning with Neural Networks and Conceptors for Speech Recognition and Car Driving Maneuvers,"Recurrent neural networks are a powerful means in diverse applications. We show that, together with so-called conceptors, they also allow fast learning, in contrast to other deep learning methods. In addition, a relatively small number of examples suffices to train neural networks with high accuracy. We demonstrate this with two applications, namely speech recognition and detecting car driving maneuvers. We improve the state of the art by application-specific preparation techniques: For speech recognition, we use mel frequency cepstral coefficients leading to a compact representation of the frequency spectra, and detecting car driving maneuvers can be done without the commonly used polynomial interpolation, as our evaluation suggests."
Sparsification via Compressed Sensing for Automatic Speech Recognition,"In order to achieve high accuracy for machine learning (ML) applications, it is essential to employ models with a large number of parameters. Certain applications, such as Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), however, require real-time interactions with users, hence compelling the model to have as low latency as possible. Deploying large scale ML applications thus necessitates model quantization and compression, especially when running ML models on resource constrained devices. For example, by forcing some of the model weight values into zero, it is possible to apply zero-weight compression, which reduces both the model size and model reading time from the memory. In the literature, such methods are referred to as sparse pruning. The fundamental questions are when and which weights should be forced to zero, i.e. be pruned. In this work, we propose a compressed sensing based pruning (CSP) approach to effectively address those questions. By reformulating sparse pruning as a sparsity inducing and compression-error reduction dual problem, we introduce the classic compressed sensing process into the ML model training process. Using ASR task as an example, we show that CSP consistently outperforms existing approaches in the literature."
BembaSpeech: A Speech Recognition Corpus for the Bemba Language,"We present a preprocessed, ready-to-use automatic speech recognition corpus, BembaSpeech, consisting over 24 hours of read speech in the Bemba language, a written but low-resourced language spoken by over 30% of the population in Zambia. To assess its usefulness for training and testing ASR systems for Bemba, we train an end-to-end Bemba ASR system by fine-tuning a pre-trained DeepSpeech English model on the training portion of the BembaSpeech corpus. Our best model achieves a word error rate (WER) of 54.78%. The results show that the corpus can be used for building ASR systems for Bemba. The corpus and models are publicly released at https://github.com/csikasote/BembaSpeech."
Bayesian Transformer Language Models for Speech Recognition,"State-of-the-art neural language models (LMs) represented by Transformers are highly complex. Their use of fixed, deterministic parameter estimates fail to account for model uncertainty and lead to over-fitting and poor generalization when given limited training data. In order to address these issues, this paper proposes a full Bayesian learning framework for Transformer LM estimation. Efficient variational inference based approaches are used to estimate the latent parameter posterior distributions associated with different parts of the Transformer model architecture including multi-head self-attention, feed forward and embedding layers. Statistically significant word error rate (WER) reductions up to 0.5\% absolute (3.18\% relative) and consistent perplexity gains were obtained over the baseline Transformer LMs on state-of-the-art Switchboard corpus trained LF-MMI factored TDNN systems with i-Vector speaker adaptation. Performance improvements were also obtained on a cross domain LM adaptation task requiring porting a Transformer LM trained on the Switchboard and Fisher data to a low-resource DementiaBank elderly speech corpus."
Federated Acoustic Modeling For Automatic Speech Recognition,"Data privacy and protection is a crucial issue for any automatic speech recognition (ASR) service provider when dealing with clients. In this paper, we investigate federated acoustic modeling using data from multiple clients. A client's data is stored on a local data server and the clients communicate only model parameters with a central server, and not their data. The communication happens infrequently to reduce the communication cost. To mitigate the non-iid issue, client adaptive federated training (CAFT) is proposed to canonicalize data across clients. The experiments are carried out on 1,150 hours of speech data from multiple domains. Hybrid LSTM acoustic models are trained via federated learning and their performance is compared to traditional centralized acoustic model training. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed federated acoustic modeling strategy. We also show that CAFT can further improve the performance of the federated acoustic model."
Effects of Layer Freezing on Transferring a Speech Recognition System to Under-resourced Languages,"In this paper, we investigate the effect of layer freezing on the effectiveness of model transfer in the area of automatic speech recognition. We experiment with Mozilla's DeepSpeech architecture on German and Swiss German speech datasets and compare the results of either training from scratch vs. transferring a pre-trained model. We compare different layer freezing schemes and find that even freezing only one layer already significantly improves results."
Non-linear frequency warping using constant-Q transformation for speech emotion recognition,"In this work, we explore the constant-Q transform (CQT) for speech emotion recognition (SER). The CQT-based time-frequency analysis provides variable spectro-temporal resolution with higher frequency resolution at lower frequencies. Since lower-frequency regions of speech signal contain more emotion-related information than higher-frequency regions, the increased low-frequency resolution of CQT makes it more promising for SER than standard short-time Fourier transform (STFT). We present a comparative analysis of short-term acoustic features based on STFT and CQT for SER with deep neural network (DNN) as a back-end classifier. We optimize different parameters for both features. The CQT-based features outperform the STFT-based spectral features for SER experiments. Further experiments with cross-corpora evaluation demonstrate that the CQT-based systems provide better generalization with out-of-domain training data."
End-to-End Multi-Channel Transformer for Speech Recognition,"Transformers are powerful neural architectures that allow integrating different modalities using attention mechanisms. In this paper, we leverage the neural transformer architectures for multi-channel speech recognition systems, where the spectral and spatial information collected from different microphones are integrated using attention layers. Our multi-channel transformer network mainly consists of three parts: channel-wise self attention layers (CSA), cross-channel attention layers (CCA), and multi-channel encoder-decoder attention layers (EDA). The CSA and CCA layers encode the contextual relationship within and between channels and across time, respectively. The channel-attended outputs from CSA and CCA are then fed into the EDA layers to help decode the next token given the preceding ones. The experiments show that in a far-field in-house dataset, our method outperforms the baseline single-channel transformer, as well as the super-directive and neural beamformers cascaded with the transformers."
A bandit approach to curriculum generation for automatic speech recognition,The Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) task has been a challenging domain especially for low data scenarios with few audio examples. This is the main problem in training ASR systems on the data from low-resource or marginalized languages. In this paper we present an approach to mitigate the lack of training data by employing Automated Curriculum Learning in combination with an adversarial bandit approach inspired by Reinforcement learning. The goal of the approach is to optimize the training sequence of mini-batches ranked by the level of difficulty and compare the ASR performance metrics against the random training sequence and discrete curriculum. We test our approach on a truly low-resource language and show that the bandit framework has a good improvement over the baseline transfer-learning model.
Intermediate Loss Regularization for CTC-based Speech Recognition,"We present a simple and efficient auxiliary loss function for automatic speech recognition (ASR) based on the connectionist temporal classification (CTC) objective. The proposed objective, an intermediate CTC loss, is attached to an intermediate layer in the CTC encoder network. This intermediate CTC loss well regularizes CTC training and improves the performance requiring only small modification of the code and small and no overhead during training and inference, respectively. In addition, we propose to combine this intermediate CTC loss with stochastic depth training, and apply this combination to a recently proposed Conformer network. We evaluate the proposed method on various corpora, reaching word error rate (WER) 9.9% on the WSJ corpus and character error rate (CER) 5.2% on the AISHELL-1 corpus respectively, based on CTC greedy search without a language model. Especially, the AISHELL-1 task is comparable to other state-of-the-art ASR systems based on auto-regressive decoder with beam search."
Effects of Number of Filters of Convolutional Layers on Speech Recognition Model Accuracy,"Inspired by the progress of the End-to-End approach [1], this paper systematically studies the effects of Number of Filters of convolutional layers on the model prediction accuracy of CNN+RNN (Convolutional Neural Networks adding to Recurrent Neural Networks) for ASR Models (Automatic Speech Recognition). Experimental results show that only when the CNN Number of Filters exceeds a certain threshold value is adding CNN to RNN able to improve the performance of the CNN+RNN speech recognition model, otherwise some parameter ranges of CNN can render it useless to add the CNN to the RNN model. Our results show a strong dependency of word accuracy on the Number of Filters of convolutional layers. Based on the experimental results, the paper suggests a possible hypothesis of Sound-2-Vector Embedding (Convolutional Embedding) to explain the above observations.  Based on this Embedding hypothesis and the optimization of parameters, the paper develops an End-to-End speech recognition system which has a high word accuracy but also has a light model-weight. The developed LVCSR (Large Vocabulary Continuous Speech Recognition) model has achieved quite a high word accuracy of 90.2% only by its Acoustic Model alone, without any assistance from intermediate phonetic representation and any Language Model. Its acoustic model contains only 4.4 million weight parameters, compared to the 35~68 million acoustic-model weight parameters in DeepSpeech2 [2] (one of the top state-of-the-art LVCSR models) which can achieve a word accuracy of 91.5%. The light-weighted model is good for improving the transcribing computing efficiency and also useful for mobile devices, Driverless Vehicles, etc. Our model weight is reduced to ~10% the size of DeepSpeech2, but our model accuracy remains close to that of DeepSpeech2. If combined with a Language Model, our LVCSR system is able to achieve 91.5% word accuracy."
Speech Emotion Recognition with Multiscale Area Attention and Data Augmentation,"In Speech Emotion Recognition (SER), emotional characteristics often appear in diverse forms of energy patterns in spectrograms. Typical attention neural network classifiers of SER are usually optimized on a fixed attention granularity. In this paper, we apply multiscale area attention in a deep convolutional neural network to attend emotional characteristics with varied granularities and therefore the classifier can benefit from an ensemble of attentions with different scales. To deal with data sparsity, we conduct data augmentation with vocal tract length perturbation (VTLP) to improve the generalization capability of the classifier. Experiments are carried out on the Interactive Emotional Dyadic Motion Capture (IEMOCAP) dataset. We achieved 79.34% weighted accuracy (WA) and 77.54% unweighted accuracy (UA), which, to the best of our knowledge, is the state of the art on this dataset."
The Multilingual TEDx Corpus for Speech Recognition and Translation,"We present the Multilingual TEDx corpus, built to support speech recognition (ASR) and speech translation (ST) research across many non-English source languages. The corpus is a collection of audio recordings from TEDx talks in 8 source languages. We segment transcripts into sentences and align them to the source-language audio and target-language translations. The corpus is released along with open-sourced code enabling extension to new talks and languages as they become available. Our corpus creation methodology can be applied to more languages than previous work, and creates multi-way parallel evaluation sets. We provide baselines in multiple ASR and ST settings, including multilingual models to improve translation performance for low-resource language pairs."
LSSED: a large-scale dataset and benchmark for speech emotion recognition,"Speech emotion recognition is a vital contributor to the next generation of human-computer interaction (HCI). However, current existing small-scale databases have limited the development of related research. In this paper, we present LSSED, a challenging large-scale english speech emotion dataset, which has data collected from 820 subjects to simulate real-world distribution. In addition, we release some pre-trained models based on LSSED, which can not only promote the development of speech emotion recognition, but can also be transferred to related downstream tasks such as mental health analysis where data is extremely difficult to collect. Finally, our experiments show the necessity of large-scale datasets and the effectiveness of pre-trained models. The dateset will be released on https://github.com/tobefans/LSSED."
WeNet: Production oriented Streaming and Non-streaming End-to-End Speech Recognition Toolkit,"In this paper, we propose an open source, production first, and production ready speech recognition toolkit called WeNet in which a new two-pass approach is implemented to unify streaming and non-streaming end-to-end (E2E) speech recognition in a single model. The main motivation of WeNet is to close the gap between the research and the production of E2E speechrecognition models. WeNet provides an efficient way to ship ASR applications in several real-world scenarios, which is the main difference and advantage to other open source E2E speech recognition toolkits. In our toolkit, a new two-pass method is implemented. Our method propose a dynamic chunk-based attention strategy of the the transformer layers to allow arbitrary right context length modifies in hybrid CTC/attention architecture. The inference latency could be easily controlled by only changing the chunk size. The CTC hypotheses are then rescored by the attention decoder to get the final result. Our experiments on the AISHELL-1 dataset using WeNet show that, our model achieves 5.03\% relative character error rate (CER) reduction in non-streaming ASR compared to a standard non-streaming transformer. After model quantification, our model perform reasonable RTF and latency."
Internal Language Model Training for Domain-Adaptive End-to-End Speech Recognition,"The efficacy of external language model (LM) integration with existing end-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems can be improved significantly using the internal language model estimation (ILME) method. In this method, the internal LM score is subtracted from the score obtained by interpolating the E2E score with the external LM score, during inference. To improve the ILME-based inference, we propose an internal LM training (ILMT) method to minimize an additional internal LM loss by updating only the E2E model components that affect the internal LM estimation. ILMT encourages the E2E model to form a standalone LM inside its existing components, without sacrificing ASR accuracy. After ILMT, the more modular E2E model with matched training and inference criteria enables a more thorough elimination of the source-domain internal LM, and therefore leads to a more effective integration of the target-domain external LM. Experimented with 30K-hour trained recurrent neural network transducer and attention-based encoder-decoder models, ILMT with ILME-based inference achieves up to 31.5% and 11.4% relative word error rate reductions from standard E2E training with Shallow Fusion on out-of-domain LibriSpeech and in-domain Microsoft production test sets, respectively."
On Scaling Contrastive Representations for Low-Resource Speech Recognition,"Recent advances in self-supervised learning through contrastive training have shown that it is possible to learn a competitive speech recognition system with as little as 10 minutes of labeled data. However, these systems are computationally expensive since they require pre-training followed by fine-tuning in a large parameter space. We explore the performance of such systems without fine-tuning by training a state-of-the-art speech recognizer on the fixed representations from the computationally demanding wav2vec 2.0 framework. We find performance to decrease without fine-tuning and, in the extreme low-resource setting, wav2vec 2.0 is inferior to its predecessor. In addition, we find that wav2vec 2.0 representations live in a low dimensional subspace and that decorrelating the features of the representations can stabilize training of the automatic speech recognizer. Finally, we propose a bidirectional extension to the original wav2vec framework that consistently improves performance."
Speech Recognition by Simply Fine-tuning BERT,"We propose a simple method for automatic speech recognition (ASR) by fine-tuning BERT, which is a language model (LM) trained on large-scale unlabeled text data and can generate rich contextual representations. Our assumption is that given a history context sequence, a powerful LM can narrow the range of possible choices and the speech signal can be used as a simple clue. Hence, comparing to conventional ASR systems that train a powerful acoustic model (AM) from scratch, we believe that speech recognition is possible by simply fine-tuning a BERT model. As an initial study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed idea on the AISHELL dataset and show that stacking a very simple AM on top of BERT can yield reasonable performance."
Transformer Based Deliberation for Two-Pass Speech Recognition,"Interactive speech recognition systems must generate words quickly while also producing accurate results. Two-pass models excel at these requirements by employing a first-pass decoder that quickly emits words, and a second-pass decoder that requires more context but is more accurate. Previous work has established that a deliberation network can be an effective second-pass model. The model attends to two kinds of inputs at once: encoded audio frames and the hypothesis text from the first-pass model. In this work, we explore using transformer layers instead of long-short term memory (LSTM) layers for deliberation rescoring. In transformer layers, we generalize the ""encoder-decoder"" attention to attend to both encoded audio and first-pass text hypotheses. The output context vectors are then combined by a merger layer. Compared to LSTM-based deliberation, our best transformer deliberation achieves 7% relative word error rate improvements along with a 38% reduction in computation. We also compare against non-deliberation transformer rescoring, and find a 9% relative improvement."
Streaming Models for Joint Speech Recognition and Translation,"Using end-to-end models for speech translation (ST) has increasingly been the focus of the ST community. These models condense the previously cascaded systems by directly converting sound waves into translated text. However, cascaded models have the advantage of including automatic speech recognition output, useful for a variety of practical ST systems that often display transcripts to the user alongside the translations. To bridge this gap, recent work has shown initial progress into the feasibility for end-to-end models to produce both of these outputs. However, all previous work has only looked at this problem from the consecutive perspective, leaving uncertainty on whether these approaches are effective in the more challenging streaming setting. We develop an end-to-end streaming ST model based on a re-translation approach and compare against standard cascading approaches. We also introduce a novel inference method for the joint case, interleaving both transcript and translation in generation and removing the need to use separate decoders. Our evaluation across a range of metrics capturing accuracy, latency, and consistency shows that our end-to-end models are statistically similar to cascading models, while having half the number of parameters. We also find that both systems provide strong translation quality at low latency, keeping 99% of consecutive quality at a lag of just under a second."
Exploiting Beam Search Confidence for Energy-Efficient Speech Recognition,"With computers getting more and more powerful and integrated in our daily lives, the focus is increasingly shifting towards more human-friendly interfaces, making Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) a central player as the ideal means of interaction with machines. Consequently, interest in speech technology has grown in the last few years, with more systems being proposed and higher accuracy levels being achieved, even surpassing \textit{Human Accuracy}. While ASR systems become increasingly powerful, the computational complexity also increases, and the hardware support have to keep pace. In this paper, we propose a technique to improve the energy-efficiency and performance of ASR systems, focusing on low-power hardware for edge devices. We focus on optimizing the DNN-based Acoustic Model evaluation, as we have observed it to be the main bottleneck in state-of-the-art ASR systems, by leveraging run-time information from the Beam Search. By doing so, we reduce energy and execution time of the acoustic model evaluation by 25.6% and 25.9%, respectively, with negligible accuracy loss."
"Arabic Speech Recognition by End-to-End, Modular Systems and Human","Recent advances in automatic speech recognition (ASR) have achieved accuracy levels comparable to human transcribers, which led researchers to debate if the machine has reached human performance. Previous work focused on the English language and modular hidden Markov model-deep neural network (HMM-DNN) systems. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive benchmarking for end-to-end transformer ASR, modular HMM-DNN ASR, and human speech recognition (HSR) on the Arabic language and its dialects. For the HSR, we evaluate linguist performance and lay-native speaker performance on a new dataset collected as a part of this study. For ASR the end-to-end work led to 12.5%, 27.5%, 33.8% WER; a new performance milestone for the MGB2, MGB3, and MGB5 challenges respectively. Our results suggest that human performance in the Arabic language is still considerably better than the machine with an absolute WER gap of 3.5% on average."
Tiny Transducer: A Highly-efficient Speech Recognition Model on Edge Devices,"This paper proposes an extremely lightweight phone-based transducer model with a tiny decoding graph on edge devices. First, a phone synchronous decoding (PSD) algorithm based on blank label skipping is first used to speed up the transducer decoding process. Then, to decrease the deletion errors introduced by the high blank score, a blank label deweighting approach is proposed. To reduce parameters and computation, deep feedforward sequential memory network (DFSMN) layers are used in the transducer encoder, and a CNN-based stateless predictor is adopted. SVD technology compresses the model further. WFST-based decoding graph takes the context-independent (CI) phone posteriors as input and allows us to flexibly bias user-specific information. Finally, with only 0.9M parameters after SVD, our system could give a relative 9.1% - 20.5% improvement compared with a bigger conventional hybrid system on edge devices."
Efficiently Fusing Pretrained Acoustic and Linguistic Encoders for Low-resource Speech Recognition,"End-to-end models have achieved impressive results on the task of automatic speech recognition (ASR). For low-resource ASR tasks, however, labeled data can hardly satisfy the demand of end-to-end models. Self-supervised acoustic pre-training has already shown its amazing ASR performance, while the transcription is still inadequate for language modeling in end-to-end models. In this work, we fuse a pre-trained acoustic encoder (wav2vec2.0) and a pre-trained linguistic encoder (BERT) into an end-to-end ASR model. The fused model only needs to learn the transfer from speech to language during fine-tuning on limited labeled data. The length of the two modalities is matched by a monotonic attention mechanism without additional parameters. Besides, a fully connected layer is introduced for the hidden mapping between modalities. We further propose a scheduled fine-tuning strategy to preserve and utilize the text context modeling ability of the pre-trained linguistic encoder. Experiments show our effective utilizing of pre-trained modules. Our model achieves better recognition performance on CALLHOME corpus (15 hours) than other end-to-end models."
Fast offline Transformer-based end-to-end automatic speech recognition for real-world applications,"With the recent advances in technology, automatic speech recognition (ASR) has been widely used in real-world applications. The efficiency of converting large amounts of speech into text accurately with limited resources has become more important than ever. This paper proposes a method to rapidly recognize a large speech database via a Transformer-based end-to-end model. Transformers have improved the state-of-the-art performance in many fields. However, they are not easy to use for long sequences. In this paper, various techniques to speed up the recognition of real-world speeches are proposed and tested, including decoding via multiple-utterance batched beam search, detecting end-of-speech based on a connectionist temporal classification (CTC), restricting the CTC prefix score, and splitting long speeches into short segments. Experiments are conducted with the Librispeech English and the real-world Korean ASR tasks to verify the proposed methods. From the experiments, the proposed system can convert 8 hours of speeches spoken at real-world meetings into text in less than 3 minutes with a 10.73% character error rate, which is 27.1% relatively lower than that of conventional systems."
An evaluation of word-level confidence estimation for end-to-end automatic speech recognition,"Quantifying the confidence (or conversely the uncertainty) of a prediction is a highly desirable trait of an automatic system, as it improves the robustness and usefulness in downstream tasks. In this paper we investigate confidence estimation for end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR). Previous work has addressed confidence measures for lattice-based ASR, while current machine learning research mostly focuses on confidence measures for unstructured deep learning. However, as the ASR systems are increasingly being built upon deep end-to-end methods, there is little work that tries to develop confidence measures in this context. We fill this gap by providing an extensive benchmark of popular confidence methods on four well-known speech datasets. There are two challenges we overcome in adapting existing methods: working on structured data (sequences) and obtaining confidences at a coarser level than the predictions (words instead of tokens). Our results suggest that a strong baseline can be obtained by scaling the logits by a learnt temperature, followed by estimating the confidence as the negative entropy of the predictive distribution and, finally, sum pooling to aggregate at word level."
Domain-aware Neural Language Models for Speech Recognition,"As voice assistants become more ubiquitous, they are increasingly expected to support and perform well on a wide variety of use-cases across different domains. We present a domain-aware rescoring framework suitable for achieving domain-adaptation during second-pass rescoring in production settings. In our framework, we fine-tune a domain-general neural language model on several domains, and use an LSTM-based domain classification model to select the appropriate domain-adapted model to use for second-pass rescoring. This domain-aware rescoring improves the word error rate by up to 2.4% and slot word error rate by up to 4.1% on three individual domains -- shopping, navigation, and music -- compared to domain general rescoring. These improvements are obtained while maintaining accuracy for the general use case."
"PhoNLP: A joint multi-task learning model for Vietnamese part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition and dependency parsing","We present the first multi-task learning model -- named PhoNLP -- for joint Vietnamese part-of-speech (POS) tagging, named entity recognition (NER) and dependency parsing. Experiments on Vietnamese benchmark datasets show that PhoNLP produces state-of-the-art results, outperforming a single-task learning approach that fine-tunes the pre-trained Vietnamese language model PhoBERT (Nguyen and Nguyen, 2020) for each task independently. We publicly release PhoNLP as an open-source toolkit under the Apache License 2.0. Although we specify PhoNLP for Vietnamese, our PhoNLP training and evaluation command scripts in fact can directly work for other languages that have a pre-trained BERT-based language model and gold annotated corpora available for the three tasks of POS tagging, NER and dependency parsing. We hope that PhoNLP can serve as a strong baseline and useful toolkit for future NLP research and applications to not only Vietnamese but also the other languages. Our PhoNLP is available at: https://github.com/VinAIResearch/PhoNLP"
Fixed-MAML for Few Shot Classification in Multilingual Speech Emotion Recognition,"In this paper, we analyze the feasibility of applying few-shot learning to speech emotion recognition task (SER). The current speech emotion recognition models work exceptionally well but fail when then input is multilingual. Moreover, when training such models, the models' performance is suitable only when the training corpus is vast. This availability of a big training corpus is a significant problem when choosing a language that is not much popular or obscure. We attempt to solve this challenge of multilingualism and lack of available data by turning this problem into a few-shot learning problem. We suggest relaxing the assumption that all N classes in an N-way K-shot problem be new and define an N+F way problem where N and F are the number of emotion classes and predefined fixed classes, respectively. We propose this modification to the Model-Agnostic MetaLearning (MAML) algorithm to solve the problem and call this new model F-MAML. This modification performs better than the original MAML and outperforms on EmoFilm dataset."
A novel policy for pre-trained Deep Reinforcement Learning for Speech Emotion Recognition,"Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a semi-supervised learning paradigm which an agent learns by interacting with an environment. Deep learning in combination with RL provides an efficient method to learn how to interact with the environment is called Deep Reinforcement Learning (deep RL). Deep RL has gained tremendous success in gaming - such as AlphaGo, but its potential have rarely being explored for challenging tasks like Speech Emotion Recognition (SER). The deep RL being used for SER can potentially improve the performance of an automated call centre agent by dynamically learning emotional-aware response to customer queries. While the policy employed by the RL agent plays a major role in action selection, there is no current RL policy tailored for SER. In addition, extended learning period is a general challenge for deep RL which can impact the speed of learning for SER. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a novel policy - ""Zeta policy"" which is tailored for SER and apply Pre-training in deep RL to achieve faster learning rate. Pre-training with cross dataset was also studied to discover the feasibility of pre-training the RL Agent with a similar dataset in a scenario of where no real environmental data is not available. IEMOCAP and SAVEE datasets were used for the evaluation with the problem being to recognize four emotions happy, sad, angry and neutral in the utterances provided. Experimental results show that the proposed ""Zeta policy"" performs better than existing policies. The results also support that pre-training can reduce the training time upon reducing the warm-up period and is robust to cross-corpus scenario."
Applying Wav2vec2.0 to Speech Recognition in Various Low-resource Languages,"There are several domains that own corresponding widely used feature extractors, such as ResNet, BERT, and GPT-x. These models are usually pre-trained on large amounts of unlabeled data by self-supervision and can be effectively applied to downstream tasks. In the speech domain, wav2vec2.0 starts to show its powerful representation ability and feasibility of ultra-low resource speech recognition on the Librispeech corpus, which belongs to the audiobook domain. However, wav2vec2.0 has not been examined on real spoken scenarios and languages other than English. To verify its universality over languages, we apply pre-trained models to solve low-resource speech recognition tasks in various spoken languages. We achieve more than 20% relative improvements in six languages compared with previous work. Among these languages, English achieves a gain of 52.4%. Moreover, using coarse-grained modeling units, such as subword or character, achieves better results than fine-grained modeling units, such as phone or letter."
Adversarial Meta Sampling for Multilingual Low-Resource Speech Recognition,"Low-resource automatic speech recognition (ASR) is challenging, as the low-resource target language data cannot well train an ASR model. To solve this issue, meta-learning formulates ASR for each source language into many small ASR tasks and meta-learns a model initialization on all tasks from different source languages to access fast adaptation on unseen target languages. However, for different source languages, the quantity and difficulty vary greatly because of their different data scales and diverse phonological systems, which leads to task-quantity and task-difficulty imbalance issues and thus a failure of multilingual meta-learning ASR (MML-ASR). In this work, we solve this problem by developing a novel adversarial meta sampling (AMS) approach to improve MML-ASR. When sampling tasks in MML-ASR, AMS adaptively determines the task sampling probability for each source language. Specifically, for each source language, if the query loss is large, it means that its tasks are not well sampled to train ASR model in terms of its quantity and difficulty and thus should be sampled more frequently for extra learning. Inspired by this fact, we feed the historical task query loss of all source language domain into a network to learn a task sampling policy for adversarially increasing the current query loss of MML-ASR. Thus, the learnt task sampling policy can master the learning situation of each language and thus predicts good task sampling probability for each language for more effective learning. Finally, experiment results on two multilingual datasets show significant performance improvement when applying our AMS on MML-ASR, and also demonstrate the applicability of AMS to other low-resource speech tasks and transfer learning ASR approaches."
Unsupervised Cross-Lingual Speech Emotion Recognition Using DomainAdversarial Neural Network,"By using deep learning approaches, Speech Emotion Recog-nition (SER) on a single domain has achieved many excellentresults. However, cross-domain SER is still a challenging taskdue to the distribution shift between source and target domains.In this work, we propose a Domain Adversarial Neural Net-work (DANN) based approach to mitigate this distribution shiftproblem for cross-lingual SER. Specifically, we add a languageclassifier and gradient reversal layer after the feature extractor toforce the learned representation both language-independent andemotion-meaningful. Our method is unsupervised, i. e., labelson target language are not required, which makes it easier to ap-ply our method to other languages. Experimental results showthe proposed method provides an average absolute improve-ment of 3.91% over the baseline system for arousal and valenceclassification task. Furthermore, we find that batch normaliza-tion is beneficial to the performance gain of DANN. Thereforewe also explore the effect of different ways of data combinationfor batch normalization."
Adjust-free adversarial example generation in speech recognition using evolutionary multi-objective optimization under black-box condition,"This paper proposes a black-box adversarial attack method to automatic speech recognition systems. Some studies have attempted to attack neural networks for speech recognition; however, these methods did not consider the robustness of generated adversarial examples against timing lag with a target speech. The proposed method in this paper adopts Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization (EMO)that allows it generating robust adversarial examples under black-box scenario. Experimental results showed that the proposed method successfully generated adjust-free adversarial examples, which are sufficiently robust against timing lag so that an attacker does not need to take the timing of playing it against the target speech."
CIF-based Collaborative Decoding for End-to-end Contextual Speech Recognition,"End-to-end (E2E) models have achieved promising results on multiple speech recognition benchmarks, and shown the potential to become the mainstream. However, the unified structure and the E2E training hamper injecting contextual information into them for contextual biasing. Though contextual LAS (CLAS) gives an excellent all-neural solution, the degree of biasing to given context information is not explicitly controllable. In this paper, we focus on incorporating context information into the continuous integrate-and-fire (CIF) based model that supports contextual biasing in a more controllable fashion. Specifically, an extra context processing network is introduced to extract contextual embeddings, integrate acoustically relevant context information and decode the contextual output distribution, thus forming a collaborative decoding with the decoder of the CIF-based model. Evaluated on the named entity rich evaluation sets of HKUST/AISHELL-2, our method brings relative character error rate (CER) reduction of 8.83%/21.13% and relative named entity character error rate (NE-CER) reduction of 40.14%/51.50% when compared with a strong baseline. Besides, it keeps the performance on original evaluation set without degradation."
A review of on-device fully neural end-to-end automatic speech recognition algorithms,"In this paper, we review various end-to-end automatic speech recognition algorithms and their optimization techniques for on-device applications. Conventional speech recognition systems comprise a large number of discrete components such as an acoustic model, a language model, a pronunciation model, a text-normalizer, an inverse-text normalizer, a decoder based on a Weighted Finite State Transducer (WFST), and so on. To obtain sufficiently high speech recognition accuracy with such conventional speech recognition systems, a very large language model (up to 100 GB) is usually needed. Hence, the corresponding WFST size becomes enormous, which prohibits their on-device implementation. Recently, fully neural network end-to-end speech recognition algorithms have been proposed. Examples include speech recognition systems based on Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC), Recurrent Neural Network Transducer (RNN-T), Attention-based Encoder-Decoder models (AED), Monotonic Chunk-wise Attention (MoChA), transformer-based speech recognition systems, and so on. These fully neural network-based systems require much smaller memory footprints compared to conventional algorithms, therefore their on-device implementation has become feasible. In this paper, we review such end-to-end speech recognition models. We extensively discuss their structures, performance, and advantages compared to conventional algorithms."
AV Taris: Online Audio-Visual Speech Recognition,"In recent years, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technology has approached human-level performance on conversational speech under relatively clean listening conditions. In more demanding situations involving distant microphones, overlapped speech, background noise, or natural dialogue structures, the ASR error rate is at least an order of magnitude higher. The visual modality of speech carries the potential to partially overcome these challenges and contribute to the sub-tasks of speaker diarisation, voice activity detection, and the recovery of the place of articulation, and can compensate for up to 15dB of noise on average. This article develops AV Taris, a fully differentiable neural network model capable of decoding audio-visual speech in real time. We achieve this by connecting two recently proposed models for audio-visual speech integration and online speech recognition, namely AV Align and Taris. We evaluate AV Taris under the same conditions as AV Align and Taris on one of the largest publicly available audio-visual speech datasets, LRS2. Our results show that AV Taris is superior to the audio-only variant of Taris, demonstrating the utility of the visual modality to speech recognition within the real time decoding framework defined by Taris. Compared to an equivalent Transformer-based AV Align model that takes advantage of full sentences without meeting the real-time requirement, we report an absolute degradation of approximately 3% with AV Taris. As opposed to the more popular alternative for online speech recognition, namely the RNN Transducer, Taris offers a greatly simplified fully differentiable training pipeline. As a consequence, AV Taris has the potential to popularise the adoption of Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) technology and overcome the inherent limitations of the audio modality in less optimal listening conditions."
Improved Robustness to Disfluencies in RNN-Transducer Based Speech Recognition,"Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) based on Recurrent Neural Network Transducers (RNN-T) is gaining interest in the speech community. We investigate data selection and preparation choices aiming for improved robustness of RNN-T ASR to speech disfluencies with a focus on partial words. For evaluation we use clean data, data with disfluencies and a separate dataset with speech affected by stuttering. We show that after including a small amount of data with disfluencies in the training set the recognition accuracy on the tests with disfluencies and stuttering improves. Increasing the amount of training data with disfluencies gives additional gains without degradation on the clean data. We also show that replacing partial words with a dedicated token helps to get even better accuracy on utterances with disfluencies and stutter. The evaluation of our best model shows 22.5% and 16.4% relative WER reduction on those two evaluation sets."
Unified Streaming and Non-streaming Two-pass End-to-end Model for Speech Recognition,"In this paper, we present a novel two-pass approach to unify streaming and non-streaming end-to-end (E2E) speech recognition in a single model. Our model adopts the hybrid CTC/attention architecture, in which the conformer layers in the encoder are modified. We propose a dynamic chunk-based attention strategy to allow arbitrary right context length. At inference time, the CTC decoder generates n-best hypotheses in a streaming way. The inference latency could be easily controlled by only changing the chunk size. The CTC hypotheses are then rescored by the attention decoder to get the final result. This efficient rescoring process causes very little sentence-level latency. Our experiments on the open 170-hour AISHELL-1 dataset show that, the proposed method can unify the streaming and non-streaming model simply and efficiently. On the AISHELL-1 test set, our unified model achieves 5.60% relative character error rate (CER) reduction in non-streaming ASR compared to a standard non-streaming transformer. The same model achieves 5.42% CER with 640ms latency in a streaming ASR system."
Multi-Classifier Interactive Learning for Ambiguous Speech Emotion Recognition,"In recent years, speech emotion recognition technology is of great significance in industrial applications such as call centers, social robots and health care. The combination of speech recognition and speech emotion recognition can improve the feedback efficiency and the quality of service. Thus, the speech emotion recognition has been attracted much attention in both industry and academic. Since emotions existing in an entire utterance may have varied probabilities, speech emotion is likely to be ambiguous, which poses great challenges to recognition tasks. However, previous studies commonly assigned a single-label or multi-label to each utterance in certain. Therefore, their algorithms result in low accuracies because of the inappropriate representation. Inspired by the optimally interacting theory, we address the ambiguous speech emotions by proposing a novel multi-classifier interactive learning (MCIL) method. In MCIL, multiple different classifiers first mimic several individuals, who have inconsistent cognitions of ambiguous emotions, and construct new ambiguous labels (the emotion probability distribution). Then, they are retrained with the new labels to interact with their cognitions. This procedure enables each classifier to learn better representations of ambiguous data from others, and further improves the recognition ability. The experiments on three benchmark corpora (MAS, IEMOCAP, and FAU-AIBO) demonstrate that MCIL does not only improve each classifier's performance, but also raises their recognition consistency from moderate to substantial."
Speech Recognition for Endangered and Extinct Samoyedic languages,"Our study presents a series of experiments on speech recognition with endangered and extinct Samoyedic languages, spoken in Northern and Southern Siberia. To best of our knowledge, this is the first time a functional ASR system is built for an extinct language. We achieve with Kamas language a Label Error Rate of 15\%, and conclude through careful error analysis that this quality is already very useful as a starting point for refined human transcriptions. Our results with related Nganasan language are more modest, with best model having the error rate of 33\%. We show, however, through experiments where Kamas training data is enlarged incrementally, that Nganasan results are in line with what is expected under low-resource circumstances of the language. Based on this, we provide recommendations for scenarios in which further language documentation or archive processing activities could benefit from modern ASR technology. All training data and processing scripts haven been published on Zenodo with clear licences to ensure further work in this important topic."
DeepTalk: Vocal Style Encoding for Speaker Recognition and Speech Synthesis,"Automatic speaker recognition algorithms typically characterize speech audio using short-term spectral features that encode the physiological and anatomical aspects of speech production. Such algorithms do not fully capitalize on speaker-dependent characteristics present in behavioral speech features. In this work, we propose a prosody encoding network called DeepTalk for extracting vocal style features directly from raw audio data. The DeepTalk method outperforms several state-of-the-art speaker recognition systems across multiple challenging datasets. The speaker recognition performance is further improved by combining DeepTalk with a state-of-the-art physiological speech feature-based speaker recognition system. We also integrate DeepTalk into a current state-of-the-art speech synthesizer to generate synthetic speech. A detailed analysis of the synthetic speech shows that the DeepTalk captures F0 contours essential for vocal style modeling. Furthermore, DeepTalk-based synthetic speech is shown to be almost indistinguishable from real speech in the context of speaker recognition."
Adapt-and-Adjust: Overcoming the Long-Tail Problem of Multilingual Speech Recognition,"One crucial challenge of real-world multilingual speech recognition is the long-tailed distribution problem, where some resource-rich languages like English have abundant training data, but a long tail of low-resource languages have varying amounts of limited training data. To overcome the long-tail problem, in this paper, we propose Adapt-and-Adjust (A2), a transformer-based multi-task learning framework for end-to-end multilingual speech recognition. The A2 framework overcomes the long-tail problem via three techniques: (1) exploiting a pretrained multilingual language model (mBERT) to improve the performance of low-resource languages; (2) proposing dual adapters consisting of both language-specific and language-agnostic adaptation with minimal additional parameters; and (3) overcoming the class imbalance, either by imposing class priors in the loss during training or adjusting the logits of the softmax output during inference. Extensive experiments on the CommonVoice corpus show that A2 significantly outperforms conventional approaches."
Transformer-Transducers for Code-Switched Speech Recognition,"We live in a world where 60% of the population can speak two or more languages fluently. Members of these communities constantly switch between languages when having a conversation. As automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems are being deployed to the real-world, there is a need for practical systems that can handle multiple languages both within an utterance or across utterances. In this paper, we present an end-to-end ASR system using a transformer-transducer model architecture for code-switched speech recognition. We propose three modifications over the vanilla model in order to handle various aspects of code-switching. First, we introduce two auxiliary loss functions to handle the low-resource scenario of code-switching. Second, we propose a novel mask-based training strategy with language ID information to improve the label encoder training towards intra-sentential code-switching. Finally, we propose a multi-label/multi-audio encoder structure to leverage the vast monolingual speech corpora towards code-switching. We demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approaches on the SEAME dataset, a public Mandarin-English code-switching corpus, achieving a mixed error rate of 18.5% and 26.3% on test_man and test_sge sets respectively."
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Speech Recognition via Uncertainty Driven Self-Training,"The performance of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems typically degrades significantly when the training and test data domains are mismatched. In this paper, we show that self-training (ST) combined with an uncertainty-based pseudo-label filtering approach can be effectively used for domain adaptation. We propose DUST, a dropout-based uncertainty-driven self-training technique which uses agreement between multiple predictions of an ASR system obtained for different dropout settings to measure the model's uncertainty about its prediction. DUST excludes pseudo-labeled data with high uncertainties from the training, which leads to substantially improved ASR results compared to ST without filtering, and accelerates the training time due to a reduced training data set. Domain adaptation experiments using WSJ as a source domain and TED-LIUM 3 as well as SWITCHBOARD as the target domains show that up to 80% of the performance of a system trained on ground-truth data can be recovered."
Streaming end-to-end multi-talker speech recognition,"End-to-end multi-talker speech recognition is an emerging research trend in the speech community due to its vast potential in applications such as conversation and meeting transcriptions. To the best of our knowledge, all existing research works are constrained in the offline scenario. In this work, we propose the Streaming Unmixing and Recognition Transducer (SURT) for end-to-end multi-talker speech recognition. Our model employs the Recurrent Neural Network Transducer (RNN-T) as the backbone that can meet various latency constraints. We study two different model architectures that are based on a speaker-differentiator encoder and a mask encoder respectively. To train this model, we investigate the widely used Permutation Invariant Training (PIT) approach and the Heuristic Error Assignment Training (HEAT) approach. Based on experiments on the publicly available LibriSpeechMix dataset, we show that HEAT can achieve better accuracy compared with PIT, and the SURT model with 150 milliseconds algorithmic latency constraint compares favorably with the offline sequence-to-sequence based baseline model in terms of accuracy."
Synth2Aug: Cross-domain speaker recognition with TTS synthesized speech,"In recent years, Text-To-Speech (TTS) has been used as a data augmentation technique for speech recognition to help complement inadequacies in the training data. Correspondingly, we investigate the use of a multi-speaker TTS system to synthesize speech in support of speaker recognition. In this study we focus the analysis on tasks where a relatively small number of speakers is available for training. We observe on our datasets that TTS synthesized speech improves cross-domain speaker recognition performance and can be combined effectively with multi-style training. Additionally, we explore the effectiveness of different types of text transcripts used for TTS synthesis. Results suggest that matching the textual content of the target domain is a good practice, and if that is not feasible, a transcript with a sufficiently large vocabulary is recommended."
Multi-task Language Modeling for Improving Speech Recognition of Rare Words,"End-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems are increasingly popular due to their relative architectural simplicity and competitive performance. However, even though the average accuracy of these systems may be high, the performance on rare content words often lags behind hybrid ASR systems. To address this problem, second-pass rescoring is often applied leveraging upon language modeling. In this paper, we propose a second-pass system with multi-task learning, utilizing semantic targets (such as intent and slot prediction) to improve speech recognition performance. We show that our rescoring model trained with these additional tasks outperforms the baseline rescoring model, trained with only the language modeling task, by 1.4% on a general test and by 2.6% on a rare word test set in terms of word-error-rate relative (WERR). Our best ASR system with multi-task LM shows 4.6% WERR deduction compared with RNN Transducer only ASR baseline for rare words recognition."
An Online Multilingual Hate speech Recognition System,"The exponential increase in the use of the Internet and social media over the last two decades has changed human interaction. This has led to many positive outcomes, but at the same time it has brought risks and harms. While the volume of harmful content online, such as hate speech, is not manageable by humans, interest in the academic community to investigate automated means for hate speech detection has increased. In this study, we analyse six publicly available datasets by combining them into a single homogeneous dataset and classify them into three classes, abusive, hateful or neither. We create a baseline model and we improve model performance scores using various optimisation techniques. After attaining a competitive performance score, we create a tool which identifies and scores a page with effective metric in near-real time and uses the same as feedback to re-train our model. We prove the competitive performance of our multilingual model on two langauges, English and Hindi, leading to comparable or superior performance to most monolingual models."
Speech Command Recognition in Computationally Constrained Environments with a Quadratic Self-organized Operational Layer,"Automatic classification of speech commands has revolutionized human computer interactions in robotic applications. However, employed recognition models usually follow the methodology of deep learning with complicated networks which are memory and energy hungry. So, there is a need to either squeeze these complicated models or use more efficient light-weight models in order to be able to implement the resulting classifiers on embedded devices. In this paper, we pick the second approach and propose a network layer to enhance the speech command recognition capability of a lightweight network and demonstrate the result via experiments. The employed method borrows the ideas of Taylor expansion and quadratic forms to construct a better representation of features in both input and hidden layers. This richer representation results in recognition accuracy improvement as shown by extensive experiments on Google speech commands (GSC) and synthetic speech commands (SSC) datasets."
End-to-end Silent Speech Recognition with Acoustic Sensing,"Silent speech interfaces (SSI) has been an exciting area of recent interest. In this paper, we present a non-invasive silent speech interface that uses inaudible acoustic signals to capture people's lip movements when they speak. We exploit the speaker and microphone of the smartphone to emit signals and listen to their reflections, respectively. The extracted phase features of these reflections are fed into the deep learning networks to recognize speech. And we also propose an end-to-end recognition framework, which combines the CNN and attention-based encoder-decoder network. Evaluation results on a limited vocabulary (54 sentences) yield word error rates of 8.4% in speaker-independent and environment-independent settings, and 8.1% for unseen sentence testing."
Deep Residual Local Feature Learning for Speech Emotion Recognition,"Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is becoming a key role in global business today to improve service efficiency, like call center services. Recent SERs were based on a deep learning approach. However, the efficiency of deep learning depends on the number of layers, i.e., the deeper layers, the higher efficiency. On the other hand, the deeper layers are causes of a vanishing gradient problem, a low learning rate, and high time-consuming. Therefore, this paper proposed a redesign of existing local feature learning block (LFLB). The new design is called a deep residual local feature learning block (DeepResLFLB). DeepResLFLB consists of three cascade blocks: LFLB, residual local feature learning block (ResLFLB), and multilayer perceptron (MLP). LFLB is built for learning local correlations along with extracting hierarchical correlations; DeepResLFLB can take advantage of repeatedly learning to explain more detail in deeper layers using residual learning for solving vanishing gradient and reducing overfitting; and MLP is adopted to find the relationship of learning and discover probability for predicted speech emotions and gender types. Based on two available published datasets: EMODB and RAVDESS, the proposed DeepResLFLB can significantly improve performance when evaluated by standard metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score."
Context-aware RNNLM Rescoring for Conversational Speech Recognition,"Conversational speech recognition is regarded as a challenging task due to its free-style speaking and long-term contextual dependencies. Prior work has explored the modeling of long-range context through RNNLM rescoring with improved performance. To further take advantage of the persisted nature during a conversation, such as topics or speaker turn, we extend the rescoring procedure to a new context-aware manner. For RNNLM training, we capture the contextual dependencies by concatenating adjacent sentences with various tag words, such as speaker or intention information. For lattice rescoring, the lattice of adjacent sentences are also connected with the first-pass decoded result by tag words. Besides, we also adopt a selective concatenation strategy based on tf-idf, making the best use of contextual similarity to improve transcription performance. Results on four different conversation test sets show that our approach yields up to 13.1% and 6% relative char-error-rate (CER) reduction compared with 1st-pass decoding and common lattice-rescoring, respectively."
On the use of Self-supervised Pre-trained Acoustic and Linguistic Features for Continuous Speech Emotion Recognition,"Pre-training for feature extraction is an increasingly studied approach to get better continuous representations of audio and text content. In the present work, we use wav2vec and camemBERT as self-supervised learned models to represent our data in order to perform continuous emotion recognition from speech (SER) on AlloSat, a large French emotional database describing the satisfaction dimension, and on the state of the art corpus SEWA focusing on valence, arousal and liking dimensions. To the authors' knowledge, this paper presents the first study showing that the joint use of wav2vec and BERT-like pre-trained features is very relevant to deal with continuous SER task, usually characterized by a small amount of labeled training data. Evaluated by the well-known concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), our experiments show that we can reach a CCC value of 0.825 instead of 0.592 when using MFCC in conjunction with word2vec word embedding on the AlloSat dataset."
Multi-Channel Automatic Speech Recognition Using Deep Complex Unet,"The front-end module in multi-channel automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems mainly use microphone array techniques to produce enhanced signals in noisy conditions with reverberation and echos. Recently, neural network (NN) based front-end has shown promising improvement over the conventional signal processing methods. In this paper, we propose to adopt the architecture of deep complex Unet (DCUnet) - a powerful complex-valued Unet-structured speech enhancement model - as the front-end of the multi-channel acoustic model, and integrate them in a multi-task learning (MTL) framework along with cascaded framework for comparison. Meanwhile, we investigate the proposed methods with several training strategies to improve the recognition accuracy on the 1000-hours real-world XiaoMi smart speaker data with echos. Experiments show that our proposed DCUnet-MTL method brings about 12.2% relative character error rate (CER) reduction compared with the traditional approach with array processing plus single-channel acoustic model. It also achieves superior performance than the recently proposed neural beamforming method."
Cascade RNN-Transducer: Syllable Based Streaming On-device Mandarin Speech Recognition with a Syllable-to-Character Converter,"End-to-end models are favored in automatic speech recognition (ASR) because of its simplified system structure and superior performance. Among these models, recurrent neural network transducer (RNN-T) has achieved significant progress in streaming on-device speech recognition because of its high-accuracy and low-latency. RNN-T adopts a prediction network to enhance language information, but its language modeling ability is limited because it still needs paired speech-text data to train. Further strengthening the language modeling ability through extra text data, such as shallow fusion with an external language model, only brings a small performance gain. In view of the fact that Mandarin Chinese is a character-based language and each character is pronounced as a tonal syllable, this paper proposes a novel cascade RNN-T approach to improve the language modeling ability of RNN-T. Our approach firstly uses an RNN-T to transform acoustic feature into syllable sequence, and then converts the syllable sequence into character sequence through an RNN-T-based syllable-to-character converter. Thus a rich text repository can be easily used to strengthen the language model ability. By introducing several important tricks, the cascade RNN-T approach surpasses the character-based RNN-T by a large margin on several Mandarin test sets, with much higher recognition quality and similar latency."
Refining Automatic Speech Recognition System for older adults,"Building a high quality automatic speech recognition (ASR) system with limited training data has been a challenging task particularly for a narrow target population. Open-sourced ASR systems, trained on sufficient data from adults, are susceptible on seniors' speech due to acoustic mismatch between adults and seniors. With 12 hours of training data, we attempt to develop an ASR system for socially isolated seniors (80+ years old) with possible cognitive impairments. We experimentally identify that ASR for the adult population performs poorly on our target population and transfer learning (TL) can boost the system's performance. Standing on the fundamental idea of TL, tuning model parameters, we further improve the system by leveraging an attention mechanism to utilize the model's intermediate information. Our approach achieves 1.58% absolute improvements over the TL model."
Streaming Attention-Based Models with Augmented Memory for End-to-End Speech Recognition,"Attention-based models have been gaining popularity recently for their strong performance demonstrated in fields such as machine translation and automatic speech recognition. One major challenge of attention-based models is the need of access to the full sequence and the quadratically growing computational cost concerning the sequence length. These characteristics pose challenges, especially for low-latency scenarios, where the system is often required to be streaming. In this paper, we build a compact and streaming speech recognition system on top of the end-to-end neural transducer architecture with attention-based modules augmented with convolution. The proposed system equips the end-to-end models with the streaming capability and reduces the large footprint from the streaming attention-based model using augmented memory. On the LibriSpeech dataset, our proposed system achieves word error rates 2.7% on test-clean and 5.8% on test-other, to our best knowledge the lowest among streaming approaches reported so far."
Low-activity supervised convolutional spiking neural networks applied to speech commands recognition,"Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are the current state-of-the-art models in many speech related tasks. There is a growing interest, though, for more biologically realistic, hardware friendly and energy efficient models, named Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). Recently, it has been shown that SNNs can be trained efficiently, in a supervised manner, using backpropagation with a surrogate gradient trick. In this work, we report speech command (SC) recognition experiments using supervised SNNs. We explored the Leaky-Integrate-Fire (LIF) neuron model for this task, and show that a model comprised of stacked dilated convolution spiking layers can reach an error rate very close to standard DNNs on the Google SC v1 dataset: 5.5%, while keeping a very sparse spiking activity, below 5%, thank to a new regularization term. We also show that modeling the leakage of the neuron membrane potential is useful, since the LIF model outperformed its non-leaky model counterpart significantly."
"The SLT 2021 children speech recognition challenge: Open datasets, rules and baselines","Automatic speech recognition (ASR) has been significantly advanced with the use of deep learning and big data. However improving robustness, including achieving equally good performance on diverse speakers and accents, is still a challenging problem. In particular, the performance of children speech recognition (CSR) still lags behind due to 1) the speech and language characteristics of children's voice are substantially different from those of adults and 2) sizable open dataset for children speech is still not available in the research community. To address these problems, we launch the Children Speech Recognition Challenge (CSRC), as a flagship satellite event of IEEE SLT 2021 workshop. The challenge will release about 400 hours of Mandarin speech data for registered teams and set up two challenge tracks and provide a common testbed to benchmark the CSR performance. In this paper, we introduce the datasets, rules, evaluation method as well as baselines."
The CUHK-TUDELFT System for The SLT 2021 Children Speech Recognition Challenge,"This technical report describes our submission to the 2021 SLT Children Speech Recognition Challenge (CSRC) Track 1. Our approach combines the use of a joint CTC-attention end-to-end (E2E) speech recognition framework, transfer learning, data augmentation and development of various language models. Procedures of data pre-processing, the background and the course of system development are described. The analysis of the experiment results, as well as the comparison between the E2E and DNN-HMM hybrid system are discussed in detail. Our system achieved a character error rate (CER) of 20.1% in our designated test set, and 23.6% in the official evaluation set, which is placed at 10-th overall."
Efficient Neural Architecture Search for End-to-end Speech Recognition via Straight-Through Gradients,"Neural Architecture Search (NAS), the process of automating architecture engineering, is an appealing next step to advancing end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), replacing expert-designed networks with learned, task-specific architectures. In contrast to early computational-demanding NAS methods, recent gradient-based NAS methods, e.g., DARTS (Differentiable ARchiTecture Search), SNAS (Stochastic NAS) and ProxylessNAS, significantly improve the NAS efficiency. In this paper, we make two contributions. First, we rigorously develop an efficient NAS method via Straight-Through (ST) gradients, called ST-NAS. Basically, ST-NAS uses the loss from SNAS but uses ST to back-propagate gradients through discrete variables to optimize the loss, which is not revealed in ProxylessNAS. Using ST gradients to support sub-graph sampling is a core element to achieve efficient NAS beyond DARTS and SNAS. Second, we successfully apply ST-NAS to end-to-end ASR. Experiments over the widely benchmarked 80-hour WSJ and 300-hour Switchboard datasets show that the ST-NAS induced architectures significantly outperform the human-designed architecture across the two datasets. Strengths of ST-NAS such as architecture transferability and low computation cost in memory and time are also reported."
On the Usefulness of Self-Attention for Automatic Speech Recognition with Transformers,"Self-attention models such as Transformers, which can capture temporal relationships without being limited by the distance between events, have given competitive speech recognition results. However, we note the range of the learned context increases from the lower to upper self-attention layers, whilst acoustic events often happen within short time spans in a left-to-right order. This leads to a question: for speech recognition, is a global view of the entire sequence useful for the upper self-attention encoder layers in Transformers? To investigate this, we train models with lower self-attention/upper feed-forward layers encoders on Wall Street Journal and Switchboard. Compared to baseline Transformers, no performance drop but minor gains are observed. We further developed a novel metric of the diagonality of attention matrices and found the learned diagonality indeed increases from the lower to upper encoder self-attention layers. We conclude the global view is unnecessary in training upper encoder layers."
"Data Augmentation For Children's Speech Recognition -- The ""Ethiopian"" System For The SLT 2021 Children Speech Recognition Challenge","This paper presents the ""Ethiopian"" system for the SLT 2021 Children Speech Recognition Challenge. Various data processing and augmentation techniques are proposed to tackle children's speech recognition problem, especially the lack of the children's speech recognition training data issue. Detailed experiments are designed and conducted to show the effectiveness of each technique, across different speech recognition toolkits and model architectures. Step by step, we explain how we come up with our final system, which provides the state-of-the-art results in the SLT 2021 Children Speech Recognition Challenge, with 21.66% CER on the Track 1 evaluation set (4th place overall), and 16.53% CER on the Track 2 evaluation set (1st place overall). Post-challenge analysis shows that our system actually achieves 18.82% CER on the Track 1 evaluation set, but we submitted the wrong version to the challenge organizer for Track 1."
Gated Recurrent Fusion with Joint Training Framework for Robust End-to-End Speech Recognition,"The joint training framework for speech enhancement and recognition methods have obtained quite good performances for robust end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR). However, these methods only utilize the enhanced feature as the input of the speech recognition component, which are affected by the speech distortion problem. In order to address this problem, this paper proposes a gated recurrent fusion (GRF) method with joint training framework for robust end-to-end ASR. The GRF algorithm is used to dynamically combine the noisy and enhanced features. Therefore, the GRF can not only remove the noise signals from the enhanced features, but also learn the raw fine structures from the noisy features so that it can alleviate the speech distortion. The proposed method consists of speech enhancement, GRF and speech recognition. Firstly, the mask based speech enhancement network is applied to enhance the input speech. Secondly, the GRF is applied to address the speech distortion problem. Thirdly, to improve the performance of ASR, the state-of-the-art speech transformer algorithm is used as the speech recognition component. Finally, the joint training framework is utilized to optimize these three components, simultaneously. Our experiments are conducted on an open-source Mandarin speech corpus called AISHELL-1. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves the relative character error rate (CER) reduction of 10.04\% over the conventional joint enhancement and transformer method only using the enhanced features. Especially for the low signal-to-noise ratio (0 dB), our proposed method can achieves better performances with 12.67\% CER reduction, which suggests the potential of our proposed method."
Efficient End-to-End Speech Recognition Using Performers in Conformers,"On-device end-to-end speech recognition poses a high requirement on model efficiency. Most prior works improve the efficiency by reducing model sizes. We propose to reduce the complexity of model architectures in addition to model sizes. More specifically, we reduce the floating-point operations in conformer by replacing the transformer module with a performer. The proposed attention-based efficient end-to-end speech recognition model yields competitive performance on the LibriSpeech corpus with 10 millions of parameters and linear computation complexity. The proposed model also outperforms previous lightweight end-to-end models by about 20% relatively in word error rate."
"Listen, Look and Deliberate: Visual context-aware speech recognition using pre-trained text-video representations","In this study, we try to address the problem of leveraging visual signals to improve Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), also known as visual context-aware ASR (VC-ASR). We explore novel VC-ASR approaches to leverage video and text representations extracted by a self-supervised pre-trained text-video embedding model. Firstly, we propose a multi-stream attention architecture to leverage signals from both audio and video modalities. This architecture consists of separate encoders for the two modalities and a single decoder that attends over them. We show that this architecture is better than fusing modalities at the signal level. Additionally, we also explore leveraging the visual information in a second pass model, which has also been referred to as a `deliberation model'. The deliberation model accepts audio representations and text hypotheses from the first pass ASR and combines them with a visual stream for an improved visual context-aware recognition. The proposed deliberation scheme can work on top of any well trained ASR and also enabled us to leverage the pre-trained text model to ground the hypotheses with the visual features. Our experiments on HOW2 dataset show that multi-stream and deliberation architectures are very effective at the VC-ASR task. We evaluate the proposed models for two scenarios; clean audio stream and distorted audio in which we mask out some specific words in the audio. The deliberation model outperforms the multi-stream model and achieves a relative WER improvement of 6% and 8.7% for the clean and masked data, respectively, compared to an audio-only model. The deliberation model also improves recovering the masked words by 59% relative."
Dual Application of Speech Enhancement for Automatic Speech Recognition,"In this work, we exploit speech enhancement for improving a recurrent neural network transducer (RNN-T) based ASR system. We employ a dense convolutional recurrent network (DCRN) for complex spectral mapping based speech enhancement, and find it helpful for ASR in two ways: a data augmentation technique, and a preprocessing frontend. In using it for ASR data augmentation, we exploit a KL divergence based consistency loss that is computed between the ASR outputs of original and enhanced utterances. In using speech enhancement as an effective ASR frontend, we propose a three-step training scheme based on model pretraining and feature selection. We evaluate our proposed techniques on a challenging social media English video dataset, and achieve an average relative improvement of 11.2% with speech enhancement based data augmentation, 8.3% with enhancement based preprocessing, and 13.4% when combining both."
Domain Adaptation Using Class Similarity for Robust Speech Recognition,"When only limited target domain data is available, domain adaptation could be used to promote performance of deep neural network (DNN) acoustic model by leveraging well-trained source model and target domain data. However, suffering from domain mismatch and data sparsity, domain adaptation is very challenging. This paper proposes a novel adaptation method for DNN acoustic model using class similarity. Since the output distribution of DNN model contains the knowledge of similarity among classes, which is applicable to both source and target domain, it could be transferred from source to target model for the performance improvement. In our approach, we first compute the frame level posterior probabilities of source samples using source model. Then, for each class, probabilities of this class are used to compute a mean vector, which we refer to as mean soft labels. During adaptation, these mean soft labels are used in a regularization term to train the target model. Experiments showed that our approach outperforms fine-tuning using one-hot labels on both accent and noise adaptation task, especially when source and target domain are highly mismatched."
Correlation based Multi-phasal models for improved imagined speech EEG recognition,"Translation of imagined speech electroencephalogram(EEG) into human understandable commands greatly facilitates the design of naturalistic brain computer interfaces. To achieve improved imagined speech unit classification, this work aims to profit from the parallel information contained in multi-phasal EEG data recorded while speaking, imagining and performing articulatory movements corresponding to specific speech units. A bi-phase common representation learning module using neural networks is designed to model the correlation and reproducibility between an analysis phase and a support phase. The trained Correlation Network is then employed to extract discriminative features of the analysis phase. These features are further classified into five binary phonological categories using machine learning models such as Gaussian mixture based hidden Markov model and deep neural networks. The proposed approach further handles the non-availability of multi-phasal data during decoding. Topographic visualizations along with result-based inferences suggest that the multi-phasal correlation modelling approach proposed in the paper enhances imagined-speech EEG recognition performance."
Data Augmentation for End-to-end Code-switching Speech Recognition,"Training a code-switching end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) model normally requires a large amount of data, while code-switching data is often limited. In this paper, three novel approaches are proposed for code-switching data augmentation. Specifically, they are audio splicing with the existing code-switching data, and TTS with new code-switching texts generated by word translation or word insertion. Our experiments on 200 hours Mandarin-English code-switching dataset show that all the three proposed approaches yield significant improvements on code-switching ASR individually. Moreover, all the proposed approaches can be combined with recent popular SpecAugment, and an addition gain can be obtained. WER is significantly reduced by relative 24.0% compared to the system without any data augmentation, and still relative 13.0% gain compared to the system with only SpecAugment"
"Cross-Lingual Machine Speech Chain for Javanese, Sundanese, Balinese, and Bataks Speech Recognition and Synthesis","Even though over seven hundred ethnic languages are spoken in Indonesia, the available technology remains limited that could support communication within indigenous communities as well as with people outside the villages. As a result, indigenous communities still face isolation due to cultural barriers; languages continue to disappear. To accelerate communication, speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) technology is one approach that can overcome language barriers. However, S2ST systems require machine translation (MT), speech recognition (ASR), and synthesis (TTS) that rely heavily on supervised training and a broad set of language resources that can be difficult to collect from ethnic communities. Recently, a machine speech chain mechanism was proposed to enable ASR and TTS to assist each other in semi-supervised learning. The framework was initially implemented only for monolingual languages. In this study, we focus on developing speech recognition and synthesis for these Indonesian ethnic languages: Javanese, Sundanese, Balinese, and Bataks. We first separately train ASR and TTS of standard Indonesian in supervised training. We then develop ASR and TTS of ethnic languages by utilizing Indonesian ASR and TTS in a cross-lingual machine speech chain framework with only text or only speech data removing the need for paired speech-text data of those ethnic languages."
Sequence-to-Sequence Learning via Attention Transfer for Incremental Speech Recognition,"Attention-based sequence-to-sequence automatic speech recognition (ASR) requires a significant delay to recognize long utterances because the output is generated after receiving entire input sequences. Although several studies recently proposed sequence mechanisms for incremental speech recognition (ISR), using different frameworks and learning algorithms is more complicated than the standard ASR model. One main reason is because the model needs to decide the incremental steps and learn the transcription that aligns with the current short speech segment. In this work, we investigate whether it is possible to employ the original architecture of attention-based ASR for ISR tasks by treating a full-utterance ASR as the teacher model and the ISR as the student model. We design an alternative student network that, instead of using a thinner or a shallower model, keeps the original architecture of the teacher model but with shorter sequences (few encoder and decoder states). Using attention transfer, the student network learns to mimic the same alignment between the current input short speech segments and the transcription. Our experiments show that by delaying the starting time of recognition process with about 1.7 sec, we can achieve comparable performance to one that needs to wait until the end."
"Integration of speech separation, diarization, and recognition for multi-speaker meetings: System description, comparison, and analysis","Multi-speaker speech recognition of unsegmented recordings has diverse applications such as meeting transcription and automatic subtitle generation. With technical advances in systems dealing with speech separation, speaker diarization, and automatic speech recognition (ASR) in the last decade, it has become possible to build pipelines that achieve reasonable error rates on this task. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end modular system for the LibriCSS meeting data, which combines independently trained separation, diarization, and recognition components, in that order. We study the effect of different state-of-the-art methods at each stage of the pipeline, and report results using task-specific metrics like SDR and DER, as well as downstream WER. Experiments indicate that the problem of overlapping speech for diarization and ASR can be effectively mitigated with the presence of a well-trained separation module. Our best system achieves a speaker-attributed WER of 12.7%, which is close to that of a non-overlapping ASR."
Internal Language Model Estimation for Domain-Adaptive End-to-End Speech Recognition,"The external language models (LM) integration remains a challenging task for end-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) which has no clear division between acoustic and language models. In this work, we propose an internal LM estimation (ILME) method to facilitate a more effective integration of the external LM with all pre-existing E2E models with no additional model training, including the most popular recurrent neural network transducer (RNN-T) and attention-based encoder-decoder (AED) models. Trained with audio-transcript pairs, an E2E model implicitly learns an internal LM that characterizes the training data in the source domain. With ILME, the internal LM scores of an E2E model are estimated and subtracted from the log-linear interpolation between the scores of the E2E model and the external LM. The internal LM scores are approximated as the output of an E2E model when eliminating its acoustic components. ILME can alleviate the domain mismatch between training and testing, or improve the multi-domain E2E ASR. Experimented with 30K-hour trained RNN-T and AED models, ILME achieves up to 15.5% and 6.8% relative word error rate reductions from Shallow Fusion on out-of-domain LibriSpeech and in-domain Microsoft production test sets, respectively."
Dynamic latency speech recognition with asynchronous revision,"In this work we propose an inference technique, asynchronous revision, to unify streaming and non-streaming speech recognition models. Specifically, we achieve dynamic latency with only one model by using arbitrary right context during inference. The model is composed of a stack of convolutional layers for audio encoding. In inference stage, the history states of encoder and decoder can be asynchronously revised to trade off between the latency and the accuracy of the model. To alleviate training and inference mismatch, we propose a training technique, segment cropping, which randomly splits input utterances into several segments with forward connections. This allows us to have dynamic latency speech recognition results with large improvements in accuracy. Experiments show that our dynamic latency model with asynchronous revision gives 8\%-14\% relative improvements over the streaming models."
DNN-Based Semantic Model for Rescoring N-best Speech Recognition List,"The word error rate (WER) of an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system increases when a mismatch occurs between the training and the testing conditions due to the noise, etc. In this case, the acoustic information can be less reliable. This work aims to improve ASR by modeling long-term semantic relations to compensate for distorted acoustic features. We propose to perform this through rescoring of the ASR N-best hypotheses list. To achieve this, we train a deep neural network (DNN). Our DNN rescoring model is aimed at selecting hypotheses that have better semantic consistency and therefore lower WER. We investigate two types of representations as part of input features to our DNN model: static word embeddings (from word2vec) and dynamic contextual embeddings (from BERT). Acoustic and linguistic features are also included. We perform experiments on the publicly available dataset TED-LIUM mixed with real noise. The proposed rescoring approaches give significant improvement of the WER over the ASR system without rescoring models in two noisy conditions and with n-gram and RNNLM."
Multitask Learning and Joint Optimization for Transformer-RNN-Transducer Speech Recognition,"Recently, several types of end-to-end speech recognition methods named transformer-transducer were introduced. According to those kinds of methods, transcription networks are generally modeled by transformer-based neural networks, while prediction networks could be modeled by either transformers or recurrent neural networks (RNN). This paper explores multitask learning, joint optimization, and joint decoding methods for transformer-RNN-transducer systems. Our proposed methods have the main advantage in that the model can maintain information on the large text corpus. We prove their effectiveness by performing experiments utilizing the well-known ESPNET toolkit for the widely used Librispeech datasets. We also show that the proposed methods can reduce word error rate (WER) by 16.6 % and 13.3 % for test-clean and test-other datasets, respectively, without changing the overall model structure nor exploiting an external LM."
Dual-decoder Transformer for Joint Automatic Speech Recognition and Multilingual Speech Translation,"We introduce dual-decoder Transformer, a new model architecture that jointly performs automatic speech recognition (ASR) and multilingual speech translation (ST). Our models are based on the original Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017) but consist of two decoders, each responsible for one task (ASR or ST). Our major contribution lies in how these decoders interact with each other: one decoder can attend to different information sources from the other via a dual-attention mechanism. We propose two variants of these architectures corresponding to two different levels of dependencies between the decoders, called the parallel and cross dual-decoder Transformers, respectively. Extensive experiments on the MuST-C dataset show that our models outperform the previously-reported highest translation performance in the multilingual settings, and outperform as well bilingual one-to-one results. Furthermore, our parallel models demonstrate no trade-off between ASR and ST compared to the vanilla multi-task architecture. Our code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/formiel/speech-translation."
Robust Raw Waveform Speech Recognition Using Relevance Weighted Representations,"Speech recognition in noisy and channel distorted scenarios is often challenging as the current acoustic modeling schemes are not adaptive to the changes in the signal distribution in the presence of noise. In this work, we develop a novel acoustic modeling framework for noise robust speech recognition based on relevance weighting mechanism. The relevance weighting is achieved using a sub-network approach that performs feature selection. A relevance sub-network is applied on the output of first layer of a convolutional network model operating on raw speech signals while a second relevance sub-network is applied on the second convolutional layer output. The relevance weights for the first layer correspond to an acoustic filterbank selection while the relevance weights in the second layer perform modulation filter selection. The model is trained for a speech recognition task on noisy and reverberant speech. The speech recognition experiments on multiple datasets (Aurora-4, CHiME-3, VOiCES) reveal that the incorporation of relevance weighting in the neural network architecture improves the speech recognition word error rates significantly (average relative improvements of 10% over the baseline systems)"
Directional ASR: A New Paradigm for E2E Multi-Speaker Speech Recognition with Source Localization,"This paper proposes a new paradigm for handling far-field multi-speaker data in an end-to-end neural network manner, called directional automatic speech recognition (D-ASR), which explicitly models source speaker locations. In D-ASR, the azimuth angle of the sources with respect to the microphone array is defined as a latent variable. This angle controls the quality of separation, which in turn determines the ASR performance. All three functionalities of D-ASR: localization, separation, and recognition are connected as a single differentiable neural network and trained solely based on ASR error minimization objectives. The advantages of D-ASR over existing methods are threefold: (1) it provides explicit speaker locations, (2) it improves the explainability factor, and (3) it achieves better ASR performance as the process is more streamlined. In addition, D-ASR does not require explicit direction of arrival (DOA) supervision like existing data-driven localization models, which makes it more appropriate for realistic data. For the case of two source mixtures, D-ASR achieves an average DOA prediction error of less than three degrees. It also outperforms a strong far-field multi-speaker end-to-end system in both separation quality and ASR performance."
Phoneme Based Neural Transducer for Large Vocabulary Speech Recognition,"To join the advantages of classical and end-to-end approaches for speech recognition, we present a simple, novel and competitive approach for phoneme-based neural transducer modeling. Different alignment label topologies are compared and word-end-based phoneme label augmentation is proposed to improve performance. Utilizing the local dependency of phonemes, we adopt a simplified neural network structure and a straightforward integration with the external word-level language model to preserve the consistency of seq-to-seq modeling. We also present a simple, stable and efficient training procedure using frame-wise cross-entropy loss. A phonetic context size of one is shown to be sufficient for the best performance. A simplified scheduled sampling approach is applied for further improvement and different decoding approaches are briefly compared. The overall performance of our best model is comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) results for the TED-LIUM Release 2 and Switchboard corpora."
Training Speech Recognition Models with Federated Learning: A Quality/Cost Framework,"We propose using federated learning, a decentralized on-device learning paradigm, to train speech recognition models. By performing epochs of training on a per-user basis, federated learning must incur the cost of dealing with non-IID data distributions, which are expected to negatively affect the quality of the trained model. We propose a framework by which the degree of non-IID-ness can be varied, consequently illustrating a trade-off between model quality and the computational cost of federated training, which we capture through a novel metric. Finally, we demonstrate that hyper-parameter optimization and appropriate use of variational noise are sufficient to compensate for the quality impact of non-IID distributions, while decreasing the cost."
Semi-Supervised Speech Recognition via Graph-based Temporal Classification,"Semi-supervised learning has demonstrated promising results in automatic speech recognition (ASR) by self-training using a seed ASR model with pseudo-labels generated for unlabeled data. The effectiveness of this approach largely relies on the pseudo-label accuracy, for which typically only the 1-best ASR hypothesis is used. However, alternative ASR hypotheses of an N-best list can provide more accurate labels for an unlabeled speech utterance and also reflect uncertainties of the seed ASR model. In this paper, we propose a generalized form of the connectionist temporal classification (CTC) objective that accepts a graph representation of the training labels. The newly proposed graph-based temporal classification (GTC) objective is applied for self-training with WFST-based supervision, which is generated from an N-best list of pseudo-labels. In this setup, GTC is used to learn not only a temporal alignment, similarly to CTC, but also a label alignment to obtain the optimal pseudo-label sequence from the weighted graph. Results show that this approach can effectively exploit an N-best list of pseudo-labels with associated scores, considerably outperforming standard pseudo-labeling, with ASR results approaching an oracle experiment in which the best hypotheses of the N-best lists are selected manually."
Speech-Based Emotion Recognition using Neural Networks and Information Visualization,"Emotions recognition is commonly employed for health assessment. However, the typical metric for evaluation in therapy is based on patient-doctor appraisal. This process can fall into the issue of subjectivity, while also requiring healthcare professionals to deal with copious amounts of information. Thus, machine learning algorithms can be a useful tool for the classification of emotions. While several models have been developed in this domain, there is a lack of userfriendly representations of the emotion classification systems for therapy. We propose a tool which enables users to take speech samples and identify a range of emotions (happy, sad, angry, surprised, neutral, clam, disgust, and fear) from audio elements through a machine learning model. The dashboard is designed based on local therapists' needs for intuitive representations of speech data in order to gain insights and informative analyses of their sessions with their patients."
Decoupling Pronunciation and Language for End-to-end Code-switching Automatic Speech Recognition,"Despite the recent significant advances witnessed in end-to-end (E2E) ASR system for code-switching, hunger for audio-text paired data limits the further improvement of the models' performance. In this paper, we propose a decoupled transformer model to use monolingual paired data and unpaired text data to alleviate the problem of code-switching data shortage. The model is decoupled into two parts: audio-to-phoneme (A2P) network and phoneme-to-text (P2T) network. The A2P network can learn acoustic pattern scenarios using large-scale monolingual paired data. Meanwhile, it generates multiple phoneme sequence candidates for single audio data in real-time during the training process. Then the generated phoneme-text paired data is used to train the P2T network. This network can be pre-trained with large amounts of external unpaired text data. By using monolingual data and unpaired text data, the decoupled transformer model reduces the high dependency on code-switching paired training data of E2E model to a certain extent. Finally, the two networks are optimized jointly through attention fusion. We evaluate the proposed method on the public Mandarin-English code-switching dataset. Compared with our transformer baseline, the proposed method achieves 18.14% relative mix error rate reduction."
CASS-NAT: CTC Alignment-based Single Step Non-autoregressive Transformer for Speech Recognition,"We propose a CTC alignment-based single step non-autoregressive transformer (CASS-NAT) for speech recognition. Specifically, the CTC alignment contains the information of (a) the number of tokens for decoder input, and (b) the time span of acoustics for each token. The information are used to extract acoustic representation for each token in parallel, referred to as token-level acoustic embedding which substitutes the word embedding in autoregressive transformer (AT) to achieve parallel generation in decoder. During inference, an error-based alignment sampling method is proposed to be applied to the CTC output space, reducing the WER and retaining the parallelism as well. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves WERs of 3.8%/9.1% on Librispeech test clean/other dataset without an external LM, and a CER of 5.8% on Aishell1 Mandarin corpus, respectively1. Compared to the AT baseline, the CASS-NAT has a performance reduction on WER, but is 51.2x faster in terms of RTF. When decoding with an oracle CTC alignment, the lower bound of WER without LM reaches 2.3% on the test-clean set, indicating the potential of the proposed method."
Transformer in action: a comparative study of transformer-based acoustic models for large scale speech recognition applications,"In this paper, we summarize the application of transformer and its streamable variant, Emformer based acoustic model for large scale speech recognition applications. We compare the transformer based acoustic models with their LSTM counterparts on industrial scale tasks. Specifically, we compare Emformer with latency-controlled BLSTM (LCBLSTM) on medium latency tasks and LSTM on low latency tasks. On a low latency voice assistant task, Emformer gets 24% to 26% relative word error rate reductions (WERRs). For medium latency scenarios, comparing with LCBLSTM with similar model size and latency, Emformer gets significant WERR across four languages in video captioning datasets with 2-3 times inference real-time factors reduction."
CopyPaste: An Augmentation Method for Speech Emotion Recognition,"Data augmentation is a widely used strategy for training robust machine learning models. It partially alleviates the problem of limited data for tasks like speech emotion recognition (SER), where collecting data is expensive and challenging. This study proposes CopyPaste, a perceptually motivated novel augmentation procedure for SER. Assuming that the presence of emotions other than neutral dictates a speaker's overall perceived emotion in a recording, concatenation of an emotional (emotion E) and a neutral utterance can still be labeled with emotion E. We hypothesize that SER performance can be improved using these concatenated utterances in model training. To verify this, three CopyPaste schemes are tested on two deep learning models: one trained independently and another using transfer learning from an x-vector model, a speaker recognition model. We observed that all three CopyPaste schemes improve SER performance on all the three datasets considered: MSP-Podcast, Crema-D, and IEMOCAP. Additionally, CopyPaste performs better than noise augmentation and, using them together improves the SER performance further. Our experiments on noisy test sets suggested that CopyPaste is effective even in noisy test conditions."
Multitask Training with Text Data for End-to-End Speech Recognition,"We propose a multitask training method for attention-based end-to-end speech recognition models. We regularize the decoder in a listen, attend, and spell model by multitask training it on both audio-text and text-only data. Trained on the 100-hour subset of LibriSpeech, the proposed method, without requiring an additional language model, leads to an 11% relative performance improvement over the baseline and approaches the performance of language model shallow fusion on the test-clean evaluation set. We observe a similar trend on the whole 960-hour LibriSpeech training set. Analyses of different types of errors and sample output sentences demonstrate that the proposed method can incorporate language level information, suggesting its effectiveness in real-world applications."
Align-Refine: Non-Autoregressive Speech Recognition via Iterative Realignment,"Non-autoregressive models greatly improve decoding speed over typical sequence-to-sequence models, but suffer from degraded performance. Infilling and iterative refinement models make up some of this gap by editing the outputs of a non-autoregressive model, but are constrained in the edits that they can make. We propose iterative realignment, where refinements occur over latent alignments rather than output sequence space. We demonstrate this in speech recognition with Align-Refine, an end-to-end Transformer-based model which refines connectionist temporal classification (CTC) alignments to allow length-changing insertions and deletions. Align-Refine outperforms Imputer and Mask-CTC, matching an autoregressive baseline on WSJ at 1/14th the real-time factor and attaining a LibriSpeech test-other WER of 9.0% without an LM. Our model is strong even in one iteration with a shallower decoder."
Emotion controllable speech synthesis using emotion-unlabeled dataset with the assistance of cross-domain speech emotion recognition,"Neural text-to-speech (TTS) approaches generally require a huge number of high quality speech data, which makes it difficult to obtain such a dataset with extra emotion labels. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for emotional TTS synthesis on a TTS dataset without emotion labels. Specifically, our proposed method consists of a cross-domain speech emotion recognition (SER) model and an emotional TTS model. Firstly, we train the cross-domain SER model on both SER and TTS datasets. Then, we use emotion labels on the TTS dataset predicted by the trained SER model to build an auxiliary SER task and jointly train it with the TTS model. Experimental results show that our proposed method can generate speech with the specified emotional expressiveness and nearly no hindering on the speech quality."
Decentralizing Feature Extraction with Quantum Convolutional Neural Network for Automatic Speech Recognition,"We propose a novel decentralized feature extraction approach in federated learning to address privacy-preservation issues for speech recognition. It is built upon a quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) composed of a quantum circuit encoder for feature extraction, and a recurrent neural network (RNN) based end-to-end acoustic model (AM). To enhance model parameter protection in a decentralized architecture, an input speech is first up-streamed to a quantum computing server to extract Mel-spectrogram, and the corresponding convolutional features are encoded using a quantum circuit algorithm with random parameters. The encoded features are then down-streamed to the local RNN model for the final recognition. The proposed decentralized framework takes advantage of the quantum learning progress to secure models and to avoid privacy leakage attacks. Testing on the Google Speech Commands Dataset, the proposed QCNN encoder attains a competitive accuracy of 95.12% in a decentralized model, which is better than the previous architectures using centralized RNN models with convolutional features. We also conduct an in-depth study of different quantum circuit encoder architectures to provide insights into designing QCNN-based feature extractors. Neural saliency analyses demonstrate a correlation between the proposed QCNN features, class activation maps, and input spectrograms. We provide an implementation for future studies."
IR-GAN: Room Impulse Response Generator for Far-field Speech Recognition,"We present a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based room impulse response generator (IR-GAN) for generating realistic synthetic room impulse responses (RIRs). IR-GAN extracts acoustic parameters from captured real-world RIRs and uses these parameters to generate new synthetic RIRs. We use these generated synthetic RIRs to improve far-field automatic speech recognition in new environments that are different from the ones used in training datasets. In particular, we augment the far-field speech training set by convolving our synthesized RIRs with a clean LibriSpeech dataset. We evaluate the quality of our synthetic RIRs on the real-world LibriSpeech test set created using real-world RIRs from the BUT ReverbDB and AIR datasets. Our IR-GAN reports up to an 8.95% lower error rate than Geometric Acoustic Simulator (GAS) in far-field speech recognition benchmarks. We further improve the performance when we combine our synthetic RIRs with synthetic impulse responses generated using GAS. This combination can reduce the word error rate by up to 14.3% in far-field speech recognition benchmarks."
Learning Fine-Grained Cross Modality Excitement for Speech Emotion Recognition,"Speech emotion recognition is a challenging task because the emotion expression is complex, multimodal and fine-grained. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal deep learning approach to perform fine-grained emotion recognition from real-life speeches. We design a temporal alignment mean-max pooling mechanism to capture the subtle and fine-grained emotions implied in every utterance. In addition, we propose a cross modality excitement module to conduct sample-specific adjustment on cross modality embeddings and adaptively recalibrate the corresponding values by its aligned latent features from the other modality. Our proposed model is evaluated on two well-known real-world speech emotion recognition datasets. The results demonstrate that our approach is superior on the prediction tasks for multimodal speech utterances, and it outperforms a wide range of baselines in terms of prediction accuracy. Further more, we conduct detailed ablation studies to show that our temporal alignment mean-max pooling mechanism and cross modality excitement significantly contribute to the promising results. In order to encourage the research reproducibility, we make the code publicly available at \url{https://github.com/tal-ai/FG_CME.git}."
Speech Activity Detection Based on Multilingual Speech Recognition System,"To better model the contextual information and increase the generalization ability of Speech Activity Detection (SAD) system, this paper leverages a multi-lingual Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system to perform SAD. Sequence discriminative training of Acoustic Model (AM) using Lattice-Free Maximum Mutual Information (LF-MMI) loss function, effectively extracts the contextual information of the input acoustic frame. Multi-lingual AM training, causes the robustness to noise and language variabilities. The index of maximum output posterior is considered as a frame-level speech/non-speech decision function. Majority voting and logistic regression are applied to fuse the language-dependent decisions. The multi-lingual ASR is trained on 18 languages of BABEL datasets and the built SAD is evaluated on 3 different languages. On out-of-domain datasets, the proposed SAD model shows significantly better performance with respect to baseline models. On the Ester2 dataset, without using any in-domain data, this model outperforms the WebRTC, phoneme recognizer based VAD (Phn Rec), and Pyannote baselines (respectively by 7.1, 1.7, and 2.7% absolute) in Detection Error Rate (DetER) metrics. Similarly, on the LiveATC dataset, this model outperforms the WebRTC, Phn Rec, and Pyannote baselines (respectively by 6.4, 10.0, and 3.7% absolutely) in DetER metrics."
Transformer-based End-to-End Speech Recognition with Local Dense Synthesizer Attention,"Recently, several studies reported that dot-product selfattention (SA) may not be indispensable to the state-of-theart Transformer models. Motivated by the fact that dense synthesizer attention (DSA), which dispenses with dot products and pairwise interactions, achieved competitive results in many language processing tasks, in this paper, we first propose a DSA-based speech recognition, as an alternative to SA. To reduce the computational complexity and improve the performance, we further propose local DSA (LDSA) to restrict the attention scope of DSA to a local range around the current central frame for speech recognition. Finally, we combine LDSA with SA to extract the local and global information simultaneously. Experimental results on the Ai-shell1 Mandarine speech recognition corpus show that the proposed LDSA-Transformer achieves a character error rate (CER) of 6.49%, which is slightly better than that of the SA-Transformer. Meanwhile, the LDSA-Transformer requires less computation than the SATransformer. The proposed combination method not only achieves a CER of 6.18%, which significantly outperforms the SA-Transformer, but also has roughly the same number of parameters and computational complexity as the latter. The implementation of the multi-head LDSA is available at https://github.com/mlxu995/multihead-LDSA."
Enriching Under-Represented Named-Entities To Improve Speech Recognition Performance,"Automatic speech recognition (ASR) for under-represented named-entity (UR-NE) is challenging due to such named-entities (NE) have insufficient instances and poor contextual coverage in the training data to learn reliable estimates and representations. In this paper, we propose approaches to enriching UR-NEs to improve speech recognition performance. Specifically, our first priority is to ensure those UR-NEs to appear in the word lattice if there is any. To this end, we make exemplar utterances for those UR-NEs according to their categories (e.g. location, person, organization, etc.), ending up with an improved language model (LM) that boosts the UR-NE occurrence in the word lattice. With more UR-NEs appearing in the lattice, we then boost the recognition performance through lattice rescoring methods. We first enrich the representations of UR-NEs in a pre-trained recurrent neural network LM (RNNLM) by borrowing the embedding representations of the rich-represented NEs (RR-NEs), yielding the lattices that statistically favor the UR-NEs. Finally, we directly boost the likelihood scores of the utterances containing UR-NEs and gain further performance improvement."
Improving Streaming Automatic Speech Recognition With Non-Streaming Model Distillation On Unsupervised Data,"Streaming end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) models are widely used on smart speakers and on-device applications. Since these models are expected to transcribe speech with minimal latency, they are constrained to be causal with no future context, compared to their non-streaming counterparts. Consequently, streaming models usually perform worse than non-streaming models. We propose a novel and effective learning method by leveraging a non-streaming ASR model as a teacher to generate transcripts on an arbitrarily large data set, which is then used to distill knowledge into streaming ASR models. This way, we scale the training of streaming models to up to 3 million hours of YouTube audio. Experiments show that our approach can significantly reduce the word error rate (WER) of RNNT models not only on LibriSpeech but also on YouTube data in four languages. For example, in French, we are able to reduce the WER by 16.4% relatively to a baseline streaming model by leveraging a non-streaming teacher model trained on the same amount of labeled data as the baseline."
Perceptual Loss based Speech Denoising with an ensemble of Audio Pattern Recognition and Self-Supervised Models,"Deep learning based speech denoising still suffers from the challenge of improving perceptual quality of enhanced signals. We introduce a generalized framework called Perceptual Ensemble Regularization Loss (PERL) built on the idea of perceptual losses. Perceptual loss discourages distortion to certain speech properties and we analyze it using six large-scale pre-trained models: speaker classification, acoustic model, speaker embedding, emotion classification, and two self-supervised speech encoders (PASE+, wav2vec 2.0). We first build a strong baseline (w/o PERL) using Conformer Transformer Networks on the popular enhancement benchmark called VCTK-DEMAND. Using auxiliary models one at a time, we find acoustic event and self-supervised model PASE+ to be most effective. Our best model (PERL-AE) only uses acoustic event model (utilizing AudioSet) to outperform state-of-the-art methods on major perceptual metrics. To explore if denoising can leverage full framework, we use all networks but find that our seven-loss formulation suffers from the challenges of Multi-Task Learning. Finally, we report a critical observation that state-of-the-art Multi-Task weight learning methods cannot outperform hand tuning, perhaps due to challenges of domain mismatch and weak complementarity of losses."
Multilingual Approach to Joint Speech and Accent Recognition with DNN-HMM Framework,"Human can recognize speech, as well as the peculiar accent of the speech simultaneously. However, present state-of-the-art ASR system can rarely do that. In this paper, we propose a multilingual approach to recognizing English speech, and related accent that speaker conveys using DNN-HMM framework. Specifically, we assume different accents of English as different languages. We then merge them together and train a multilingual ASR system. During decoding, we conduct two experiments. One is a monolingual ASR-based decoding, with the accent information embedded at phone level, realizing word-based accent recognition (AR), and the other is a multilingual ASR-based decoding, realizing an approximated utterance-based AR. Experimental results on an 8-accent English speech recognition show both methods can yield WERs close to the conventional ASR systems that completely ignore the accent, as well as desired AR accuracy. Besides, we conduct extensive analysis for the proposed method, such as transfer learning without-domain data exploitation, cross-accent recognition confusion, as well as characteristics of accented-word."
Self-training and Pre-training are Complementary for Speech Recognition,"Self-training and unsupervised pre-training have emerged as effective approaches to improve speech recognition systems using unlabeled data. However, it is not clear whether they learn similar patterns or if they can be effectively combined. In this paper, we show that pseudo-labeling and pre-training with wav2vec 2.0 are complementary in a variety of labeled data setups. Using just 10 minutes of labeled data from Libri-light as well as 53k hours of unlabeled data from LibriVox achieves WERs of 3.0%/5.2% on the clean and other test sets of Librispeech - rivaling the best published systems trained on 960 hours of labeled data only a year ago. Training on all labeled data of Librispeech achieves WERs of 1.5%/3.1%."
Confidence Estimation for Attention-based Sequence-to-sequence Models for Speech Recognition,"For various speech-related tasks, confidence scores from a speech recogniser are a useful measure to assess the quality of transcriptions. In traditional hidden Markov model-based automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems, confidence scores can be reliably obtained from word posteriors in decoding lattices. However, for an ASR system with an auto-regressive decoder, such as an attention-based sequence-to-sequence model, computing word posteriors is difficult. An obvious alternative is to use the decoder softmax probability as the model confidence. In this paper, we first examine how some commonly used regularisation methods influence the softmax-based confidence scores and study the overconfident behaviour of end-to-end models. Then we propose a lightweight and effective approach named confidence estimation module (CEM) on top of an existing end-to-end ASR model. Experiments on LibriSpeech show that CEM can mitigate the overconfidence problem and can produce more reliable confidence scores with and without shallow fusion of a language model. Further analysis shows that CEM generalises well to speech from a moderately mismatched domain and can potentially improve downstream tasks such as semi-supervised learning."
Developing Real-time Streaming Transformer Transducer for Speech Recognition on Large-scale Dataset,"Recently, Transformer based end-to-end models have achieved great success in many areas including speech recognition. However, compared to LSTM models, the heavy computational cost of the Transformer during inference is a key issue to prevent their applications. In this work, we explored the potential of Transformer Transducer (T-T) models for the fist pass decoding with low latency and fast speed on a large-scale dataset. We combine the idea of Transformer-XL and chunk-wise streaming processing to design a streamable Transformer Transducer model. We demonstrate that T-T outperforms the hybrid model, RNN Transducer (RNN-T), and streamable Transformer attention-based encoder-decoder model in the streaming scenario. Furthermore, the runtime cost and latency can be optimized with a relatively small look-ahead."
LSTM-LM with Long-Term History for First-Pass Decoding in Conversational Speech Recognition,"LSTM language models (LSTM-LMs) have been proven to be powerful and yielded significant performance improvements over count based n-gram LMs in modern speech recognition systems. Due to its infinite history states and computational load, most previous studies focus on applying LSTM-LMs in the second-pass for rescoring purpose. Recent work shows that it is feasible and computationally affordable to adopt the LSTM-LMs in the first-pass decoding within a dynamic (or tree based) decoder framework. In this work, the LSTM-LM is composed with a WFST decoder on-the-fly for the first-pass decoding. Furthermore, motivated by the long-term history nature of LSTM-LMs, the use of context beyond the current utterance is explored for the first-pass decoding in conversational speech recognition. The context information is captured by the hidden states of LSTM-LMs across utterance and can be used to guide the first-pass search effectively. The experimental results in our internal meeting transcription system show that significant performance improvements can be obtained by incorporating the contextual information with LSTM-LMs in the first-pass decoding, compared to applying the contextual information in the second-pass rescoring."
Dynamic Layer Customization for Noise Robust Speech Emotion Recognition in Heterogeneous Condition Training,"Robustness to environmental noise is important to creating automatic speech emotion recognition systems that are deployable in the real world. Prior work on noise robustness has assumed that systems would not make use of sample-by-sample training noise conditions, or that they would have access to unlabelled testing data to generalize across noise conditions. We avoid these assumptions and introduce the resulting task as heterogeneous condition training. We show that with full knowledge of the test noise conditions, we can improve performance by dynamically routing samples to specialized feature encoders for each noise condition, and with partial knowledge, we can use known noise conditions and domain adaptation algorithms to train systems that generalize well to unseen noise conditions. We then extend these improvements to the multimodal setting by dynamically routing samples to maintain temporal ordering, resulting in significant improvements over approaches that do not specialize or generalize based on noise type."
Towards End-to-End Training of Automatic Speech Recognition for Nigerian Pidgin,"Nigerian Pidgin remains one of the most popular languages in West Africa. With at least 75 million speakers along the West African coast, the language has spread to diasporic communities through Nigerian immigrants in England, Canada, and America, amongst others. In contrast, the language remains an under-resourced one in the field of natural language processing, particularly on speech recognition and translation tasks. In this work, we present the first parallel (speech-to-text) data on Nigerian pidgin. We also trained the first end-to-end speech recognition system (QuartzNet and Jasper model) on this language which were both optimized using Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss. With baseline results, we were able to achieve a low word error rate (WER) of 0.77% using a greedy decoder on our dataset. Finally, we open-source the data and code along with this publication in order to encourage future research in this direction."
Emformer: Efficient Memory Transformer Based Acoustic Model For Low Latency Streaming Speech Recognition,"This paper proposes an efficient memory transformer Emformer for low latency streaming speech recognition. In Emformer, the long-range history context is distilled into an augmented memory bank to reduce self-attention's computation complexity. A cache mechanism saves the computation for the key and value in self-attention for the left context. Emformer applies a parallelized block processing in training to support low latency models. We carry out experiments on benchmark LibriSpeech data. Under average latency of 960 ms, Emformer gets WER 2.50\% on test-clean and 5.62\% on test-other. Comparing with a strong baseline augmented memory transformer (AM-TRF), Emformer gets 4.6 folds training speedup and 18\% relative real-time factor (RTF) reduction in decoding with relative WER reduction 17\% on test-clean and 9\% on test-other. For a low latency scenario with an average latency of 80 ms, Emformer achieves WER 3.01\% on test-clean and 7.09\% on test-other. Comparing with the LSTM baseline with the same latency and model size, Emformer gets relative WER reduction 9\% and 16\% on test-clean and test-other, respectively."
VenoMave: Targeted Poisoning Against Speech Recognition,"Despite remarkable improvements, automatic speech recognition is susceptible to adversarial perturbations. Compared to standard machine learning architectures, these attacks are significantly more challenging, especially since the inputs to a speech recognition system are time series that contain both acoustic and linguistic properties of speech. Extracting all recognition-relevant information requires more complex pipelines and an ensemble of specialized components. Consequently, an attacker needs to consider the entire pipeline. In this paper, we present VENOMAVE, the first training-time poisoning attack against speech recognition. Similar to the predominantly studied evasion attacks, we pursue the same goal: leading the system to an incorrect and attacker-chosen transcription of a target audio waveform. In contrast to evasion attacks, however, we assume that the attacker can only manipulate a small part of the training data without altering the target audio waveform at runtime. We evaluate our attack on two datasets: TIDIGITS and Speech Commands. When poisoning less than 0.17% of the dataset, VENOMAVE achieves attack success rates of more than 80.0%, without access to the victim's network architecture or hyperparameters. In a more realistic scenario, when the target audio waveform is played over the air in different rooms, VENOMAVE maintains a success rate of up to 73.3%. Finally, VENOMAVE achieves an attack transferability rate of 36.4% between two different model architectures."
Pushing the Limits of Semi-Supervised Learning for Automatic Speech Recognition,"We employ a combination of recent developments in semi-supervised learning for automatic speech recognition to obtain state-of-the-art results on LibriSpeech utilizing the unlabeled audio of the Libri-Light dataset. More precisely, we carry out noisy student training with SpecAugment using giant Conformer models pre-trained using wav2vec 2.0 pre-training. By doing so, we are able to achieve word-error-rates (WERs) 1.4%/2.6% on the LibriSpeech test/test-other sets against the current state-of-the-art WERs 1.7%/3.3%."
Multi-Window Data Augmentation Approach for Speech Emotion Recognition,"We present a Multi-Window Data Augmentation (MWA-SER) approach for speech emotion recognition. MWA-SER is a unimodal approach that focuses on two key concepts; designing the speech augmentation method and building the deep learning model to recognize the underlying emotion of an audio signal. Our proposed multi-window augmentation approach generates additional data samples from the speech signal by employing multiple window sizes in the audio feature extraction process. We show that our augmentation method, combined with a deep learning model, improves speech emotion recognition performance. We evaluate the performance of our approach on three benchmark datasets: IEMOCAP, SAVEE, and RAVDESS. We show that the multi-window model improves the SER performance and outperforms a single-window model. The notion of finding the best window size is an essential step in audio feature extraction. We perform extensive experimental evaluations to find the best window choice and explore the windowing effect for SER analysis."
Multimodal Speech Recognition with Unstructured Audio Masking,"Visual context has been shown to be useful for automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems when the speech signal is noisy or corrupted. Previous work, however, has only demonstrated the utility of visual context in an unrealistic setting, where a fixed set of words are systematically masked in the audio. In this paper, we simulate a more realistic masking scenario during model training, called RandWordMask, where the masking can occur for any word segment. Our experiments on the Flickr 8K Audio Captions Corpus show that multimodal ASR can generalize to recover different types of masked words in this unstructured masking setting. Moreover, our analysis shows that our models are capable of attending to the visual signal when the audio signal is corrupted. These results show that multimodal ASR systems can leverage the visual signal in more generalized noisy scenarios."
Lightweight End-to-End Speech Recognition from Raw Audio Data Using Sinc-Convolutions,"Many end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems still rely on pre-processed frequency-domain features that are handcrafted to emulate the human hearing. Our work is motivated by recent advances in integrated learnable feature extraction. For this, we propose Lightweight Sinc-Convolutions (LSC) that integrate Sinc-convolutions with depthwise convolutions as a low-parameter machine-learnable feature extraction for end-to-end ASR systems.  We integrated LSC into the hybrid CTC/attention architecture for evaluation. The resulting end-to-end model shows smooth convergence behaviour that is further improved by applying SpecAugment in time-domain. We also discuss filter-level improvements, such as using log-compression as activation function. Our model achieves a word error rate of 10.7% on the TEDlium v2 test dataset, surpassing the corresponding architecture with log-mel filterbank features by an absolute 1.9%, but only has 21% of its model size."
End-to-end Triplet Loss based Emotion Embedding System for Speech Emotion Recognition,"In this paper, an end-to-end neural embedding system based on triplet loss and residual learning has been proposed for speech emotion recognition. The proposed system learns the embeddings from the emotional information of the speech utterances. The learned embeddings are used to recognize the emotions portrayed by given speech samples of various lengths. The proposed system implements Residual Neural Network architecture. It is trained using softmax pre-training and triplet loss function. The weights between the fully connected and embedding layers of the trained network are used to calculate the embedding values. The embedding representations of various emotions are mapped onto a hyperplane, and the angles among them are computed using the cosine similarity. These angles are utilized to classify a new speech sample into its appropriate emotion class. The proposed system has demonstrated 91.67% and 64.44% accuracy while recognizing emotions for RAVDESS and IEMOCAP dataset, respectively."
Gender domain adaptation for automatic speech recognition task,"This paper is focused on the finetuning of acoustic models for speaker adaptation goals on a given gender. We pretrained the Transformer baseline model on Librispeech-960 and conduct experiments with finetuning on the gender-specific test subsets and. In general, we do not obtain essential WER reduction by finetuning techniques by this approach. We achieved up to ~5% lower word error rate on the male subset and 3% on the female subset if the layers in the encoder and decoder are not frozen, but the tuning is started from the last checkpoints. Moreover, we adapted our base model on the full L2 Arctic dataset of accented speech and fine-tuned it for particular speakers and male and female genders separately. The models trained on the gender subsets obtained 1-2% higher accuracy when compared to the model tuned on the whole L2 Arctic dataset. Finally, we tested the concatenation of the pretrained x-vector voice embeddings and embeddings from a conventional encoder, but its gain in accuracy is not significant."
Population Based Training for Data Augmentation and Regularization in Speech Recognition,"Varying data augmentation policies and regularization over the course of optimization has led to performance improvements over using fixed values. We show that population based training is a useful tool to continuously search those hyperparameters, within a fixed budget. This greatly simplifies the experimental burden and computational cost of finding such optimal schedules. We experiment in speech recognition by optimizing SpecAugment this way, as well as dropout. It compares favorably to a baseline that does not change those hyperparameters over the course of training, with an 8% relative WER improvement. We obtain 5.18% word error rate on LibriSpeech's test-other."
Domain Adversarial Neural Networks for Dysarthric Speech Recognition,"Speech recognition systems have improved dramatically over the last few years, however, their performance is significantly degraded for the cases of accented or impaired speech. This work explores domain adversarial neural networks (DANN) for speaker-independent speech recognition on the UAS dataset of dysarthric speech. The classification task on 10 spoken digits is performed using an end-to-end CNN taking raw audio as input. The results are compared to a speaker-adaptive (SA) model as well as speaker-dependent (SD) and multi-task learning models (MTL). The experiments conducted in this paper show that DANN achieves an absolute recognition rate of 74.91% and outperforms the baseline by 12.18%. Additionally, the DANN model achieves comparable results to the SA model's recognition rate of 77.65%. We also observe that when labelled dysarthric speech data is available DANN and MTL perform similarly, but when they are not DANN performs better than MTL."
Super-Human Performance in Online Low-latency Recognition of Conversational Speech,"Achieving super-human performance in recognizing human speech has been a goal for several decades, as researchers have worked on increasingly challenging tasks. In the 1990's it was discovered, that conversational speech between two humans turns out to be considerably more difficult than read speech as hesitations, disfluencies, false starts and sloppy articulation complicate acoustic processing and require robust handling of acoustic, lexical and language context, jointly. Early attempts with statistical models could only reach error rates over 50% and far from human performance (WER of around 5.5%). Neural hybrid models and recent attention-based encoder-decoder models have considerably improved performance as such contexts can now be learned in an integral fashion. However, processing such contexts requires an entire utterance presentation and thus introduces unwanted delays before a recognition result can be output. In this paper, we address performance as well as latency. We present results for a system that can achieve super-human performance (at a WER of 5.0%, over the Switchboard conversational benchmark) at a word based latency of only 1 second behind a speaker's speech. The system uses multiple attention-based encoder-decoder networks integrated within a novel low latency incremental inference approach."
Transformer Transducer: One Model Unifying Streaming and Non-streaming Speech Recognition,"In this paper we present a Transformer-Transducer model architecture and a training technique to unify streaming and non-streaming speech recognition models into one model. The model is composed of a stack of transformer layers for audio encoding with no lookahead or right context and an additional stack of transformer layers on top trained with variable right context. In inference time, the context length for the variable context layers can be changed to trade off the latency and the accuracy of the model. We also show that we can run this model in a Y-model architecture with the top layers running in parallel in low latency and high latency modes. This allows us to have streaming speech recognition results with limited latency and delayed speech recognition results with large improvements in accuracy (20% relative improvement for voice-search task). We show that with limited right context (1-2 seconds of audio) and small additional latency (50-100 milliseconds) at the end of decoding, we can achieve similar accuracy with models using unlimited audio right context. We also present optimizations for audio and label encoders to speed up the inference in streaming and non-streaming speech decoding."
Fine-Grained Grounding for Multimodal Speech Recognition,"Multimodal automatic speech recognition systems integrate information from images to improve speech recognition quality, by grounding the speech in the visual context. While visual signals have been shown to be useful for recovering entities that have been masked in the audio, these models should be capable of recovering a broader range of word types. Existing systems rely on global visual features that represent the entire image, but localizing the relevant regions of the image will make it possible to recover a larger set of words, such as adjectives and verbs. In this paper, we propose a model that uses finer-grained visual information from different parts of the image, using automatic object proposals. In experiments on the Flickr8K Audio Captions Corpus, we find that our model improves over approaches that use global visual features, that the proposals enable the model to recover entities and other related words, such as adjectives, and that improvements are due to the model's ability to localize the correct proposals."
Improving Vietnamese Named Entity Recognition from Speech Using Word Capitalization and Punctuation Recovery Models,"Studies on the Named Entity Recognition (NER) task have shown outstanding results that reach human parity on input texts with correct text formattings, such as with proper punctuation and capitalization. However, such conditions are not available in applications where the input is speech, because the text is generated from a speech recognition system (ASR), and that the system does not consider the text formatting. In this paper, we (1) presented the first Vietnamese speech dataset for NER task, and (2) the first pre-trained public large-scale monolingual language model for Vietnamese that achieved the new state-of-the-art for the Vietnamese NER task by 1.3% absolute F1 score comparing to the latest study. And finally, (3) we proposed a new pipeline for NER task from speech that overcomes the text formatting problem by introducing a text capitalization and punctuation recovery model (CaPu) into the pipeline. The model takes input text from an ASR system and performs two tasks at the same time, producing proper text formatting that helps to improve NER performance. Experimental results indicated that the CaPu model helps to improve by nearly 4% of F1-score."
Embedded Emotions -- A Data Driven Approach to Learn Transferable Feature Representations from Raw Speech Input for Emotion Recognition,"Traditional approaches to automatic emotion recognition are relying on the application of handcrafted features. More recently however the advent of deep learning enabled algorithms to learn meaningful representations of input data automatically. In this paper, we investigate the applicability of transferring knowledge learned from large text and audio corpora to the task of automatic emotion recognition. To evaluate the practicability of our approach, we are taking part in this year's Interspeech ComParE Elderly Emotion Sub-Challenge, where the goal is to classify spoken narratives of elderly people with respect to the emotion of the speaker. Our results show that the learned feature representations can be effectively applied for classifying emotions from spoken language. We found the performance of the features extracted from the audio signal to be not as consistent as those that have been extracted from the transcripts. While the acoustic features achieved best in class results on the development set, when compared to the baseline systems, their performance dropped considerably on the test set of the challenge. The features extracted from the text form, however, are showing promising results on both sets and are outperforming the official baseline by 5.7 percentage points unweighted average recall."
A Crowdsourced Open-Source Kazakh Speech Corpus and Initial Speech Recognition Baseline,"We present an open-source speech corpus for the Kazakh language. The Kazakh speech corpus (KSC) contains around 332 hours of transcribed audio comprising over 153,000 utterances spoken by participants from different regions and age groups, as well as both genders. It was carefully inspected by native Kazakh speakers to ensure high quality. The KSC is the largest publicly available database developed to advance various Kazakh speech and language processing applications. In this paper, we first describe the data collection and preprocessing procedures followed by a description of the database specifications. We also share our experience and challenges faced during the database construction, which might benefit other researchers planning to build a speech corpus for a low-resource language. To demonstrate the reliability of the database, we performed preliminary speech recognition experiments. The experimental results imply that the quality of audio and transcripts is promising (2.8% character error rate and 8.7% word error rate on the test set). To enable experiment reproducibility and ease the corpus usage, we also released an ESPnet recipe for our speech recognition models."
End-to-End Speech Recognition and Disfluency Removal,"Disfluency detection is usually an intermediate step between an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system and a downstream task. By contrast, this paper aims to investigate the task of end-to-end speech recognition and disfluency removal. We specifically explore whether it is possible to train an ASR model to directly map disfluent speech into fluent transcripts, without relying on a separate disfluency detection model. We show that end-to-end models do learn to directly generate fluent transcripts; however, their performance is slightly worse than a baseline pipeline approach consisting of an ASR system and a disfluency detection model. We also propose two new metrics that can be used for evaluating integrated ASR and disfluency models. The findings of this paper can serve as a benchmark for further research on the task of end-to-end speech recognition and disfluency removal in the future."
End-to-End Bengali Speech Recognition,"Bengali is a prominent language of the Indian subcontinent. However, while many state-of-the-art acoustic models exist for prominent languages spoken in the region, research and resources for Bengali are few and far between. In this work, we apply CTC based CNN-RNN networks, a prominent deep learning based end-to-end automatic speech recognition technique, to the Bengali ASR task. We also propose and evaluate the applicability and efficacy of small 7x3 and 3x3 convolution kernels which are prominently used in the computer vision domain primarily because of their FLOPs and parameter efficient nature. We propose two CNN blocks, 2-layer Block A and 4-layer Block B, with the first layer comprising of 7x3 kernel and the subsequent layers comprising solely of 3x3 kernels. Using the publicly available Large Bengali ASR Training data set, we benchmark and evaluate the performance of seven deep neural network configurations of varying complexities and depth on the Bengali ASR task. Our best model, with Block B, has a WER of 13.67, having an absolute reduction of 1.39% over comparable model with larger convolution kernels of size 41x11 and 21x11."
Persian Ezafe Recognition Using Transformers and Its Role in Part-Of-Speech Tagging,"Ezafe is a grammatical particle in some Iranian languages that links two words together. Regardless of the important information it conveys, it is almost always not indicated in Persian script, resulting in mistakes in reading complex sentences and errors in natural language processing tasks. In this paper, we experiment with different machine learning methods to achieve state-of-the-art results in the task of ezafe recognition. Transformer-based methods, BERT and XLMRoBERTa, achieve the best results, the latter achieving 2.68% F1-score more than the previous state-of-the-art. We, moreover, use ezafe information to improve Persian part-of-speech tagging results and show that such information will not be useful to transformer-based methods and explain why that might be the case."
Optimizing Speech Emotion Recognition using Manta-Ray Based Feature Selection,"Emotion recognition from audio signals has been regarded as a challenging task in signal processing as it can be considered as a collection of static and dynamic classification tasks. Recognition of emotions from speech data has been heavily relied upon end-to-end feature extraction and classification using machine learning models, though the absence of feature selection and optimization have restrained the performance of these methods. Recent studies have shown that Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) have been emerged as one of the most relied feature extraction methods, though it circumscribes the accuracy of classification with a very small feature dimension. In this paper, we propose that the concatenation of features, extracted by using different existing feature extraction methods can not only boost the classification accuracy but also expands the possibility of efficient feature selection. We have used Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) apart from the MFCC feature extraction method, before feature merging. Besides, we have performed a novel application of Manta Ray optimization in speech emotion recognition tasks that resulted in a state-of-the-art result in this field. We have evaluated the performance of our model using SAVEE and Emo-DB, two publicly available datasets. Our proposed method outperformed all the existing methods in speech emotion analysis and resulted in a decent result in these two datasets with a classification accuracy of 97.06% and 97.68% respectively."
EasyASR: A Distributed Machine Learning Platform for End-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition,"We present EasyASR, a distributed machine learning platform for training and serving large-scale Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models, as well as collecting and processing audio data at scale. Our platform is built upon the Machine Learning Platform for AI of Alibaba Cloud. Its main functionality is to support efficient learning and inference for end-to-end ASR models on distributed GPU clusters. It allows users to learn ASR models with either pre-defined or user-customized network architectures via simple user interface. On EasyASR, we have produced state-of-the-art results over several public datasets for Mandarin speech recognition."
VoiceFilter-Lite: Streaming Targeted Voice Separation for On-Device Speech Recognition,"We introduce VoiceFilter-Lite, a single-channel source separation model that runs on the device to preserve only the speech signals from a target user, as part of a streaming speech recognition system. Delivering such a model presents numerous challenges: It should improve the performance when the input signal consists of overlapped speech, and must not hurt the speech recognition performance under all other acoustic conditions. Besides, this model must be tiny, fast, and perform inference in a streaming fashion, in order to have minimal impact on CPU, memory, battery and latency. We propose novel techniques to meet these multi-faceted requirements, including using a new asymmetric loss, and adopting adaptive runtime suppression strength. We also show that such a model can be quantized as a 8-bit integer model and run in realtime."
Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Control Through Domain-based Automatic Speech Recognition,"Currently, unmanned aerial vehicles, such as drones, are becoming a part of our lives and reaching out to many areas of society, including the industrialized world. A common alternative to control the movements and actions of the drone is through unwired tactile interfaces, for which different remote control devices can be found. However, control through such devices is not a natural, human-like communication interface, which sometimes is difficult to master for some users. In this work, we present a domain-based speech recognition architecture to effectively control an unmanned aerial vehicle such as a drone. The drone control is performed using a more natural, human-like way to communicate the instructions. Moreover, we implement an algorithm for command interpretation using both Spanish and English languages, as well as to control the movements of the drone in a simulated domestic environment. The conducted experiments involve participants giving voice commands to the drone in both languages in order to compare the effectiveness of each of them, considering the mother tongue of the participants in the experiment. Additionally, different levels of distortion have been applied to the voice commands in order to test the proposed approach when facing noisy input signals. The obtained results show that the unmanned aerial vehicle is capable of interpreting user voice instructions achieving an improvement in speech-to-action recognition for both languages when using phoneme matching in comparison to only using the cloud-based algorithm without domain-based instructions. Using raw audio inputs, the cloud-based approach achieves 74.81% and 97.04% accuracy for English and Spanish instructions respectively, whereas using our phoneme matching approach the results are improved achieving 93.33% and 100.00% accuracy for English and Spanish languages."
Multi-modal Attention for Speech Emotion Recognition,"Emotion represents an essential aspect of human speech that is manifested in speech prosody. Speech, visual, and textual cues are complementary in human communication. In this paper, we study a hybrid fusion method, referred to as multi-modal attention network (MMAN) to make use of visual and textual cues in speech emotion recognition. We propose a novel multi-modal attention mechanism, cLSTM-MMA, which facilitates the attention across three modalities and selectively fuse the information. cLSTM-MMA is fused with other uni-modal sub-networks in the late fusion. The experiments show that speech emotion recognition benefits significantly from visual and textual cues, and the proposed cLSTM-MMA alone is as competitive as other fusion methods in terms of accuracy, but with a much more compact network structure. The proposed hybrid network MMAN achieves state-of-the-art performance on IEMOCAP database for emotion recognition."
"Is Everything Fine, Grandma? Acoustic and Linguistic Modeling for Robust Elderly Speech Emotion Recognition","Acoustic and linguistic analysis for elderly emotion recognition is an under-studied and challenging research direction, but essential for the creation of digital assistants for the elderly, as well as unobtrusive telemonitoring of elderly in their residences for mental healthcare purposes. This paper presents our contribution to the INTERSPEECH 2020 Computational Paralinguistics Challenge (ComParE) - Elderly Emotion Sub-Challenge, which is comprised of two ternary classification tasks for arousal and valence recognition. We propose a bi-modal framework, where these tasks are modeled using state-of-the-art acoustic and linguistic features, respectively. In this study, we demonstrate that exploiting task-specific dictionaries and resources can boost the performance of linguistic models, when the amount of labeled data is small. Observing a high mismatch between development and test set performances of various models, we also propose alternative training and decision fusion strategies to better estimate and improve the generalization performance."
KoSpeech: Open-Source Toolkit for End-to-End Korean Speech Recognition,"We present KoSpeech, an open-source software, which is modular and extensible end-to-end Korean automatic speech recognition (ASR) toolkit based on the deep learning library PyTorch. Several automatic speech recognition open-source toolkits have been released, but all of them deal with non-Korean languages, such as English (e.g. ESPnet, Espresso). Although AI Hub opened 1,000 hours of Korean speech corpus known as KsponSpeech, there is no established preprocessing method and baseline model to compare model performances. Therefore, we propose preprocessing methods for KsponSpeech corpus and a baseline model for benchmarks. Our baseline model is based on Listen, Attend and Spell (LAS) architecture and ables to customize various training hyperparameters conveniently. By KoSpeech, we hope this could be a guideline for those who research Korean speech recognition. Our baseline model achieved 10.31% character error rate (CER) at KsponSpeech corpus only with the acoustic model. Our source code is available here."
Voice Conversion by Cascading Automatic Speech Recognition and Text-to-Speech Synthesis with Prosody Transfer,"With the development of automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) technique, it's intuitive to construct a voice conversion system by cascading an ASR and TTS system. In this paper, we present a ASR-TTS method for voice conversion, which used iFLYTEK ASR engine to transcribe the source speech into text and a Transformer TTS model with WaveNet vocoder to synthesize the converted speech from the decoded text. For the TTS model, we proposed to use a prosody code to describe the prosody information other than text and speaker information contained in speech. A prosody encoder is used to extract the prosody code. During conversion, the source prosody is transferred to converted speech by conditioning the Transformer TTS model with its code. Experiments were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our system also obtained the best naturalness and similarity in the mono-lingual task of Voice Conversion Challenge 2020."
Convolutional Speech Recognition with Pitch and Voice Quality Features,"The effects of adding pitch and voice quality features such as jitter and shimmer to a state-of-the-art CNN model for Automatic Speech Recognition are studied in this work. Pitch features have been previously used for improving classical HMM and DNN baselines, while jitter and shimmer parameters have proven to be useful for tasks like speaker or emotion recognition. Up to our knowledge, this is the first work combining such pitch and voice quality features with modern convolutional architectures, showing improvements up to 7% and 3% relative WER points, for the publicly available Spanish Common Voice and LibriSpeech 100h datasets, respectively. Particularly, our work combines these features with mel-frequency spectral coefficients (MFSCs) to train a convolutional architecture with Gated Linear Units (Conv GLUs). Such models have shown to yield small word error rates, while being very suitable for parallel processing for online streaming recognition use cases. We have added pitch and voice quality functionality to Facebook's wav2letter speech recognition framework, and we provide with such code and recipes to the community, to carry on with further experiments. Besides, to the best of our knowledge, our Spanish Common Voice recipe is the first public Spanish recipe for wav2letter."
When the Differences in Frequency Domain are Compensated: Understanding and Defeating Modulated Replay Attacks on Automatic Speech Recognition,"Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have been widely deployed in modern smart devices to provide convenient and diverse voice-controlled services. Since ASR systems are vulnerable to audio replay attacks that can spoof and mislead ASR systems, a number of defense systems have been proposed to identify replayed audio signals based on the speakers' unique acoustic features in the frequency domain. In this paper, we uncover a new type of replay attack called modulated replay attack, which can bypass the existing frequency domain based defense systems. The basic idea is to compensate for the frequency distortion of a given electronic speaker using an inverse filter that is customized to the speaker's transform characteristics. Our experiments on real smart devices confirm the modulated replay attacks can successfully escape the existing detection mechanisms that rely on identifying suspicious features in the frequency domain. To defeat modulated replay attacks, we design and implement a countermeasure named DualGuard. We discover and formally prove that no matter how the replay audio signals could be modulated, the replay attacks will either leave ringing artifacts in the time domain or cause spectrum distortion in the frequency domain. Therefore, by jointly checking suspicious features in both frequency and time domains, DualGuard can successfully detect various replay attacks including the modulated replay attacks. We implement a prototype of DualGuard on a popular voice interactive platform, ReSpeaker Core v2. The experimental results show DualGuard can achieve 98% accuracy on detecting modulated replay attacks."
Parallel Rescoring with Transformer for Streaming On-Device Speech Recognition,"Recent advances of end-to-end models have outperformed conventional models through employing a two-pass model. The two-pass model provides better speed-quality trade-offs for on-device speech recognition, where a 1st-pass model generates hypotheses in a streaming fashion, and a 2nd-pass model re-scores the hypotheses with full audio sequence context. The 2nd-pass model plays a key role in the quality improvement of the end-to-end model to surpass the conventional model. One main challenge of the two-pass model is the computation latency introduced by the 2nd-pass model. Specifically, the original design of the two-pass model uses LSTMs for the 2nd-pass model, which are subject to long latency as they are constrained by the recurrent nature and have to run inference sequentially. In this work we explore replacing the LSTM layers in the 2nd-pass rescorer with Transformer layers, which can process the entire hypothesis sequences in parallel and can therefore utilize the on-device computation resources more efficiently. Compared with an LSTM-based baseline, our proposed Transformer rescorer achieves more than 50% latency reduction with quality improvement."
Learned Transferable Architectures Can Surpass Hand-Designed Architectures for Large Scale Speech Recognition,"In this paper, we explore the neural architecture search (NAS) for automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. With reference to the previous works in the computer vision field, the transferability of the searched architecture is the main focus of our work. The architecture search is conducted on the small proxy dataset, and then the evaluation network, constructed with the searched architecture, is evaluated on the large dataset. Especially, we propose a revised search space for speech recognition tasks which theoretically facilitates the search algorithm to explore the architectures with low complexity. Extensive experiments show that: (i) the architecture searched on the small proxy dataset can be transferred to the large dataset for the speech recognition tasks. (ii) the architecture learned in the revised search space can greatly reduce the computational overhead and GPU memory usage with mild performance degradation. (iii) the searched architecture can achieve more than 20% and 15% (average on the four test sets) relative improvements respectively on the AISHELL-2 dataset and the large (10k hours) dataset, compared with our best hand-designed DFSMN-SAN architecture. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of NAS results with large scale dataset (up to 10K hours), indicating the promising application of NAS to industrial ASR systems."
Aphasic Speech Recognition using a Mixture of Speech Intelligibility Experts,"Robust speech recognition is a key prerequisite for semantic feature extraction in automatic aphasic speech analysis. However, standard one-size-fits-all automatic speech recognition models perform poorly when applied to aphasic speech. One reason for this is the wide range of speech intelligibility due to different levels of severity (i.e., higher severity lends itself to less intelligible speech). To address this, we propose a novel acoustic model based on a mixture of experts (MoE), which handles the varying intelligibility stages present in aphasic speech by explicitly defining severity-based experts. At test time, the contribution of each expert is decided by estimating speech intelligibility with a speech intelligibility detector (SID). We show that our proposed approach significantly reduces phone error rates across all severity stages in aphasic speech compared to a baseline approach that does not incorporate severity information into the modeling process."
Dyadic Speech-based Affect Recognition using DAMI-P2C Parent-child Multimodal Interaction Dataset,"Automatic speech-based affect recognition of individuals in dyadic conversation is a challenging task, in part because of its heavy reliance on manual pre-processing. Traditional approaches frequently require hand-crafted speech features and segmentation of speaker turns. In this work, we design end-to-end deep learning methods to recognize each person's affective expression in an audio stream with two speakers, automatically discovering features and time regions relevant to the target speaker's affect. We integrate a local attention mechanism into the end-to-end architecture and compare the performance of three attention implementations -- one mean pooling and two weighted pooling methods. Our results show that the proposed weighted-pooling attention solutions are able to learn to focus on the regions containing target speaker's affective information and successfully extract the individual's valence and arousal intensity. Here we introduce and use a ""dyadic affect in multimodal interaction - parent to child"" (DAMI-P2C) dataset collected in a study of 34 families, where a parent and a child (3-7 years old) engage in reading storybooks together. In contrast to existing public datasets for affect recognition, each instance for both speakers in the DAMI-P2C dataset is annotated for the perceived affect by three labelers. To encourage more research on the challenging task of multi-speaker affect sensing, we make the annotated DAMI-P2C dataset publicly available, including acoustic features of the dyads' raw audios, affect annotations, and a diverse set of developmental, social, and demographic profiles of each dyad."
Are Neural Open-Domain Dialog Systems Robust to Speech Recognition Errors in the Dialog History? An Empirical Study,"Large end-to-end neural open-domain chatbots are becoming increasingly popular. However, research on building such chatbots has typically assumed that the user input is written in nature and it is not clear whether these chatbots would seamlessly integrate with automatic speech recognition (ASR) models to serve the speech modality. We aim to bring attention to this important question by empirically studying the effects of various types of synthetic and actual ASR hypotheses in the dialog history on TransferTransfo, a state-of-the-art Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) based neural open-domain dialog system from the NeurIPS ConvAI2 challenge. We observe that TransferTransfo trained on written data is very sensitive to such hypotheses introduced to the dialog history during inference time. As a baseline mitigation strategy, we introduce synthetic ASR hypotheses to the dialog history during training and observe marginal improvements, demonstrating the need for further research into techniques to make end-to-end open-domain chatbots fully speech-robust. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the effects of synthetic and actual ASR hypotheses on a state-of-the-art neural open-domain dialog system and we hope it promotes speech-robustness as an evaluation criterion in open-domain dialog."
Speech Recognition using EEG signals recorded using dry electrodes,"In this paper, we demonstrate speech recognition using electroencephalography (EEG) signals obtained using dry electrodes on a limited English vocabulary consisting of three vowels and one word using a deep learning model. We demonstrate a test accuracy of 79.07 percent on a subset vocabulary consisting of two English vowels. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using EEG signals recorded using dry electrodes for performing the task of speech recognition."
"Jointly Fine-Tuning ""BERT-like"" Self Supervised Models to Improve Multimodal Speech Emotion Recognition","Multimodal emotion recognition from speech is an important area in affective computing. Fusing multiple data modalities and learning representations with limited amounts of labeled data is a challenging task. In this paper, we explore the use of modality-specific ""BERT-like"" pretrained Self Supervised Learning (SSL) architectures to represent both speech and text modalities for the task of multimodal speech emotion recognition. By conducting experiments on three publicly available datasets (IEMOCAP, CMU-MOSEI, and CMU-MOSI), we show that jointly fine-tuning ""BERT-like"" SSL architectures achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results. We also evaluate two methods of fusing speech and text modalities and show that a simple fusion mechanism can outperform more complex ones when using SSL models that have similar architectural properties to BERT."
Advancing Multiple Instance Learning with Attention Modeling for Categorical Speech Emotion Recognition,"Categorical speech emotion recognition is typically performed as a sequence-to-label problem, i.e., to determine the discrete emotion label of the input utterance as a whole. One of the main challenges in practice is that most of the existing emotion corpora do not give ground truth labels for each segment; instead, we only have labels for whole utterances. To extract segment-level emotional information from such weakly labeled emotion corpora, we propose using multiple instance learning (MIL) to learn segment embeddings in a weakly supervised manner. Also, for a sufficiently long utterance, not all of the segments contain relevant emotional information. In this regard, three attention-based neural network models are then applied to the learned segment embeddings to attend the most salient part of a speech utterance. Experiments on the CASIA corpus and the IEMOCAP database show better or highly competitive results than other state-of-the-art approaches."
Adaptation Algorithms for Neural Network-Based Speech Recognition: An Overview,"We present a structured overview of adaptation algorithms for neural network-based speech recognition, considering both hybrid hidden Markov model / neural network systems and end-to-end neural network systems, with a focus on speaker adaptation, domain adaptation, and accent adaptation. The overview characterizes adaptation algorithms as based on embeddings, model parameter adaptation, or data augmentation. We present a meta-analysis of the performance of speech recognition adaptation algorithms, based on relative error rate reductions as reported in the literature."
MASRI-HEADSET: A Maltese Corpus for Speech Recognition,"Maltese, the national language of Malta, is spoken by approximately 500,000 people. Speech processing for Maltese is still in its early stages of development. In this paper, we present the first spoken Maltese corpus designed purposely for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). The MASRI-HEADSET corpus was developed by the MASRI project at the University of Malta. It consists of 8 hours of speech paired with text, recorded by using short text snippets in a laboratory environment. The speakers were recruited from different geographical locations all over the Maltese islands, and were roughly evenly distributed by gender. This paper also presents some initial results achieved in baseline experiments for Maltese ASR using Sphinx and Kaldi. The MASRI-HEADSET Corpus is publicly available for research/academic purposes."
"Conv-Transformer Transducer: Low Latency, Low Frame Rate, Streamable End-to-End Speech Recognition","Transformer has achieved competitive performance against state-of-the-art end-to-end models in automatic speech recognition (ASR), and requires significantly less training time than RNN-based models. The original Transformer, with encoder-decoder architecture, is only suitable for offline ASR. It relies on an attention mechanism to learn alignments, and encodes input audio bidirectionally. The high computation cost of Transformer decoding also limits its use in production streaming systems. To make Transformer suitable for streaming ASR, we explore Transducer framework as a streamable way to learn alignments. For audio encoding, we apply unidirectional Transformer with interleaved convolution layers. The interleaved convolution layers are used for modeling future context which is important to performance. To reduce computation cost, we gradually downsample acoustic input, also with the interleaved convolution layers. Moreover, we limit the length of history context in self-attention to maintain constant computation cost for each decoding step. We show that this architecture, named Conv-Transformer Transducer, achieves competitive performance on LibriSpeech dataset (3.6\% WER on test-clean) without external language models. The performance is comparable to previously published streamable Transformer Transducer and strong hybrid streaming ASR systems, and is achieved with smaller look-ahead window (140~ms), fewer parameters and lower frame rate."
"Online Automatic Speech Recognition with Listen, Attend and Spell Model","The Listen, Attend and Spell (LAS) model and other attention-based automatic speech recognition (ASR) models have known limitations when operated in a fully online mode. In this paper, we analyze the online operation of LAS models to demonstrate that these limitations stem from the handling of silence regions and the reliability of online attention mechanism at the edge of input buffers. We propose a novel and simple technique that can achieve fully online recognition while meeting accuracy and latency targets. For the Mandarin dictation task, our proposed approach can achieve a character error rate in online operation that is within 4% relative to an offline LAS model. The proposed online LAS model operates at 12% lower latency relative to a conventional neural network hidden Markov model hybrid of comparable accuracy. We have validated the proposed method through a production scale deployment, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first such deployment of a fully online LAS model."
Transfer Learning Approaches for Streaming End-to-End Speech Recognition System,"Transfer learning (TL) is widely used in conventional hybrid automatic speech recognition (ASR) system, to transfer the knowledge from source to target language. TL can be applied to end-to-end (E2E) ASR system such as recurrent neural network transducer (RNN-T) models, by initializing the encoder and/or prediction network of the target language with the pre-trained models from source language. In the hybrid ASR system, transfer learning is typically done by initializing the target language acoustic model (AM) with source language AM. Several transfer learning strategies exist in the case of the RNN-T framework, depending upon the choice of the initialization model for encoder and prediction networks. This paper presents a comparative study of four different TL methods for RNN-T framework. We show 17% relative word error rate reduction with different TL methods over randomly initialized RNN-T model. We also study the impact of TL with varying amount of training data ranging from 50 hours to 1000 hours and show the efficacy of TL for languages with small amount of training data."
Transformer with Bidirectional Decoder for Speech Recognition,"Attention-based models have made tremendous progress on end-to-end automatic speech recognition(ASR) recently. However, the conventional transformer-based approaches usually generate the sequence results token by token from left to right, leaving the right-to-left contexts unexploited. In this work, we introduce a bidirectional speech transformer to utilize the different directional contexts simultaneously. Specifically, the outputs of our proposed transformer include a left-to-right target, and a right-to-left target. In inference stage, we use the introduced bidirectional beam search method, which can not only generate left-to-right candidates but also generate right-to-left candidates, and determine the best hypothesis by the score.  To demonstrate our proposed speech transformer with a bidirectional decoder(STBD), we conduct extensive experiments on the AISHELL-1 dataset. The results of experiments show that STBD achieves a 3.6\% relative CER reduction(CERR) over the unidirectional speech transformer baseline. Besides, the strongest model in this paper called STBD-Big can achieve 6.64\% CER on the test set, without language model rescoring and any extra data augmentation strategies."
TinySpeech: Attention Condensers for Deep Speech Recognition Neural Networks on Edge Devices,"Advances in deep learning have led to state-of-the-art performance across a multitude of speech recognition tasks. Nevertheless, the widespread deployment of deep neural networks for on-device speech recognition remains a challenge, particularly in edge scenarios where the memory and computing resources are highly constrained (e.g., low-power embedded devices) or where the memory and computing budget dedicated to speech recognition is low (e.g., mobile devices performing numerous tasks besides speech recognition). In this study, we introduce the concept of attention condensers for building low-footprint, highly-efficient deep neural networks for on-device speech recognition on the edge. An attention condenser is a self-attention mechanism that learns and produces a condensed embedding characterizing joint local and cross-channel activation relationships, and performs selective attention accordingly. To illustrate its efficacy, we introduce TinySpeech, low-precision deep neural networks comprising largely of attention condensers tailored for on-device speech recognition using a machine-driven design exploration strategy, with one tailored specifically with microcontroller operation constraints. Experimental results on the Google Speech Commands benchmark dataset for limited-vocabulary speech recognition showed that TinySpeech networks achieved significantly lower architectural complexity (as much as 507\times fewer parameters), lower computational complexity (as much as 48\times fewer multiply-add operations), and lower storage requirements (as much as 2028\times lower weight memory requirements) when compared to previous work. These results not only demonstrate the efficacy of attention condensers for building highly efficient networks for on-device speech recognition, but also illuminate its potential for accelerating deep learning on the edge and empowering TinyML applications."
Subword Regularization: An Analysis of Scalability and Generalization for End-to-End Automatic Speech Recognition,"Subwords are the most widely used output units in end-to-end speech recognition. They combine the best of two worlds by modeling the majority of frequent words directly and at the same time allow open vocabulary speech recognition by backing off to shorter units or characters to construct words unseen during training. However, mapping text to subwords is ambiguous and often multiple segmentation variants are possible. Yet, many systems are trained using only the most likely segmentation. Recent research suggests that sampling subword segmentations during training acts as a regularizer for neural machine translation and speech recognition models, leading to performance improvements. In this work, we conduct a principled investigation on the regularizing effect of the subword segmentation sampling method for a streaming end-to-end speech recognition task. In particular, we evaluate the subword regularization contribution depending on the size of the training dataset. Our results suggest that subword regularization provides a consistent improvement of (2-8%) relative word-error-rate reduction, even in a large-scale setting with datasets up to a size of 20k hours. Further, we analyze the effect of subword regularization on recognition of unseen words and its implications on beam diversity."
LRSpeech: Extremely Low-Resource Speech Synthesis and Recognition,"Speech synthesis (text to speech, TTS) and recognition (automatic speech recognition, ASR) are important speech tasks, and require a large amount of text and speech pairs for model training. However, there are more than 6,000 languages in the world and most languages are lack of speech training data, which poses significant challenges when building TTS and ASR systems for extremely low-resource languages. In this paper, we develop LRSpeech, a TTS and ASR system under the extremely low-resource setting, which can support rare languages with low data cost. LRSpeech consists of three key techniques: 1) pre-training on rich-resource languages and fine-tuning on low-resource languages; 2) dual transformation between TTS and ASR to iteratively boost the accuracy of each other; 3) knowledge distillation to customize the TTS model on a high-quality target-speaker voice and improve the ASR model on multiple voices. We conduct experiments on an experimental language (English) and a truly low-resource language (Lithuanian) to verify the effectiveness of LRSpeech. Experimental results show that LRSpeech 1) achieves high quality for TTS in terms of both intelligibility (more than 98% intelligibility rate) and naturalness (above 3.5 mean opinion score (MOS)) of the synthesized speech, which satisfy the requirements for industrial deployment, 2) achieves promising recognition accuracy for ASR, and 3) last but not least, uses extremely low-resource training data. We also conduct comprehensive analyses on LRSpeech with different amounts of data resources, and provide valuable insights and guidances for industrial deployment. We are currently deploying LRSpeech into a commercialized cloud speech service to support TTS on more rare languages."
Deep Learning Based Dereverberation of Temporal Envelopesfor Robust Speech Recognition,"Automatic speech recognition in reverberant conditions is a challenging task as the long-term envelopes of the reverberant speech are temporally smeared. In this paper, we propose a neural model for enhancement of sub-band temporal envelopes for dereverberation of speech. The temporal envelopes are derived using the autoregressive modeling framework of frequency domain linear prediction (FDLP). The neural enhancement model proposed in this paper performs an envelop gain based enhancement of temporal envelopes and it consists of a series of convolutional and recurrent neural network layers. The enhanced sub-band envelopes are used to generate features for automatic speech recognition (ASR). The ASR experiments are performed on the REVERB challenge dataset as well as the CHiME-3 dataset. In these experiments, the proposed neural enhancement approach provides significant improvements over a baseline ASR system with beamformed audio (average relative improvements of 21% on the development set and about 11% on the evaluation set in word error rates for REVERB challenge dataset)."
A Transfer Learning Method for Speech Emotion Recognition from Automatic Speech Recognition,"This paper presents a transfer learning method in speech emotion recognition based on a Time-Delay Neural Network (TDNN) architecture. A major challenge in the current speech-based emotion detection research is data scarcity. The proposed method resolves this problem by applying transfer learning techniques in order to leverage data from the automatic speech recognition (ASR) task for which ample data is available. Our experiments also show the advantage of speaker-class adaptation modeling techniques by adopting identity-vector (i-vector) based features in addition to standard Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) features.[1] We show the transfer learning models significantly outperform the other methods without pretraining on ASR. The experiments performed on the publicly available IEMOCAP dataset which provides 12 hours of motional speech data. The transfer learning was initialized by using the Ted-Lium v.2 speech dataset providing 207 hours of audio with the corresponding transcripts. We achieve the highest significantly higher accuracy when compared to state-of-the-art, using five-fold cross validation. Using only speech, we obtain an accuracy 71.7% for anger, excitement, sadness, and neutrality emotion content."
Attentive Fusion Enhanced Audio-Visual Encoding for Transformer Based Robust Speech Recognition,"Audio-visual information fusion enables a performance improvement in speech recognition performed in complex acoustic scenarios, e.g., noisy environments. It is required to explore an effective audio-visual fusion strategy for audiovisual alignment and modality reliability. Different from the previous end-to-end approaches where the audio-visual fusion is performed after encoding each modality, in this paper we propose to integrate an attentive fusion block into the encoding process. It is shown that the proposed audio-visual fusion method in the encoder module can enrich audio-visual representations, as the relevance between the two modalities is leveraged. In line with the transformer-based architecture, we implement the embedded fusion block using a multi-head attention based audiovisual fusion with one-way or two-way interactions. The proposed method can sufficiently combine the two streams and weaken the over-reliance on the audio modality. Experiments on the LRS3-TED dataset demonstrate that the proposed method can increase the recognition rate by 0.55%, 4.51% and 4.61% on average under the clean, seen and unseen noise conditions, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art approach."
Compact Graph Architecture for Speech Emotion Recognition,"We propose a deep graph approach to address the task of speech emotion recognition. A compact, efficient and scalable way to represent data is in the form of graphs. Following the theory of graph signal processing, we propose to model speech signal as a cycle graph or a line graph. Such graph structure enables us to construct a Graph Convolution Network (GCN)-based architecture that can perform an accurate graph convolution in contrast to the approximate convolution used in standard GCNs. We evaluated the performance of our model for speech emotion recognition on the popular IEMOCAP and MSP-IMPROV databases. Our model outperforms standard GCN and other relevant deep graph architectures indicating the effectiveness of our approach. When compared with existing speech emotion recognition methods, our model achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art with significantly fewer learnable parameters (~30K) indicating its applicability in resource-constrained devices."
Modular End-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition Framework for Acoustic-to-word Model,"End-to-end (E2E) systems have played a more and more important role in automatic speech recognition (ASR) and achieved great performance. However, E2E systems recognize output word sequences directly with the input acoustic feature, which can only be trained on limited acoustic data. The extra text data is widely used to improve the results of traditional artificial neural network-hidden Markov model (ANN-HMM) hybrid systems. The involving of extra text data to standard E2E ASR systems may break the E2E property during decoding. In this paper, a novel modular E2E ASR system is proposed. The modular E2E ASR system consists of two parts: an acoustic-to-phoneme (A2P) model and a phoneme-to-word (P2W) model. The A2P model is trained on acoustic data, while extra data including large scale text data can be used to train the P2W model. This additional data enables the modular E2E ASR system to model not only the acoustic part but also the language part. During the decoding phase, the two models will be integrated and act as a standard acoustic-to-word (A2W) model. In other words, the proposed modular E2E ASR system can be easily trained with extra text data and decoded in the same way as a standard E2E ASR system. Experimental results on the Switchboard corpus show that the modular E2E model achieves better word error rate (WER) than standard A2W models."
Multimodal Integration for Large-Vocabulary Audio-Visual Speech Recognition,"For many small- and medium-vocabulary tasks, audio-visual speech recognition can significantly improve the recognition rates compared to audio-only systems. However, there is still an ongoing debate regarding the best combination strategy for multi-modal information, which should allow for the translation of these gains to large-vocabulary recognition. While an integration at the level of state-posterior probabilities, using dynamic stream weighting, is almost universally helpful for small-vocabulary systems, in large-vocabulary speech recognition, the recognition accuracy remains difficult to improve. In the following, we specifically consider the large-vocabulary task of the LRS2 database, and we investigate a broad range of integration strategies, comparing early integration and end-to-end learning with many versions of hybrid recognition and dynamic stream weighting. One aspect, which is shown to provide much benefit here, is the use of dynamic stream reliability indicators, which allow for hybrid architectures to strongly profit from the inclusion of visual information whenever the audio channel is distorted even slightly."
Efficient minimum word error rate training of RNN-Transducer for end-to-end speech recognition,"In this work, we propose a novel and efficient minimum word error rate (MWER) training method for RNN-Transducer (RNN-T). Unlike previous work on this topic, which performs on-the-fly limited-size beam-search decoding and generates alignment scores for expected edit-distance computation, in our proposed method, we re-calculate and sum scores of all the possible alignments for each hypothesis in N-best lists. The hypothesis probability scores and back-propagated gradients are calculated efficiently using the forward-backward algorithm. Moreover, the proposed method allows us to decouple the decoding and training processes, and thus we can perform offline parallel-decoding and MWER training for each subset iteratively. Experimental results show that this proposed semi-on-the-fly method can speed up the on-the-fly method by 6 times and result in a similar WER improvement (3.6%) over a baseline RNN-T model. The proposed MWER training can also effectively reduce high-deletion errors (9.2% WER-reduction) introduced by RNN-T models when EOS is added for endpointer. Further improvement can be achieved if we use a proposed RNN-T rescoring method to re-rank hypotheses and use external RNN-LM to perform additional rescoring. The best system achieves a 5% relative improvement on an English test-set of real far-field recordings and a 11.6% WER reduction on music-domain utterances."
MP3 Compression To Diminish Adversarial Noise in End-to-End Speech Recognition,"Audio Adversarial Examples (AAE) represent specially created inputs meant to trick Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems into misclassification. The present work proposes MP3 compression as a means to decrease the impact of Adversarial Noise (AN) in audio samples transcribed by ASR systems. To this end, we generated AAEs with the Fast Gradient Sign Method for an end-to-end, hybrid CTC-attention ASR system. Our method is then validated by two objective indicators: (1) Character Error Rates (CER) that measure the speech decoding performance of four ASR models trained on uncompressed, as well as MP3-compressed data sets and (2) Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) estimated for both uncompressed and MP3-compressed AAEs that are reconstructed in the time domain by feature inversion. We found that MP3 compression applied to AAEs indeed reduces the CER when compared to uncompressed AAEs. Moreover, feature-inverted (reconstructed) AAEs had significantly higher SNRs after MP3 compression, indicating that AN was reduced. In contrast to AN, MP3 compression applied to utterances augmented with regular noise resulted in more transcription errors, giving further evidence that MP3 encoding is effective in diminishing only AN."
Sequential Routing Framework: Fully Capsule Network-based Speech Recognition,"Capsule networks (CapsNets) have recently gotten attention as a novel neural architecture. This paper presents the sequential routing framework which we believe is the first method to adapt a CapsNet-only structure to sequence-to-sequence recognition. Input sequences are capsulized then sliced by a window size. Each slice is classified to a label at the corresponding time through iterative routing mechanisms. Afterwards, losses are computed by connectionist temporal classification (CTC). During routing, the required number of parameters can be controlled by the window size regardless of the length of sequences by sharing learnable weights across the slices. We additionally propose a sequential dynamic routing algorithm to replace traditional dynamic routing. The proposed technique can minimize decoding speed degradation caused by the routing iterations since it can operate in a non-iterative manner without dropping accuracy. The method achieves a 1.1% lower word error rate at 16.9% on the Wall Street Journal corpus compared to bidirectional long short-term memory-based CTC networks. On the TIMIT corpus, it attains a 0.7% lower phone error rate at 17.5% compared to convolutional neural network-based CTC networks (Zhang et al., 2016)."
Audio Adversarial Examples for Robust Hybrid CTC/Attention Speech Recognition,"Recent advances in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) demonstrated how end-to-end systems are able to achieve state-of-the-art performance. There is a trend towards deeper neural networks, however those ASR models are also more complex and prone against specially crafted noisy data. Those Audio Adversarial Examples (AAE) were previously demonstrated on ASR systems that use Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC), as well as attention-based encoder-decoder architectures. Following the idea of the hybrid CTC/attention ASR system, this work proposes algorithms to generate AAEs to combine both approaches into a joint CTC-attention gradient method. Evaluation is performed using a hybrid CTC/attention end-to-end ASR model on two reference sentences as case study, as well as the TEDlium v2 speech recognition task. We then demonstrate the application of this algorithm for adversarial training to obtain a more robust ASR model."
SoK: The Faults in our ASRs: An Overview of Attacks against Automatic Speech Recognition and Speaker Identification Systems,"Speech and speaker recognition systems are employed in a variety of applications, from personal assistants to telephony surveillance and biometric authentication. The wide deployment of these systems has been made possible by the improved accuracy in neural networks. Like other systems based on neural networks, recent research has demonstrated that speech and speaker recognition systems are vulnerable to attacks using manipulated inputs. However, as we demonstrate in this paper, the end-to-end architecture of speech and speaker systems and the nature of their inputs make attacks and defenses against them substantially different than those in the image space. We demonstrate this first by systematizing existing research in this space and providing a taxonomy through which the community can evaluate future work. We then demonstrate experimentally that attacks against these models almost universally fail to transfer. In so doing, we argue that substantial additional work is required to provide adequate mitigations in this space."
"The ASRU 2019 Mandarin-English Code-Switching Speech Recognition Challenge: Open Datasets, Tracks, Methods and Results","Code-switching (CS) is a common phenomenon and recognizing CS speech is challenging. But CS speech data is scarce and there' s no common testbed in relevant research. This paper describes the design and main outcomes of the ASRU 2019 Mandarin-English code-switching speech recognition challenge, which aims to improve the ASR performance in Mandarin-English code-switching situation. 500 hours Mandarin speech data and 240 hours Mandarin-English intra-sentencial CS data are released to the participants. Three tracks were set for advancing the AM and LM part in traditional DNN-HMM ASR system, as well as exploring the E2E models' performance. The paper then presents an overview of the results and system performance in the three tracks. It turns out that traditional ASR system benefits from pronunciation lexicon, CS text generating and data augmentation. In E2E track, however, the results highlight the importance of using language identification, building-up a rational set of modeling units and spec-augment. The other details in model training and method comparsion are discussed."
DARF: A data-reduced FADE version for simulations of speech recognition thresholds with real hearing aids,"Developing and selecting hearing aids is a time consuming process which is simplified by using objective models. Previously, the framework for auditory discrimination experiments (FADE) accurately simulated benefits of hearing aid algorithms with root mean squared prediction errors below 3 dB. One FADE simulation requires several hours of (un)processed signals, which is obstructive when the signals have to be recorded. We propose and evaluate a data-reduced FADE version (DARF) which facilitates simulations with signals that cannot be processed digitally, but that can only be recorded in real-time. DARF simulates one speech recognition threshold (SRT) with about 30 minutes of recorded and processed signals of the (German) matrix sentence test. Benchmark experiments were carried out to compare DARF and standard FADE exhibiting small differences for stationary maskers (1 dB), but larger differences with strongly fluctuating maskers (5 dB). Hearing impairment and hearing aid algorithms seemed to reduce the differences. Hearing aid benefits were simulated in terms of speech recognition with three pairs of real hearing aids in silence (\geq8 dB), in stationary and fluctuating maskers in co-located (stat. 2 dB; fluct. 6 dB), and spatially separated speech and noise signals (stat. \geq8 dB; fluct. 8 dB). The simulations were plausible in comparison to data from literature, but a comparison with empirical data is still open. DARF facilitates objective SRT simulations with real devices with unknown signal processing in real environments. Yet, a validation of DARF for devices with unknown signal processing is still pending since it was only tested with three similar devices. Nonetheless, DARF could be used for improving as well as for developing or model-based fitting of hearing aids."
Gated Recurrent Context: Softmax-free Attention for Online Encoder-Decoder Speech Recognition,"Recently, attention-based encoder-decoder (AED) models have shown state-of-the-art performance in automatic speech recognition (ASR). As the original AED models with global attentions are not capable of online inference, various online attention schemes have been developed to reduce ASR latency for better user experience. However, a common limitation of the conventional softmax-based online attention approaches is that they introduce an additional hyperparameter related to the length of the attention window, requiring multiple trials of model training for tuning the hyperparameter. In order to deal with this problem, we propose a novel softmax-free attention method and its modified formulation for online attention, which does not need any additional hyperparameter at the training phase. Through a number of ASR experiments, we demonstrate the tradeoff between the latency and performance of the proposed online attention technique can be controlled by merely adjusting a threshold at the test phase. Furthermore, the proposed methods showed competitive performance to the conventional global and online attentions in terms of word-error-rates (WERs)."
Deep Graph Random Process for Relational-Thinking-Based Speech Recognition,"Lying at the core of human intelligence, relational thinking is characterized by initially relying on innumerable unconscious percepts pertaining to relations between new sensory signals and prior knowledge, consequently becoming a recognizable concept or object through coupling and transformation of these percepts. Such mental processes are difficult to model in real-world problems such as in conversational automatic speech recognition (ASR), as the percepts (if they are modelled as graphs indicating relationships among utterances) are supposed to be innumerable and not directly observable. In this paper, we present a Bayesian nonparametric deep learning method called deep graph random process (DGP) that can generate an infinite number of probabilistic graphs representing percepts. We further provide a closed-form solution for coupling and transformation of these percept graphs for acoustic modeling. Our approach is able to successfully infer relations among utterances without using any relational data during training. Experimental evaluations on ASR tasks including CHiME-2 and CHiME-5 demonstrate the effectiveness and benefits of our method."
LSTM and GPT-2 Synthetic Speech Transfer Learning for Speaker Recognition to Overcome Data Scarcity,"In speech recognition problems, data scarcity often poses an issue due to the willingness of humans to provide large amounts of data for learning and classification. In this work, we take a set of 5 spoken Harvard sentences from 7 subjects and consider their MFCC attributes. Using character level LSTMs (supervised learning) and OpenAI's attention-based GPT-2 models, synthetic MFCCs are generated by learning from the data provided on a per-subject basis. A neural network is trained to classify the data against a large dataset of Flickr8k speakers and is then compared to a transfer learning network performing the same task but with an initial weight distribution dictated by learning from the synthetic data generated by the two models. The best result for all of the 7 subjects were networks that had been exposed to synthetic data, the model pre-trained with LSTM-produced data achieved the best result 3 times and the GPT-2 equivalent 5 times (since one subject had their best result from both models at a draw). Through these results, we argue that speaker classification can be improved by utilising a small amount of user data but with exposure to synthetically-generated MFCCs which then allow the networks to achieve near maximum classification scores."
Whole-Word Segmental Speech Recognition with Acoustic Word Embeddings,"Segmental models are sequence prediction models in which scores of hypotheses are based on entire variable-length segments of frames. We consider segmental models for whole-word (""acoustic-to-word"") speech recognition, with the feature vectors defined using vector embeddings of segments. Such models are computationally challenging as the number of paths is proportional to the vocabulary size, which can be orders of magnitude larger than when using subword units like phones. We describe an efficient approach for end-to-end whole-word segmental models, with forward-backward and Viterbi decoding performed on a GPU and a simple segment scoring function that reduces space complexity. In addition, we investigate the use of pre-training via jointly trained acoustic word embeddings (AWEs) and acoustically grounded word embeddings (AGWEs) of written word labels. We find that word error rate can be reduced by a large margin by pre-training the acoustic segment representation with AWEs, and additional (smaller) gains can be obtained by pre-training the word prediction layer with AGWEs. Our final models improve over prior A2W models."
Multi-view Frequency LSTM: An Efficient Frontend for Automatic Speech Recognition,"Acoustic models in real-time speech recognition systems typically stack multiple unidirectional LSTM layers to process the acoustic frames over time. Performance improvements over vanilla LSTM architectures have been reported by prepending a stack of frequency-LSTM (FLSTM) layers to the time LSTM. These FLSTM layers can learn a more robust input feature to the time LSTM layers by modeling time-frequency correlations in the acoustic input signals. A drawback of FLSTM based architectures however is that they operate at a predefined, and tuned, window size and stride, referred to as 'view' in this paper. We present a simple and efficient modification by combining the outputs of multiple FLSTM stacks with different views, into a dimensionality reduced feature representation. The proposed multi-view FLSTM architecture allows to model a wider range of time-frequency correlations compared to an FLSTM model with single view. When trained on 50K hours of English far-field speech data with CTC loss followed by sMBR sequence training, we show that the multi-view FLSTM acoustic model provides relative Word Error Rate (WER) improvements of 3-7% for different speaker and acoustic environment scenarios over an optimized single FLSTM model, while retaining a similar computational footprint."
Unsupervised Cross-lingual Representation Learning for Speech Recognition,"This paper presents XLSR which learns cross-lingual speech representations by pretraining a single model from the raw waveform of speech in multiple languages. We build on wav2vec 2.0 which is trained by solving a contrastive task over masked latent speech representations and jointly learns a quantization of the latents shared across languages. The resulting model is fine-tuned on labeled data and experiments show that cross-lingual pretraining significantly outperforms monolingual pretraining. On the CommonVoice benchmark, XLSR shows a relative phoneme error rate reduction of 72% compared to the best known results. On BABEL, our approach improves word error rate by 16% relative compared to a comparable system. Our approach enables a single multilingual speech recognition model which is competitive to strong individual models. Analysis shows that the latent discrete speech representations are shared across languages with increased sharing for related languages. We hope to catalyze research in low-resource speech understanding by releasing XLSR-53, a large model pretrained in 53 languages."
Deep Double-Side Learning Ensemble Model for Few-Shot Parkinson Speech Recognition,"Diagnosis and therapeutic effect assessment of Parkinson disease based on voice data are very important,but its few-shot learning problem is challenging.Although deep learning is good at automatic feature extraction, it suffers from few-shot learning problem. Therefore, the general effective method is first conduct feature extraction based on prior knowledge, and then carry out feature reduction for subsequent classification. However, there are two major problems: 1) Structural information among speech features has not been mined and new features of higher quality have not been reconstructed. 2) Structural information between data samples has not been mined and new samples with higher quality have not been reconstructed. To solve these two problems, based on the existing Parkinson speech feature data set, a deep double-side learning ensemble model is designed in this paper that can reconstruct speech features and samples deeply and simultaneously. As to feature reconstruction, an embedded deep stacked group sparse auto-encoder is designed in this paper to conduct nonlinear feature transformation, so as to acquire new high-level deep features, and then the deep features are fused with original speech features by L1 regularization feature selection method. As to speech sample reconstruction, a deep sample learning algorithm is designed in this paper based on iterative mean clustering to conduct samples transformation, so as to obtain new high-level deep samples. Finally, the bagging ensemble learning mode is adopted to fuse the deep feature learning algorithm and the deep samples learning algorithm together, thereby constructing a deep double-side learning ensemble model. At the end of this paper, two representative speech datasets of Parkinson's disease were used for verification. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm are effective."
Boosting Active Learning for Speech Recognition with Noisy Pseudo-labeled Samples,"The cost of annotating transcriptions for large speech corpora becomes a bottleneck to maximally enjoy the potential capacity of deep neural network-based automatic speech recognition models. In this paper, we present a new training pipeline boosting the conventional active learning approach targeting label-efficient learning to resolve the mentioned problem. Existing active learning methods only focus on selecting a set of informative samples under a labeling budget. One step further, we suggest that the training efficiency can be further improved by utilizing the unlabeled samples, exceeding the labeling budget, by introducing sophisticatedly configured unsupervised loss complementing supervised loss effectively. We propose new unsupervised loss based on consistency regularization, and we configure appropriate augmentation techniques for utterances to adopt consistency regularization in the automatic speech recognition task. From the qualitative and quantitative experiments on the real-world dataset and under real-usage scenarios, we show that the proposed training pipeline can boost the efficacy of active learning approaches, thus successfully reducing a sustainable amount of human labeling cost."
"Joint Speaker Counting, Speech Recognition, and Speaker Identification for Overlapped Speech of Any Number of Speakers","We propose an end-to-end speaker-attributed automatic speech recognition model that unifies speaker counting, speech recognition, and speaker identification on monaural overlapped speech. Our model is built on serialized output training (SOT) with attention-based encoder-decoder, a recently proposed method for recognizing overlapped speech comprising an arbitrary number of speakers. We extend SOT by introducing a speaker inventory as an auxiliary input to produce speaker labels as well as multi-speaker transcriptions. All model parameters are optimized by speaker-attributed maximum mutual information criterion, which represents a joint probability for overlapped speech recognition and speaker identification. Experiments on LibriSpeech corpus show that our proposed method achieves significantly better speaker-attributed word error rate than the baseline that separately performs overlapped speech recognition and speaker identification."
Multi-Encoder-Decoder Transformer for Code-Switching Speech Recognition,"Code-switching (CS) occurs when a speaker alternates words of two or more languages within a single sentence or across sentences. Automatic speech recognition (ASR) of CS speech has to deal with two or more languages at the same time. In this study, we propose a Transformer-based architecture with two symmetric language-specific encoders to capture the individual language attributes, that improve the acoustic representation of each language. These representations are combined using a language-specific multi-head attention mechanism in the decoder module. Each encoder and its corresponding attention module in the decoder are pre-trained using a large monolingual corpus aiming to alleviate the impact of limited CS training data. We call such a network a multi-encoder-decoder (MED) architecture. Experiments on the SEAME corpus show that the proposed MED architecture achieves 10.2% and 10.8% relative error rate reduction on the CS evaluation sets with Mandarin and English as the matrix language respectively."
Automatic Speech Recognition Benchmark for Air-Traffic Communications,"Advances in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) over the last decade opened new areas of speech-based automation such as in Air-Traffic Control (ATC) environment. Currently, voice communication and data links communications are the only way of contact between pilots and Air-Traffic Controllers (ATCo), where the former is the most widely used and the latter is a non-spoken method mandatory for oceanic messages and limited for some domestic issues. ASR systems on ATCo environments inherit increasing complexity due to accents from non-English speakers, cockpit noise, speaker-dependent biases, and small in-domain ATC databases for training. Hereby, we introduce CleanSky EC-H2020 ATCO2, a project that aims to develop an ASR-based platform to collect, organize and automatically pre-process ATCo speech-data from air space. This paper conveys an exploratory benchmark of several state-of-the-art ASR models trained on more than 170 hours of ATCo speech-data. We demonstrate that the cross-accent flaws due to speakers' accents are minimized due to the amount of data, making the system feasible for ATC environments. The developed ASR system achieves an averaged word error rate (WER) of 7.75% across four databases. An additional 35% relative improvement in WER is achieved on one test set when training a TDNNF system with byte-pair encoding."
Quantization of Acoustic Model Parameters in Automatic Speech Recognition Framework,"State-of-the-art hybrid automatic speech recognition (ASR) system exploits deep neural network (DNN) based acoustic models (AM) trained with Lattice Free-Maximum Mutual Information (LF-MMI) criterion and n-gram language models. The AMs typically have millions of parameters and require significant parameter reduction to operate on embedded devices. The impact of parameter quantization on the overall word recognition performance is studied in this paper. Following approaches are presented: (i) AM trained in Kaldi framework with conventional factorized TDNN (TDNN-F) architecture, (ii) the TDNN AM built in Kaldi loaded into the PyTorch toolkit using a C++ wrapper for post-training quantization, (iii) quantization-aware training in PyTorch for Kaldi TDNN model, (iv) quantization-aware training in Kaldi. Results obtained on standard Librispeech setup provide an interesting overview of recognition accuracy w.r.t. applied quantization scheme."
End-to-End Code Switching Language Models for Automatic Speech Recognition,"In this paper, we particularly work on the code-switched text, one of the most common occurrences in the bilingual communities across the world. Due to the discrepancies in the extraction of code-switched text from an Automated Speech Recognition(ASR) module, and thereby extracting the monolingual text from the code-switched text, we propose an approach for extracting monolingual text using Deep Bi-directional Language Models(LM) such as BERT and other Machine Translation models, and also explore different ways of extracting code-switched text from the ASR model. We also explain the robustness of the model by comparing the results of Perplexity and other different metrics like WER, to the standard bi-lingual text output without any external information."
Data Augmentation for Training Dialog Models Robust to Speech Recognition Errors,"Speech-based virtual assistants, such as Amazon Alexa, Google assistant, and Apple Siri, typically convert users' audio signals to text data through automatic speech recognition (ASR) and feed the text to downstream dialog models for natural language understanding and response generation. The ASR output is error-prone; however, the downstream dialog models are often trained on error-free text data, making them sensitive to ASR errors during inference time. To bridge the gap and make dialog models more robust to ASR errors, we leverage an ASR error simulator to inject noise into the error-free text data, and subsequently train the dialog models with the augmented data. Compared to other approaches for handling ASR errors, such as using ASR lattice or end-to-end methods, our data augmentation approach does not require any modification to the ASR or downstream dialog models; our approach also does not introduce any additional latency during inference time. We perform extensive experiments on benchmark data and show that our approach improves the performance of downstream dialog models in the presence of ASR errors, and it is particularly effective in the low-resource situations where there are constraints on model size or the training data is scarce."
Improving Cross-Lingual Transfer Learning for End-to-End Speech Recognition with Speech Translation,"Transfer learning from high-resource languages is known to be an efficient way to improve end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) for low-resource languages. Pre-trained or jointly trained encoder-decoder models, however, do not share the language modeling (decoder) for the same language, which is likely to be inefficient for distant target languages. We introduce speech-to-text translation (ST) as an auxiliary task to incorporate additional knowledge of the target language and enable transferring from that target language. Specifically, we first translate high-resource ASR transcripts into a target low-resource language, with which a ST model is trained. Both ST and target ASR share the same attention-based encoder-decoder architecture and vocabulary. The former task then provides a fully pre-trained model for the latter, bringing up to 24.6% word error rate (WER) reduction to the baseline (direct transfer from high-resource ASR). We show that training ST with human translations is not necessary. ST trained with machine translation (MT) pseudo-labels brings consistent gains. It can even outperform those using human labels when transferred to target ASR by leveraging only 500K MT examples. Even with pseudo-labels from low-resource MT (200K examples), ST-enhanced transfer brings up to 8.9% WER reduction to direct transfer."
Learning not to Discriminate: Task Agnostic Learning for Improving Monolingual and Code-switched Speech Recognition,"Recognizing code-switched speech is challenging for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) for a variety of reasons, including the lack of code-switched training data. Recently, we showed that monolingual ASR systems fine-tuned on code-switched data deteriorate in performance on monolingual speech recognition, which is not desirable as ASR systems deployed in multilingual scenarios should recognize both monolingual and code-switched speech with high accuracy. Our experiments indicated that this loss in performance could be mitigated by using certain strategies for fine-tuning and regularization, leading to improvements in both monolingual and code-switched ASR. In this work, we present further improvements over our previous work by using domain adversarial learning to train task agnostic models. We evaluate the classification accuracy of an adversarial discriminator and show that it can learn shared layer parameters that are task agnostic. We train end-to-end ASR systems starting with a pooled model that uses monolingual and code-switched data along with the adversarial discriminator. Our proposed technique leads to reductions in Word Error Rates (WER) in monolingual and code-switched test sets across three language pairs."
On the Effectiveness of Neural Text Generation based Data Augmentation for Recognition of Morphologically Rich Speech,"Advanced neural network models have penetrated Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) in recent years, however, in language modeling many systems still rely on traditional Back-off N-gram Language Models (BNLM) partly or entirely. The reason for this are the high cost and complexity of training and using neural language models, mostly possible by adding a second decoding pass (rescoring). In our recent work we have significantly improved the online performance of a conversational speech transcription system by transferring knowledge from a Recurrent Neural Network Language Model (RNNLM) to the single pass BNLM with text generation based data augmentation. In the present paper we analyze the amount of transferable knowledge and demonstrate that the neural augmented LM (RNN-BNLM) can help to capture almost 50% of the knowledge of the RNNLM yet by dropping the second decoding pass and making the system real-time capable. We also systematically compare word and subword LMs and show that subword-based neural text augmentation can be especially beneficial in under-resourced conditions. In addition, we show that using the RNN-BNLM in the first pass followed by a neural second pass, offline ASR results can be even significantly improved."
Learning to Count Words in Fluent Speech enables Online Speech Recognition,"Sequence to Sequence models, in particular the Transformer, achieve state of the art results in Automatic Speech Recognition. Practical usage is however limited to cases where full utterance latency is acceptable. In this work we introduce Taris, a Transformer-based online speech recognition system aided by an auxiliary task of incremental word counting. We use the cumulative word sum to dynamically segment speech and enable its eager decoding into words. Experiments performed on the LRS2, LibriSpeech, and Aishell-1 datasets of English and Mandarin speech show that the online system performs comparable with the offline one when having a dynamic algorithmic delay of 5 segments. Furthermore, we show that the estimated segment length distribution resembles the word length distribution obtained with forced alignment, although our system does not require an exact segment-to-word equivalence. Taris introduces a negligible overhead compared to a standard Transformer, while the local relationship modelling between inputs and outputs grants invariance to sequence length by design."
A Siamese Neural Network with Modified Distance Loss For Transfer Learning in Speech Emotion Recognition,"Automatic emotion recognition plays a significant role in the process of human computer interaction and the design of Internet of Things (IOT) technologies. Yet, a common problem in emotion recognition systems lies in the scarcity of reliable labels. By modeling pairwise differences between samples of interest, a Siamese network can help to mitigate this challenge since it requires fewer samples than traditional deep learning methods. In this paper, we propose a distance loss, which can be applied on the Siamese network fine-tuning, by optimizing the model based on the relevant distance between same and difference class pairs. Our system use samples from the source data to pre-train the weights of proposed Siamese neural network, which are fine-tuned based on the target data. We present an emotion recognition task that uses speech, since it is one of the most ubiquitous and frequently used bio-behavioral signals. Our target data comes from the RAVDESS dataset, while the CREMA-D and eNTERFACE'05 are used as source data, respectively. Our results indicate that the proposed distance loss is able to greatly benefit the fine-tuning process of Siamese network. Also, the selection of source data has more effect on the Siamese network performance compared to the number of frozen layers. These suggest the great potential of applying the Siamese network and modelling pairwise differences in the field of transfer learning for automatic emotion recognition."
Constrained Variational Autoencoder for improving EEG based Speech Recognition Systems,"In this paper we introduce a recurrent neural network (RNN) based variational autoencoder (VAE) model with a new constrained loss function that can generate more meaningful electroencephalography (EEG) features from raw EEG features to improve the performance of EEG based speech recognition systems. We demonstrate that both continuous and isolated speech recognition systems trained and tested using EEG features generated from raw EEG features using our VAE model results in improved performance and we demonstrate our results for a limited English vocabulary consisting of 30 unique sentences for continuous speech recognition and for an English vocabulary consisting of 2 unique sentences for isolated speech recognition. We compare our method with another recently introduced method described by authors in [1] to improve the performance of EEG based continuous speech recognition systems and we demonstrate that our method outperforms their method as vocabulary size increases when trained and tested using the same data set. Even though we demonstrate results only for automatic speech recognition (ASR) experiments in this paper, the proposed VAE model with constrained loss function can be extended to a variety of other EEG based brain computer interface (BCI) applications."
SAN-M: Memory Equipped Self-Attention for End-to-End Speech Recognition,"End-to-end speech recognition has become popular in recent years, since it can integrate the acoustic, pronunciation and language models into a single neural network. Among end-to-end approaches, attention-based methods have emerged as being superior. For example, Transformer, which adopts an encoder-decoder architecture. The key improvement introduced by Transformer is the utilization of self-attention instead of recurrent mechanisms, enabling both encoder and decoder to capture long-range dependencies with lower computational complexity.In this work, we propose boosting the self-attention ability with a DFSMN memory block, forming the proposed memory equipped self-attention (SAN-M) mechanism. Theoretical and empirical comparisons have been made to demonstrate the relevancy and complementarity between self-attention and the DFSMN memory block. Furthermore, the proposed SAN-M provides an efficient mechanism to integrate these two modules. We have evaluated our approach on the public AISHELL-1 benchmark and an industrial-level 20,000-hour Mandarin speech recognition task. On both tasks, SAN-M systems achieved much better performance than the self-attention based Transformer baseline system. Specially, it can achieve a CER of 6.46% on the AISHELL-1 task even without using any external LM, comfortably outperforming other state-of-the-art systems."
Streaming Chunk-Aware Multihead Attention for Online End-to-End Speech Recognition,"Recently, streaming end-to-end automatic speech recognition (E2E-ASR) has gained more and more attention. Many efforts have been paid to turn the non-streaming attention-based E2E-ASR system into streaming architecture. In this work, we propose a novel online E2E-ASR system by using Streaming Chunk-Aware Multihead Attention(SCAMA) and a latency control memory equipped self-attention network (LC-SAN-M). LC-SAN-M uses chunk-level input to control the latency of encoder. As to SCAMA, a jointly trained predictor is used to control the output of encoder when feeding to decoder, which enables decoder to generate output in streaming manner. Experimental results on the open 170-hour AISHELL-1 and an industrial-level 20000-hour Mandarin speech recognition tasks show that our approach can significantly outperform the MoChA-based baseline system under comparable setup. On the AISHELL-1 task, our proposed method achieves a character error rate (CER) of 7.39%, to the best of our knowledge, which is the best published performance for online ASR."
Understanding effect of speech perception in EEG based speech recognition systems,"The electroencephalography (EEG) signals recorded in parallel with speech are used to perform isolated and continuous speech recognition. During speaking process, one also hears his or her own speech and this speech perception is also reflected in the recorded EEG signals. In this paper we investigate whether it is possible to separate out this speech perception component from EEG signals in order to design more robust EEG based speech recognition systems. We further demonstrate predicting EEG signals recorded in parallel with speaking from EEG signals recorded in parallel with passive listening and vice versa with very low normalized root mean squared error (RMSE). We finally demonstrate both isolated and continuous speech recognition using EEG signals recorded in parallel with listening, speaking and improve the previous connectionist temporal classification (CTC) model results demonstrated by authors in [1] using their data set."
Improving EEG based continuous speech recognition using GAN,"In this paper we demonstrate that it is possible to generate more meaningful electroencephalography (EEG) features from raw EEG features using generative adversarial networks (GAN) to improve the performance of EEG based continuous speech recognition systems. We improve the results demonstrated by authors in [1] using their data sets for for some of the test time experiments and for other cases our results were comparable with theirs. Our proposed approach can be implemented without using any additional sensor information, whereas in [1] authors used additional features like acoustic or articulatory information to improve the performance of EEG based continuous speech recognition systems."
Learning to Recognize Code-switched Speech Without Forgetting Monolingual Speech Recognition,"Recently, there has been significant progress made in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) of code-switched speech, leading to gains in accuracy on code-switched datasets in many language pairs. Code-switched speech co-occurs with monolingual speech in one or both languages being mixed. In this work, we show that fine-tuning ASR models on code-switched speech harms performance on monolingual speech. We point out the need to optimize models for code-switching while also ensuring that monolingual performance is not sacrificed. Monolingual models may be trained on thousands of hours of speech which may not be available for re-training a new model. We propose using the Learning Without Forgetting (LWF) framework for code-switched ASR when we only have access to a monolingual model and do not have the data it was trained on. We show that it is possible to train models using this framework that perform well on both code-switched and monolingual test sets. In cases where we have access to monolingual training data as well, we propose regularization strategies for fine-tuning models for code-switching without sacrificing monolingual accuracy. We report improvements in Word Error Rate (WER) in monolingual and code-switched test sets compared to baselines that use pooled data and simple fine-tuning."
Detecting Adversarial Examples for Speech Recognition via Uncertainty Quantification,"Machine learning systems and also, specifically, automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems are vulnerable against adversarial attacks, where an attacker maliciously changes the input. In the case of ASR systems, the most interesting cases are targeted attacks, in which an attacker aims to force the system into recognizing given target transcriptions in an arbitrary audio sample. The increasing number of sophisticated, quasi imperceptible attacks raises the question of countermeasures. In this paper, we focus on hybrid ASR systems and compare four acoustic models regarding their ability to indicate uncertainty under attack: a feed-forward neural network and three neural networks specifically designed for uncertainty quantification, namely a Bayesian neural network, Monte Carlo dropout, and a deep ensemble. We employ uncertainty measures of the acoustic model to construct a simple one-class classification model for assessing whether inputs are benign or adversarial. Based on this approach, we are able to detect adversarial examples with an area under the receiving operator curve score of more than 0.99. The neural networks for uncertainty quantification simultaneously diminish the vulnerability to the attack, which is reflected in a lower recognition accuracy of the malicious target text in comparison to a standard hybrid ASR system."
On the Comparison of Popular End-to-End Models for Large Scale Speech Recognition,"Recently, there has been a strong push to transition from hybrid models to end-to-end (E2E) models for automatic speech recognition. Currently, there are three promising E2E methods: recurrent neural network transducer (RNN-T), RNN attention-based encoder-decoder (AED), and Transformer-AED. In this study, we conduct an empirical comparison of RNN-T, RNN-AED, and Transformer-AED models, in both non-streaming and streaming modes. We use 65 thousand hours of Microsoft anonymized training data to train these models. As E2E models are more data hungry, it is better to compare their effectiveness with large amount of training data. To the best of our knowledge, no such comprehensive study has been conducted yet. We show that although AED models are stronger than RNN-T in the non-streaming mode, RNN-T is very competitive in streaming mode if its encoder can be properly initialized. Among all three E2E models, transformer-AED achieved the best accuracy in both streaming and non-streaming mode. We show that both streaming RNN-T and transformer-AED models can obtain better accuracy than a highly-optimized hybrid model."
Insertion-Based Modeling for End-to-End Automatic Speech Recognition,"End-to-end (E2E) models have gained attention in the research field of automatic speech recognition (ASR). Many E2E models proposed so far assume left-to-right autoregressive generation of an output token sequence except for connectionist temporal classification (CTC) and its variants. However, left-to-right decoding cannot consider the future output context, and it is not always optimal for ASR. One of the non-left-to-right models is known as non-autoregressive Transformer (NAT) and has been intensively investigated in the area of neural machine translation (NMT) research. One NAT model, mask-predict, has been applied to ASR but the model needs some heuristics or additional component to estimate the length of the output token sequence. This paper proposes to apply another type of NAT called insertion-based models, that were originally proposed for NMT, to ASR tasks. Insertion-based models solve the above mask-predict issues and can generate an arbitrary generation order of an output sequence. In addition, we introduce a new formulation of joint training of the insertion-based models and CTC. This formulation reinforces CTC by making it dependent on insertion-based token generation in a non-autoregressive manner. We conducted experiments on three public benchmarks and achieved competitive performance to strong autoregressive Transformer with a similar decoding condition."
Multi-Staged Cross-Lingual Acoustic Model Adaption for Robust Speech Recognition in Real-World Applications -- A Case Study on German Oral History Interviews,"While recent automatic speech recognition systems achieve remarkable performance when large amounts of adequate, high quality annotated speech data is used for training, the same systems often only achieve an unsatisfactory result for tasks in domains that greatly deviate from the conditions represented by the training data. For many real-world applications, there is a lack of sufficient data that can be directly used for training robust speech recognition systems. To address this issue, we propose and investigate an approach that performs a robust acoustic model adaption to a target domain in a cross-lingual, multi-staged manner. Our approach enables the exploitation of large-scale training data from other domains in both the same and other languages. We evaluate our approach using the challenging task of German oral history interviews, where we achieve a relative reduction of the word error rate by more than 30% compared to a model trained from scratch only on the target domain, and 6-7% relative compared to a model trained robustly on 1000 hours of same-language out-of-domain training data."
Adapting End-to-End Speech Recognition for Readable Subtitles,"Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems are primarily evaluated on transcription accuracy. However, in some use cases such as subtitling, verbatim transcription would reduce output readability given limited screen size and reading time. Therefore, this work focuses on ASR with output compression, a task challenging for supervised approaches due to the scarcity of training data. We first investigate a cascaded system, where an unsupervised compression model is used to post-edit the transcribed speech. We then compare several methods of end-to-end speech recognition under output length constraints. The experiments show that with limited data far less than needed for training a model from scratch, we can adapt a Transformer-based ASR model to incorporate both transcription and compression capabilities. Furthermore, the best performance in terms of WER and ROUGE scores is achieved by explicitly modeling the length constraints within the end-to-end ASR system."
Low-Latency Sequence-to-Sequence Speech Recognition and Translation by Partial Hypothesis Selection,"Encoder-decoder models provide a generic architecture for sequence-to-sequence tasks such as speech recognition and translation. While offline systems are often evaluated on quality metrics like word error rates (WER) and BLEU, latency is also a crucial factor in many practical use-cases. We propose three latency reduction techniques for chunk-based incremental inference and evaluate their efficiency in terms of accuracy-latency trade-off. On the 300-hour How2 dataset, we reduce latency by 83% to 0.8 second by sacrificing 1% WER (6% rel.) compared to offline transcription. Although our experiments use the Transformer, the hypothesis selection strategies are applicable to other encoder-decoder models. To avoid expensive re-computation, we use a unidirectionally-attending encoder. After an adaptation procedure to partial sequences, the unidirectional model performs on-par with the original model. We further show that our approach is also applicable to low-latency speech translation. On How2 English-Portuguese speech translation, we reduce latency to 0.7 second (-84% rel.) while incurring a loss of 2.4 BLEU points (5% rel.) compared to the offline system."
End-to-end Named Entity Recognition from English Speech,"Named entity recognition (NER) from text has been a widely studied problem and usually extracts semantic information from text. Until now, NER from speech is mostly studied in a two-step pipeline process that includes first applying an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system on an audio sample and then passing the predicted transcript to a NER tagger. In such cases, the error does not propagate from one step to another as both the tasks are not optimized in an end-to-end (E2E) fashion. Recent studies confirm that integrated approaches (e.g., E2E ASR) outperform sequential ones (e.g., phoneme based ASR). In this paper, we introduce a first publicly available NER annotated dataset for English speech and present an E2E approach, which jointly optimizes the ASR and NER tagger components. Experimental results show that the proposed E2E approach outperforms the classical two-step approach. We also discuss how NER from speech can be used to handle out of vocabulary (OOV) words in an ASR system."
Deep Reinforcement Learning with Pre-training for Time-efficient Training of Automatic Speech Recognition,"Deep reinforcement learning (deep RL) is a combination of deep learning with reinforcement learning principles to create efficient methods that can learn by interacting with its environment. This has led to breakthroughs in many complex tasks, such as playing the game ""Go"", that were previously difficult to solve. However, deep RL requires significant training time making it difficult to use in various real-life applications such as Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). In this paper, we study pre-training in deep RL to reduce the training time and improve the performance of Speech Recognition, a popular application of HCI. To evaluate the performance improvement in training we use the publicly available ""Speech Command"" dataset, which contains utterances of 30 command keywords spoken by 2,618 speakers. Results show that pre-training with deep RL offers faster convergence compared to non-pre-trained RL while achieving improved speech recognition accuracy."
Large scale evaluation of importance maps in automatic speech recognition,"In this paper, we propose a metric that we call the structured saliency benchmark (SSBM) to evaluate importance maps computed for automatic speech recognizers on individual utterances. These maps indicate time-frequency points of the utterance that are most important for correct recognition of a target word. Our evaluation technique is not only suitable for standard classification tasks, but is also appropriate for structured prediction tasks like sequence-to-sequence models. Additionally, we use this approach to perform a large scale comparison of the importance maps created by our previously introduced technique using ""bubble noise"" to identify important points through correlation with a baseline approach based on smoothed speech energy and forced alignment. Our results show that the bubble analysis approach is better at identifying important speech regions than this baseline on 100 sentences from the AMI corpus."
Dynamic Sparsity Neural Networks for Automatic Speech Recognition,"In automatic speech recognition (ASR), model pruning is a widely adopted technique that reduces model size and latency to deploy neural network models on edge devices with resource constraints. However, multiple models with different sparsity levels usually need to be separately trained and deployed to heterogeneous target hardware with different resource specifications and for applications that have various latency requirements. In this paper, we present Dynamic Sparsity Neural Networks (DSNN) that, once trained, can instantly switch to any predefined sparsity configuration at run-time. We demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of DSNN using experiments on internal production datasets with Google Voice Search data, and show that the performance of a DSNN model is on par with that of individually trained single sparsity networks. Our trained DSNN model, therefore, can greatly ease the training process and simplify deployment in diverse scenarios with resource constraints."
End-to-End Far-Field Speech Recognition with Unified Dereverberation and Beamforming,"Despite successful applications of end-to-end approaches in multi-channel speech recognition, the performance still degrades severely when the speech is corrupted by reverberation. In this paper, we integrate the dereverberation module into the end-to-end multi-channel speech recognition system and explore two different frontend architectures. First, a multi-source mask-based weighted prediction error (WPE) module is incorporated in the frontend for dereverberation. Second, another novel frontend architecture is proposed, which extends the weighted power minimization distortionless response (WPD) convolutional beamformer to perform simultaneous separation and dereverberation. We derive a new formulation from the original WPD, which can handle multi-source input, and replace eigenvalue decomposition with the matrix inverse operation to make the back-propagation algorithm more stable. The above two architectures are optimized in a fully end-to-end manner, only using the speech recognition criterion. Experiments on both spatialized wsj1-2mix corpus and REVERB show that our proposed model outperformed the conventional methods in reverberant scenarios."
ASAPP-ASR: Multistream CNN and Self-Attentive SRU for SOTA Speech Recognition,"In this paper we present state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the LibriSpeech corpus with two novel neural network architectures, a multistream CNN for acoustic modeling and a self-attentive simple recurrent unit (SRU) for language modeling. In the hybrid ASR framework, the multistream CNN acoustic model processes an input of speech frames in multiple parallel pipelines where each stream has a unique dilation rate for diversity. Trained with the SpecAugment data augmentation method, it achieves relative word error rate (WER) improvements of 4% on test-clean and 14% on test-other. We further improve the performance via N-best rescoring using a 24-layer self-attentive SRU language model, achieving WERs of 1.75% on test-clean and 4.46% on test-other."
Simplified Self-Attention for Transformer-based End-to-End Speech Recognition,"Transformer models have been introduced into end-to-end speech recognition with state-of-the-art performance on various tasks owing to their superiority in modeling long-term dependencies. However, such improvements are usually obtained through the use of very large neural networks. Transformer models mainly include two submodules - position-wise feedforward layers and self-attention (SAN) layers. In this paper, to reduce the model complexity while maintaining good performance, we propose a simplified self-attention (SSAN) layer which employs FSMN memory block instead of projection layers to form query and key vectors for transformer-based end-to-end speech recognition. We evaluate the SSAN-based and the conventional SAN-based transformers on the public AISHELL-1, internal 1000-hour and 20,000-hour large-scale Mandarin tasks. Results show that our proposed SSAN-based transformer model can achieve over 20% relative reduction in model parameters and 6.7% relative CER reduction on the AISHELL-1 task. With impressively 20% parameter reduction, our model shows no loss of recognition performance on the 20,000-hour large-scale task."
A Comparison of Label-Synchronous and Frame-Synchronous End-to-End Models for Speech Recognition,"End-to-end models are gaining wider attention in the field of automatic speech recognition (ASR). One of their advantages is the simplicity of building that directly recognizes the speech frame sequence into the text label sequence by neural networks. According to the driving end in the recognition process, end-to-end ASR models could be categorized into two types: label-synchronous and frame-synchronous, each of which has unique model behaviour and characteristic. In this work, we make a detailed comparison on a representative label-synchronous model (transformer) and a soft frame-synchronous model (continuous integrate-and-fire (CIF) based model). The results on three public dataset and a large-scale dataset with 12000 hours of training data show that the two types of models have respective advantages that are consistent with their synchronous mode."
Relative Positional Encoding for Speech Recognition and Direct Translation,"Transformer models are powerful sequence-to-sequence architectures that are capable of directly mapping speech inputs to transcriptions or translations. However, the mechanism for modeling positions in this model was tailored for text modeling, and thus is less ideal for acoustic inputs. In this work, we adapt the relative position encoding scheme to the Speech Transformer, where the key addition is relative distance between input states in the self-attention network. As a result, the network can better adapt to the variable distributions present in speech data. Our experiments show that our resulting model achieves the best recognition result on the Switchboard benchmark in the non-augmentation condition, and the best published result in the MuST-C speech translation benchmark. We also show that this model is able to better utilize synthetic data than the Transformer, and adapts better to variable sentence segmentation quality for speech translation."
A Further Study of Unsupervised Pre-training for Transformer Based Speech Recognition,"Building a good speech recognition system usually requires large amounts of transcribed data, which is expensive to collect. To tackle this problem, many unsupervised pre-training methods have been proposed. Among these methods, Masked Predictive Coding achieved significant improvements on various speech recognition datasets with BERT-like Masked Reconstruction loss and Transformer backbone. However, many aspects of MPC have not been fully investigated. In this paper, we conduct a further study on MPC and focus on three important aspects: the effect of pre-training data speaking style, its extension on streaming model, and how to better transfer learned knowledge from pre-training stage to downstream tasks. Experiments reveled that pre-training data with matching speaking style is more useful on downstream recognition tasks. A unified training objective with APC and MPC provided 8.46% relative error reduction on streaming model trained on HKUST. Also, the combination of target data adaption and layer-wise discriminative training helped the knowledge transfer of MPC, which achieved 3.99% relative error reduction on AISHELL over a strong baseline."
Exploring Transformers for Large-Scale Speech Recognition,"While recurrent neural networks still largely define state-of-the-art speech recognition systems, the Transformer network has been proven to be a competitive alternative, especially in the offline condition. Most studies with Transformers have been constrained in a relatively small scale setting, and some forms of data argumentation approaches are usually applied to combat the data sparsity issue. In this paper, we aim at understanding the behaviors of Transformers in the large-scale speech recognition setting, where we have used around 65,000 hours of training data. We investigated various aspects on scaling up Transformers, including model initialization, warmup training as well as different Layer Normalization strategies. In the streaming condition, we compared the widely used attention mask based future context lookahead approach to the Transformer-XL network. From our experiments, we show that Transformers can achieve around 6% relative word error rate (WER) reduction compared to the BLSTM baseline in the offline fashion, while in the streaming fashion, Transformer-XL is comparable to LC-BLSTM with 800 millisecond latency constraint."
Improved Noisy Student Training for Automatic Speech Recognition,"Recently, a semi-supervised learning method known as ""noisy student training"" has been shown to improve image classification performance of deep networks significantly. Noisy student training is an iterative self-training method that leverages augmentation to improve network performance. In this work, we adapt and improve noisy student training for automatic speech recognition, employing (adaptive) SpecAugment as the augmentation method. We find effective methods to filter, balance and augment the data generated in between self-training iterations. By doing so, we are able to obtain word error rates (WERs) 4.2%/8.6% on the clean/noisy LibriSpeech test sets by only using the clean 100h subset of LibriSpeech as the supervised set and the rest (860h) as the unlabeled set. Furthermore, we are able to achieve WERs 1.7%/3.4% on the clean/noisy LibriSpeech test sets by using the unlab-60k subset of LibriLight as the unlabeled set for LibriSpeech 960h. We are thus able to improve upon the previous state-of-the-art clean/noisy test WERs achieved on LibriSpeech 100h (4.74%/12.20%) and LibriSpeech (1.9%/4.1%)."
Distilling Knowledge from Ensembles of Acoustic Models for Joint CTC-Attention End-to-End Speech Recognition,"Knowledge distillation has been widely used to compress existing deep learning models while preserving the performance on a wide range of applications. In the specific context of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), distillation from ensembles of acoustic models has recently shown promising results in increasing recognition performance. In this paper, we propose an extension of multi-teacher distillation methods to joint CTC-attention end-to-end ASR systems. We also introduce three novel distillation strategies. The core intuition behind them is to integrate the error rate metric to the teacher selection rather than solely focusing on the observed losses. In this way, we directly distill and optimize the student toward the relevant metric for speech recognition. We evaluate these strategies under a selection of training procedures on different datasets (TIMIT, Librispeech, Common Voice) and various languages (English, French, Italian). In particular, state-of-the-art error rates are reported on the Common Voice French, Italian and TIMIT datasets."
Should we hard-code the recurrence concept or learn it instead ? Exploring the Transformer architecture for Audio-Visual Speech Recognition,"The audio-visual speech fusion strategy AV Align has shown significant performance improvements in audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) on the challenging LRS2 dataset. Performance improvements range between 7% and 30% depending on the noise level when leveraging the visual modality of speech in addition to the auditory one. This work presents a variant of AV Align where the recurrent Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) computation block is replaced by the more recently proposed Transformer block. We compare the two methods, discussing in greater detail their strengths and weaknesses. We find that Transformers also learn cross-modal monotonic alignments, but suffer from the same visual convergence problems as the LSTM model, calling for a deeper investigation into the dominant modality problem in machine learning."
Iterative Pseudo-Labeling for Speech Recognition,"Pseudo-labeling has recently shown promise in end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR). We study Iterative Pseudo-Labeling (IPL), a semi-supervised algorithm which efficiently performs multiple iterations of pseudo-labeling on unlabeled data as the acoustic model evolves. In particular, IPL fine-tunes an existing model at each iteration using both labeled data and a subset of unlabeled data. We study the main components of IPL: decoding with a language model and data augmentation. We then demonstrate the effectiveness of IPL by achieving state-of-the-art word-error rate on the Librispeech test sets in both standard and low-resource setting. We also study the effect of language models trained on different corpora to show IPL can effectively utilize additional text. Finally, we release a new large in-domain text corpus which does not overlap with the Librispeech training transcriptions to foster research in low-resource, semi-supervised ASR"
Generative Adversarial Training Data Adaptation for Very Low-resource Automatic Speech Recognition,"It is important to transcribe and archive speech data of endangered languages for preserving heritages of verbal culture and automatic speech recognition (ASR) is a powerful tool to facilitate this process. However, since endangered languages do not generally have large corpora with many speakers, the performance of ASR models trained on them are considerably poor in general. Nevertheless, we are often left with a lot of recordings of spontaneous speech data that have to be transcribed. In this work, for mitigating this speaker sparsity problem, we propose to convert the whole training speech data and make it sound like the test speaker in order to develop a highly accurate ASR system for this speaker. For this purpose, we utilize a CycleGAN-based non-parallel voice conversion technology to forge a labeled training data that is close to the test speaker's speech. We evaluated this speaker adaptation approach on two low-resource corpora, namely, Ainu and Mboshi. We obtained 35-60% relative improvement in phone error rate on the Ainu corpus, and 40% relative improvement was attained on the Mboshi corpus. This approach outperformed two conventional methods namely unsupervised adaptation and multilingual training with these two corpora."
Weak-Attention Suppression For Transformer Based Speech Recognition,"Transformers, originally proposed for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, have recently achieved great success in automatic speech recognition (ASR). However, adjacent acoustic units (i.e., frames) are highly correlated, and long-distance dependencies between them are weak, unlike text units. It suggests that ASR will likely benefit from sparse and localized attention. In this paper, we propose Weak-Attention Suppression (WAS), a method that dynamically induces sparsity in attention probabilities. We demonstrate that WAS leads to consistent Word Error Rate (WER) improvement over strong transformer baselines. On the widely used LibriSpeech benchmark, our proposed method reduced WER by 10%$ on test-clean and 5% on test-other for streamable transformers, resulting in a new state-of-the-art among streaming models. Further analysis shows that WAS learns to suppress attention of non-critical and redundant continuous acoustic frames, and is more likely to suppress past frames rather than future ones. It indicates the importance of lookahead in attention-based ASR models."
Audio-visual Multi-channel Recognition of Overlapped Speech,"Automatic speech recognition (ASR) of overlapped speech remains a highly challenging task to date. To this end, multi-channel microphone array data are widely used in state-of-the-art ASR systems. Motivated by the invariance of visual modality to acoustic signal corruption, this paper presents an audio-visual multi-channel overlapped speech recognition system featuring tightly integrated separation front-end and recognition back-end. A series of audio-visual multi-channel speech separation front-end components based on \textit{TF masking}, \textit{filter\&sum} and \textit{mask-based MVDR} beamforming approaches were developed. To reduce the error cost mismatch between the separation and recognition components, they were jointly fine-tuned using the connectionist temporal classification (CTC) loss function, or a multi-task criterion interpolation with scale-invariant signal to noise ratio (Si-SNR) error cost. Experiments suggest that the proposed multi-channel AVSR system outperforms the baseline audio-only ASR system by up to 6.81\% (26.83\% relative) and 22.22\% (56.87\% relative) absolute word error rate (WER) reduction on overlapped speech constructed using either simulation or replaying of the lipreading sentence 2 (LRS2) dataset respectively."
Quaternion Neural Networks for Multi-channel Distant Speech Recognition,"Despite the significant progress in automatic speech recognition (ASR), distant ASR remains challenging due to noise and reverberation. A common approach to mitigate this issue consists of equipping the recording devices with multiple microphones that capture the acoustic scene from different perspectives. These multi-channel audio recordings contain specific internal relations between each signal. In this paper, we propose to capture these inter- and intra- structural dependencies with quaternion neural networks, which can jointly process multiple signals as whole quaternion entities. The quaternion algebra replaces the standard dot product with the Hamilton one, thus offering a simple and elegant way to model dependencies between elements. The quaternion layers are then coupled with a recurrent neural network, which can learn long-term dependencies in the time domain. We show that a quaternion long-short term memory neural network (QLSTM), trained on the concatenated multi-channel speech signals, outperforms equivalent real-valued LSTM on two different tasks of multi-channel distant speech recognition."
Attention-based Transducer for Online Speech Recognition,"Recent studies reveal the potential of recurrent neural network transducer (RNN-T) for end-to-end (E2E) speech recognition. Among some most popular E2E systems including RNN-T, Attention Encoder-Decoder (AED), and Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC), RNN-T has some clear advantages given that it supports streaming recognition and does not have frame-independency assumption. Although significant progresses have been made for RNN-T research, it is still facing performance challenges in terms of training speed and accuracy. We propose attention-based transducer with modification over RNN-T in two aspects. First, we introduce chunk-wise attention in the joint network. Second, self-attention is introduced in the encoder. Our proposed model outperforms RNN-T for both training speed and accuracy. For training, we achieves over 1.7x speedup. With 500 hours LAIX non-native English training data, attention-based transducer yields ~10.6% WER reduction over baseline RNN-T. Trained with full set of over 10K hours data, our final system achieves ~5.5% WER reduction over that trained with the best Kaldi TDNN-f recipe. After 8-bit weight quantization without WER degradation, RTF and latency drop to 0.34~0.36 and 268~409 milliseconds respectively on a single CPU core of a production server."
"Deep Architecture Enhancing Robustness to Noise, Adversarial Attacks, and Cross-corpus Setting for Speech Emotion Recognition","Speech emotion recognition systems (SER) can achieve high accuracy when the training and test data are identically distributed, but this assumption is frequently violated in practice and the performance of SER systems plummet against unforeseen data shifts. The design of robust models for accurate SER is challenging, which limits its use in practical applications. In this paper we propose a deeper neural network architecture wherein we fuse DenseNet, LSTM and Highway Network to learn powerful discriminative features which are robust to noise. We also propose data augmentation with our network architecture to further improve the robustness. We comprehensively evaluate the architecture coupled with data augmentation against (1) noise, (2) adversarial attacks and (3) cross-corpus settings. Our evaluations on the widely used IEMOCAP and MSP-IMPROV datasets show promising results when compared with existing studies and state-of-the-art models."
Augmenting Generative Adversarial Networks for Speech Emotion Recognition,"Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have shown potential in learning emotional attributes and generating new data samples. However, their performance is usually hindered by the unavailability of larger speech emotion recognition (SER) data. In this work, we propose a framework that utilises the mixup data augmentation scheme to augment the GAN in feature learning and generation. To show the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we present results for SER on (i) synthetic feature vectors, (ii) augmentation of the training data with synthetic features, (iii) encoded features in compressed representation. Our results show that the proposed framework can effectively learn compressed emotional representations as well as it can generate synthetic samples that help improve performance in within-corpus and cross-corpus evaluation."
Conformer: Convolution-augmented Transformer for Speech Recognition,"Recently Transformer and Convolution neural network (CNN) based models have shown promising results in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), outperforming Recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Transformer models are good at capturing content-based global interactions, while CNNs exploit local features effectively. In this work, we achieve the best of both worlds by studying how to combine convolution neural networks and transformers to model both local and global dependencies of an audio sequence in a parameter-efficient way. To this regard, we propose the convolution-augmented transformer for speech recognition, named Conformer. Conformer significantly outperforms the previous Transformer and CNN based models achieving state-of-the-art accuracies. On the widely used LibriSpeech benchmark, our model achieves WER of 2.1%/4.3% without using a language model and 1.9%/3.9% with an external language model on test/testother. We also observe competitive performance of 2.7%/6.3% with a small model of only 10M parameters."
Speech Recognition and Multi-Speaker Diarization of Long Conversations,"Speech recognition (ASR) and speaker diarization (SD) models have traditionally been trained separately to produce rich conversation transcripts with speaker labels. Recent advances have shown that joint ASR and SD models can learn to leverage audio-lexical inter-dependencies to improve word diarization performance. We introduce a new benchmark of hour-long podcasts collected from the weekly This American Life radio program to better compare these approaches when applied to extended multi-speaker conversations. We find that training separate ASR and SD models perform better when utterance boundaries are known but otherwise joint models can perform better. To handle long conversations with unknown utterance boundaries, we introduce a striding attention decoding algorithm and data augmentation techniques which, combined with model pre-training, improves ASR and SD."
AccentDB: A Database of Non-Native English Accents to Assist Neural Speech Recognition,"Modern Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technology has evolved to identify the speech spoken by native speakers of a language very well. However, identification of the speech spoken by non-native speakers continues to be a major challenge for it. In this work, we first spell out the key requirements for creating a well-curated database of speech samples in non-native accents for training and testing robust ASR systems. We then introduce AccentDB, one such database that contains samples of 4 Indian-English accents collected by us, and a compilation of samples from 4 native-English, and a metropolitan Indian-English accent. We also present an analysis on separability of the collected accent data. Further, we present several accent classification models and evaluate them thoroughly against human-labelled accent classes. We test the generalization of our classifier models in a variety of setups of seen and unseen data. Finally, we introduce the task of accent neutralization of non-native accents to native accents using autoencoder models with task-specific architectures. Thus, our work aims to aid ASR systems at every stage of development with a database for training, classification models for feature augmentation, and neutralization systems for acoustic transformations of non-native accents of English."
Spike-Triggered Non-Autoregressive Transformer for End-to-End Speech Recognition,"Non-autoregressive transformer models have achieved extremely fast inference speed and comparable performance with autoregressive sequence-to-sequence models in neural machine translation. Most of the non-autoregressive transformers decode the target sequence from a predefined-length mask sequence. If the predefined length is too long, it will cause a lot of redundant calculations. If the predefined length is shorter than the length of the target sequence, it will hurt the performance of the model. To address this problem and improve the inference speed, we propose a spike-triggered non-autoregressive transformer model for end-to-end speech recognition, which introduces a CTC module to predict the length of the target sequence and accelerate the convergence. All the experiments are conducted on a public Chinese mandarin dataset AISHELL-1. The results show that the proposed model can accurately predict the length of the target sequence and achieve a competitive performance with the advanced transformers. What's more, the model even achieves a real-time factor of 0.0056, which exceeds all mainstream speech recognition models."
ConcealNet: An End-to-end Neural Network for Packet Loss Concealment in Deep Speech Emotion Recognition,"Packet loss is a common problem in data transmission, including speech data transmission. This may affect a wide range of applications that stream audio data, like streaming applications or speech emotion recognition (SER). Packet Loss Concealment (PLC) is any technique of facing packet loss. Simple PLC baselines are 0-substitution or linear interpolation. In this paper, we present a concealment wrapper, which can be used with stacked recurrent neural cells. The concealment cell can provide a recurrent neural network (ConcealNet), that performs real-time step-wise end-to-end PLC at inference time. Additionally, extending this with an end-to-end emotion prediction neural network provides a network that performs SER from audio with lost frames, end-to-end. The proposed model is compared against the fore-mentioned baselines. Additionally, a bidirectional variant with better performance is utilised. For evaluation, we chose the public RECOLA dataset given its long audio tracks with continuous emotion labels. ConcealNet is evaluated on the reconstruction of the audio and the quality of corresponding emotions predicted after that. The proposed ConcealNet model has shown considerable improvement, for both audio reconstruction and the corresponding emotion prediction, in environments that do not have losses with long duration, even when the losses occur frequently."
"""I have vxxx bxx connexxxn!"": Facing Packet Loss in Deep Speech Emotion Recognition","In applications that use emotion recognition via speech, frame-loss can be a severe issue given manifold applications, where the audio stream loses some data frames, for a variety of reasons like low bandwidth. In this contribution, we investigate for the first time the effects of frame-loss on the performance of emotion recognition via speech. Reproducible extensive experiments are reported on the popular RECOLA corpus using a state-of-the-art end-to-end deep neural network, which mainly consists of convolution blocks and recurrent layers. A simple environment based on a Markov Chain model is used to model the loss mechanism based on two main parameters. We explore matched, mismatched, and multi-condition training settings. As one expects, the matched setting yields the best performance, while the mismatched yields the lowest. Furthermore, frame-loss as a data augmentation technique is introduced as a general-purpose strategy to overcome the effects of frame-loss. It can be used during training, and we observed it to produce models that are more robust against frame-loss in run-time environments."
You Do Not Need More Data: Improving End-To-End Speech Recognition by Text-To-Speech Data Augmentation,"Data augmentation is one of the most effective ways to make end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) perform close to the conventional hybrid approach, especially when dealing with low-resource tasks. Using recent advances in speech synthesis (text-to-speech, or TTS), we build our TTS system on an ASR training database and then extend the data with synthesized speech to train a recognition model. We argue that, when the training data amount is relatively low, this approach can allow an end-to-end model to reach hybrid systems' quality. For an artificial low-to-medium-resource setup, we compare the proposed augmentation with the semi-supervised learning technique. We also investigate the influence of vocoder usage on final ASR performance by comparing Griffin-Lim algorithm with our modified LPCNet. When applied with an external language model, our approach outperforms a semi-supervised setup for LibriSpeech test-clean and only 33% worse than a comparable supervised setup. Our system establishes a competitive result for end-to-end ASR trained on LibriSpeech train-clean-100 set with WER 4.3% for test-clean and 13.5% for test-other."
DARTS-ASR: Differentiable Architecture Search for Multilingual Speech Recognition and Adaptation,"In previous works, only parameter weights of ASR models are optimized under fixed-topology architecture. However, the design of successful model architecture has always relied on human experience and intuition. Besides, many hyperparameters related to model architecture need to be manually tuned. Therefore in this paper, we propose an ASR approach with efficient gradient-based architecture search, DARTS-ASR. In order to examine the generalizability of DARTS-ASR, we apply our approach not only on many languages to perform monolingual ASR, but also on a multilingual ASR setting. Following previous works, we conducted experiments on a multilingual dataset, IARPA BABEL. The experiment results show that our approach outperformed the baseline fixed-topology architecture by 10.2% and 10.0% relative reduction on character error rates under monolingual and multilingual ASR settings respectively. Furthermore, we perform some analysis on the searched architectures by DARTS-ASR."
Discriminative Multi-modality Speech Recognition,"Vision is often used as a complementary modality for audio speech recognition (ASR), especially in the noisy environment where performance of solo audio modality significantly deteriorates. After combining visual modality, ASR is upgraded to the multi-modality speech recognition (MSR). In this paper, we propose a two-stage speech recognition model. In the first stage, the target voice is separated from background noises with help from the corresponding visual information of lip movements, making the model 'listen' clearly. At the second stage, the audio modality combines visual modality again to better understand the speech by a MSR sub-network, further improving the recognition rate. There are some other key contributions: we introduce a pseudo-3D residual convolution (P3D)-based visual front-end to extract more discriminative features; we upgrade the temporal convolution block from 1D ResNet with the temporal convolutional network (TCN), which is more suitable for the temporal tasks; the MSR sub-network is built on the top of Element-wise-Attention Gated Recurrent Unit (EleAtt-GRU), which is more effective than Transformer in long sequences. We conducted extensive experiments on the LRS3-TED and the LRW datasets. Our two-stage model (audio enhanced multi-modality speech recognition, AE-MSR) consistently achieves the state-of-the-art performance by a significant margin, which demonstrates the necessity and effectiveness of AE-MSR."
"Listen Attentively, and Spell Once: Whole Sentence Generation via a Non-Autoregressive Architecture for Low-Latency Speech Recognition","Although attention based end-to-end models have achieved promising performance in speech recognition, the multi-pass forward computation in beam-search increases inference time cost, which limits their practical applications. To address this issue, we propose a non-autoregressive end-to-end speech recognition system called LASO (listen attentively, and spell once). Because of the non-autoregressive property, LASO predicts a textual token in the sequence without the dependence on other tokens. Without beam-search, the one-pass propagation much reduces inference time cost of LASO. And because the model is based on the attention based feedforward structure, the computation can be implemented in parallel efficiently. We conduct experiments on publicly available Chinese dataset AISHELL-1. LASO achieves a character error rate of 6.4%, which outperforms the state-of-the-art autoregressive transformer model (6.7%). The average inference latency is 21 ms, which is 1/50 of the autoregressive transformer model."
Incremental Learning for End-to-End Automatic Speech Recognition,"In this paper, we propose an incremental learning method for end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) which enables an ASR system to perform well on new tasks while maintaining the performance on its originally learned ones. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting during incremental learning, we design a novel explainability-based knowledge distillation for ASR models, which is combined with a response-based knowledge distillation to maintain the original model's predictions and the ""reason"" for the predictions. Our method works without access to the training data of original tasks, which addresses the cases where the previous data is no longer available or joint training is costly. Results on a multi-stage sequential training task show that our method outperforms existing ones in mitigating forgetting. Furthermore, in two practical scenarios, compared to the target-reference joint training method, the performance drop of our method is 0.02% Character Error Rate (CER), which is 97% smaller than the drops of the baseline methods."
ContextNet: Improving Convolutional Neural Networks for Automatic Speech Recognition with Global Context,"Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have shown promising results for end-to-end speech recognition, albeit still behind other state-of-the-art methods in performance. In this paper, we study how to bridge this gap and go beyond with a novel CNN-RNN-transducer architecture, which we call ContextNet. ContextNet features a fully convolutional encoder that incorporates global context information into convolution layers by adding squeeze-and-excitation modules. In addition, we propose a simple scaling method that scales the widths of ContextNet that achieves good trade-off between computation and accuracy. We demonstrate that on the widely used LibriSpeech benchmark, ContextNet achieves a word error rate (WER) of 2.1%/4.6% without external language model (LM), 1.9%/4.1% with LM and 2.9%/7.0% with only 10M parameters on the clean/noisy LibriSpeech test sets. This compares to the previous best published system of 2.0%/4.6% with LM and 3.9%/11.3% with 20M parameters. The superiority of the proposed ContextNet model is also verified on a much larger internal dataset."
End-to-end Whispered Speech Recognition with Frequency-weighted Approaches and Pseudo Whisper Pre-training,"Whispering is an important mode of human speech, but no end-to-end recognition results for it were reported yet, probably due to the scarcity of available whispered speech data. In this paper, we present several approaches for end-to-end (E2E) recognition of whispered speech considering the special characteristics of whispered speech and the scarcity of data. This includes a frequency-weighted SpecAugment policy and a frequency-divided CNN feature extractor for better capturing the high-frequency structures of whispered speech, and a layer-wise transfer learning approach to pre-train a model with normal or normal-to-whispered converted speech then fine-tune it with whispered speech to bridge the gap between whispered and normal speech. We achieve an overall relative reduction of 19.8% in PER and 44.4% in CER on a relatively small whispered TIMIT corpus. The results indicate as long as we have a good E2E model pre-trained on normal or pseudo-whispered speech, a relatively small set of whispered speech may suffice to obtain a reasonably good E2E whispered speech recognizer."
Fast and Robust Unsupervised Contextual Biasing for Speech Recognition,"Automatic speech recognition (ASR) system is becoming a ubiquitous technology. Although its accuracy is closing the gap with that of human level under certain settings, one area that can further improve is to incorporate user-specific information or context to bias its prediction. A common framework is to dynamically construct a small language model from the provided contextual mini corpus and interpolate its score with the main language model during the decoding process.  Here we propose an alternative approach that does not entail explicit contextual language model. Instead, we derive the bias score for every word in the system vocabulary from the training corpus. The method is unique in that 1) it does not require meta-data or class-label annotation for the context or the training corpus. 2) The bias score is proportional to the word's log-probability, thus not only would it bias the provided context, but also robust against irrelevant context (e.g. user mis-specified or in case where it is hard to quantify a tight scope). 3) The bias score for the entire vocabulary is pre-determined during the training stage, thereby eliminating computationally expensive language model construction during inference.  We show significant improvement in recognition accuracy when the relevant context is available. Additionally, we also demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits high tolerance to false-triggering errors in the presence of irrelevant context."
Does Visual Self-Supervision Improve Learning of Speech Representations for Emotion Recognition?,"Self-supervised learning has attracted plenty of recent research interest. However, most works for self-supervision in speech are typically unimodal and there has been limited work that studies the interaction between audio and visual modalities for cross-modal self-supervision. This work (1) investigates visual self-supervision via face reconstruction to guide the learning of audio representations; (2) proposes an audio-only self-supervision approach for speech representation learning; (3) shows that a multi-task combination of the proposed visual and audio self-supervision is beneficial for learning richer features that are more robust in noisy conditions; (4) shows that self-supervised pretraining can outperform fully supervised training and is especially useful to prevent overfitting on smaller sized datasets. We evaluate our learned audio representations for discrete emotion recognition, continuous affect recognition and automatic speech recognition. We outperform existing self-supervised methods for all tested downstream tasks. Our results demonstrate the potential of visual self-supervision for audio feature learning and suggest that joint visual and audio self-supervision leads to more informative audio representations for speech and emotion recognition."
A language score based output selection method for multilingual speech recognition,"The quality of a multilingual speech recognition system can be improved by adaptation methods if the input language is specified. For systems that can accept multilingual inputs, the popular approach is to apply a language identifier to the input then switch or configure decoders in the next step, or use one more subsequence model to select the output from a set of candidates. Motivated by the goal of reducing the latency for real-time applications, in this paper, a language model rescoring method is firstly applied to produce all possible candidates for target languages, then a simple score is proposed to automatically select the output without any identifier model or language specification of the input language. The main point is that this score can be simply and automatically estimated on-the-fly so that the whole decoding pipeline is more simple and compact. Experimental results showed that this method can achieve the same quality as when the input language is specified. In addition, we present to design an English and Vietnamese End-to-End model to deal with not only the problem of cross-lingual speakers but also as a solution to improve the accuracy of borrowed words of English in Vietnamese."
Exploring Pre-training with Alignments for RNN Transducer based End-to-End Speech Recognition,"Recently, the recurrent neural network transducer (RNN-T) architecture has become an emerging trend in end-to-end automatic speech recognition research due to its advantages of being capable for online streaming speech recognition. However, RNN-T training is made difficult by the huge memory requirements, and complicated neural structure. A common solution to ease the RNN-T training is to employ connectionist temporal classification (CTC) model along with RNN language model (RNNLM) to initialize the RNN-T parameters. In this work, we conversely leverage external alignments to seed the RNN-T model. Two different pre-training solutions are explored, referred to as encoder pre-training, and whole-network pre-training respectively. Evaluated on Microsoft 65,000 hours anonymized production data with personally identifiable information removed, our proposed methods can obtain significant improvement. In particular, the encoder pre-training solution achieved a 10% and a 8% relative word error rate reduction when compared with random initialization and the widely used CTC+RNNLM initialization strategy, respectively. Our solutions also significantly reduce the RNN-T model latency from the baseline."
Multi-head Monotonic Chunkwise Attention For Online Speech Recognition,"The attention mechanism of the Listen, Attend and Spell (LAS) model requires the whole input sequence to calculate the attention context and thus is not suitable for online speech recognition. To deal with this problem, we propose multi-head monotonic chunk-wise attention (MTH-MoChA), an improved version of MoChA. MTH-MoChA splits the input sequence into small chunks and computes multi-head attentions over the chunks. We also explore useful training strategies such as LSTM pooling, minimum world error rate training and SpecAugment to further improve the performance of MTH-MoChA. Experiments on AISHELL-1 data show that the proposed model, along with the training strategies, improve the character error rate (CER) of MoChA from 8.96% to 7.68% on test set. On another 18000 hours in-car speech data set, MTH-MoChA obtains 7.28% CER, which is significantly better than a state-of-the-art hybrid system."
Multiresolution and Multimodal Speech Recognition with Transformers,"This paper presents an audio visual automatic speech recognition (AV-ASR) system using a Transformer-based architecture. We particularly focus on the scene context provided by the visual information, to ground the ASR. We extract representations for audio features in the encoder layers of the transformer and fuse video features using an additional crossmodal multihead attention layer. Additionally, we incorporate a multitask training criterion for multiresolution ASR, where we train the model to generate both character and subword level transcriptions.  Experimental results on the How2 dataset, indicate that multiresolution training can speed up convergence by around 50% and relatively improves word error rate (WER) performance by upto 18% over subword prediction models. Further, incorporating visual information improves performance with relative gains upto 3.76% over audio only models.  Our results are comparable to state-of-the-art Listen, Attend and Spell-based architectures."
Meta-Transfer Learning for Code-Switched Speech Recognition,"An increasing number of people in the world today speak a mixed-language as a result of being multilingual. However, building a speech recognition system for code-switching remains difficult due to the availability of limited resources and the expense and significant effort required to collect mixed-language data. We therefore propose a new learning method, meta-transfer learning, to transfer learn on a code-switched speech recognition system in a low-resource setting by judiciously extracting information from high-resource monolingual datasets. Our model learns to recognize individual languages, and transfer them so as to better recognize mixed-language speech by conditioning the optimization on the code-switching data. Based on experimental results, our model outperforms existing baselines on speech recognition and language modeling tasks, and is faster to converge."
Research on Modeling Units of Transformer Transducer for Mandarin Speech Recognition,"Modeling unit and model architecture are two key factors of Recurrent Neural Network Transducer (RNN-T) in end-to-end speech recognition. To improve the performance of RNN-T for Mandarin speech recognition task, a novel transformer transducer with the combination architecture of self-attention transformer and RNN is proposed. And then the choice of different modeling units for transformer transducer is explored. In addition, we present a new mix-bandwidth training method to obtain a general model that is able to accurately recognize Mandarin speech with different sampling rates simultaneously. All of our experiments are conducted on about 12,000 hours of Mandarin speech with sampling rate in 8kHz and 16kHz. Experimental results show that Mandarin transformer transducer using syllable with tone achieves the best performance. It yields an average of 14.4% and 44.1% relative Word Error Rate (WER) reduction when compared with the models using syllable initial/final with tone and Chinese character, respectively. Also, it outperforms the model based on syllable initial/final with tone with an average of 13.5% relative Character Error Rate (CER) reduction."
End-to-end speech-to-dialog-act recognition,"Spoken language understanding, which extracts intents and/or semantic concepts in utterances, is conventionally formulated as a post-processing of automatic speech recognition. It is usually trained with oracle transcripts, but needs to deal with errors by ASR. Moreover, there are acoustic features which are related with intents but not represented with the transcripts. In this paper, we present an end-to-end model which directly converts speech into dialog acts without the deterministic transcription process. In the proposed model, the dialog act recognition network is conjunct with an acoustic-to-word ASR model at its latent layer before the softmax layer, which provides a distributed representation of word-level ASR decoding information. Then, the entire network is fine-tuned in an end-to-end manner. This allows for stable training as well as robustness against ASR errors. The model is further extended to conduct DA segmentation jointly. Evaluations with the Switchboard corpus demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves dialog act recognition accuracy from the conventional pipeline framework."
Cloud-Based Face and Speech Recognition for Access Control Applications,"This paper describes the implementation of a system to recognize employees and visitors wanting to gain access to a physical office through face images and speech-to-text recognition. The system helps employees to unlock the entrance door via face recognition without the need of tag-keys or cards. To prevent spoofing attacks and increase security, a randomly generated code is sent to the employee, who then has to type it into the screen. On the other hand, visitors and delivery persons are provided with a speech-to-text service where they utter the name of the employee that they want to meet, and the system then sends a notification to the right employee automatically. The hardware of the system is constituted by two Raspberry Pi, a 7-inch LCD-touch display, a camera, and a sound card with a microphone and speaker. To carry out face recognition and speech-to-text conversion, the cloud-based platforms Amazon Web Services and the Google Speech-to-Text API service are used respectively. The two-step face authentication mechanism for employees provides an increased level of security and protection against spoofing attacks without the need of carrying key-tags or access cards, while disturbances by visitors or couriers are minimized by notifying their arrival to the right employee, without disturbing other co-workers by means of ring-bells."
Towards a Competitive End-to-End Speech Recognition for CHiME-6 Dinner Party Transcription,"While end-to-end ASR systems have proven competitive with the conventional hybrid approach, they are prone to accuracy degradation when it comes to noisy and low-resource conditions. In this paper, we argue that, even in such difficult cases, some end-to-end approaches show performance close to the hybrid baseline. To demonstrate this, we use the CHiME-6 Challenge data as an example of challenging environments and noisy conditions of everyday speech. We experimentally compare and analyze CTC-Attention versus RNN-Transducer approaches along with RNN versus Transformer architectures. We also provide a comparison of acoustic features and speech enhancements. Besides, we evaluate the effectiveness of neural network language models for hypothesis re-scoring in low-resource conditions. Our best end-to-end model based on RNN-Transducer, together with improved beam search, reaches quality by only 3.8% WER abs. worse than the LF-MMI TDNN-F CHiME-6 Challenge baseline. With the Guided Source Separation based training data augmentation, this approach outperforms the hybrid baseline system by 2.7% WER abs. and the end-to-end system best known before by 25.7% WER abs."
ClovaCall: Korean Goal-Oriented Dialog Speech Corpus for Automatic Speech Recognition of Contact Centers,"Automatic speech recognition (ASR) via call is essential for various applications, including AI for contact center (AICC) services. Despite the advancement of ASR, however, most publicly available call-based speech corpora such as Switchboard are old-fashioned. Also, most existing call corpora are in English and mainly focus on open domain dialog or general scenarios such as audiobooks. Here we introduce a new large-scale Korean call-based speech corpus under a goal-oriented dialog scenario from more than 11,000 people, i.e., ClovaCall corpus. ClovaCall includes approximately 60,000 pairs of a short sentence and its corresponding spoken utterance in a restaurant reservation domain. We validate the effectiveness of our dataset with intensive experiments using two standard ASR models. Furthermore, we release our ClovaCall dataset and baseline source codes to be available via https://github.com/ClovaAI/ClovaCall."
CHiME-6 Challenge:Tackling Multispeaker Speech Recognition for Unsegmented Recordings,"Following the success of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th CHiME challenges we organize the 6th CHiME Speech Separation and Recognition Challenge (CHiME-6). The new challenge revisits the previous CHiME-5 challenge and further considers the problem of distant multi-microphone conversational speech diarization and recognition in everyday home environments. Speech material is the same as the previous CHiME-5 recordings except for accurate array synchronization. The material was elicited using a dinner party scenario with efforts taken to capture data that is representative of natural conversational speech. This paper provides a baseline description of the CHiME-6 challenge for both segmented multispeaker speech recognition (Track 1) and unsegmented multispeaker speech recognition (Track 2). Of note, Track 2 is the first challenge activity in the community to tackle an unsegmented multispeaker speech recognition scenario with a complete set of reproducible open source baselines providing speech enhancement, speaker diarization, and speech recognition modules."
Beat Detection and Automatic Annotation of the Music of Bharatanatyam Dance using Speech Recognition Techniques,"Bharatanatyam, an Indian Classical Dance form, represents the rich cultural heritage of India. Analysis and recognition of such dance forms are critical for the preservation of cultural heritage. Like in most dance forms, a Bharatanatyam dancer performs in synchronization with structured rhythmic music, called Sollukattu, which comprises instrumental beats and vocalized utterances (bols) to create a rhythmic music structure. Computer analysis of Bharatanatyam, therefore, requires a structural analysis of Sollukattus. In this paper, we use speech processing techniques to recognize bols. Exploiting the predefined structures of Sollukattus and the detected bols, we recognize the Sollukattu. We estimate the tempo period by two methods. Finally, we generate a complete annotation of the audio signal by beat marking. For this, we also use the information of beats detected from the onset envelope of a Sollukattu signal. For training and test, we create a data set for Sollukattus and annotate them. We achieve 85% accuracy in bol recognition, 95% in Sollukattu recognition, 96% in tempo period estimation, and over 90% in beat marking. This is the maiden attempt to fully structurally analyze the music of an Indian Classical Dance form and the use of speech processing techniques for beat marking."
How to Teach DNNs to Pay Attention to the Visual Modality in Speech Recognition,"Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) seeks to model, and thereby exploit, the dynamic relationship between a human voice and the corresponding mouth movements. A recently proposed multimodal fusion strategy, AV Align, based on state-of-the-art sequence to sequence neural networks, attempts to model this relationship by explicitly aligning the acoustic and visual representations of speech. This study investigates the inner workings of AV Align and visualises the audio-visual alignment patterns. Our experiments are performed on two of the largest publicly available AVSR datasets, TCD-TIMIT and LRS2. We find that AV Align learns to align acoustic and visual representations of speech at the frame level on TCD-TIMIT in a generally monotonic pattern. We also determine the cause of initially seeing no improvement over audio-only speech recognition on the more challenging LRS2. We propose a regularisation method which involves predicting lip-related Action Units from visual representations. Our regularisation method leads to better exploitation of the visual modality, with performance improvements between 7% and 30% depending on the noise level. Furthermore, we show that the alternative Watch, Listen, Attend, and Spell network is affected by the same problem as AV Align, and that our proposed approach can effectively help it learn visual representations. Our findings validate the suitability of the regularisation method to AVSR and encourage researchers to rethink the multimodal convergence problem when having one dominant modality."
Alzheimer's Dementia Recognition through Spontaneous Speech: The ADReSS Challenge,"The ADReSS Challenge at INTERSPEECH 2020 defines a shared task through which different approaches to the automated recognition of Alzheimer's dementia based on spontaneous speech can be compared. ADReSS provides researchers with a benchmark speech dataset which has been acoustically pre-processed and balanced in terms of age and gender, defining two cognitive assessment tasks, namely: the Alzheimer's speech classification task and the neuropsychological score regression task. In the Alzheimer's speech classification task, ADReSS challenge participants create models for classifying speech as dementia or healthy control speech. In the the neuropsychological score regression task, participants create models to predict mini-mental state examination scores. This paper describes the ADReSS Challenge in detail and presents a baseline for both tasks, including feature extraction procedures and results for classification and regression models. ADReSS aims to provide the speech and language Alzheimer's research community with a platform for comprehensive methodological comparisons. This will hopefully contribute to addressing the lack of standardisation that currently affects the field and shed light on avenues for future research and clinical applicability."
Improving Readability for Automatic Speech Recognition Transcription,"Modern Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems can achieve high performance in terms of recognition accuracy. However, a perfectly accurate transcript still can be challenging to read due to grammatical errors, disfluency, and other errata common in spoken communication. Many downstream tasks and human readers rely on the output of the ASR system; therefore, errors introduced by the speaker and ASR system alike will be propagated to the next task in the pipeline. In this work, we propose a novel NLP task called ASR post-processing for readability (APR) that aims to transform the noisy ASR output into a readable text for humans and downstream tasks while maintaining the semantic meaning of the speaker. In addition, we describe a method to address the lack of task-specific data by synthesizing examples for the APR task using the datasets collected for Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) followed by text-to-speech (TTS) and ASR. Furthermore, we propose metrics borrowed from similar tasks to evaluate performance on the APR task. We compare fine-tuned models based on several open-sourced and adapted pre-trained models with the traditional pipeline method. Our results suggest that finetuned models improve the performance on the APR task significantly, hinting at the potential benefits of using APR systems. We hope that the read, understand, and rewrite approach of our work can serve as a basis that many NLP tasks and human readers can benefit from."
Keywords Extraction and Sentiment Analysis using Automatic Speech Recognition,"Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is the interdisciplinary subfield of computational linguistics that develops methodologies and technologies that enables the recognition and translation of spoken language into text by computers. It incorporates knowledge and research in linguistics, computer science, and electrical engineering fields. Sentiment analysis is contextual mining of text which identifies and extracts subjective information in the source material and helping a business to understand the social sentiment of their brand, product or service while monitoring online conversations. According to the speech structure, three models are used in speech recognition to do the match: Acoustic Model, Phonetic Dictionary and Language Model. Any speech recognition program is evaluated using two factors: Accuracy (percentage error in converting spoken words to digital data) and Speed (the extent to which the program can keep up with a human speaker). For the purpose of converting speech to text (STT), we will be studying the following open source toolkits: CMU Sphinx and Kaldi. The toolkits use Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and I-vector for feature extraction. CMU Sphinx has been used with pre-trained Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), while Kaldi is used with pre-trained Neural Networks (NNET) as acoustic models. The n-gram language models contain the phonemes or pdf-ids for generating the most probable hypothesis (transcription) in the form of a lattice. The speech dataset is stored in the form of .raw or .wav file and is transcribed in .txt file. The system then tries to identify opinions within the text, and extract the following attributes: Polarity (if the speaker expresses a positive or negative opinion) and Keywords (the thing that is being talked about)."
Semi-supervised acoustic and language model training for English-isiZulu code-switched speech recognition,"We present an analysis of semi-supervised acoustic and language model training for English-isiZulu code-switched ASR using soap opera speech. Approximately 11 hours of untranscribed multilingual speech was transcribed automatically using four bilingual code-switching transcription systems operating in English-isiZulu, English-isiXhosa, English-Setswana and English-Sesotho. These transcriptions were incorporated into the acoustic and language model training sets. Results showed that the TDNN-F acoustic models benefit from the additional semi-supervised data and that even better performance could be achieved by including additional CNN layers. Using these CNN-TDNN-F acoustic models, a first iteration of semi-supervised training achieved an absolute mixed-language WER reduction of 3.4%, and a further 2.2% after a second iteration. Although the languages in the untranscribed data were unknown, the best results were obtained when all automatically transcribed data was used for training and not just the utterances classified as English-isiZulu. Despite reducing perplexity, the semi-supervised language model was not able to improve the ASR performance."
Homophone-based Label Smoothing in End-to-End Automatic Speech Recognition,"A new label smoothing method that makes use of prior knowledge of a language at human level, homophone, is proposed in this paper for automatic speech recognition (ASR). Compared with its forerunners, the proposed method uses pronunciation knowledge of homophones in a more complex way. End-to-end ASR models that learn acoustic model and language model jointly and modelling units of characters are necessary conditions for this method. Experiments with hybrid CTC sequence-to-sequence model show that the new method can reduce character error rate (CER) by 0.4% absolutely."
Full-Sum Decoding for Hybrid HMM based Speech Recognition using LSTM Language Model,"In hybrid HMM based speech recognition, LSTM language models have been widely applied and achieved large improvements. The theoretical capability of modeling any unlimited context suggests that no recombination should be applied in decoding. This motivates to reconsider full summation over the HMM-state sequences instead of Viterbi approximation in decoding. We explore the potential gain from more accurate probabilities in terms of decision making and apply the full-sum decoding with a modified prefix-tree search framework. The proposed full-sum decoding is evaluated on both Switchboard and Librispeech corpora. Different models using CE and sMBR training criteria are used. Additionally, both MAP and confusion network decoding as approximated variants of general Bayes decision rule are evaluated. Consistent improvements over strong baselines are achieved in almost all cases without extra cost. We also discuss tuning effort, efficiency and some limitations of full-sum decoding."
Serialized Output Training for End-to-End Overlapped Speech Recognition,"This paper proposes serialized output training (SOT), a novel framework for multi-speaker overlapped speech recognition based on an attention-based encoder-decoder approach. Instead of having multiple output layers as with the permutation invariant training (PIT), SOT uses a model with only one output layer that generates the transcriptions of multiple speakers one after another. The attention and decoder modules take care of producing multiple transcriptions from overlapped speech. SOT has two advantages over PIT: (1) no limitation in the maximum number of speakers, and (2) an ability to model the dependencies among outputs for different speakers. We also propose a simple trick that allows SOT to be executed in O(S), where S is the number of the speakers in the training sample, by using the start times of the constituent source utterances. Experimental results on LibriSpeech corpus show that the SOT models can transcribe overlapped speech with variable numbers of speakers significantly better than PIT-based models. We also show that the SOT models can accurately count the number of speakers in the input audio."
Training for Speech Recognition on Coprocessors,"Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has increased in popularity in recent years. The evolution of processor and storage technologies has enabled more advanced ASR mechanisms, fueling the development of virtual assistants such as Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri, Microsoft Cortana, and Google Home. The interest in such assistants, in turn, has amplified the novel developments in ASR research. However, despite this popularity, there has not been a detailed training efficiency analysis of modern ASR systems. This mainly stems from: the proprietary nature of many modern applications that depend on ASR, like the ones listed above; the relatively expensive co-processor hardware that is used to accelerate ASR by big vendors to enable such applications; and the absence of well-established benchmarks. The goal of this paper is to address the latter two of these challenges. The paper first describes an ASR model, based on a deep neural network inspired by recent work in this domain, and our experiences building it. Then we evaluate this model on three CPU-GPU co-processor platforms that represent different budget categories. Our results demonstrate that utilizing hardware acceleration yields good results even without high-end equipment. While the most expensive platform (10X price of the least expensive one) converges to the initial accuracy target 10-30% and 60-70% faster than the other two, the differences among the platforms almost disappear at slightly higher accuracy targets. In addition, our results further highlight both the difficulty of evaluating ASR systems due to the complex, long, and resource intensive nature of the model training in this domain, and the importance of establishing benchmarks for ASR."
High Performance Sequence-to-Sequence Model for Streaming Speech Recognition,"Recently sequence-to-sequence models have started to achieve state-of-the-art performance on standard speech recognition tasks when processing audio data in batch mode, i.e., the complete audio data is available when starting processing. However, when it comes to performing run-on recognition on an input stream of audio data while producing recognition results in real-time and with low word-based latency, these models face several challenges. For many techniques, the whole audio sequence to be decoded needs to be available at the start of the processing, e.g., for the attention mechanism or the bidirectional LSTM (BLSTM). In this paper, we propose several techniques to mitigate these problems. We introduce an additional loss function controlling the uncertainty of the attention mechanism, a modified beam search identifying partial, stable hypotheses, ways of working with BLSTM in the encoder, and the use of chunked BLSTM. Our experiments show that with the right combination of these techniques, it is possible to perform run-on speech recognition with low word-based latency without sacrificing in word error rate performance."
Techniques for Vocabulary Expansion in Hybrid Speech Recognition Systems,"The problem of out of vocabulary words (OOV) is typical for any speech recognition system, hybrid systems are usually constructed to recognize a fixed set of words and rarely can include all the words that will be encountered during exploitation of the system. One of the popular approach to cover OOVs is to use subword units rather then words. Such system can potentially recognize any previously unseen word if the word can be constructed from present subword units, but also non-existing words can be recognized. The other popular approach is to modify HMM part of the system so that it can be easily and effectively expanded with custom set of words we want to add to the system. In this paper we explore different existing methods of this solution on both graph construction and search method levels. We also present a novel vocabulary expansion techniques which solve some common internal subroutine problems regarding recognition graph processing."
Cross Lingual Cross Corpus Speech Emotion Recognition,"The majority of existing speech emotion recognition models are trained and evaluated on a single corpus and a single language setting. These systems do not perform as well when applied in a cross-corpus and cross-language scenario. This paper presents results for speech emotion recognition for 4 languages in both single corpus and cross corpus setting. Additionally, since multi-task learning (MTL) with gender, naturalness and arousal as auxiliary tasks has shown to enhance the generalisation capabilities of the emotion models, this paper introduces language ID as another auxiliary task in MTL framework to explore the role of spoken language on emotion recognition which has not been studied yet."
Deliberation Model Based Two-Pass End-to-End Speech Recognition,"End-to-end (E2E) models have made rapid progress in automatic speech recognition (ASR) and perform competitively relative to conventional models. To further improve the quality, a two-pass model has been proposed to rescore streamed hypotheses using the non-streaming Listen, Attend and Spell (LAS) model while maintaining a reasonable latency. The model attends to acoustics to rescore hypotheses, as opposed to a class of neural correction models that use only first-pass text hypotheses. In this work, we propose to attend to both acoustics and first-pass hypotheses using a deliberation network. A bidirectional encoder is used to extract context information from first-pass hypotheses. The proposed deliberation model achieves 12% relative WER reduction compared to LAS rescoring in Google Voice Search (VS) tasks, and 23% reduction on a proper noun test set. Compared to a large conventional model, our best model performs 21% relatively better for VS. In terms of computational complexity, the deliberation decoder has a larger size than the LAS decoder, and hence requires more computations in second-pass decoding."
High-Accuracy and Low-Latency Speech Recognition with Two-Head Contextual Layer Trajectory LSTM Model,"While the community keeps promoting end-to-end models over conventional hybrid models, which usually are long short-term memory (LSTM) models trained with a cross entropy criterion followed by a sequence discriminative training criterion, we argue that such conventional hybrid models can still be significantly improved. In this paper, we detail our recent efforts to improve conventional hybrid LSTM acoustic models for high-accuracy and low-latency automatic speech recognition. To achieve high accuracy, we use a contextual layer trajectory LSTM (cltLSTM), which decouples the temporal modeling and target classification tasks, and incorporates future context frames to get more information for accurate acoustic modeling. We further improve the training strategy with sequence-level teacher-student learning. To obtain low latency, we design a two-head cltLSTM, in which one head has zero latency and the other head has a small latency, compared to an LSTM. When trained with Microsoft's 65 thousand hours of anonymized training data and evaluated with test sets with 1.8 million words, the proposed two-head cltLSTM model with the proposed training strategy yields a 28.2\% relative WER reduction over the conventional LSTM acoustic model, with a similar perceived latency."
Development of Automatic Speech Recognition for Kazakh Language using Transfer Learning,"Development of Automatic Speech Recognition system for Kazakh language is very challenging due to a lack of data.Existing data of kazakh speech with its corresponding transcriptions are heavily accessed and not enough to gain a worth mentioning results.For this reason, speech recognition of Kazakh language has not been explored well.There are only few works that investigate this area with traditional methods Hidden Markov Model, Gaussian Mixture Model, but they are suffering from poor outcome and lack of enough data.In our work we suggest a new method that takes pre-trained model of Russian language and applies its knowledge as a starting point to our neural network structure, which means that we are transferring the weights of pre-trained model to our neural network.The main reason we chose Russian model is that pronunciation of kazakh and russian languages are quite similar because they share 78 percent letters and there are quite large corpus of russian speech dataset. We have collected a dataset of Kazakh speech with transcriptions in the base of Suleyman Demirel University with 50 native speakers each having around 400 sentences.Data have been chosen from famous Kazakh books.  We have considered 4 different scenarios in our experiment. First, we trained our neural network without using a pre-trained Russian model with 2 LSTM layers and 2 BiLSTM .Second, we have trained the same 2 LSTM layered and 2 BiLSTM layered using a pre-trained model. As a result, we have improved our models training cost and Label Error Rate by using external Russian speech recognition model up to 24 percent and 32 percent respectively.Pre-trained Russian language model has trained on 100 hours of data with the same neural network architecture."
Toward Cross-Domain Speech Recognition with End-to-End Models,"In the area of multi-domain speech recognition, research in the past focused on hybrid acoustic models to build cross-domain and domain-invariant speech recognition systems. In this paper, we empirically examine the difference in behavior between hybrid acoustic models and neural end-to-end systems when mixing acoustic training data from several domains. For these experiments we composed a multi-domain dataset from public sources, with the different domains in the corpus covering a wide variety of topics and acoustic conditions such as telephone conversations, lectures, read speech and broadcast news. We show that for the hybrid models, supplying additional training data from other domains with mismatched acoustic conditions does not increase the performance on specific domains. However, our end-to-end models optimized with sequence-based criterion generalize better than the hybrid models on diverse domains. In term of word-error-rate performance, our experimental acoustic-to-word and attention-based models trained on multi-domain dataset reach the performance of domain-specific long short-term memory (LSTM) hybrid models, thus resulting in multi-domain speech recognition systems that do not suffer in performance over domain specific ones. Moreover, the use of neural end-to-end models eliminates the need of domain-adapted language models during recognition, which is a great advantage when the input domain is unknown."
Improving noise robust automatic speech recognition with single-channel time-domain enhancement network,"With the advent of deep learning, research on noise-robust automatic speech recognition (ASR) has progressed rapidly. However, ASR performance in noisy conditions of single-channel systems remains unsatisfactory. Indeed, most single-channel speech enhancement (SE) methods (denoising) have brought only limited performance gains over state-of-the-art ASR back-end trained on multi-condition training data. Recently, there has been much research on neural network-based SE methods working in the time-domain showing levels of performance never attained before. However, it has not been established whether the high enhancement performance achieved by such time-domain approaches could be translated into ASR. In this paper, we show that a single-channel time-domain denoising approach can significantly improve ASR performance, providing more than 30 % relative word error reduction over a strong ASR back-end on the real evaluation data of the single-channel track of the CHiME-4 dataset. These positive results demonstrate that single-channel noise reduction can still improve ASR performance, which should open the door to more research in that direction."
Multi-Time-Scale Convolution for Emotion Recognition from Speech Audio Signals,"Robustness against temporal variations is important for emotion recognition from speech audio, since emotion is ex-pressed through complex spectral patterns that can exhibit significant local dilation and compression on the time axis depending on speaker and context. To address this and potentially other tasks, we introduce the multi-time-scale (MTS) method to create flexibility towards temporal variations when analyzing time-frequency representations of audio data. MTS extends convolutional neural networks with convolution kernels that are scaled and re-sampled along the time axis, to increase temporal flexibility without increasing the number of trainable parameters compared to standard convolutional layers. We evaluate MTS and standard convolutional layers in different architectures for emotion recognition from speech audio, using 4 datasets of different sizes. The results show that the use of MTS layers consistently improves the generalization of networks of different capacity and depth, compared to standard convolution, especially on smaller datasets"
Can We Read Speech Beyond the Lips? Rethinking RoI Selection for Deep Visual Speech Recognition,"Recent advances in deep learning have heightened interest among researchers in the field of visual speech recognition (VSR). Currently, most existing methods equate VSR with automatic lip reading, which attempts to recognise speech by analysing lip motion. However, human experience and psychological studies suggest that we do not always fix our gaze at each other's lips during a face-to-face conversation, but rather scan the whole face repetitively. This inspires us to revisit a fundamental yet somehow overlooked problem: can VSR models benefit from reading extraoral facial regions, i.e. beyond the lips? In this paper, we perform a comprehensive study to evaluate the effects of different facial regions with state-of-the-art VSR models, including the mouth, the whole face, the upper face, and even the cheeks. Experiments are conducted on both word-level and sentence-level benchmarks with different characteristics. We find that despite the complex variations of the data, incorporating information from extraoral facial regions, even the upper face, consistently benefits VSR performance. Furthermore, we introduce a simple yet effective method based on Cutout to learn more discriminative features for face-based VSR, hoping to maximise the utility of information encoded in different facial regions. Our experiments show obvious improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods that use only the lip region as inputs, a result we believe would probably provide the VSR community with some new and exciting insights."
Learning Fast Adaptation on Cross-Accented Speech Recognition,"Local dialects influence people to pronounce words of the same language differently from each other. The great variability and complex characteristics of accents creates a major challenge for training a robust and accent-agnostic automatic speech recognition (ASR) system. In this paper, we introduce a cross-accented English speech recognition task as a benchmark for measuring the ability of the model to adapt to unseen accents using the existing CommonVoice corpus. We also propose an accent-agnostic approach that extends the model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) algorithm for fast adaptation to unseen accents. Our approach significantly outperforms joint training in both zero-shot, few-shot, and all-shot in the mixed-region and cross-region settings in terms of word error rate."
Untangling in Invariant Speech Recognition,"Encouraged by the success of deep neural networks on a variety of visual tasks, much theoretical and experimental work has been aimed at understanding and interpreting how vision networks operate. Meanwhile, deep neural networks have also achieved impressive performance in audio processing applications, both as sub-components of larger systems and as complete end-to-end systems by themselves. Despite their empirical successes, comparatively little is understood about how these audio models accomplish these tasks. In this work, we employ a recently developed statistical mechanical theory that connects geometric properties of network representations and the separability of classes to probe how information is untangled within neural networks trained to recognize speech. We observe that speaker-specific nuisance variations are discarded by the network's hierarchy, whereas task-relevant properties such as words and phonemes are untangled in later layers. Higher level concepts such as parts-of-speech and context dependence also emerge in the later layers of the network. Finally, we find that the deep representations carry out significant temporal untangling by efficiently extracting task-relevant features at each time step of the computation. Taken together, these findings shed light on how deep auditory models process time dependent input signals to achieve invariant speech recognition, and show how different concepts emerge through the layers of the network."
The Effect of Silence Feature in Dimensional Speech Emotion Recognition,"Silence is a part of human-to-human communication, which can be a clue for human emotion perception. For automatic emotion recognition by a computer, it is not clear whether silence is useful to determine human emotion within a speech. This paper presents an investigation of the effect of using silence feature in dimensional emotion recognition. Since the silence feature is extracted per utterance, we grouped the silence feature with high statistical functions from a set of acoustic features. The result reveals that the silence features affect the arousal dimension more than other emotion dimensions. The proper choice of a threshold factor in the calculation of silence feature improved the performance of dimensional speech emotion recognition performance, in terms of a concordance correlation coefficient. On the other side, improper choice of that factor leads to a decrease in performance by using the same architecture."
Emotion Recognition System from Speech and Visual Information based on Convolutional Neural Networks,"Emotion recognition has become an important field of research in the human-computer interactions domain. The latest advancements in the field show that combining visual with audio information lead to better results if compared to the case of using a single source of information separately. From a visual point of view, a human emotion can be recognized by analyzing the facial expression of the person. More precisely, the human emotion can be described through a combination of several Facial Action Units. In this paper, we propose a system that is able to recognize emotions with a high accuracy rate and in real time, based on deep Convolutional Neural Networks. In order to increase the accuracy of the recognition system, we analyze also the speech data and fuse the information coming from both sources, i.e., visual and audio. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme for emotion recognition and the importance of combining visual with audio data."
A Novel Decision Tree for Depression Recognition in Speech,"Depression is a common mental disorder worldwide which causes a range of serious outcomes. The diagnosis of depression relies on patient-reported scales and psychiatrist interview which may lead to subjective bias. In recent years, more and more researchers are devoted to depression recognition in speech , which may be an effective and objective indicator. This study proposes a new speech segment fusion method based on decision tree to improve the depression recognition accuracy and conducts a validation on a sample of 52 subjects (23 depressed patients and 29 healthy controls). The recognition accuracy are 75.8% and 68.5% for male and female respectively on gender-dependent models. It can be concluded from the data that the proposed decision tree model can improve the depression classification performance."
RTMobile: Beyond Real-Time Mobile Acceleration of RNNs for Speech Recognition,"Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) based automatic speech recognition has nowadays become prevalent on mobile devices such as smart phones. However, previous RNN compression techniques either suffer from hardware performance overhead due to irregularity or significant accuracy loss due to the preserved regularity for hardware friendliness. In this work, we propose RTMobile that leverages both a novel block-based pruning approach and compiler optimizations to accelerate RNN inference on mobile devices. Our proposed RTMobile is the first work that can achieve real-time RNN inference on mobile platforms. Experimental results demonstrate that RTMobile can significantly outperform existing RNN hardware acceleration methods in terms of inference accuracy and time. Compared with prior work on FPGA, RTMobile using Adreno 640 embedded GPU on GRU can improve the energy-efficiency by about 40\times while maintaining the same inference time."
A Density Ratio Approach to Language Model Fusion in End-To-End Automatic Speech Recognition,"This article describes a density ratio approach to integrating external Language Models (LMs) into end-to-end models for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). Applied to a Recurrent Neural Network Transducer (RNN-T) ASR model trained on a given domain, a matched in-domain RNN-LM, and a target domain RNN-LM, the proposed method uses Bayes' Rule to define RNN-T posteriors for the target domain, in a manner directly analogous to the classic hybrid model for ASR based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) or LSTMs in the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) framework (Bourlard & Morgan, 1994). The proposed approach is evaluated in cross-domain and limited-data scenarios, for which a significant amount of target domain text data is used for LM training, but only limited (or no) {audio, transcript} training data pairs are used to train the RNN-T. Specifically, an RNN-T model trained on paired audio & transcript data from YouTube is evaluated for its ability to generalize to Voice Search data. The Density Ratio method was found to consistently outperform the dominant approach to LM and end-to-end ASR integration, Shallow Fusion."
Distributed Training of Deep Neural Network Acoustic Models for Automatic Speech Recognition,"The past decade has witnessed great progress in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) due to advances in deep learning. The improvements in performance can be attributed to both improved models and large-scale training data. Key to training such models is the employment of efficient distributed learning techniques. In this article, we provide an overview of distributed training techniques for deep neural network acoustic models for ASR. Starting with the fundamentals of data parallel stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and ASR acoustic modeling, we will investigate various distributed training strategies and their realizations in high performance computing (HPC) environments with an emphasis on striking the balance between communication and computation. Experiments are carried out on a popular public benchmark to study the convergence, speedup and recognition performance of the investigated strategies."
Multilingual Twitter Corpus and Baselines for Evaluating Demographic Bias in Hate Speech Recognition,"Existing research on fairness evaluation of document classification models mainly uses synthetic monolingual data without ground truth for author demographic attributes. In this work, we assemble and publish a multilingual Twitter corpus for the task of hate speech detection with inferred four author demographic factors: age, country, gender and race/ethnicity. The corpus covers five languages: English, Italian, Polish, Portuguese and Spanish. We evaluate the inferred demographic labels with a crowdsourcing platform, Figure Eight. To examine factors that can cause biases, we take an empirical analysis of demographic predictability on the English corpus. We measure the performance of four popular document classifiers and evaluate the fairness and bias of the baseline classifiers on the author-level demographic attributes."
Semi-Supervised Speech Recognition via Local Prior Matching,"For sequence transduction tasks like speech recognition, a strong structured prior model encodes rich information about the target space, implicitly ruling out invalid sequences by assigning them low probability. In this work, we propose local prior matching (LPM), a semi-supervised objective that distills knowledge from a strong prior (e.g. a language model) to provide learning signal to a discriminative model trained on unlabeled speech. We demonstrate that LPM is theoretically well-motivated, simple to implement, and superior to existing knowledge distillation techniques under comparable settings. Starting from a baseline trained on 100 hours of labeled speech, with an additional 360 hours of unlabeled data, LPM recovers 54% and 73% of the word error rate on clean and noisy test sets relative to a fully supervised model on the same data."
Rnn-transducer with language bias for end-to-end Mandarin-English code-switching speech recognition,"Recently, language identity information has been utilized to improve the performance of end-to-end code-switching (CS) speech recognition. However, previous works use an additional language identification (LID) model as an auxiliary module, which causes the system complex. In this work, we propose an improved recurrent neural network transducer (RNN-T) model with language bias to alleviate the problem. We use the language identities to bias the model to predict the CS points. This promotes the model to learn the language identity information directly from transcription, and no additional LID model is needed. We evaluate the approach on a Mandarin-English CS corpus SEAME. Compared to our RNN-T baseline, the proposed method can achieve 16.2% and 12.9% relative error reduction on two test sets, respectively."
Gradient-Adjusted Neuron Activation Profiles for Comprehensive Introspection of Convolutional Speech Recognition Models,"Deep Learning based Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models are very successful, but hard to interpret. To gain better understanding of how Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) accomplish their tasks, introspection methods have been proposed. Adapting such techniques from computer vision to speech recognition is not straight-forward, because speech data is more complex and less interpretable than image data. In this work, we introduce Gradient-adjusted Neuron Activation Profiles (GradNAPs) as means to interpret features and representations in Deep Neural Networks. GradNAPs are characteristic responses of ANNs to particular groups of inputs, which incorporate the relevance of neurons for prediction. We show how to utilize GradNAPs to gain insight about how data is processed in ANNs. This includes different ways of visualizing features and clustering of GradNAPs to compare embeddings of different groups of inputs in any layer of a given network. We demonstrate our proposed techniques using a fully-convolutional ASR model."
Speech Emotion Recognition using Support Vector Machine,"In this project, we aim to classify the speech taken as one of the four emotions namely, sadness, anger, fear and happiness. The samples that have been taken to complete this project are taken from Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) and UGA database. The important characteristics determined from the samples are energy, pitch, MFCC coefficients, LPCC coefficients and speaker rate. The classifier used to classify these emotional states is Support Vector Machine (SVM) and this is done using two classification strategies: One against All (OAA) and Gender Dependent Classification. Furthermore, a comparative analysis has been conducted between the two and LPCC and MFCC algorithms as well."
Speech Corpus of Ainu Folklore and End-to-end Speech Recognition for Ainu Language,"Ainu is an unwritten language that has been spoken by Ainu people who are one of the ethnic groups in Japan. It is recognized as critically endangered by UNESCO and archiving and documentation of its language heritage is of paramount importance. Although a considerable amount of voice recordings of Ainu folklore has been produced and accumulated to save their culture, only a quite limited parts of them are transcribed so far. Thus, we started a project of automatic speech recognition (ASR) for the Ainu language in order to contribute to the development of annotated language archives. In this paper, we report speech corpus development and the structure and performance of end-to-end ASR for Ainu. We investigated four modeling units (phone, syllable, word piece, and word) and found that the syllable-based model performed best in terms of both word and phone recognition accuracy, which were about 60% and over 85% respectively in speaker-open condition. Furthermore, word and phone accuracy of 80% and 90% has been achieved in a speaker-closed setting. We also found out that a multilingual ASR training with additional speech corpora of English and Japanese further improves the speaker-open test accuracy."
Small energy masking for improved neural network training for end-to-end speech recognition,"In this paper, we present a Small Energy Masking (SEM) algorithm, which masks inputs having values below a certain threshold. More specifically, a time-frequency bin is masked if the filterbank energy in this bin is less than a certain energy threshold. A uniform distribution is employed to randomly generate the ratio of this energy threshold to the peak filterbank energy of each utterance in decibels. The unmasked feature elements are scaled so that the total sum of the feature values remain the same through this masking procedure. This very simple algorithm shows relatively 11.2 % and 13.5 % Word Error Rate (WER) improvements on the standard LibriSpeech test-clean and test-other sets over the baseline end-to-end speech recognition system. Additionally, compared to the input dropout algorithm, SEM algorithm shows relatively 7.7 % and 11.6 % improvements on the same LibriSpeech test-clean and test-other sets. With a modified shallow-fusion technique with a Transformer LM, we obtained a 2.62 % WER on the LibriSpeech test-clean set and a 7.87 % WER on the LibriSpeech test-other set."
Attentional Speech Recognition Models Misbehave on Out-of-domain Utterances,"We discuss the problem of echographic transcription in autoregressive sequence-to-sequence attentional architectures for automatic speech recognition, where a model produces very long sequences of repetitive outputs when presented with out-of-domain utterances. We decode audio from the British National Corpus with an attentional encoder-decoder model trained solely on the LibriSpeech corpus. We observe that there are many 5-second recordings that produce more than 500 characters of decoding output (i.e. more than 100 characters per second). A frame-synchronous hybrid (DNN-HMM) model trained on the same data does not produce these unusually long transcripts. These decoding issues are reproducible in a speech transformer model from ESPnet, and to a lesser extent in a self-attention CTC model, suggesting that these issues are intrinsic to the use of the attention mechanism. We create a separate length prediction model to predict the correct number of wordpieces in the output, which allows us to identify and truncate problematic decoding results without increasing word error rates on the LibriSpeech task."
End-to-End Multi-speaker Speech Recognition with Transformer,"Recently, fully recurrent neural network (RNN) based end-to-end models have been proven to be effective for multi-speaker speech recognition in both the single-channel and multi-channel scenarios. In this work, we explore the use of Transformer models for these tasks by focusing on two aspects. First, we replace the RNN-based encoder-decoder in the speech recognition model with a Transformer architecture. Second, in order to use the Transformer in the masking network of the neural beamformer in the multi-channel case, we modify the self-attention component to be restricted to a segment rather than the whole sequence in order to reduce computation. Besides the model architecture improvements, we also incorporate an external dereverberation preprocessing, the weighted prediction error (WPE), enabling our model to handle reverberated signals. Experiments on the spatialized wsj1-2mix corpus show that the Transformer-based models achieve 40.9% and 25.6% relative WER reduction, down to 12.1% and 6.4% WER, under the anechoic condition in single-channel and multi-channel tasks, respectively, while in the reverberant case, our methods achieve 41.5% and 13.8% relative WER reduction, down to 16.5% and 15.2% WER."
Continuous Silent Speech Recognition using EEG,In this paper we explore continuous silent speech recognition using electroencephalography (EEG) signals. We implemented a connectionist temporal classification (CTC) automatic speech recognition (ASR) model to translate EEG signals recorded in parallel while subjects were reading English sentences in their mind without producing any voice to text. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using EEG signals for performing continuous silent speech recognition. We demonstrate our results for a limited English vocabulary consisting of 30 unique sentences.
Transformer Transducer: A Streamable Speech Recognition Model with Transformer Encoders and RNN-T Loss,"In this paper we present an end-to-end speech recognition model with Transformer encoders that can be used in a streaming speech recognition system. Transformer computation blocks based on self-attention are used to encode both audio and label sequences independently. The activations from both audio and label encoders are combined with a feed-forward layer to compute a probability distribution over the label space for every combination of acoustic frame position and label history. This is similar to the Recurrent Neural Network Transducer (RNN-T) model, which uses RNNs for information encoding instead of Transformer encoders. The model is trained with the RNN-T loss well-suited to streaming decoding. We present results on the LibriSpeech dataset showing that limiting the left context for self-attention in the Transformer layers makes decoding computationally tractable for streaming, with only a slight degradation in accuracy. We also show that the full attention version of our model beats the-state-of-the art accuracy on the LibriSpeech benchmarks. Our results also show that we can bridge the gap between full attention and limited attention versions of our model by attending to a limited number of future frames."
Robust Multi-channel Speech Recognition using Frequency Aligned Network,"Conventional speech enhancement technique such as beamforming has known benefits for far-field speech recognition. Our own work in frequency-domain multi-channel acoustic modeling has shown additional improvements by training a spatial filtering layer jointly within an acoustic model. In this paper, we further develop this idea and use frequency aligned network for robust multi-channel automatic speech recognition (ASR). Unlike an affine layer in the frequency domain, the proposed frequency aligned component prevents one frequency bin influencing other frequency bins. We show that this modification not only reduces the number of parameters in the model but also significantly and improves the ASR performance. We investigate effects of frequency aligned network through ASR experiments on the real-world far-field data where users are interacting with an ASR system in uncontrolled acoustic environments. We show that our multi-channel acoustic model with a frequency aligned network shows up to 18% relative reduction in word error rate."
End-to-End Automatic Speech Recognition Integrated With CTC-Based Voice Activity Detection,"This paper integrates a voice activity detection (VAD) function with end-to-end automatic speech recognition toward an online speech interface and transcribing very long audio recordings. We focus on connectionist temporal classification (CTC) and its extension of CTC/attention architectures. As opposed to an attention-based architecture, input-synchronous label prediction can be performed based on a greedy search with the CTC (pre-)softmax output. This prediction includes consecutive long blank labels, which can be regarded as a non-speech region. We use the labels as a cue for detecting speech segments with simple thresholding. The threshold value is directly related to the length of a non-speech region, which is more intuitive and easier to control than conventional VAD hyperparameters. Experimental results on unsegmented data show that the proposed method outperformed the baseline methods using the conventional energy-based and neural-network-based VAD methods and achieved an RTF less than 0.2. The proposed method is publicly available."
BUT Opensat 2019 Speech Recognition System,"The paper describes the BUT Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems submitted for OpenSAT evaluations under two domain categories such as low resourced languages and public safety communications. The first was challenging due to lack of training data, therefore various architectures and multilingual approaches were employed. The combination led to superior performance. The second domain was challenging due to recording in extreme conditions such as specific channel, speaker under stress and high levels of noise. Data augmentation process was inevitable to get reasonably good performance."
Submodular Rank Aggregation on Score-based Permutations for Distributed Automatic Speech Recognition,"Distributed automatic speech recognition (ASR) requires to aggregate outputs of distributed deep neural network (DNN)-based models. This work studies the use of submodular functions to design a rank aggregation on score-based permutations, which can be used for distributed ASR systems in both supervised and unsupervised modes. Specifically, we compose an aggregation rank function based on the Lovasz Bregman divergence for setting up linear structured convex and nested structured concave functions. The algorithm is based on stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and can obtain well-trained aggregation models. Our experiments on the distributed ASR system show that the submodular rank aggregation can obtain higher speech recognition accuracy than traditional aggregation methods like Adaboost. Code is available online~\footnote{https://github.com/uwjunqi/Subrank}."
Scaling Up Online Speech Recognition Using ConvNets,"We design an online end-to-end speech recognition system based on Time-Depth Separable (TDS) convolutions and Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC). We improve the core TDS architecture in order to limit the future context and hence reduce latency while maintaining accuracy. The system has almost three times the throughput of a well tuned hybrid ASR baseline while also having lower latency and a better word error rate. Also important to the efficiency of the recognizer is our highly optimized beam search decoder. To show the impact of our design choices, we analyze throughput, latency, accuracy, and discuss how these metrics can be tuned based on the user requirements."
Multi-task self-supervised learning for Robust Speech Recognition,"Despite the growing interest in unsupervised learning, extracting meaningful knowledge from unlabelled audio remains an open challenge. To take a step in this direction, we recently proposed a problem-agnostic speech encoder (PASE), that combines a convolutional encoder followed by multiple neural networks, called workers, tasked to solve self-supervised problems (i.e., ones that do not require manual annotations as ground truth). PASE was shown to capture relevant speech information, including speaker voice-print and phonemes. This paper proposes PASE+, an improved version of PASE for robust speech recognition in noisy and reverberant environments. To this end, we employ an online speech distortion module, that contaminates the input signals with a variety of random disturbances. We then propose a revised encoder that better learns short- and long-term speech dynamics with an efficient combination of recurrent and convolutional networks. Finally, we refine the set of workers used in self-supervision to encourage better cooperation. Results on TIMIT, DIRHA and CHiME-5 show that PASE+ significantly outperforms both the previous version of PASE as well as common acoustic features. Interestingly, PASE+ learns transferable representations suitable for highly mismatched acoustic conditions."
Data Techniques For Online End-to-end Speech Recognition,"Practitioners often need to build ASR systems for new use cases in a short amount of time, given limited in-domain data. While recently developed end-to-end methods largely simplify the modeling pipelines, they still suffer from the data sparsity issue. In this work, we explore a few simple-to-implement techniques for building online ASR systems in an end-to-end fashion, with a small amount of transcribed data in the target domain. These techniques include data augmentation in the target domain, domain adaptation using models previously trained on a large source domain, and knowledge distillation on non-transcribed target domain data, using an adapted bi-directional model as the teacher; they are applicable in real scenarios with different types of resources. Our experiments demonstrate that each technique is independently useful in the improvement of the online ASR performance in the target domain."
Transformer-based Online CTC/attention End-to-End Speech Recognition Architecture,"Recently, Transformer has gained success in automatic speech recognition (ASR) field. However, it is challenging to deploy a Transformer-based end-to-end (E2E) model for online speech recognition. In this paper, we propose the Transformer-based online CTC/attention E2E ASR architecture, which contains the chunk self-attention encoder (chunk-SAE) and the monotonic truncated attention (MTA) based self-attention decoder (SAD). Firstly, the chunk-SAE splits the speech into isolated chunks. To reduce the computational cost and improve the performance, we propose the state reuse chunk-SAE. Sencondly, the MTA based SAD truncates the speech features monotonically and performs attention on the truncated features. To support the online recognition, we integrate the state reuse chunk-SAE and the MTA based SAD into online CTC/attention architecture. We evaluate the proposed online models on the HKUST Mandarin ASR benchmark and achieve a 23.66% character error rate (CER) with a 320 ms latency. Our online model yields as little as 0.19% absolute CER degradation compared with the offline baseline, and achieves significant improvement over our prior work on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based online E2E models."
Speech Emotion Recognition Based on Multi-feature and Multi-lingual Fusion,"A speech emotion recognition algorithm based on multi-feature and Multi-lingual fusion is proposed in order to resolve low recognition accuracy caused by lack of large speech dataset and low robustness of acoustic features in the recognition of speech emotion. First, handcrafted and deep automatic features are extracted from existing data in Chinese and English speech emotions. Then, the various features are fused respectively. Finally, the fused features of different languages are fused again and trained in a classification model. Distinguishing the fused features with the unfused ones, the results manifest that the fused features significantly enhance the accuracy of speech emotion recognition algorithm. The proposed solution is evaluated on the two Chinese corpus and two English corpus, and is shown to provide more accurate predictions compared to original solution. As a result of this study, the multi-feature and Multi-lingual fusion algorithm can significantly improve the speech emotion recognition accuracy when the dataset is small."
Robust Speaker Recognition Using Speech Enhancement And Attention Model,"In this paper, a novel architecture for speaker recognition is proposed by cascading speech enhancement and speaker processing. Its aim is to improve speaker recognition performance when speech signals are corrupted by noise. Instead of individually processing speech enhancement and speaker recognition, the two modules are integrated into one framework by a joint optimisation using deep neural networks. Furthermore, to increase robustness against noise, a multi-stage attention mechanism is employed to highlight the speaker related features learned from context information in time and frequency domain. To evaluate speaker identification and verification performance of the proposed approach, we test it on the dataset of VoxCeleb1, one of mostly used benchmark datasets. Moreover, the robustness of our proposed approach is also tested on VoxCeleb1 data when being corrupted by three types of interferences, general noise, music, and babble, at different signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels. The obtained results show that the proposed approach using speech enhancement and multi-stage attention models outperforms two strong baselines not using them in most acoustic conditions in our experiments."
Open Challenge for Correcting Errors of Speech Recognition Systems,The paper announces the new long-term challenge for improving the performance of automatic speech recognition systems. The goal of the challenge is to investigate methods of correcting the recognition results on the basis of previously made errors by the speech processing system. The dataset prepared for the task is described and evaluation criteria are presented.
Streaming automatic speech recognition with the transformer model,"Encoder-decoder based sequence-to-sequence models have demonstrated state-of-the-art results in end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR). Recently, the transformer architecture, which uses self-attention to model temporal context information, has been shown to achieve significantly lower word error rates (WERs) compared to recurrent neural network (RNN) based system architectures. Despite its success, the practical usage is limited to offline ASR tasks, since encoder-decoder architectures typically require an entire speech utterance as input. In this work, we propose a transformer based end-to-end ASR system for streaming ASR, where an output must be generated shortly after each spoken word. To achieve this, we apply time-restricted self-attention for the encoder and triggered attention for the encoder-decoder attention mechanism. Our proposed streaming transformer architecture achieves 2.8% and 7.2% WER for the ""clean"" and ""other"" test data of LibriSpeech, which to our knowledge is the best published streaming end-to-end ASR result for this task."
Domain Adaptation via Teacher-Student Learning for End-to-End Speech Recognition,"Teacher-student (T/S) has shown to be effective for domain adaptation of deep neural network acoustic models in hybrid speech recognition systems. In this work, we extend the T/S learning to large-scale unsupervised domain adaptation of an attention-based end-to-end (E2E) model through two levels of knowledge transfer: teacher's token posteriors as soft labels and one-best predictions as decoder guidance. To further improve T/S learning with the help of ground-truth labels, we propose adaptive T/S (AT/S) learning. Instead of conditionally choosing from either the teacher's soft token posteriors or the one-hot ground-truth label, in AT/S, the student always learns from both the teacher and the ground truth with a pair of adaptive weights assigned to the soft and one-hot labels quantifying the confidence on each of the knowledge sources. The confidence scores are dynamically estimated at each decoder step as a function of the soft and one-hot labels. With 3400 hours parallel close-talk and far-field Microsoft Cortana data for domain adaptation, T/S and AT/S achieve 6.3% and 10.3% relative word error rate improvement over a strong E2E model trained with the same amount of far-field data."
Character-Aware Attention-Based End-to-End Speech Recognition,"Predicting words and subword units (WSUs) as the output has shown to be effective for the attention-based encoder-decoder (AED) model in end-to-end speech recognition. However, as one input to the decoder recurrent neural network (RNN), each WSU embedding is learned independently through context and acoustic information in a purely data-driven fashion. Little effort has been made to explicitly model the morphological relationships among WSUs. In this work, we propose a novel character-aware (CA) AED model in which each WSU embedding is computed by summarizing the embeddings of its constituent characters using a CA-RNN. This WSU-independent CA-RNN is jointly trained with the encoder, the decoder and the attention network of a conventional AED to predict WSUs. With CA-AED, the embeddings of morphologically similar WSUs are naturally and directly correlated through the CA-RNN in addition to the semantic and acoustic relations modeled by a traditional AED. Moreover, CA-AED significantly reduces the model parameters in a traditional AED by replacing the large pool of WSU embeddings with a much smaller set of character embeddings. On a 3400 hours Microsoft Cortana dataset, CA-AED achieves up to 11.9% relative WER improvement over a strong AED baseline with 27.1% fewer model parameters."
Audio-visual Recognition of Overlapped speech for the LRS2 dataset,"Automatic recognition of overlapped speech remains a highly challenging task to date. Motivated by the bimodal nature of human speech perception, this paper investigates the use of audio-visual technologies for overlapped speech recognition. Three issues associated with the construction of audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) systems are addressed. First, the basic architecture designs i.e. end-to-end and hybrid of AVSR systems are investigated. Second, purposefully designed modality fusion gates are used to robustly integrate the audio and visual features. Third, in contrast to a traditional pipelined architecture containing explicit speech separation and recognition components, a streamlined and integrated AVSR system optimized consistently using the lattice-free MMI (LF-MMI) discriminative criterion is also proposed. The proposed LF-MMI time-delay neural network (TDNN) system establishes the state-of-the-art for the LRS2 dataset. Experiments on overlapped speech simulated from the LRS2 dataset suggest the proposed AVSR system outperformed the audio only baseline LF-MMI DNN system by up to 29.98\% absolute in word error rate (WER) reduction, and produced recognition performance comparable to a more complex pipelined system. Consistent performance improvements of 4.89\% absolute in WER reduction over the baseline AVSR system using feature fusion are also obtained."
HMM-based phoneme speech recognition system for control and command of industrial robots,"Speech recognition is a prominent technology, which helps us to develop a Natural language interface through speech for the Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). It allows the computer to take the spoken instructions, interpret it, and generate text from it. In this paper, we propose a phoneme based speech recognition system to control industrial robots. Speech recognition has become one of the popular interfaces when it comes to reducing robot operator's efforts to control and command the robot. This paper intends to investigate the potential of Linear Predictive coding technique to develop a stable and robust phoneme speech recognition system for robotics applications. Our system is divided into three segments: a microphone array, a voice module, and a 3-DOF robotic arm. To validate our approach, we have performed tests with simple and complex sentences for various robotics activities like manipulating a cube and pick and place tasks. Moreover, we also analyzed the test result to rectify the problems and limitations in our approach. The paper presents all the test results which we have achieved through conducting experiments on our project."
Transformer-based language modeling and decoding for conversational speech recognition,"We propose a way to use a transformer-based language model in conversational speech recognition. Specifically, we focus on decoding efficiently in a weighted finite-state transducer framework. We showcase an approach to lattice re-scoring that allows for longer range history captured by a transfomer-based language model and takes advantage of a transformer's ability to avoid computing sequentially."
Re-synchronization using the Hand Preceding Model for Multi-modal Fusion in Automatic Continuous Cued Speech Recognition,"Cued Speech (CS) is an augmented lip reading complemented by hand coding, and it is very helpful to the deaf people. Automatic CS recognition can help communications between the deaf people and others. Due to the asynchronous nature of lips and hand movements, fusion of them in automatic CS recognition is a challenging problem. In this work, we propose a novel re-synchronization procedure for multi-modal fusion, which aligns the hand features with lips feature. It is realized by delaying hand position and hand shape with their optimal hand preceding time which is derived by investigating the temporal organizations of hand position and hand shape movements in CS. This re-synchronization procedure is incorporated into a practical continuous CS recognition system that combines convolutional neural network (CNN) with multi-stream hidden markov model (MSHMM). A significant improvement of about 4.6\% has been achieved retaining 76.6\% CS phoneme recognition correctness compared with the state-of-the-art architecture (72.04\%), which did not take into account the asynchrony of multi-modal fusion in CS. To our knowledge, this is the first work to tackle the asynchronous multi-modal fusion in the automatic continuous CS recognition."
Attention based on-device streaming speech recognition with large speech corpus,"In this paper, we present a new on-device automatic speech recognition (ASR) system based on monotonic chunk-wise attention (MoChA) models trained with large (> 10K hours) corpus. We attained around 90% of a word recognition rate for general domain mainly by using joint training of connectionist temporal classifier (CTC) and cross entropy (CE) losses, minimum word error rate (MWER) training, layer-wise pre-training and data augmentation methods. In addition, we compressed our models by more than 3.4 times smaller using an iterative hyper low-rank approximation (LRA) method while minimizing the degradation in recognition accuracy. The memory footprint was further reduced with 8-bit quantization to bring down the final model size to lower than 39 MB. For on-demand adaptation, we fused the MoChA models with statistical n-gram models, and we could achieve a relatively 36% improvement on average in word error rate (WER) for target domains including the general domain."
EEG based Continuous Speech Recognition using Transformers,"In this paper we investigate continuous speech recognition using electroencephalography (EEG) features using recently introduced end-to-end transformer based automatic speech recognition (ASR) model. Our results demonstrate that transformer based model demonstrate faster training compared to recurrent neural network (RNN) based sequence-to-sequence EEG models and better performance during inference time for smaller test set vocabulary but as we increase the vocabulary size, the performance of the RNN based models were better than transformer based model on a limited English vocabulary."
Attentive batch normalization for lstm-based acoustic modeling of speech recognition,"Batch normalization (BN) is an effective method to accelerate model training and improve the generalization performance of neural networks. In this paper, we propose an improved batch normalization technique called attentive batch normalization (ABN) in Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) based acoustic modeling for automatic speech recognition (ASR). In the proposed method, an auxiliary network is used to dynamically generate the scaling and shifting parameters in batch normalization, and attention mechanisms are introduced to improve their regularized performance. Furthermore, two schemes, frame-level and utterance-level ABN, are investigated. We evaluate our proposed methods on Mandarin and Uyghur ASR tasks, respectively. The experimental results show that the proposed ABN greatly improves the performance of batch normalization in terms of transcription accuracy for both languages."
Learning Transferable Features for Speech Emotion Recognition,"Emotion recognition from speech is one of the key steps towards emotional intelligence in advanced human-machine interaction. Identifying emotions in human speech requires learning features that are robust and discriminative across diverse domains that differ in terms of language, spontaneity of speech, recording conditions, and types of emotions. This corresponds to a learning scenario in which the joint distributions of features and labels may change substantially across domains. In this paper, we propose a deep architecture that jointly exploits a convolutional network for extracting domain-shared features and a long short-term memory network for classifying emotions using domain-specific features. We use transferable features to enable model adaptation from multiple source domains, given the sparseness of speech emotion data and the fact that target domains are short of labeled data. A comprehensive cross-corpora experiment with diverse speech emotion domains reveals that transferable features provide gains ranging from 4.3% to 18.4% in speech emotion recognition. We evaluate several domain adaptation approaches, and we perform an ablation study to understand which source domains add the most to the overall recognition effectiveness for a given target domain."
power-law nonlinearity with maximally uniform distribution criterion for improved neural network training in automatic speech recognition,"In this paper, we describe the Maximum Uniformity of Distribution (MUD) algorithm with the power-law nonlinearity. In this approach, we hypothesize that neural network training will become more stable if feature distribution is not too much skewed. We propose two different types of MUD approaches: power function-based MUD and histogram-based MUD. In these approaches, we first obtain the mel filterbank coefficients and apply nonlinearity functions for each filterbank channel. With the power function-based MUD, we apply a power-function based nonlinearity where power function coefficients are chosen to maximize the likelihood assuming that nonlinearity outputs follow the uniform distribution. With the histogram-based MUD, the empirical Cumulative Density Function (CDF) from the training database is employed to transform the original distribution into a uniform distribution. In MUD processing, we do not use any prior knowledge (e.g. logarithmic relation) about the energy of the incoming signal and the perceived intensity by a human. Experimental results using an end-to-end speech recognition system demonstrate that power-function based MUD shows better result than the conventional Mel Filterbank Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs). On the LibriSpeech database, we could achieve 4.02 % WER on test-clean and 13.34 % WER on test-other without using any Language Models (LMs). The major contribution of this work is that we developed a new algorithm for designing the compressive nonlinearity in a data-driven way, which is much more flexible than the previous approaches and may be extended to other domains as well."
end-to-end training of a large vocabulary end-to-end speech recognition system,"In this paper, we present an end-to-end training framework for building state-of-the-art end-to-end speech recognition systems. Our training system utilizes a cluster of Central Processing Units(CPUs) and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). The entire data reading, large scale data augmentation, neural network parameter updates are all performed ""on-the-fly"". We use vocal tract length perturbation [1] and an acoustic simulator [2] for data augmentation. The processed features and labels are sent to the GPU cluster. The Horovod allreduce approach is employed to train neural network parameters. We evaluated the effectiveness of our system on the standard Librispeech corpus [3] and the 10,000-hr anonymized Bixby English dataset. Our end-to-end speech recognition system built using this training infrastructure showed a 2.44 % WER on test-clean of the LibriSpeech test set after applying shallow fusion with a Transformer language model (LM). For the proprietary English Bixby open domain test set, we obtained a WER of 7.92 % using a Bidirectional Full Attention (BFA) end-to-end model after applying shallow fusion with an RNN-LM. When the monotonic chunckwise attention (MoCha) based approach is employed for streaming speech recognition, we obtained a WER of 9.95 % on the same Bixby open domain test set."
Emotion Recognition from Speech,"In this work, we conduct an extensive comparison of various approaches to speech based emotion recognition systems. The analyses were carried out on audio recordings from Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song (RAVDESS). After pre-processing the raw audio files, features such as Log-Mel Spectrogram, Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), pitch and energy were considered. The significance of these features for emotion classification was compared by applying methods such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). On the 14-class (2 genders x 7 emotions) classification task, an accuracy of 68% was achieved with a 4-layer 2 dimensional CNN using the Log-Mel Spectrogram features. We also observe that, in emotion recognition, the choice of audio features impacts the results much more than the model complexity."
Generating Synthetic Audio Data for Attention-Based Speech Recognition Systems,"Recent advances in text-to-speech (TTS) led to the development of flexible multi-speaker end-to-end TTS systems. We extend state-of-the-art attention-based automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems with synthetic audio generated by a TTS system trained only on the ASR corpora itself. ASR and TTS systems are built separately to show that text-only data can be used to enhance existing end-to-end ASR systems without the necessity of parameter or architecture changes. We compare our method with language model integration of the same text data and with simple data augmentation methods like SpecAugment and show that performance improvements are mostly independent. We achieve improvements of up to 33% relative in word-error-rate (WER) over a strong baseline with data-augmentation in a low-resource environment (LibriSpeech-100h), closing the gap to a comparable oracle experiment by more than 50\%. We also show improvements of up to 5% relative WER over our most recent ASR baseline on LibriSpeech-960h."
Personalization of End-to-end Speech Recognition On Mobile Devices For Named Entities,"We study the effectiveness of several techniques to personalize end-to-end speech models and improve the recognition of proper names relevant to the user. These techniques differ in the amounts of user effort required to provide supervision, and are evaluated on how they impact speech recognition performance. We propose using keyword-dependent precision and recall metrics to measure vocabulary acquisition performance. We evaluate the algorithms on a dataset that we designed to contain names of persons that are difficult to recognize. Therefore, the baseline recall rate for proper names in this dataset is very low: 2.4%. A data synthesis approach we developed brings it to 48.6%, with no need for speech input from the user. With speech input, if the user corrects only the names, the name recall rate improves to 64.4%. If the user corrects all the recognition errors, we achieve the best recall of 73.5%. To eliminate the need to upload user data and store personalized models on a server, we focus on performing the entire personalization workflow on a mobile device."
Detecting Adversarial Attacks On Audiovisual Speech Recognition,"Adversarial attacks pose a threat to deep learning models. However, research on adversarial detection methods, especially in the multi-modal domain, is very limited. In this work, we propose an efficient and straightforward detection method based on the temporal correlation between audio and video streams. The main idea is that the correlation between audio and video in adversarial examples will be lower than benign examples due to added adversarial noise. We use the synchronisation confidence score as a proxy for audiovisual correlation and based on it we can detect adversarial attacks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on detection of adversarial attacks on audiovisual speech recognition models. We apply recent adversarial attacks on two audiovisual speech recognition models trained on the GRID and LRW datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is an effective way for detecting such attacks."
Continuous Speech Recognition using EEG and Video,In this paper we investigate whether electroencephalography (EEG) features can be used to improve the performance of continuous visual speech recognition systems. We implemented a connectionist temporal classification (CTC) based end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) model for performing recognition. Our results demonstrate that EEG features are helpful in enhancing the performance of continuous visual speech recognition systems.
Synchronous Speech Recognition and Speech-to-Text Translation with Interactive Decoding,"Speech-to-text translation (ST), which translates source language speech into target language text, has attracted intensive attention in recent years. Compared to the traditional pipeline system, the end-to-end ST model has potential benefits of lower latency, smaller model size, and less error propagation. However, it is notoriously difficult to implement such a model without transcriptions as intermediate. Existing works generally apply multi-task learning to improve translation quality by jointly training end-to-end ST along with automatic speech recognition (ASR). However, different tasks in this method cannot utilize information from each other, which limits the improvement. Other works propose a two-stage model where the second model can use the hidden state from the first one, but its cascade manner greatly affects the efficiency of training and inference process. In this paper, we propose a novel interactive attention mechanism which enables ASR and ST to perform synchronously and interactively in a single model. Specifically, the generation of transcriptions and translations not only relies on its previous outputs but also the outputs predicted in the other task. Experiments on TED speech translation corpora have shown that our proposed model can outperform strong baselines on the quality of speech translation and achieve better speech recognition performances as well."
Leveraging End-to-End Speech Recognition with Neural Architecture Search,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been demonstrated to outperform many traditional machine learning algorithms in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). In this paper, we show that a large improvement in the accuracy of deep speech models can be achieved with effective Neural Architecture Optimization at a very low computational cost. Phone recognition tests with the popular LibriSpeech and TIMIT benchmarks proved this fact by displaying the ability to discover and train novel candidate models within a few hours (less than a day) many times faster than the attention-based seq2seq models. Our method achieves test error of 7% Word Error Rate (WER) on the LibriSpeech corpus and 13% Phone Error Rate (PER) on the TIMIT corpus, on par with state-of-the-art results."
Visualizing Deep Neural Networks for Speech Recognition with Learned Topographic Filter Maps,"The uninformative ordering of artificial neurons in Deep Neural Networks complicates visualizing activations in deeper layers. This is one reason why the internal structure of such models is very unintuitive. In neuroscience, activity of real brains can be visualized by highlighting active regions. Inspired by those techniques, we train a convolutional speech recognition model, where filters are arranged in a 2D grid and neighboring filters are similar to each other. We show, how those topographic filter maps visualize artificial neuron activations more intuitively. Moreover, we investigate, whether this causes phoneme-responsive neurons to be grouped in certain regions of the topographic map."
A Multi Purpose and Large Scale Speech Corpus in Persian and English for Speaker and Speech Recognition: the DeepMine Database,"DeepMine is a speech database in Persian and English designed to build and evaluate text-dependent, text-prompted, and text-independent speaker verification, as well as Persian speech recognition systems. It contains more than 1850 speakers and 540 thousand recordings overall, more than 480 hours of speech are transcribed. It is the first public large-scale speaker verification database in Persian, the largest public text-dependent and text-prompted speaker verification database in English, and the largest public evaluation dataset for text-independent speaker verification. It has a good coverage of age, gender, and accents. We provide several evaluation protocols for each part of the database to allow for research on different aspects of speaker verification. We also provide the results of several experiments that can be considered as baselines: HMM-based i-vectors for text-dependent speaker verification, and HMM-based as well as state-of-the-art deep neural network based ASR. We demonstrate that the database can serve for training robust ASR models."
Semantic Mask for Transformer based End-to-End Speech Recognition,"Attention-based encoder-decoder model has achieved impressive results for both automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS) tasks. This approach takes advantage of the memorization capacity of neural networks to learn the mapping from the input sequence to the output sequence from scratch, without the assumption of prior knowledge such as the alignments. However, this model is prone to overfitting, especially when the amount of training data is limited. Inspired by SpecAugment and BERT, in this paper, we propose a semantic mask based regularization for training such kind of end-to-end (E2E) model. The idea is to mask the input features corresponding to a particular output token, e.g., a word or a word-piece, in order to encourage the model to fill the token based on the contextual information. While this approach is applicable to the encoder-decoder framework with any type of neural network architecture, we study the transformer-based model for ASR in this work. We perform experiments on Librispeech 960h and TedLium2 data sets, and achieve the state-of-the-art performance on the test set in the scope of E2E models."
Synchronous Transformers for End-to-End Speech Recognition,"For most of the attention-based sequence-to-sequence models, the decoder predicts the output sequence conditioned on the entire input sequence processed by the encoder. The asynchronous problem between the encoding and decoding makes these models difficult to be applied for online speech recognition. In this paper, we propose a model named synchronous transformer to address this problem, which can predict the output sequence chunk by chunk. Once a fixed-length chunk of the input sequence is processed by the encoder, the decoder begins to predict symbols immediately. During training, a forward-backward algorithm is introduced to optimize all the possible alignment paths. Our model is evaluated on a Mandarin dataset AISHELL-1. The experiments show that the synchronous transformer is able to perform encoding and decoding synchronously, and achieves a character error rate of 8.91% on the test set."
Bimodal Speech Emotion Recognition Using Pre-Trained Language Models,"Speech emotion recognition is a challenging task and an important step towards more natural human-machine interaction. We show that pre-trained language models can be fine-tuned for text emotion recognition, achieving an accuracy of 69.5% on Task 4A of SemEval 2017, improving upon the previous state of the art by over 3% absolute. We combine these language models with speech emotion recognition, achieving results of 73.5% accuracy when using provided transcriptions and speech data on a subset of four classes of the IEMOCAP dataset. The use of noise-induced transcriptions and speech data results in an accuracy of 71.4%. For our experiments, we created IEmoNet, a modular and adaptable bimodal framework for speech emotion recognition based on pre-trained language models. Lastly, we discuss the idea of using an emotional classifier as a reward for reinforcement learning as a step towards more successful and convenient human-machine interaction."
Integrating Knowledge into End-to-End Speech Recognition from External Text-Only Data,"Attention-based encoder-decoder (AED) models have achieved promising performance in speech recognition. However, because of the end-to-end training, an AED model is usually trained with speech-text paired data. It is challenging to incorporate external text-only data into AED models. Another issue of the AED model is that it does not use the right context of a text token while predicting the token. To alleviate the above two issues, we propose a unified method called LST (Learn Spelling from Teachers) to integrate knowledge into an AED model from the external text-only data and leverage the whole context in a sentence. The method is divided into two stages. First, in the representation stage, a language model is trained on the text. It can be seen as that the knowledge in the text is compressed into the LM. Then, at the transferring stage, the knowledge is transferred to the AED model via teacher-student learning. To further use the whole context of the text sentence, we propose an LM called causal cloze completer (COR), which estimates the probability of a token, given both the left context and the right context of it. Therefore, with LST training, the AED model can leverage the whole context in the sentence. Different from fusion based methods, which use LM during decoding, the proposed method does not increase any extra complexity at the inference stage. We conduct experiments on two scales of public Chinese datasets AISHELL-1 and AISHELL-2. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of leveraging external text-only data and the whole context in a sentence with our proposed method, compared with baseline hybrid systems and AED model based systems."
Deep Contextualized Acoustic Representations For Semi-Supervised Speech Recognition,"We propose a novel approach to semi-supervised automatic speech recognition (ASR). We first exploit a large amount of unlabeled audio data via representation learning, where we reconstruct a temporal slice of filterbank features from past and future context frames. The resulting deep contextualized acoustic representations (DeCoAR) are then used to train a CTC-based end-to-end ASR system using a smaller amount of labeled audio data. In our experiments, we show that systems trained on DeCoAR consistently outperform ones trained on conventional filterbank features, giving 42% and 19% relative improvement over the baseline on WSJ eval92 and LibriSpeech test-clean, respectively. Our approach can drastically reduce the amount of labeled data required; unsupervised training on LibriSpeech then supervision with 100 hours of labeled data achieves performance on par with training on all 960 hours directly. Pre-trained models and code will be released online."
Language Model Bootstrapping Using Neural Machine Translation For Conversational Speech Recognition,"Building conversational speech recognition systems for new languages is constrained by the availability of utterances that capture user-device interactions. Data collection is both expensive and limited by the speed of manual transcription. In order to address this, we advocate the use of neural machine translation as a data augmentation technique for bootstrapping language models. Machine translation (MT) offers a systematic way of incorporating collections from mature, resource-rich conversational systems that may be available for a different language. However, ingesting raw translations from a general purpose MT system may not be effective owing to the presence of named entities, intra sentential code-switching and the domain mismatch between the conversational data being translated and the parallel text used for MT training. To circumvent this, we explore the following domain adaptation techniques: (a) sentence embedding based data selection for MT training, (b) model finetuning, and (c) rescoring and filtering translated hypotheses. Using Hindi as the experimental testbed, we translate US English utterances to supplement the transcribed collections. We observe a relative word error rate reduction of 7.8-15.6%, depending on the bootstrapping phase. Fine grained analysis reveals that translation particularly aids the interaction scenarios which are underrepresented in the transcribed data."
Attentive Modality Hopping Mechanism for Speech Emotion Recognition,"In this work, we explore the impact of visual modality in addition to speech and text for improving the accuracy of the emotion detection system. The traditional approaches tackle this task by fusing the knowledge from the various modalities independently for performing emotion classification. In contrast to these approaches, we tackle the problem by introducing an attention mechanism to combine the information. In this regard, we first apply a neural network to obtain hidden representations of the modalities. Then, the attention mechanism is defined to select and aggregate important parts of the video data by conditioning on the audio and text data. Furthermore, the attention mechanism is again applied to attend important parts of the speech and textual data, by considering other modality. Experiments are performed on the standard IEMOCAP dataset using all three modalities (audio, text, and video). The achieved results show a significant improvement of 3.65% in terms of weighted accuracy compared to the baseline system."
Improving Voice Separation by Incorporating End-to-end Speech Recognition,"Despite recent advances in voice separation methods, many challenges remain in realistic scenarios such as noisy recording and the limits of available data. In this work, we propose to explicitly incorporate the phonetic and linguistic nature of speech by taking a transfer learning approach using an end-to-end automatic speech recognition (E2EASR) system. The voice separation is conditioned on deep features extracted from E2EASR to cover the long-term dependence of phonetic aspects. Experimental results on speech separation and enhancement task on the AVSpeech dataset show that the proposed method significantly improves the signal-to-distortion ratio over the baseline model and even outperforms an audio visual model, that utilizes visual information of lip movements."
Minimum Bayes Risk Training of RNN-Transducer for End-to-End Speech Recognition,"In this work, we propose minimum Bayes risk (MBR) training of RNN-Transducer (RNN-T) for end-to-end speech recognition. Specifically, initialized with a RNN-T trained model, MBR training is conducted via minimizing the expected edit distance between the reference label sequence and on-the-fly generated N-best hypothesis. We also introduce a heuristic to incorporate an external neural network language model (NNLM) in RNN-T beam search decoding and explore MBR training with the external NNLM. Experimental results demonstrate an MBR trained model outperforms a RNN-T trained model substantially and further improvements can be achieved if trained with an external NNLM. Our best MBR trained system achieves absolute character error rate (CER) reductions of 1.2% and 0.5% on read and spontaneous Mandarin speech respectively over a strong convolution and transformer based RNN-T baseline trained on ~21,000 hours of speech."
AIPNet: Generative Adversarial Pre-training of Accent-invariant Networks for End-to-end Speech Recognition,"As one of the major sources in speech variability, accents have posed a grand challenge to the robustness of speech recognition systems. In this paper, our goal is to build a unified end-to-end speech recognition system that generalizes well across accents. For this purpose, we propose a novel pre-training framework AIPNet based on generative adversarial nets (GAN) for accent-invariant representation learning: Accent Invariant Pre-training Networks. We pre-train AIPNet to disentangle accent-invariant and accent-specific characteristics from acoustic features through adversarial training on accented data for which transcriptions are not necessarily available. We further fine-tune AIPNet by connecting the accent-invariant module with an attention-based encoder-decoder model for multi-accent speech recognition. In the experiments, our approach is compared against four baselines including both accent-dependent and accent-independent models. Experimental results on 9 English accents show that the proposed approach outperforms all the baselines by 2.3 \sim 4.5% relative reduction on average WER when transcriptions are available in all accents and by 1.6 \sim 6.1% relative reduction when transcriptions are only available in US accent."
Improving EEG based Continuous Speech Recognition,In this paper we introduce various techniques to improve the performance of electroencephalography (EEG) features based continuous speech recognition (CSR) systems. A connectionist temporal classification (CTC) based automatic speech recognition (ASR) system was implemented for performing recognition. We introduce techniques to initialize the weights of the recurrent layers in the encoder of the CTC model with more meaningful weights rather than with random weights and we make use of an external language model to improve the beam search during decoding time.  We finally study the problem of predicting articulatory features from EEG features in this paper.
Cantonese Automatic Speech Recognition Using Transfer Learning from Mandarin,"We propose a system to develop a basic automatic speech recognizer(ASR) for Cantonese, a low-resource language, through transfer learning of Mandarin, a high-resource language. We take a time-delayed neural network trained on Mandarin, and perform weight transfer of several layers to a newly initialized model for Cantonese. We experiment with the number of layers transferred, their learning rates, and pretraining i-vectors. Key findings are that this approach allows for quicker training time with less data. We find that for every epoch, log-probability is smaller for transfer learning models compared to a Cantonese-only model. The transfer learning models show slight improvement in CER."
On using 2D sequence-to-sequence models for speech recognition,"Attention-based sequence-to-sequence models have shown promising results in automatic speech recognition. Using these architectures, one-dimensional input and output sequences are related by an attention approach, thereby replacing more explicit alignment processes, like in classical HMM-based modeling. In contrast, here we apply a novel two-dimensional long short-term memory (2DLSTM) architecture to directly model the input/output relation between audio/feature vector sequences and word sequences. The proposed model is an alternative model such that instead of using any type of attention components, we apply a 2DLSTM layer to assimilate the context from both input observations and output transcriptions. The experimental evaluation on the Switchboard 300h automatic speech recognition task shows word error rates for the 2DLSTM model that are competitive to end-to-end attention-based model."
Deep Spiking Neural Networks for Large Vocabulary Automatic Speech Recognition,"Artificial neural networks (ANN) have become the mainstream acoustic modeling technique for large vocabulary automatic speech recognition (ASR). A conventional ANN features a multi-layer architecture that requires massive amounts of computation. The brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNN) closely mimic the biological neural networks and can operate on low-power neuromorphic hardware with spike-based computation. Motivated by their unprecedented energyefficiency and rapid information processing capability, we explore the use of SNNs for speech recognition. In this work, we use SNNs for acoustic modeling and evaluate their performance on several large vocabulary recognition scenarios. The experimental results demonstrate competitive ASR accuracies to their ANN counterparts, while require significantly reduced computational cost and inference time. Integrating the algorithmic power of deep SNNs with energy-efficient neuromorphic hardware, therefore, offer an attractive solution for ASR applications running locally on mobile and embedded devices."
Sample Drop Detection for Distant-speech Recognition with Asynchronous Devices Distributed in Space,"In many applications of multi-microphone multi-device processing, the synchronization among different input channels can be affected by the lack of a common clock and isolated drops of samples. In this work, we address the issue of sample drop detection in the context of a conversational speech scenario, recorded by a set of microphones distributed in space. The goal is to design a neural-based model that given a short window in the time domain, detects whether one or more devices have been subjected to a sample drop event. The candidate time windows are selected from a set of large time intervals, possibly including a sample drop, and by using a preprocessing step. The latter is based on the application of normalized cross-correlation between signals acquired by different devices. The architecture of the neural network relies on a CNN-LSTM encoder, followed by multi-head attention. The experiments are conducted using both artificial and real data. Our proposed approach obtained F1 score of 88% on an evaluation set extracted from the CHiME-5 corpus. A comparable performance was found in a larger set of experiments conducted on a set of multi-channel artificial scenes."
"M3ER: Multiplicative Multimodal Emotion Recognition Using Facial, Textual, and Speech Cues","We present M3ER, a learning-based method for emotion recognition from multiple input modalities. Our approach combines cues from multiple co-occurring modalities (such as face, text, and speech) and also is more robust than other methods to sensor noise in any of the individual modalities. M3ER models a novel, data-driven multiplicative fusion method to combine the modalities, which learn to emphasize the more reliable cues and suppress others on a per-sample basis. By introducing a check step which uses Canonical Correlational Analysis to differentiate between ineffective and effective modalities, M3ER is robust to sensor noise. M3ER also generates proxy features in place of the ineffectual modalities. We demonstrate the efficiency of our network through experimentation on two benchmark datasets, IEMOCAP and CMU-MOSEI. We report a mean accuracy of 82.7% on IEMOCAP and 89.0% on CMU-MOSEI, which, collectively, is an improvement of about 5% over prior work."
3-D Feature and Acoustic Modeling for Far-Field Speech Recognition,"Automatic speech recognition in multi-channel reverberant conditions is a challenging task. The conventional way of suppressing the reverberation artifacts involves a beamforming based enhancement of the multi-channel speech signal, which is used to extract spectrogram based features for a neural network acoustic model. In this paper, we propose to extract features directly from the multi-channel speech signal using a multi variate autoregressive (MAR) modeling approach, where the correlations among all the three dimensions of time, frequency and channel are exploited. The MAR features are fed to a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture which performs the joint acoustic modeling on the three dimensions. The 3-D CNN architecture allows the combination of multi-channel features that optimize the speech recognition cost compared to the traditional beamforming models that focus on the enhancement task. Experiments are conducted on the CHiME-3 and REVERB Challenge dataset using multi-channel reverberant speech. In these experiments, the proposed 3-D feature and acoustic modeling approach provides significant improvements over an ASR system trained with beamformed audio (average relative improvements of 10 % and 9 % in word error rates for CHiME-3 and REVERB Challenge datasets respectively."
Listen and Fill in the Missing Letters: Non-Autoregressive Transformer for Speech Recognition,"Recently very deep transformers have outperformed conventional bi-directional long short-term memory networks by a large margin in speech recognition. However, to put it into production usage, inference computation cost is still a serious concern in real scenarios. In this paper, we study two different non-autoregressive transformer structure for automatic speech recognition (ASR): A-CMLM and A-FMLM. During training, for both frameworks, input tokens fed to the decoder are randomly replaced by special mask tokens. The network is required to predict the tokens corresponding to those mask tokens by taking both unmasked context and input speech into consideration. During inference, we start from all mask tokens and the network iteratively predicts missing tokens based on partial results. We show that this framework can support different decoding strategies, including traditional left-to-right. A new decoding strategy is proposed as an example, which starts from the easiest predictions to the most difficult ones. Results on Mandarin (Aishell) and Japanese (CSJ) ASR benchmarks show the possibility to train such a non-autoregressive network for ASR. Especially in Aishell, the proposed method outperformed the Kaldi ASR system and it matches the performance of the state-of-the-art autoregressive transformer with 7x speedup. Pretrained models and code will be made available after publication."
Recurrent Neural Network Transducer for Audio-Visual Speech Recognition,"This work presents a large-scale audio-visual speech recognition system based on a recurrent neural network transducer (RNN-T) architecture. To support the development of such a system, we built a large audio-visual (A/V) dataset of segmented utterances extracted from YouTube public videos, leading to 31k hours of audio-visual training content. The performance of an audio-only, visual-only, and audio-visual system are compared on two large-vocabulary test sets: a set of utterance segments from public YouTube videos called YTDEV18 and the publicly available LRS3-TED set. To highlight the contribution of the visual modality, we also evaluated the performance of our system on the YTDEV18 set artificially corrupted with background noise and overlapping speech. To the best of our knowledge, our system significantly improves the state-of-the-art on the LRS3-TED set."
Long-span language modeling for speech recognition,"We explore neural language modeling for speech recognition where the context spans multiple sentences. Rather than encode history beyond the current sentence using a cache of words or document-level features, we focus our study on the ability of LSTM and Transformer language models to implicitly learn to carry over context across sentence boundaries. We introduce a new architecture that incorporates an attention mechanism into LSTM to combine the benefits of recurrent and attention architectures. We conduct language modeling and speech recognition experiments on the publicly available LibriSpeech corpus. We show that conventional training on a paragraph-level corpus results in significant reductions in perplexity compared to training on a sentence-level corpus. We also describe speech recognition experiments using long-span language models in second-pass re-ranking, and provide insights into the ability of such models to take advantage of context beyond the current sentence."
Effectiveness of self-supervised pre-training for speech recognition,"We compare self-supervised representation learning algorithms which either explicitly quantize the audio data or learn representations without quantization. We find the former to be more accurate since it builds a good vocabulary of the data through vq-wav2vec [1] to enable learning of effective representations in subsequent BERT training. Different to previous work, we directly fine-tune the pre-trained BERT models on transcribed speech using a Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss instead of feeding the representations into a task-specific model. We also propose a BERT-style model learning directly from the continuous audio data and compare pre-training on raw audio to spectral features. Fine-tuning a BERT model on 10 hour of labeled Librispeech data with a vq-wav2vec vocabulary is almost as good as the best known reported system trained on 100 hours of labeled data on testclean, while achieving a 25% WER reduction on test-other. When using only 10 minutes of labeled data, WER is 25.2 on test-other and 16.3 on test-clean. This demonstrates that self-supervision can enable speech recognition systems trained on a near-zero amount of transcribed data."
Speaker Adaptation for Attention-Based End-to-End Speech Recognition,"We propose three regularization-based speaker adaptation approaches to adapt the attention-based encoder-decoder (AED) model with very limited adaptation data from target speakers for end-to-end automatic speech recognition. The first method is Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) regularization, in which the output distribution of a speaker-dependent (SD) AED is forced to be close to that of the speaker-independent (SI) model by adding a KLD regularization to the adaptation criterion. To compensate for the asymmetric deficiency in KLD regularization, an adversarial speaker adaptation (ASA) method is proposed to regularize the deep-feature distribution of the SD AED through the adversarial learning of an auxiliary discriminator and the SD AED. The third approach is the multi-task learning, in which an SD AED is trained to jointly perform the primary task of predicting a large number of output units and an auxiliary task of predicting a small number of output units to alleviate the target sparsity issue. Evaluated on a Microsoft short message dictation task, all three methods are highly effective in adapting the AED model, achieving up to 12.2% and 3.0% word error rate improvement over an SI AED trained from 3400 hours data for supervised and unsupervised adaptation, respectively."
A Simplified Fully Quantized Transformer for End-to-end Speech Recognition,"While significant improvements have been made in recent years in terms of end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) performance, such improvements were obtained through the use of very large neural networks, unfit for embedded use on edge devices. That being said, in this paper, we work on simplifying and compressing Transformer-based encoder-decoder architectures for the end-to-end ASR task. We empirically introduce a more compact Speech-Transformer by investigating the impact of discarding particular modules on the performance of the model. Moreover, we evaluate reducing the numerical precision of our network's weights and activations while maintaining the performance of the full-precision model. Our experiments show that we can reduce the number of parameters of the full-precision model and then further compress the model 4x by fully quantizing to 8-bit fixed point precision."
A comparison of end-to-end models for long-form speech recognition,"End-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) models, including both attention-based models and the recurrent neural network transducer (RNN-T), have shown superior performance compared to conventional systems. However, previous studies have focused primarily on short utterances that typically last for just a few seconds or, at most, a few tens of seconds. Whether such architectures are practical on long utterances that last from minutes to hours remains an open question. In this paper, we both investigate and improve the performance of end-to-end models on long-form transcription. We first present an empirical comparison of different end-to-end models on a real world long-form task and demonstrate that the RNN-T model is much more robust than attention-based systems in this regime. We next explore two improvements to attention-based systems that significantly improve its performance: restricting the attention to be monotonic, and applying a novel decoding algorithm that breaks long utterances into shorter overlapping segments. Combining these two improvements, we show that attention-based end-to-end models can be very competitive to RNN-T on long-form speech recognition."
Spatial Attention for Far-field Speech Recognition with Deep Beamforming Neural Networks,"In this paper, we introduce spatial attention for refining the information in multi-direction neural beamformer for far-field automatic speech recognition. Previous approaches of neural beamformers with multiple look directions, such as the factored complex linear projection, have shown promising results. However, the features extracted by such methods contain redundant information, as only the direction of the target speech is relevant. We propose using a spatial attention subnet to weigh the features from different directions, so that the subsequent acoustic model could focus on the most relevant features for the speech recognition. Our experimental results show that spatial attention achieves up to 9% relative word error rate improvement over methods without the attention."
Temporal Feedback Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks for Speech Command Recognition,"End-to-end learning models using raw waveforms as input have shown superior performances in many audio recognition tasks. However, most model architectures are based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) which were mainly developed for visual recognition tasks. In this paper, we propose an extension of squeeze-and-excitation networks (SENets) which adds temporal feedback control from the top-layer features to channel-wise feature activations in lower layers using a recurrent module. This is analogous to the adaptive gain control mechanism of outer hair-cell in the human auditory system. We apply the proposed model to speech command recognition and show that it slightly outperforms the SENets and other CNN-based models. We also investigate the details of the performance improvement by conducting failure analysis and visualizing the channel-wise feature scaling induced by the temporal feedback."
Towards Robust Deep Neural Networks for Affect and Depression Recognition from Speech,"Intelligent monitoring systems and affective computing applications have emerged in recent years to enhance healthcare. Examples of these applications include assessment of affective states such as Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). MDD describes the constant expression of certain emotions: negative emotions (low Valence) and lack of interest (low Arousal). High-performing intelligent systems would enhance MDD diagnosis in its early stages. In this paper, we present a new deep neural network architecture, called EmoAudioNet, for emotion and depression recognition from speech. Deep EmoAudioNet learns from the time-frequency representation of the audio signal and the visual representation of its spectrum of frequencies. Our model shows very promising results in predicting affect and depression. It works similarly or outperforms the state-of-the-art methods according to several evaluation metrics on RECOLA and on DAIC-WOZ datasets in predicting arousal, valence, and depression.

Improving Generalization of Transformer for Speech Recognition with Parallel Schedule Sampling and Relative Positional Embedding,"Transformer has shown promising results in many sequence to sequence transformation tasks recently. It utilizes a number of feed-forward self-attention layers to replace the recurrent neural networks (RNN) in attention-based encoder decoder (AED) architecture. Self-attention layer learns temporal dependence by incorporating sinusoidal positional embedding of tokens in a sequence for parallel computing. Quicker iteration speed in training than sequential operation of RNN can be obtained. Deeper layers of the transformer also make it perform better than RNN-based AED. However, this parallelization ability is lost when applying scheduled sampling training. Self-attention with sinusoidal positional embedding may cause performance degradations for longer sequences that have similar acoustic or semantic information at different positions as well. To address these problems, we propose to use parallel scheduled sampling (PSS) and relative positional embedding (RPE) to help the transformer generalize to unseen data. Our proposed methods achieve a 7% relative improvement for short utterances and a 70% relative gain for long utterances on a 10,000-hour Mandarin ASR task."
Multi-scale Octave Convolutions for Robust Speech Recognition,"We propose a multi-scale octave convolution layer to learn robust speech representations efficiently. Octave convolutions were introduced by Chen et al [1] in the computer vision field to reduce the spatial redundancy of the feature maps by decomposing the output of a convolutional layer into feature maps at two different spatial resolutions, one octave apart. This approach improved the efficiency as well as the accuracy of the CNN models. The accuracy gain was attributed to the enlargement of the receptive field in the original input space. We argue that octave convolutions likewise improve the robustness of learned representations due to the use of average pooling in the lower resolution group, acting as a low-pass filter. We test this hypothesis by evaluating on two noisy speech corpora - Aurora-4 and AMI. We extend the octave convolution concept to multiple resolution groups and multiple octaves. To evaluate the robustness of the inferred representations, we report the similarity between clean and noisy encodings using an affine projection loss as a proxy robustness measure. The results show that proposed method reduces the WER by up to 6.6% relative for Aurora-4 and 3.6% for AMI, while improving the computational efficiency of the CNN acoustic models."
Lightweight and Efficient End-to-End Speech Recognition Using Low-Rank Transformer,"Highly performing deep neural networks come at the cost of computational complexity that limits their practicality for deployment on portable devices. We propose the low-rank transformer (LRT), a memory-efficient and fast neural architecture that significantly reduces the parameters and boosts the speed of training and inference for end-to-end speech recognition. Our approach reduces the number of parameters of the network by more than 50% and speeds up the inference time by around 1.35x compared to the baseline transformer model. The experiments show that our LRT model generalizes better and yields lower error rates on both validation and test sets compared to an uncompressed transformer model. The LRT model outperforms those from existing works on several datasets in an end-to-end setting without using an external language model or acoustic data."
Unsupervised Representation Learning with Future Observation Prediction for Speech Emotion Recognition,"Prior works on speech emotion recognition utilize various unsupervised learning approaches to deal with low-resource samples. However, these methods pay less attention to modeling the long-term dynamic dependency, which is important for speech emotion recognition. To deal with this problem, this paper combines the unsupervised representation learning strategy -- Future Observation Prediction (FOP), with transfer learning approaches (such as Fine-tuning and Hypercolumns). To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct experiments on the IEMOCAP database. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is superior to currently advanced unsupervised learning strategies."
Indian EmoSpeech Command Dataset: A dataset for emotion based speech recognition in the wild,"Speech emotion analysis is an important task which further enables several application use cases. The non-verbal sounds within speech utterances also play a pivotal role in emotion analysis in speech. Due to the widespread use of smartphones, it becomes viable to analyze speech commands captured using microphones for emotion understanding by utilizing on-device machine learning models. The non-verbal information includes the environment background sounds describing the type of surroundings, current situation and activities being performed. In this work, we consider both verbal (speech commands) and non-verbal sounds (background noises) within an utterance for emotion analysis in real-life scenarios. We create an indigenous dataset for this task namely ""Indian EmoSpeech Command Dataset"". It contains keywords with diverse emotions and background sounds, presented to explore new challenges in audio analysis. We exhaustively compare with various baseline models for emotion analysis on speech commands on several performance metrics. We demonstrate that we achieve a significant average gain of 3.3% in top-one score over a subset of speech command dataset for keyword spotting."
Does Speech enhancement of publicly available data help build robust Speech Recognition Systems?,"Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems play a key role in many commercial products including voice assistants. Typically, they require large amounts of clean speech data for training which gives an undue advantage to large organizations which have tons of private data. In this paper, we have first curated a fairly big dataset using publicly available data sources. Thereafter, we tried to investigate if we can use publicly available noisy data to train robust ASR systems. We have used speech enhancement to clean the noisy data first and then used it together with its cleaned version to train ASR systems. We have found that using speech enhancement gives 9.5\% better word error rate than training on just noisy data and 9\% better than training on just clean data. It's performance is also comparable to the ideal case scenario when trained on noisy and its clean version."
Improving sequence-to-sequence speech recognition training with on-the-fly data augmentation,"Sequence-to-Sequence (S2S) models recently started to show state-of-the-art performance for automatic speech recognition (ASR). With these large and deep models overfitting remains the largest problem, outweighing performance improvements that can be obtained from better architectures. One solution to the overfitting problem is increasing the amount of available training data and the variety exhibited by the training data with the help of data augmentation. In this paper we examine the influence of three data augmentation methods on the performance of two S2S model architectures. One of the data augmentation method comes from literature, while two other methods are our own development - a time perturbation in the frequency domain and sub-sequence sampling. Our experiments on Switchboard and Fisher data show state-of-the-art performance for S2S models that are trained solely on the speech training data and do not use additional text data."
DFSMN-SAN with Persistent Memory Model for Automatic Speech Recognition,"Self-attention networks (SAN) have been introduced into automatic speech recognition (ASR) and achieved state-of-the-art performance owing to its superior ability in capturing long term dependency. One of the key ingredients is the self-attention mechanism which can be effectively performed on the whole utterance level. In this paper, we try to investigate whether even more information beyond the whole utterance level can be exploited and beneficial. We propose to apply self-attention layer with augmented memory to ASR. Specifically, we first propose a variant model architecture which combines deep feed-forward sequential memory network (DFSMN) with self-attention layers to form a better baseline model compared with a purely self-attention network. Then, we propose and compare two kinds of additional memory structures added into self-attention layers. Experiments on large-scale LVCSR tasks show that on four individual test sets, the DFSMN-SAN architecture outperforms vanilla SAN encoder by 5% relatively in character error rate (CER). More importantly, the additional memory structure provides further 5% to 11% relative improvement in CER."
Transformer-Transducer: End-to-End Speech Recognition with Self-Attention,"We explore options to use Transformer networks in neural transducer for end-to-end speech recognition. Transformer networks use self-attention for sequence modeling and comes with advantages in parallel computation and capturing contexts. We propose 1) using VGGNet with causal convolution to incorporate positional information and reduce frame rate for efficient inference 2) using truncated self-attention to enable streaming for Transformer and reduce computational complexity. All experiments are conducted on the public LibriSpeech corpus. The proposed Transformer-Transducer outperforms neural transducer with LSTM/BLSTM networks and achieved word error rates of 6.37 % on the test-clean set and 15.30 % on the test-other set, while remaining streamable, compact with 45.7M parameters for the entire system, and computationally efficient with complexity of O(T), where T is input sequence length."
Sequence-to-sequence Automatic Speech Recognition with Word Embedding Regularization and Fused Decoding,"In this paper, we investigate the benefit that off-the-shelf word embedding can bring to the sequence-to-sequence (seq-to-seq) automatic speech recognition (ASR). We first introduced the word embedding regularization by maximizing the cosine similarity between a transformed decoder feature and the target word embedding. Based on the regularized decoder, we further proposed the fused decoding mechanism. This allows the decoder to consider the semantic consistency during decoding by absorbing the information carried by the transformed decoder feature, which is learned to be close to the target word embedding. Initial results on LibriSpeech demonstrated that pre-trained word embedding can significantly lower ASR recognition error with a negligible cost, and the choice of word embedding algorithms among Skip-gram, CBOW and BERT is important."
Towards Unsupervised Speech Recognition and Synthesis with Quantized Speech Representation Learning,"In this paper we propose a Sequential Representation Quantization AutoEncoder (SeqRQ-AE) to learn from primarily unpaired audio data and produce sequences of representations very close to phoneme sequences of speech utterances. This is achieved by proper temporal segmentation to make the representations phoneme-synchronized, and proper phonetic clustering to have total number of distinct representations close to the number of phonemes. Mapping between the distinct representations and phonemes is learned from a small amount of annotated paired data. Preliminary experiments on LJSpeech demonstrated the learned representations for vowels have relative locations in latent space in good parallel to that shown in the IPA vowel chart defined by linguistics experts. With less than 20 minutes of annotated speech, our method outperformed existing methods on phoneme recognition and is able to synthesize intelligible speech that beats our baseline model."
Unsupervised pre-training for sequence to sequence speech recognition,"This paper proposes a novel approach to pre-train encoder-decoder sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model with unpaired speech and transcripts respectively. Our pre-training method is divided into two stages, named acoustic pre-trianing and linguistic pre-training. In the acoustic pre-training stage, we use a large amount of speech to pre-train the encoder by predicting masked speech feature chunks with its context. In the linguistic pre-training stage, we generate synthesized speech from a large number of transcripts using a single-speaker text to speech (TTS) system, and use the synthesized paired data to pre-train decoder. This two-stage pre-training method integrates rich acoustic and linguistic knowledge into seq2seq model, which will benefit downstream automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks. The unsupervised pre-training is finished on AISHELL-2 dataset and we apply the pre-trained model to multiple paired data ratios of AISHELL-1 and HKUST. We obtain relative character error rate reduction (CERR) from 38.24% to 7.88% on AISHELL-1 and from 12.00% to 1.20% on HKUST. Besides, we apply our pretrained model to a cross-lingual case with CALLHOME dataset. For all six languages in CALLHOME dataset, our pre-training method makes model outperform baseline consistently."
Meta Learning for End-to-End Low-Resource Speech Recognition,"In this paper, we proposed to apply meta learning approach for low-resource automatic speech recognition (ASR). We formulated ASR for different languages as different tasks, and meta-learned the initialization parameters from many pretraining languages to achieve fast adaptation on unseen target language, via recently proposed model-agnostic meta learning algorithm (MAML). We evaluated the proposed approach using six languages as pretraining tasks and four languages as target tasks. Preliminary results showed that the proposed method, MetaASR, significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art multitask pretraining approach on all target languages with different combinations of pretraining languages. In addition, since MAML's model-agnostic property, this paper also opens new research direction of applying meta learning to more speech-related applications."
Confidence Estimation for Black Box Automatic Speech Recognition Systems Using Lattice Recurrent Neural Networks,"Recently, there has been growth in providers of speech transcription services enabling others to leverage technology they would not normally be able to use. As a result, speech-enabled solutions have become commonplace. Their success critically relies on the quality, accuracy, and reliability of the underlying speech transcription systems. Those black box systems, however, offer limited means for quality control as only word sequences are typically available. This paper examines this limited resource scenario for confidence estimation, a measure commonly used to assess transcription reliability. In particular, it explores what other sources of word and sub-word level information available in the transcription process could be used to improve confidence scores. To encode all such information this paper extends lattice recurrent neural networks to handle sub-words. Experimental results using the IARPA OpenKWS 2016 evaluation system show that the use of additional information yields significant gains in confidence estimation accuracy. The implementation for this model can be found online."
Towards Online End-to-end Transformer Automatic Speech Recognition,"The Transformer self-attention network has recently shown promising performance as an alternative to recurrent neural networks in end-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. However, Transformer has a drawback in that the entire input sequence is required to compute self-attention. We have proposed a block processing method for the Transformer encoder by introducing a context-aware inheritance mechanism. An additional context embedding vector handed over from the previously processed block helps to encode not only local acoustic information but also global linguistic, channel, and speaker attributes. In this paper, we extend it towards an entire online E2E ASR system by introducing an online decoding process inspired by monotonic chunkwise attention (MoChA) into the Transformer decoder. Our novel MoChA training and inference algorithms exploit the unique properties of Transformer, whose attentions are not always monotonic or peaky, and have multiple heads and residual connections of the decoder layers. Evaluations of the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) and AISHELL-1 show that our proposed online Transformer decoder outperforms conventional chunkwise approaches."
Exploring Lexicon-Free Modeling Units for End-to-End Korean and Korean-English Code-Switching Speech Recognition,"As the character-based end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) models evolve, the choice of acoustic modeling units becomes important. Since Korean is a fairly phonetic language and has a unique writing system with its own Korean alphabet, it's worth investigating modeling units for an end-to-end Korean ASR task. In this work, we introduce lexicon-free modeling units in Korean, and explore them using a hybrid CTC/Attention-based encoder-decoder model. Five lexicon-free units are investigated: Syllable-based Korean character (with English character for a code-switching task), Korean Jamo character (with English character), sub-word on syllable-based character (with sub-word in English), sub-word on Jamo character (with sub-words in English), and finally byte unit, which is a universal one across language. Experiments on Zeroth-Korean (51.6 hrs) and Medical Record (2530 hrs) are done for Korean and Korean-English code-switching ASR tasks, respectively. Sequence-to-sequence learning with sub-words based on Korean syllables (and sub-words in English) performs the best for both tasks without lexicon and an extra language model integration."
L2RS: A Learning-to-Rescore Mechanism for Automatic Speech Recognition,"Modern Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems primarily rely on scores from an Acoustic Model (AM) and a Language Model (LM) to rescore the N-best lists. With the abundance of recent natural language processing advances, the information utilized by current ASR for evaluating the linguistic and semantic legitimacy of the N-best hypotheses is rather limited. In this paper, we propose a novel Learning-to-Rescore (L2RS) mechanism, which is specialized for utilizing a wide range of textual information from the state-of-the-art NLP models and automatically deciding their weights to rescore the N-best lists for ASR systems. Specifically, we incorporate features including BERT sentence embedding, topic vector, and perplexity scores produced by n-gram LM, topic modeling LM, BERT LM and RNNLM to train a rescoring model. We conduct extensive experiments based on a public dataset, and experimental results show that L2RS outperforms not only traditional rescoring methods but also its deep neural network counterparts by a substantial improvement of 20.67% in terms of NDCG@10. L2RS paves the way for developing more effective rescoring models for ASR."
Pre-training in Deep Reinforcement Learning for Automatic Speech Recognition,"Deep reinforcement learning (deep RL) is a combination of deep learning with reinforcement learning principles to create efficient methods that can learn by interacting with its environment. This led to breakthroughs in many complex tasks that were previously difficult to solve. However, deep RL requires a large amount of training time that makes it difficult to use in various real-life applications like human-computer interaction (HCI). Therefore, in this paper, we study pre-training in deep RL to reduce the training time and improve the performance in speech recognition, a popular application of HCI. We achieve significantly improved performance in less time on a publicly available speech command recognition dataset."
Speech Emotion Recognition via Contrastive Loss under Siamese Networks,"Speech emotion recognition is an important aspect of human-computer interaction. Prior work proposes various end-to-end models to improve the classification performance. However, most of them rely on the cross-entropy loss together with softmax as the supervision component, which does not explicitly encourage discriminative learning of features. In this paper, we introduce the contrastive loss function to encourage intra-class compactness and inter-class separability between learnable features. Furthermore, multiple feature selection methods and pairwise sample selection methods are evaluated. To verify the performance of the proposed system, we conduct experiments on The Interactive Emotional Dyadic Motion Capture (IEMOCAP) database, a common evaluation corpus. Experimental results reveal the advantages of the proposed method, which reaches 62.19% in the weighted accuracy and 63.21% in the unweighted accuracy. It outperforms the baseline system that is optimized without the contrastive loss function with 1.14% and 2.55% in the weighted accuracy and the unweighted accuracy, respectively."
Low-frequency Compensated Synthetic Impulse Responses for Improved Far-field Speech Recognition,"We propose a method for generating low-frequency compensated synthetic impulse responses that improve the performance of far-field speech recognition systems trained on artificially augmented datasets. We design linear-phase filters that adapt the simulated impulse responses to equalization distributions corresponding to real-world captured impulse responses. Our filtered synthetic impulse responses are then used to augment clean speech data from LibriSpeech dataset [1]. We evaluate the performance of our method on the real-world LibriSpeech test set. In practice, our low-frequency compensated synthetic dataset can reduce the word-error-rate by up to 8.8% for far-field speech recognition."
Correction of Automatic Speech Recognition with Transformer Sequence-to-sequence Model,"In this work, we introduce a simple yet efficient post-processing model for automatic speech recognition (ASR). Our model has Transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture which ""translates"" ASR model output into grammatically and semantically correct text. We investigate different strategies for regularizing and optimizing the model and show that extensive data augmentation and the initialization with pre-trained weights are required to achieve good performance. On the LibriSpeech benchmark, our method demonstrates significant improvement in word error rate over the baseline acoustic model with greedy decoding, especially on much noisier dev-other and test-other portions of the evaluation dataset. Our model also outperforms baseline with 6-gram language model re-scoring and approaches the performance of re-scoring with Transformer-XL neural language model."
A practical two-stage training strategy for multi-stream end-to-end speech recognition,"The multi-stream paradigm of audio processing, in which several sources are simultaneously considered, has been an active research area for information fusion. Our previous study offered a promising direction within end-to-end automatic speech recognition, where parallel encoders aim to capture diverse information followed by a stream-level fusion based on attention mechanisms to combine the different views. However, with an increasing number of streams resulting in an increasing number of encoders, the previous approach could require substantial memory and massive amounts of parallel data for joint training. In this work, we propose a practical two-stage training scheme. Stage-1 is to train a Universal Feature Extractor (UFE), where encoder outputs are produced from a single-stream model trained with all data. Stage-2 formulates a multi-stream scheme intending to solely train the attention fusion module using the UFE features and pretrained components from Stage-1. Experiments have been conducted on two datasets, DIRHA and AMI, as a multi-stream scenario. Compared with our previous method, this strategy achieves relative word error rate reductions of 8.2--32.4%, while consistently outperforming several conventional combination methods."
GPU-Accelerated Viterbi Exact Lattice Decoder for Batched Online and Offline Speech Recognition,"We present an optimized weighted finite-state transducer (WFST) decoder capable of online streaming and offline batch processing of audio using Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). The decoder is efficient in memory utilization, input/output (I/O) bandwidth, and uses a novel Viterbi implementation designed to maximize parallelism. The reduced memory footprint allows the decoder to process significantly larger graphs than previously possible, while optimizing I/O increases the number of simultaneous streams supported. GPU preprocessing of lattice segments enables intermediate lattice results to be returned to the requestor during streaming inference. Collectively, the proposed algorithm yields up to a 240x speedup over single core CPU decoding, and up to 40x faster decoding than the current state-of-the-art GPU decoder, while returning equivalent results. This decoder design enables deployment of production-grade ASR models on a large spectrum of systems, ranging from large data center servers to low-power edge devices."
Adversarial Example Detection by Classification for Deep Speech Recognition,"Machine Learning systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks and will highly likely produce incorrect outputs under these attacks. There are white-box and black-box attacks regarding to adversary's access level to the victim learning algorithm. To defend the learning systems from these attacks, existing methods in the speech domain focus on modifying input signals and testing the behaviours of speech recognizers. We, however, formulate the defense as a classification problem and present a strategy for systematically generating adversarial example datasets: one for white-box attacks and one for black-box attacks, containing both adversarial and normal examples. The white-box attack is a gradient-based method on Baidu DeepSpeech with the Mozilla Common Voice database while the black-box attack is a gradient-free method on a deep model-based keyword spotting system with the Google Speech Command dataset. The generated datasets are used to train a proposed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), together with cepstral features, to detect adversarial examples. Experimental results show that, it is possible to accurately distinct between adversarial and normal examples for known attacks, in both single-condition and multi-condition training settings, while the performance degrades dramatically for unknown attacks. The adversarial datasets and the source code are made publicly available."
Improving Transformer-based Speech Recognition Using Unsupervised Pre-training,"Speech recognition technologies are gaining enormous popularity in various industrial applications. However, building a good speech recognition system usually requires large amounts of transcribed data, which is expensive to collect. To tackle this problem, an unsupervised pre-training method called Masked Predictive Coding is proposed, which can be applied for unsupervised pre-training with Transformer based model. Experiments on HKUST show that using the same training data, we can achieve CER 23.3%, exceeding the best end-to-end model by over 0.2% absolute CER. With more pre-training data, we can further reduce the CER to 21.0%, or a 11.8% relative CER reduction over baseline."
Transformer-based Acoustic Modeling for Hybrid Speech Recognition,"We propose and evaluate transformer-based acoustic models (AMs) for hybrid speech recognition. Several modeling choices are discussed in this work, including various positional embedding methods and an iterated loss to enable training deep transformers. We also present a preliminary study of using limited right context in transformer models, which makes it possible for streaming applications. We demonstrate that on the widely used Librispeech benchmark, our transformer-based AM outperforms the best published hybrid result by 19% to 26% relative when the standard n-gram language model (LM) is used. Combined with neural network LM for rescoring, our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results on Librispeech. Our findings are also confirmed on a much larger internal dataset."
Speech Emotion Recognition with Dual-Sequence LSTM Architecture,"Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) has emerged as a critical component of the next generation human-machine interfacing technologies. In this work, we propose a new dual-level model that predicts emotions based on both MFCC features and mel-spectrograms produced from raw audio signals. Each utterance is preprocessed into MFCC features and two mel-spectrograms at different time-frequency resolutions. A standard LSTM processes the MFCC features, while a novel LSTM architecture, denoted as Dual-Sequence LSTM (DS-LSTM), processes the two mel-spectrograms simultaneously. The outputs are later averaged to produce a final classification of the utterance. Our proposed model achieves, on average, a weighted accuracy of 72.7% and an unweighted accuracy of 73.3%---a 6% improvement over current state-of-the-art unimodal models---and is comparable with multimodal models that leverage textual information as well as audio signals."
End-to-End Speech Recognition: A review for the French Language,"Recently, end-to-end ASR based either on sequence-to-sequence networks or on the CTC objective function gained a lot of interest from the community, achieving competitive results over traditional systems using robust but complex pipelines. One of the main features of end-to-end systems, in addition to the ability to free themselves from extra linguistic resources such as dictionaries or language models, is the capacity to model acoustic units such as characters, subwords or directly words; opening up the capacity to directly translate speech with different representations or levels of knowledge depending on the target language. In this paper we propose a review of the existing end-to-end ASR approaches for the French language. We compare results to conventional state-of-the-art ASR systems and discuss which units are more suited to model the French language."
LibriVoxDeEn: A Corpus for German-to-English Speech Translation and German Speech Recognition,"We present a corpus of sentence-aligned triples of German audio, German text, and English translation, based on German audiobooks. The speech translation data consist of 110 hours of audio material aligned to over 50k parallel sentences. An even larger dataset comprising 547 hours of German speech aligned to German text is available for speech recognition. The audio data is read speech and thus low in disfluencies. The quality of audio and sentence alignments has been checked by a manual evaluation, showing that speech alignment quality is in general very high. The sentence alignment quality is comparable to well-used parallel translation data and can be adjusted by cutoffs on the automatic alignment score. To our knowledge, this corpus is to date the largest resource for German speech recognition and for end-to-end German-to-English speech translation."
Lead2Gold: Towards exploiting the full potential of noisy transcriptions for speech recognition,"The transcriptions used to train an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system may contain errors. Usually, either a quality control stage discards transcriptions with too many errors, or the noisy transcriptions are used as is. We introduce Lead2Gold, a method to train an ASR system that exploits the full potential of noisy transcriptions. Based on a noise model of transcription errors, Lead2Gold searches for better transcriptions of the training data with a beam search that takes this noise model into account. The beam search is differentiable and does not require a forced alignment step, thus the whole system is trained end-to-end. Lead2Gold can be viewed as a new loss function that can be used on top of any sequence-to-sequence deep neural network. We conduct proof-of-concept experiments on noisy transcriptions generated from letter corruptions with different noise levels. We show that Lead2Gold obtains a better ASR accuracy than a competitive baseline which does not account for the (artificially-introduced) transcription noise."
Analyzing Large Receptive Field Convolutional Networks for Distant Speech Recognition,"Despite significant efforts over the last few years to build a robust automatic speech recognition (ASR) system for different acoustic settings, the performance of the current state-of-the-art technologies significantly degrades in noisy reverberant environments.  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been successfully used to achieve substantial improvements in many speech processing applications including distant speech recognition (DSR). However, standard CNN architectures were not efficient in capturing long-term speech dynamics, which are essential in the design of a robust DSR system. In the present study, we address this issue by investigating variants of large receptive field CNNs (LRF-CNNs) which include deeply recursive networks, dilated convolutional neural networks, and stacked hourglass networks. To compare the efficacy of the aforementioned architectures with the standard CNN for Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus, we use a hybrid DNN-HMM based speech recognition system. We extend the study to evaluate the system performances for distant speech simulated using realistic room impulse responses (RIRs). Our experiments show that with fixed number of parameters across all architectures, the large receptive field networks show consistent improvements over the standard CNNs for distant speech. Amongst the explored LRF-CNNs, stacked hourglass network has shown improvements with a 8.9% relative reduction in word error rate (WER) and 10.7% relative improvement in frame accuracy compared to the standard CNNs for distant simulated speech signals."
MIMO-SPEECH: End-to-End Multi-Channel Multi-Speaker Speech Recognition,"Recently, the end-to-end approach has proven its efficacy in monaural multi-speaker speech recognition. However, high word error rates (WERs) still prevent these systems from being used in practical applications. On the other hand, the spatial information in multi-channel signals has proven helpful in far-field speech recognition tasks. In this work, we propose a novel neural sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) architecture, MIMO-Speech, which extends the original seq2seq to deal with multi-channel input and multi-channel output so that it can fully model multi-channel multi-speaker speech separation and recognition. MIMO-Speech is a fully neural end-to-end framework, which is optimized only via an ASR criterion. It is comprised of: 1) a monaural masking network, 2) a multi-source neural beamformer, and 3) a multi-output speech recognition model. With this processing, the input overlapped speech is directly mapped to text sequences. We further adopted a curriculum learning strategy, making the best use of the training set to improve the performance. The experiments on the spatialized wsj1-2mix corpus show that our model can achieve more than 60% WER reduction compared to the single-channel system with high quality enhanced signals (SI-SDR = 23.1 dB) obtained by the above separation function."
VAIS ASR: Building a conversational speech recognition system using language model combination,"Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems have been evolving quickly and reaching human parity in certain cases. The systems usually perform pretty well on reading style and clean speech, however, most of the available systems suffer from situation where the speaking style is conversation and in noisy environments. It is not straight-forward to tackle such problems due to difficulties in data collection for both speech and text. In this paper, we attempt to mitigate the problems using language models combination techniques that allows us to utilize both large amount of writing style text and small number of conversation text data. Evaluation on the VLSP 2019 ASR challenges showed that our system achieved 4.85% WER on the VLSP 2018 and 15.09% WER on the VLSP 2019 data sets."
"Hear ""No Evil"", See ""Kenansville"": Efficient and Transferable Black-Box Attacks on Speech Recognition and Voice Identification Systems","Automatic speech recognition and voice identification systems are being deployed in a wide array of applications, from providing control mechanisms to devices lacking traditional interfaces, to the automatic transcription of conversations and authentication of users. Many of these applications have significant security and privacy considerations. We develop attacks that force mistranscription and misidentification in state of the art systems, with minimal impact on human comprehension. Processing pipelines for modern systems are comprised of signal preprocessing and feature extraction steps, whose output is fed to a machine-learned model. Prior work has focused on the models, using white-box knowledge to tailor model-specific attacks. We focus on the pipeline stages before the models, which (unlike the models) are quite similar across systems. As such, our attacks are black-box and transferable, and demonstrably achieve mistranscription and misidentification rates as high as 100% by modifying only a few frames of audio. We perform a study via Amazon Mechanical Turk demonstrating that there is no statistically significant difference between human perception of regular and perturbed audio. Our findings suggest that models may learn aspects of speech that are generally not perceived by human subjects, but that are crucial for model accuracy. We also find that certain English language phonemes (in particular, vowels) are significantly more susceptible to our attack. We show that the attacks are effective when mounted over cellular networks, where signals are subject to degradation due to transcoding, jitter, and packet loss."
SNDCNN: Self-normalizing deep CNNs with scaled exponential linear units for speech recognition,"Very deep CNNs achieve state-of-the-art results in both computer vision and speech recognition, but are difficult to train. The most popular way to train very deep CNNs is to use shortcut connections (SC) together with batch normalization (BN). Inspired by Self- Normalizing Neural Networks, we propose the self-normalizing deep CNN (SNDCNN) based acoustic model topology, by removing the SC/BN and replacing the typical RELU activations with scaled exponential linear unit (SELU) in ResNet-50. SELU activations make the network self-normalizing and remove the need for both shortcut connections and batch normalization. Compared to ResNet- 50, we can achieve the same or lower (up to 4.5% relative) word error rate (WER) while boosting both training and inference speed by 60%-80%. We also explore other model inference optimization schemes to further reduce latency for production use."
From Senones to Chenones: Tied Context-Dependent Graphemes for Hybrid Speech Recognition,"There is an implicit assumption that traditional hybrid approaches for automatic speech recognition (ASR) cannot directly model graphemes and need to rely on phonetic lexicons to get competitive performance, especially on English which has poor grapheme-phoneme correspondence. In this work, we show for the first time that, on English, hybrid ASR systems can in fact model graphemes effectively by leveraging tied context-dependent graphemes, i.e., chenones. Our chenone-based systems significantly outperform equivalent senone baselines by 4.5% to 11.1% relative on three different English datasets. Our results on Librispeech are state-of-the-art compared to other hybrid approaches and competitive with previously published end-to-end numbers. Further analysis shows that chenones can better utilize powerful acoustic models and large training data, and require context- and position-dependent modeling to work well. Chenone-based systems also outperform senone baselines on proper noun and rare word recognition, an area where the latter is traditionally thought to have an advantage. Our work provides an alternative for end-to-end ASR and establishes that hybrid systems can be improved by dropping the reliance on phonetic knowledge."
Neural Zero-Inflated Quality Estimation Model For Automatic Speech Recognition System,"The performances of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems are usually evaluated by the metric word error rate (WER) when the manually transcribed data are provided, which are, however, expensively available in the real scenario. In addition, the empirical distribution of WER for most ASR systems usually tends to put a significant mass near zero, making it difficult to simulate with a single continuous distribution. In order to address the two issues of ASR quality estimation (QE), we propose a novel neural zero-inflated model to predict the WER of the ASR result without transcripts. We design a neural zero-inflated beta regression on top of a bidirectional transformer language model conditional on speech features (speech-BERT). We adopt the pre-training strategy of token level mask language modeling for speech-BERT as well, and further fine-tune with our zero-inflated layer for the mixture of discrete and continuous outputs. The experimental results show that our approach achieves better performance on WER prediction in the metrics of Pearson and MAE, compared with most existed quality estimation algorithms for ASR or machine translation."
State-of-the-Art Speech Recognition Using Multi-Stream Self-Attention With Dilated 1D Convolutions,"Self-attention has been a huge success for many downstream tasks in NLP, which led to exploration of applying self-attention to speech problems as well. The efficacy of self-attention in speech applications, however, seems not fully blown yet since it is challenging to handle highly correlated speech frames in the context of self-attention. In this paper we propose a new neural network model architecture, namely multi-stream self-attention, to address the issue thus make the self-attention mechanism more effective for speech recognition. The proposed model architecture consists of parallel streams of self-attention encoders, and each stream has layers of 1D convolutions with dilated kernels whose dilation rates are unique given stream, followed by a self-attention layer. The self-attention mechanism in each stream pays attention to only one resolution of input speech frames and the attentive computation can be more efficient. In a later stage, outputs from all the streams are concatenated then linearly projected to the final embedding. By stacking the proposed multi-stream self-attention encoder blocks and rescoring the resultant lattices with neural network language models, we achieve the word error rate of 2.2% on the test-clean dataset of the LibriSpeech corpus, the best number reported thus far on the dataset."
Domain Expansion in DNN-based Acoustic Models for Robust Speech Recognition,"Training acoustic models with sequentially incoming data -- while both leveraging new data and avoiding the forgetting effect-- is an essential obstacle to achieving human intelligence level in speech recognition. An obvious approach to leverage data from a new domain (e.g., new accented speech) is to first generate a comprehensive dataset of all domains, by combining all available data, and then use this dataset to retrain the acoustic models. However, as the amount of training data grows, storing and retraining on such a large-scale dataset becomes practically impossible. To deal with this problem, in this study, we study several domain expansion techniques which exploit only the data of the new domain to build a stronger model for all domains. These techniques are aimed at learning the new domain with a minimal forgetting effect (i.e., they maintain original model performance). These techniques modify the adaptation procedure by imposing new constraints including (1) weight constraint adaptation (WCA): keeping the model parameters close to the original model parameters; (2) elastic weight consolidation (EWC): slowing down training for parameters that are important for previously established domains; (3) soft KL-divergence (SKLD): restricting the KL-divergence between the original and the adapted model output distributions; and (4) hybrid SKLD-EWC: incorporating both SKLD and EWC constraints. We evaluate these techniques in an accent adaptation task in which we adapt a deep neural network (DNN) acoustic model trained with native English to three different English accents: Australian, Hispanic, and Indian. The experimental results show that SKLD significantly outperforms EWC, and EWC works better than WCA. The hybrid SKLD-EWC technique results in the best overall performance."
Self-Attention Transducers for End-to-End Speech Recognition,"Recurrent neural network transducers (RNN-T) have been successfully applied in end-to-end speech recognition. However, the recurrent structure makes it difficult for parallelization . In this paper, we propose a self-attention transducer (SA-T) for speech recognition. RNNs are replaced with self-attention blocks, which are powerful to model long-term dependencies inside sequences and able to be efficiently parallelized. Furthermore, a path-aware regularization is proposed to assist SA-T to learn alignments and improve the performance. Additionally, a chunk-flow mechanism is utilized to achieve online decoding. All experiments are conducted on a Mandarin Chinese dataset AISHELL-1. The results demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves a 21.3% relative reduction in character error rate compared with the baseline RNN-T. In addition, the SA-T with chunk-flow mechanism can perform online decoding with only a little degradation of the performance."
Improving RNN Transducer Modeling for End-to-End Speech Recognition,"In the last few years, an emerging trend in automatic speech recognition research is the study of end-to-end (E2E) systems. Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC), Attention Encoder-Decoder (AED), and RNN Transducer (RNN-T) are the most popular three methods. Among these three methods, RNN-T has the advantages to do online streaming which is challenging to AED and it doesn't have CTC's frame-independence assumption. In this paper, we improve the RNN-T training in two aspects. First, we optimize the training algorithm of RNN-T to reduce the memory consumption so that we can have larger training minibatch for faster training speed. Second, we propose better model structures so that we obtain RNN-T models with the very good accuracy but small footprint. Trained with 30 thousand hours anonymized and transcribed Microsoft production data, the best RNN-T model with even smaller model size (216 Megabytes) achieves up-to 11.8% relative word error rate (WER) reduction from the baseline RNN-T model. This best RNN-T model is significantly better than the device hybrid model with similar size by achieving up-to 15.0% relative WER reduction, and obtains similar WERs as the server hybrid model of 5120 Megabytes in size."
Optimizing Speech Recognition For The Edge,"While most deployed speech recognition systems today still run on servers, we are in the midst of a transition towards deployments on edge devices. This leap to the edge is powered by the progression from traditional speech recognition pipelines to end-to-end (E2E) neural architectures, and the parallel development of more efficient neural network topologies and optimization techniques. Thus, we are now able to create highly accurate speech recognizers that are both small and fast enough to execute on typical mobile devices. In this paper, we begin with a baseline RNN-Transducer architecture comprised of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers. We then experiment with a variety of more computationally efficient layer types, as well as apply optimization techniques like neural connection pruning and parameter quantization to construct a small, high quality, on-device speech recognizer that is an order of magnitude smaller than the baseline system without any optimizations."
Speech Recognition with Augmented Synthesized Speech,"Recent success of the Tacotron speech synthesis architecture and its variants in producing natural sounding multi-speaker synthesized speech has raised the exciting possibility of replacing expensive, manually transcribed, domain-specific, human speech that is used to train speech recognizers. The multi-speaker speech synthesis architecture can learn latent embedding spaces of prosody, speaker and style variations derived from input acoustic representations thereby allowing for manipulation of the synthesized speech. In this paper, we evaluate the feasibility of enhancing speech recognition performance using speech synthesis using two corpora from different domains. We explore algorithms to provide the necessary acoustic and lexical diversity needed for robust speech recognition. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of this approach as a data augmentation strategy for domain-transfer.  We find that improvements to speech recognition performance is achievable by augmenting training data with synthesized material. However, there remains a substantial gap in performance between recognizers trained on human speech those trained on synthesized speech."
Self-Training for End-to-End Speech Recognition,"We revisit self-training in the context of end-to-end speech recognition. We demonstrate that training with pseudo-labels can substantially improve the accuracy of a baseline model. Key to our approach are a strong baseline acoustic and language model used to generate the pseudo-labels, filtering mechanisms tailored to common errors from sequence-to-sequence models, and a novel ensemble approach to increase pseudo-label diversity. Experiments on the LibriSpeech corpus show that with an ensemble of four models and label filtering, self-training yields a 33.9% relative improvement in WER compared with a baseline trained on 100 hours of labelled data in the noisy speech setting. In the clean speech setting, self-training recovers 59.3% of the gap between the baseline and an oracle model, which is at least 93.8% relatively higher than what previous approaches can achieve."
Espresso: A Fast End-to-end Neural Speech Recognition Toolkit,"We present Espresso, an open-source, modular, extensible end-to-end neural automatic speech recognition (ASR) toolkit based on the deep learning library PyTorch and the popular neural machine translation toolkit fairseq. Espresso supports distributed training across GPUs and computing nodes, and features various decoding approaches commonly employed in ASR, including look-ahead word-based language model fusion, for which a fast, parallelized decoder is implemented. Espresso achieves state-of-the-art ASR performance on the WSJ, LibriSpeech, and Switchboard data sets among other end-to-end systems without data augmentation, and is 4--11x faster for decoding than similar systems (e.g. ESPnet)."
"Word Recognition, Competition, and Activation in a Model of Visually Grounded Speech","In this paper, we study how word-like units are represented and activated in a recurrent neural model of visually grounded speech. The model used in our experiments is trained to project an image and its spoken description in a common representation space. We show that a recurrent model trained on spoken sentences implicitly segments its input into word-like units and reliably maps them to their correct visual referents. We introduce a methodology originating from linguistics to analyse the representation learned by neural networks -- the gating paradigm -- and show that the correct representation of a word is only activated if the network has access to first phoneme of the target word, suggesting that the network does not rely on a global acoustic pattern. Furthermore, we find out that not all speech frames (MFCC vectors in our case) play an equal role in the final encoded representation of a given word, but that some frames have a crucial effect on it. Finally, we suggest that word representation could be activated through a process of lexical competition."
Simultaneous Speech Recognition and Speaker Diarization for Monaural Dialogue Recordings with Target-Speaker Acoustic Models,"This paper investigates the use of target-speaker automatic speech recognition (TS-ASR) for simultaneous speech recognition and speaker diarization of single-channel dialogue recordings. TS-ASR is a technique to automatically extract and recognize only the speech of a target speaker given a short sample utterance of that speaker. One obvious drawback of TS-ASR is that it cannot be used when the speakers in the recordings are unknown because it requires a sample of the target speakers in advance of decoding. To remove this limitation, we propose an iterative method, in which (i) the estimation of speaker embeddings and (ii) TS-ASR based on the estimated speaker embeddings are alternately executed. We evaluated the proposed method by using very challenging dialogue recordings in which the speaker overlap ratio was over 20%. We confirmed that the proposed method significantly reduced both the word error rate (WER) and diarization error rate (DER). Our proposed method combined with i-vector speaker embeddings ultimately achieved a WER that differed by only 2.1 % from that of TS-ASR given oracle speaker embeddings. Furthermore, our method can solve speaker diarization simultaneously as a by-product and achieved better DER than that of the conventional clustering-based speaker diarization method based on i-vector."
MFCC-based Recurrent Neural Network for Automatic Clinical Depression Recognition and Assessment from Speech,"Clinical depression or Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a common and serious medical illness. In this paper, a deep recurrent neural network-based framework is presented to detect depression and to predict its severity level from speech. Low-level and high-level audio features are extracted from audio recordings to predict the 24 scores of the Patient Health Questionnaire and the binary class of depression diagnosis. To overcome the problem of the small size of Speech Depression Recognition (SDR) datasets, expanding training labels and transferred features are considered. The proposed approach outperforms the state-of-art approaches on the DAIC-WOZ database with an overall accuracy of 76.27% and a root mean square error of 0.4 in assessing depression, while a root mean square error of 0.168 is achieved in predicting the depression severity levels. The proposed framework has several advantages (fastness, non-invasiveness, and non-intrusion), which makes it convenient for real-time applications. The performances of the proposed approach are evaluated under a multi-modal and a multi-features experiments. MFCC based high-level features hold relevant information related to depression. Yet, adding visual action units and different other acoustic features further boosts the classification results by 20% and 10% to reach an accuracy of 95.6% and 86%, respectively. Considering visual-facial modality needs to be carefully studied as it sparks patient privacy concerns while adding more acoustic features increases the computation time."
An Investigation Into On-device Personalization of End-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition Models,"Speaker-independent speech recognition systems trained with data from many users are generally robust against speaker variability and work well for a large population of speakers. However, these systems do not always generalize well for users with very different speech characteristics. This issue can be addressed by building personalized systems that are designed to work well for each specific user. In this paper, we investigate the idea of securely training personalized end-to-end speech recognition models on mobile devices so that user data and models never leave the device and are never stored on a server. We study how the mobile training environment impacts performance by simulating on-device data consumption. We conduct experiments using data collected from speech impaired users for personalization. Our results show that personalization achieved 63.7\% relative word error rate reduction when trained in a server environment and 58.1% in a mobile environment. Moving to on-device personalization resulted in 18.7% performance degradation, in exchange for improved scalability and data privacy. To train the model on device, we split the gradient computation into two and achieved 45% memory reduction at the expense of 42% increase in training time."
Integrating Source-channel and Attention-based Sequence-to-sequence Models for Speech Recognition,"This paper proposes a novel automatic speech recognition (ASR) framework called Integrated Source-Channel and Attention (ISCA) that combines the advantages of traditional systems based on the noisy source-channel model (SC) and end-to-end style systems using attention-based sequence-to-sequence models. The traditional SC system framework includes hidden Markov models and connectionist temporal classification (CTC) based acoustic models, language models (LMs), and a decoding procedure based on a lexicon, whereas the end-to-end style attention-based system jointly models the whole process with a single model. By rescoring the hypotheses produced by traditional systems using end-to-end style systems based on an extended noisy source-channel model, ISCA allows structured knowledge to be easily incorporated via the SC-based model while exploiting the complementarity of the attention-based model. Experiments on the AMI meeting corpus show that ISCA is able to give a relative word error rate reduction up to 21% over an individual system, and by 13% over an alternative method which also involves combining CTC and attention-based models."
Learning Alignment for Multimodal Emotion Recognition from Speech,"Speech emotion recognition is a challenging problem because human convey emotions in subtle and complex ways. For emotion recognition on human speech, one can either extract emotion related features from audio signals or employ speech recognition techniques to generate text from speech and then apply natural language processing to analyze the sentiment. Further, emotion recognition will be beneficial from using audio-textual multimodal information, it is not trivial to build a system to learn from multimodality. One can build models for two input sources separately and combine them in a decision level, but this method ignores the interaction between speech and text in the temporal domain. In this paper, we propose to use an attention mechanism to learn the alignment between speech frames and text words, aiming to produce more accurate multimodal feature representations. The aligned multimodal features are fed into a sequential model for emotion recognition. We evaluate the approach on the IEMOCAP dataset and the experimental results show the proposed approach achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the dataset."
Large-Scale Multilingual Speech Recognition with a Streaming End-to-End Model,"Multilingual end-to-end (E2E) models have shown great promise in expansion of automatic speech recognition (ASR) coverage of the world's languages. They have shown improvement over monolingual systems, and have simplified training and serving by eliminating language-specific acoustic, pronunciation, and language models. This work presents an E2E multilingual system which is equipped to operate in low-latency interactive applications, as well as handle a key challenge of real world data: the imbalance in training data across languages. Using nine Indic languages, we compare a variety of techniques, and find that a combination of conditioning on a language vector and training language-specific adapter layers produces the best model. The resulting E2E multilingual model achieves a lower word error rate (WER) than both monolingual E2E models (eight of nine languages) and monolingual conventional systems (all nine languages)."
Automatic Speech Recognition Services: Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing Usability,"Nowadays, speech is becoming a more common, if not standard, interface to technology. This can be seen in the trend of technology changes over the years. Increasingly, voice is used to control programs, appliances and personal devices within homes, cars, workplaces, and public spaces through smartphones and home assistant devices using Amazon's Alexa, Google's Assistant and Apple's Siri, and other proliferating technologies. However, most speech interfaces are not accessible for Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (DHH) people. In this paper, performances of current Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) with voices of DHH speakers are evaluated. ASR has improved over the years, and is able to reach Word Error Rates (WER) as low as 5-6% [1][2][3], with the help of cloud-computing and machine learning algorithms that take in custom vocabulary models. In this paper, a custom vocabulary model is used, and the significance of the improvement is evaluated when using DHH speech."
Towards Multimodal Emotion Recognition in German Speech Events in Cars using Transfer Learning,"The recognition of emotions by humans is a complex process which considers multiple interacting signals such as facial expressions and both prosody and semantic content of utterances. Commonly, research on automatic recognition of emotions is, with few exceptions, limited to one modality. We describe an in-car experiment for emotion recognition from speech interactions for three modalities: the audio signal of a spoken interaction, the visual signal of the driver's face, and the manually transcribed content of utterances of the driver. We use off-the-shelf tools for emotion detection in audio and face and compare that to a neural transfer learning approach for emotion recognition from text which utilizes existing resources from other domains. We see that transfer learning enables models based on out-of-domain corpora to perform well. This method contributes up to 10 percentage points in F1, with up to 76 micro-average F1 across the emotions joy, annoyance and insecurity. Our findings also indicate that off-the-shelf-tools analyzing face and audio are not ready yet for emotion detection in in-car speech interactions without further adjustments."
Bandwidth Embeddings for Mixed-bandwidth Speech Recognition,"In this paper, we tackle the problem of handling narrowband and wideband speech by building a single acoustic model (AM), also called mixed bandwidth AM. In the proposed approach, an auxiliary input feature is used to provide the bandwidth information to the model, and bandwidth embeddings are jointly learned as part of acoustic model training. Experimental evaluations show that using bandwidth embeddings helps the model to handle the variability of the narrow and wideband speech, and makes it possible to train a mixed-bandwidth AM. Furthermore, we propose to use parallel convolutional layers to handle the mismatch between the narrow and wideband speech better, where separate convolution layers are used for each type of input speech signal. Our best system achieves 13% relative improvement on narrowband speech, while not degrading on wideband speech."
Multiresolution analysis (discrete wavelet transform) through Daubechies family for emotion recognition in speech,"We propose a study of the mathematical properties of voice as an audio signal. This work includes signals in which the channel conditions are not ideal for emotion recognition. Multiresolution analysis discrete wavelet transform was performed through the use of Daubechies Wavelet Family (Db1-Haar, Db 6, Db8, Db10) allowing the decomposition of the initial audio signal into sets of coefficients on which a set of features was extracted and analyzed statistically in order to differentiate emotional states. ANNs proved to be a system that allows an appropriate classification of such states. This study shows that the extracted features using wavelet decomposition are enough to analyze and extract emotional content in audio signals presenting a high accuracy rate in classification of emotional states without the need to use other kinds of classical frequency-time features. Accordingly, this paper seeks to characterize mathematically the six basic emotions in humans: boredom, disgust, happiness, anxiety, anger and sadness, also included the neutrality, for a total of seven states to identify."
"Deaf, Hard of Hearing, and Hearing Perspectives on using Automatic Speech Recognition in Conversation","Many personal devices have transitioned from visual-controlled interfaces to speech-controlled interfaces to reduce costs and interactive friction, supported by the rapid growth in capabilities of speech-controlled interfaces, e.g., Amazon Echo or Apple's Siri. A consequence is that people who are deaf or hard of hearing (DHH) may be unable to use these speech-controlled devices. We show that deaf speech has a high error rate compared to hearing speech, in commercial speech-controlled interfaces. Deaf speech had approximately a 78% word error rate (WER) compared to a hearing speech 18% WER. Our findings show that current speech-controlled interfaces are not usable by DHH people. Based on our findings, significant advances in speech recognition software or alternative approaches will be needed for deaf use of speech-controlled interfaces. We show that current speech-controlled interfaces are not usable by DHH people."
Feasibility of Using Automatic Speech Recognition with Voices of Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing Individuals,"Many personal devices have transitioned from visual-controlled interfaces to speech-controlled interfaces to reduce device costs and interactive friction. This transition has been hastened by the increasing capabilities of speech-controlled interfaces, e.g., Amazon Echo or Apple's Siri. A consequence is that people who are deaf or hard of hearing (DHH) may be unable to use these speech-controlled devices. We show that deaf speech has a high error rate compared to hearing speech, in commercial speech-controlled interfaces. Deaf speech had approximately a 78% word error rate (WER) compared to a hearing speech 18% WER. Our findings show that current speech-controlled interfaces are not usable by deaf and hard of hearing people. Therefore, it might be wise to pursue other methods for deaf persons to deliver natural commands to computers."
Two-Pass End-to-End Speech Recognition,"The requirements for many applications of state-of-the-art speech recognition systems include not only low word error rate (WER) but also low latency. Specifically, for many use-cases, the system must be able to decode utterances in a streaming fashion and faster than real-time. Recently, a streaming recurrent neural network transducer (RNN-T) end-to-end (E2E) model has shown to be a good candidate for on-device speech recognition, with improved WER and latency metrics compared to conventional on-device models [1]. However, this model still lags behind a large state-of-the-art conventional model in quality [2]. On the other hand, a non-streaming E2E Listen, Attend and Spell (LAS) model has shown comparable quality to large conventional models [3]. This work aims to bring the quality of an E2E streaming model closer to that of a conventional system by incorporating a LAS network as a second-pass component, while still abiding by latency constraints. Our proposed two-pass model achieves a 17%-22% relative reduction in WER compared to RNN-T alone and increases latency by a small fraction over RNN-T."
Towards Better Understanding of Spontaneous Conversations: Overcoming Automatic Speech Recognition Errors With Intent Recognition,"In this paper, we present a method for correcting automatic speech recognition (ASR) errors using a finite state transducer (FST) intent recognition framework. Intent recognition is a powerful technique for dialog flow management in turn-oriented, human-machine dialogs. This technique can also be very useful in the context of human-human dialogs, though it serves a different purpose of key insight extraction from conversations. We argue that currently available intent recognition techniques are not applicable to human-human dialogs due to the complex structure of turn-taking and various disfluencies encountered in spontaneous conversations, exacerbated by speech recognition errors and scarcity of domain-specific labeled data. Without efficient key insight extraction techniques, raw human-human dialog transcripts remain significantly unexploited.  Our contribution consists of a novel FST for intent indexing and an algorithm for fuzzy intent search over the lattice - a compact graph encoding of ASR's hypotheses. We also develop a pruning strategy to constrain the fuzziness of the FST index search. Extracted intents represent linguistic domain knowledge and help us improve (rescore) the original transcript. We compare our method with a baseline, which uses only the most likely transcript hypothesis (best path), and find an increase in the total number of recognized intents by 25%."
Two-Staged Acoustic Modeling Adaption for Robust Speech Recognition by the Example of German Oral History Interviews,"In automatic speech recognition, often little training data is available for specific challenging tasks, but training of state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition systems requires large amounts of annotated speech. To address this issue, we propose a two-staged approach to acoustic modeling that combines noise and reverberation data augmentation with transfer learning to robustly address challenges such as difficult acoustic recording conditions, spontaneous speech, and speech of elderly people. We evaluate our approach using the example of German oral history interviews, where a relative average reduction of the word error rate by 19.3% is achieved."
State-of-the-art Speech Recognition using EEG and Towards Decoding of Speech Spectrum From EEG,"In this paper we first demonstrate continuous noisy speech recognition using electroencephalography (EEG) signals on English vocabulary using different types of state of the art end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) models, we further provide results obtained using EEG data recorded under different experimental conditions. We finally demonstrate decoding of speech spectrum from EEG signals using a long short term memory (LSTM) based regression model and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based model. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using EEG signals for continuous noisy speech recognition under different experimental conditions and we provide preliminary results for synthesis of speech from EEG features."
Exploiting semi-supervised training through a dropout regularization in end-to-end speech recognition,"In this paper, we explore various approaches for semi supervised learning in an end to end automatic speech recognition (ASR) framework. The first step in our approach involves training a seed model on the limited amount of labelled data. Additional unlabelled speech data is employed through a data selection mechanism to obtain the best hypothesized output, further used to retrain the seed model. However, uncertainties of the model may not be well captured with a single hypothesis. As opposed to this technique, we apply a dropout mechanism to capture the uncertainty by obtaining multiple hypothesized text transcripts of an speech recording. We assume that the diversity of automatically generated transcripts for an utterance will implicitly increase the reliability of the model. Finally, the data selection process is also applied on these hypothesized transcripts to reduce the uncertainty. Experiments on freely available TEDLIUM corpus and proprietary Adobe's internal dataset show that the proposed approach significantly reduces ASR errors, compared to the baseline model."
End-to-End Multi-Speaker Speech Recognition using Speaker Embeddings and Transfer Learning,This paper presents our latest investigation on end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) for overlapped speech. We propose to train an end-to-end system conditioned on speaker embeddings and further improved by transfer learning from clean speech. This proposed framework does not require any parallel non-overlapped speech materials and is independent of the number of speakers. Our experimental results on overlapped speech datasets show that joint conditioning on speaker embeddings and transfer learning significantly improves the ASR performance.
Challenging the Boundaries of Speech Recognition: The MALACH Corpus,"There has been huge progress in speech recognition over the last several years. Tasks once thought extremely difficult, such as SWITCHBOARD, now approach levels of human performance. The MALACH corpus (LDC catalog LDC2012S05), a 375-Hour subset of a large archive of Holocaust testimonies collected by the Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation, presents significant challenges to the speech community. The collection consists of unconstrained, natural speech filled with disfluencies, heavy accents, age-related coarticulations, un-cued speaker and language switching, and emotional speech - all still open problems for speech recognition systems. Transcription is challenging even for skilled human annotators. This paper proposes that the community place focus on the MALACH corpus to develop speech recognition systems that are more robust with respect to accents, disfluencies and emotional speech. To reduce the barrier for entry, a lexicon and training and testing setups have been created and baseline results using current deep learning technologies are presented. The metadata has just been released by LDC (LDC2019S11). It is hoped that this resource will enable the community to build on top of these baselines so that the extremely important information in these and related oral histories becomes accessible to a wider audience."
Pitch-Synchronous Single Frequency Filtering Spectrogram for Speech Emotion Recognition,"Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are widely used for speech emotion recognition (SER). In such cases, the short time fourier transform (STFT) spectrogram is the most popular choice for representing speech, which is fed as input to the CNN. However, the uncertainty principles of the short-time Fourier transform prevent it from capturing time and frequency resolutions simultaneously. On the other hand, the recently proposed single frequency filtering (SFF) spectrogram promises to be a better alternative because it captures both time and frequency resolutions simultaneously. In this work, we explore the SFF spectrogram as an alternative representation of speech for SER. We have modified the SFF spectrogram by taking the average of the amplitudes of all the samples between two successive glottal closure instants (GCI) locations. The duration between two successive GCI locations gives the pitch, motivating us to name the modified SFF spectrogram as pitch-synchronous SFF spectrogram. The GCI locations were detected using zero frequency filtering approach. The proposed pitch-synchronous SFF spectrogram produced accuracy values of 63.95% (unweighted) and 70.4% (weighted) on the IEMOCAP dataset. These correspond to an improvement of +7.35% (unweighted) and +4.3% (weighted) over state-of-the-art result on the STFT sepctrogram using CNN. Specially, the proposed method recognized 22.7% of the happy emotion samples correctly, whereas this number was 0% for state-of-the-art results. These results also promise a much wider use of the proposed pitch-synchronous SFF spectrogram for other speech-based applications."
Fast and Accurate Capitalization and Punctuation for Automatic Speech Recognition Using Transformer and Chunk Merging,"In recent years, studies on automatic speech recognition (ASR) have shown outstanding results that reach human parity on short speech segments. However, there are still difficulties in standardizing the output of ASR such as capitalization and punctuation restoration for long-speech transcription. The problems obstruct readers to understand the ASR output semantically and also cause difficulties for natural language processing models such as NER, POS and semantic parsing. In this paper, we propose a method to restore the punctuation and capitalization for long-speech ASR transcription. The method is based on Transformer models and chunk merging that allows us to (1), build a single model that performs punctuation and capitalization in one go, and (2), perform decoding in parallel while improving the prediction accuracy. Experiments on British National Corpus showed that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and decoding speed."
Practical Speech Recognition with HTK,"The practical aspects of developing an Automatic Speech Recognition System (ASR) with HTK are reviewed. Steps are explained concerning hardware, software, libraries, applications and computer programs used. The common procedure to rapidly apply speech recognition system is summarized. The procedure is illustrated, to implement a speech based electrical switch in home automation for the Indonesian language. The main key of the procedure is to match the environment for training and testing using the training data recorded from the testing program, HVite. Often the silence detector of HTK is wrongly triggered by noises because the microphone is too sensitive. This problem is mitigated by simply scaling down the volume. In this sub-word phone-based speech recognition, noise is included in the training database and labelled particularly. Illustration of the procedure is applied to a home automation application. Electrical switches are controlled by Indonesian speech recognizer. The results show 100% command completion rate."
Imperio: Robust Over-the-Air Adversarial Examples for Automatic Speech Recognition Systems,"Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems can be fooled via targeted adversarial examples, which induce the ASR to produce arbitrary transcriptions in response to altered audio signals. However, state-of-the-art adversarial examples typically have to be fed into the ASR system directly, and are not successful when played in a room. The few published over-the-air adversarial examples fall into one of three categories: they are either handcrafted examples, they are so conspicuous that human listeners can easily recognize the target transcription once they are alerted to its content, or they require precise information about the room where the attack takes place, and are hence not transferable to other rooms. In this paper, we demonstrate the first algorithm that produces generic adversarial examples, which remain robust in an over-the-air attack that is not adapted to the specific environment. Hence, no prior knowledge of the room characteristics is required. Instead, we use room impulse responses (RIRs) to compute robust adversarial examples for arbitrary room characteristics and employ the ASR system Kaldi to demonstrate the attack. Further, our algorithm can utilize psychoacoustic methods to hide changes of the original audio signal below the human thresholds of hearing. In practical experiments, we show that the adversarial examples work for varying room setups, and that no direct line-of-sight between speaker and microphone is necessary. As a result, an attacker can create inconspicuous adversarial examples for any target transcription and apply these to arbitrary room setups without any prior knowledge."
Multilingual Speech Recognition with Corpus Relatedness Sampling,"Multilingual acoustic models have been successfully applied to low-resource speech recognition. Most existing works have combined many small corpora together and pretrained a multilingual model by sampling from each corpus uniformly. The model is eventually fine-tuned on each target corpus. This approach, however, fails to exploit the relatedness and similarity among corpora in the training set. For example, the target corpus might benefit more from a corpus in the same domain or a corpus from a close language. In this work, we propose a simple but useful sampling strategy to take advantage of this relatedness. We first compute the corpus-level embeddings and estimate the similarity between each corpus. Next, we start training the multilingual model with uniform-sampling from each corpus at first, then we gradually increase the probability to sample from related corpora based on its similarity with the target corpus. Finally, the model would be fine-tuned automatically on the target corpus. Our sampling strategy outperforms the baseline multilingual model on 16 low-resource tasks. Additionally, we demonstrate that our corpus embeddings capture the language and domain information of each corpus."
Multi-Frame Cross-Entropy Training for Convolutional Neural Networks in Speech Recognition,"We introduce Multi-Frame Cross-Entropy training (MFCE) for convolutional neural network acoustic models. Recognizing that similar to RNNs, CNNs are in nature sequence models that take variable length inputs, we propose to take as input to the CNN a part of an utterance long enough that multiple labels are predicted at once, therefore getting cross-entropy loss signal from multiple adjacent frames. This increases the amount of label information drastically for small marginal computational cost. We show large WER improvements on hub5 and rt02 after training on the 2000-hour Switchboard benchmark."
Investigating Target Set Reduction for End-to-End Speech Recognition of Hindi-English Code-Switching Data,"End-to-end (E2E) systems are fast replacing the conventional systems in the domain of automatic speech recognition. As the target labels are learned directly from speech data, the E2E systems need a bigger corpus for effective training. In the context of code-switching task, the E2E systems face two challenges: (i) the expansion of the target set due to multiple languages involved, and (ii) the lack of availability of sufficiently large domain-specific corpus. Towards addressing those challenges, we propose an approach for reducing the number of target labels for reliable training of the E2E systems on limited data. The efficacy of the proposed approach has been demonstrated on two prominent architectures, namely CTC-based and attention-based E2E networks. The experimental validations are performed on a recently created Hindi-English code-switching corpus. For contrast purpose, the results for the full target set based E2E system and a hybrid DNN-HMM system are also reported."
Investigation on N-gram Approximated RNNLMs for Recognition of Morphologically Rich Speech,"Recognition of Hungarian conversational telephone speech is challenging due to the informal style and morphological richness of the language. Recurrent Neural Network Language Model (RNNLM) can provide remedy for the high perplexity of the task; however, two-pass decoding introduces a considerable processing delay. In order to eliminate this delay we investigate approaches aiming at the complexity reduction of RNNLM, while preserving its accuracy. We compare the performance of conventional back-off n-gram language models (BNLM), BNLM approximation of RNNLMs (RNN-BNLM) and RNN n-grams in terms of perplexity and word error rate (WER). Morphological richness is often addressed by using statistically derived subwords - morphs - in the language models, hence our investigations are extended to morph-based models, as well. We found that using RNN-BNLMs 40% of the RNNLM perplexity reduction can be recovered, which is roughly equal to the performance of a RNN 4-gram model. Combining morph-based modeling and approximation of RNNLM, we were able to achieve 8% relative WER reduction and preserve real-time operation of our conversational telephone speech recognition system."
Unsupervised Adversarial Domain Adaptation for Cross-Lingual Speech Emotion Recognition,"Cross-lingual speech emotion recognition (SER) is a crucial task for many real-world applications. The performance of SER systems is often degraded by the differences in the distributions of training and test data. These differences become more apparent when training and test data belong to different languages, which cause a significant performance gap between the validation and test scores. It is imperative to build more robust models that can fit in practical applications of SER systems. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based model for multilingual SER. Our choice of using GAN is motivated by their great success in learning the underlying data distribution. The proposed model is designed in such a way that can learn language invariant representations without requiring target-language data labels. We evaluate our proposed model on four different language emotional datasets, including an Urdu-language dataset to also incorporate alternative languages for which labelled data is difficult to find and which have not been studied much by the mainstream community. Our results show that our proposed model can significantly improve the baseline cross-lingual SER performance for all the considered datasets including the non-mainstream Urdu language data without requiring any labels."
Multi-Task Semi-Supervised Adversarial Autoencoding for Speech Emotion Recognition,"Inspite the emerging importance of Speech Emotion Recognition (SER), the state-of-the-art accuracy is quite low and needs improvement to make commercial applications of SER viable. A key underlying reason for the low accuracy is the scarcity of emotion datasets, which is a challenge for developing any robust machine learning model in general. In this paper, we propose a solution to this problem: a multi-task learning framework that uses auxiliary tasks for which data is abundantly available. We show that utilisation of this additional data can improve the primary task of SER for which only limited labelled data is available. In particular, we use gender identifications and speaker recognition as auxiliary tasks, which allow the use of very large datasets, e.g., speaker classification datasets. To maximise the benefit of multi-task learning, we further use an adversarial autoencoder (AAE) within our framework, which has a strong capability to learn powerful and discriminative features. Furthermore, the unsupervised AAE in combination with the supervised classification networks enables semi-supervised learning which incorporates a discriminative component in the AAE unsupervised training pipeline. This semi-supervised learning essentially helps to improve generalisation of our framework and thus leads to improvements in SER performance. The proposed model is rigorously evaluated for categorical and dimensional emotion, and cross-corpus scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on two publicly available datasets."
Learn Spelling from Teachers: Transferring Knowledge from Language Models to Sequence-to-Sequence Speech Recognition,"Integrating an external language model into a sequence-to-sequence speech recognition system is non-trivial. Previous works utilize linear interpolation or a fusion network to integrate external language models. However, these approaches introduce external components, and increase decoding computation. In this paper, we instead propose a knowledge distillation based training approach to integrating external language models into a sequence-to-sequence model. A recurrent neural network language model, which is trained on large scale external text, generates soft labels to guide the sequence-to-sequence model training. Thus, the language model plays the role of the teacher. This approach does not add any external component to the sequence-to-sequence model during testing. And this approach is flexible to be combined with shallow fusion technique together for decoding. The experiments are conducted on public Chinese datasets AISHELL-1 and CLMAD. Our approach achieves a character error rate of 9.3%, which is relatively reduced by 18.42% compared with the vanilla sequence-to-sequence model."
A Highly Efficient Distributed Deep Learning System For Automatic Speech Recognition,"Modern Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems rely on distributed deep learning to for quick training completion. To enable efficient distributed training, it is imperative that the training algorithms can converge with a large mini-batch size. In this work, we discovered that Asynchronous Decentralized Parallel Stochastic Gradient Descent (ADPSGD) can work with much larger batch size than commonly used Synchronous SGD (SSGD) algorithm. On commonly used public SWB-300 and SWB-2000 ASR datasets, ADPSGD can converge with a batch size 3X as large as the one used in SSGD, thus enable training at a much larger scale. Further, we proposed a Hierarchical-ADPSGD (H-ADPSGD) system in which learners on the same computing node construct a super learner via a fast allreduce implementation, and super learners deploy ADPSGD algorithm among themselves. On a 64 Nvidia V100 GPU cluster connected via a 100Gb/s Ethernet network, our system is able to train SWB-2000 to reach a 7.6% WER on the Hub5-2000 Switchboard (SWB) test-set and a 13.2% WER on the Call-home (CH) test-set in 5.2 hours. To the best of our knowledge, this is the fastest ASR training system that attains this level of model accuracy for SWB-2000 task to be ever reported in the literature."
Joint Speech Recognition and Speaker Diarization via Sequence Transduction,"Speech applications dealing with conversations require not only recognizing the spoken words, but also determining who spoke when. The task of assigning words to speakers is typically addressed by merging the outputs of two separate systems, namely, an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system and a speaker diarization (SD) system. The two systems are trained independently with different objective functions. Often the SD systems operate directly on the acoustics and are not constrained to respect word boundaries and this deficiency is overcome in an ad hoc manner. Motivated by recent advances in sequence to sequence learning, we propose a novel approach to tackle the two tasks by a joint ASR and SD system using a recurrent neural network transducer. Our approach utilizes both linguistic and acoustic cues to infer speaker roles, as opposed to typical SD systems, which only use acoustic cues. We evaluated the performance of our approach on a large corpus of medical conversations between physicians and patients. Compared to a competitive conventional baseline, our approach improves word-level diarization error rate from 15.8% to 2.2%."
Large-Scale Mixed-Bandwidth Deep Neural Network Acoustic Modeling for Automatic Speech Recognition,"In automatic speech recognition (ASR), wideband (WB) and narrowband (NB) speech signals with different sampling rates typically use separate acoustic models. Therefore mixed-bandwidth (MB) acoustic modeling has important practical values for ASR system deployment. In this paper, we extensively investigate large-scale MB deep neural network acoustic modeling for ASR using 1,150 hours of WB data and 2,300 hours of NB data. We study various MB strategies including downsampling, upsampling and bandwidth extension for MB acoustic modeling and evaluate their performance on 8 diverse WB and NB test sets from various application domains. To deal with the large amounts of training data, distributed training is carried out on multiple GPUs using synchronous data parallelism."
Acoustic Model Optimization Based On Evolutionary Stochastic Gradient Descent with Anchors for Automatic Speech Recognition,"Evolutionary stochastic gradient descent (ESGD) was proposed as a population-based approach that combines the merits of gradient-aware and gradient-free optimization algorithms for superior overall optimization performance. In this paper we investigate a variant of ESGD for optimization of acoustic models for automatic speech recognition (ASR). In this variant, we assume the existence of a well-trained acoustic model and use it as an anchor in the parent population whose good ""gene"" will propagate in the evolution to the offsprings. We propose an ESGD algorithm leveraging the anchor models such that it guarantees the best fitness of the population will never degrade from the anchor model. Experiments on 50-hour Broadcast News (BN50) and 300-hour Switchboard (SWB300) show that the ESGD with anchors can further improve the loss and ASR performance over the existing well-trained acoustic models."
Multi-layer Attention Mechanism for Speech Keyword Recognition,"As an important part of speech recognition technology, automatic speech keyword recognition has been intensively studied in recent years. Such technology becomes especially pivotal under situations with limited infrastructures and computational resources, such as voice command recognition in vehicles and robot interaction. At present, the mainstream methods in automatic speech keyword recognition are based on long short-term memory (LSTM) networks with attention mechanism. However, due to inevitable information losses for the LSTM layer caused during feature extraction, the calculated attention weights are biased. In this paper, a novel approach, namely Multi-layer Attention Mechanism, is proposed to handle the inaccurate attention weights problem. The key idea is that, in addition to the conventional attention mechanism, information of layers prior to feature extraction and LSTM are introduced into attention weights calculations. Therefore, the attention weights are more accurate because the overall model can have more precise and focused areas. We conduct a comprehensive comparison and analysis on the keyword spotting performances on convolution neural network, bi-directional LSTM cyclic neural network, and cyclic neural network with the proposed attention mechanism on Google Speech Command datasets V2 datasets. Experimental results indicate favorable results for the proposed method and demonstrate the validity of the proposed method. The proposed multi-layer attention methods can be useful for other researches related to object spotting."
Transfer Learning from Audio-Visual Grounding to Speech Recognition,"Transfer learning aims to reduce the amount of data required to excel at a new task by re-using the knowledge acquired from learning other related tasks. This paper proposes a novel transfer learning scenario, which distills robust phonetic features from grounding models that are trained to tell whether a pair of image and speech are semantically correlated, without using any textual transcripts. As semantics of speech are largely determined by its lexical content, grounding models learn to preserve phonetic information while disregarding uncorrelated factors, such as speaker and channel. To study the properties of features distilled from different layers, we use them as input separately to train multiple speech recognition models. Empirical results demonstrate that layers closer to input retain more phonetic information, while following layers exhibit greater invariance to domain shift. Moreover, while most previous studies include training data for speech recognition for feature extractor training, our grounding models are not trained on any of those data, indicating more universal applicability to new domains."
Analyzing Phonetic and Graphemic Representations in End-to-End Automatic Speech Recognition,"End-to-end neural network systems for automatic speech recognition (ASR) are trained from acoustic features to text transcriptions. In contrast to modular ASR systems, which contain separately-trained components for acoustic modeling, pronunciation lexicon, and language modeling, the end-to-end paradigm is both conceptually simpler and has the potential benefit of training the entire system on the end task. However, such neural network models are more opaque: it is not clear how to interpret the role of different parts of the network and what information it learns during training. In this paper, we analyze the learned internal representations in an end-to-end ASR model. We evaluate the representation quality in terms of several classification tasks, comparing phonemes and graphemes, as well as different articulatory features. We study two languages (English and Arabic) and three datasets, finding remarkable consistency in how different properties are represented in different layers of the deep neural network."
NIESR: Nuisance Invariant End-to-end Speech Recognition,"Deep neural network models for speech recognition have achieved great success recently, but they can learn incorrect associations between the target and nuisance factors of speech (e.g., speaker identities, background noise, etc.), which can lead to overfitting. While several methods have been proposed to tackle this problem, existing methods incorporate additional information about nuisance factors during training to develop invariant models. However, enumeration of all possible nuisance factors in speech data and the collection of their annotations is difficult and expensive. We present a robust training scheme for end-to-end speech recognition that adopts an unsupervised adversarial invariance induction framework to separate out essential factors for speech-recognition from nuisances without using any supplementary labels besides the transcriptions. Experiments show that the speech recognition model trained with the proposed training scheme achieves relative improvements of 5.48% on WSJ0, 6.16% on CHiME3, and 6.61% on TIMIT dataset over the base model. Additionally, the proposed method achieves a relative improvement of 14.44% on the combined WSJ0+CHiME3 dataset."
Improved low-resource Somali speech recognition by semi-supervised acoustic and language model training,"We present improvements in automatic speech recognition (ASR) for Somali, a currently extremely under-resourced language. This forms part of a continuing United Nations (UN) effort to employ ASR-based keyword spotting systems to support humanitarian relief programmes in rural Africa. Using just 1.57 hours of annotated speech data as a seed corpus, we increase the pool of training data by applying semi-supervised training to 17.55 hours of untranscribed speech. We make use of factorised time-delay neural networks (TDNN-F) for acoustic modelling, since these have recently been shown to be effective in resource-scarce situations. Three semi-supervised training passes were performed, where the decoded output from each pass was used for acoustic model training in the subsequent pass. The automatic transcriptions from the best performing pass were used for language model augmentation. To ensure the quality of automatic transcriptions, decoder confidence is used as a threshold. The acoustic and language models obtained from the semi-supervised approach show significant improvement in terms of WER and perplexity compared to the baseline. Incorporating the automatically generated transcriptions yields a 6.55\% improvement in language model perplexity. The use of 17.55 hour of Somali acoustic data in semi-supervised training shows an improvement of 7.74\% relative over the baseline."
End-to-End Speech Recognition with High-Frame-Rate Features Extraction,"State-of-the-art end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) extracts acoustic features from input speech signal every 10 ms which corresponds to a frame rate of 100 frames/second. In this report, we investigate the use of high-frame-rate features extraction in end-to-end ASR. High frame rates of 200 and 400 frames/second are used in the features extraction and provide additional information for end-to-end ASR. The effectiveness of high-frame-rate features extraction is evaluated independently and in combination with speed perturbation based data augmentation. Experiments performed on two speech corpora, Wall Street Journal (WSJ) and CHiME-5, show that using high-frame-rate features extraction yields improved performance for end-to-end ASR, both independently and in combination with speed perturbation. On WSJ corpus, the relative reduction of word error rate (WER) yielded by high-frame-rate features extraction independently and in combination with speed perturbation are up to 21.3% and 24.1%, respectively. On CHiME-5 corpus, the corresponding relative WER reductions are up to 2.8% and 7.9%, respectively, on the test data recorded by microphone arrays and up to 11.8% and 21.2%, respectively, on the test data recorded by binaural microphones."
Latent Dirichlet Allocation Based Acoustic Data Selection for Automatic Speech Recognition,"Selecting in-domain data from a large pool of diverse and out-of-domain data is a non-trivial problem. In most cases simply using all of the available data will lead to sub-optimal and in some cases even worse performance compared to carefully selecting a matching set. This is true even for data-inefficient neural models. Acoustic Latent Dirichlet Allocation (aLDA) is shown to be useful in a variety of speech technology related tasks, including domain adaptation of acoustic models for automatic speech recognition and entity labeling for information retrieval. In this paper we propose to use aLDA as a data similarity criterion in a data selection framework. Given a large pool of out-of-domain and potentially mismatched data, the task is to select the best-matching training data to a set of representative utterances sampled from a target domain. Our target data consists of around 32 hours of meeting data (both far-field and close-talk) and the pool contains 2k hours of meeting, talks, voice search, dictation, command-and-control, audio books, lectures, generic media and telephony speech data. The proposed technique for training data selection, significantly outperforms random selection, posterior-based selection as well as using all of the available data."
Kite: Automatic speech recognition for unmanned aerial vehicles,"This paper addresses the problem of building a speech recognition system attuned to the control of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Even though UAVs are becoming widespread, the task of creating voice interfaces for them is largely unaddressed. To this end, we introduce a multi-modal evaluation dataset for UAV control, consisting of spoken commands and associated images, which represent the visual context of what the UAV ""sees"" when the pilot utters the command. We provide baseline results and address two research directions: (i) how robust the language models are, given an incomplete list of commands at train time; (ii) how to incorporate visual information in the language model. We find that recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a solution to both tasks: they can be successfully adapted using a small number of commands and they can be extended to use visual cues. Our results show that the image-based RNN outperforms its text-only counterpart even if the command-image training associations are automatically generated and inherently imperfect. The dataset and our code are available at http://kite.speed.pub.ro."
Analyzing Utility of Visual Context in Multimodal Speech Recognition Under Noisy Conditions,"Multimodal learning allows us to leverage information from multiple sources (visual, acoustic and text), similar to our experience of the real world. However, it is currently unclear to what extent auxiliary modalities improve performance over unimodal models, and under what circumstances the auxiliary modalities are useful. We examine the utility of the auxiliary visual context in Multimodal Automatic Speech Recognition in adversarial settings, where we deprive the models from partial audio signal during inference time. Our experiments show that while MMASR models show significant gains over traditional speech-to-text architectures (upto 4.2% WER improvements), they do not incorporate visual information when the audio signal has been corrupted. This shows that current methods of integrating the visual modality do not improve model robustness to noise, and we need better visually grounded adaptation techniques."
Gated Embeddings in End-to-End Speech Recognition for Conversational-Context Fusion,"We present a novel conversational-context aware end-to-end speech recognizer based on a gated neural network that incorporates conversational-context/word/speech embeddings. Unlike conventional speech recognition models, our model learns longer conversational-context information that spans across sentences and is consequently better at recognizing long conversations. Specifically, we propose to use the text-based external word and/or sentence embeddings (i.e., fastText, BERT) within an end-to-end framework, yielding a significant improvement in word error rate with better conversational-context representation. We evaluated the models on the Switchboard conversational speech corpus and show that our model outperforms standard end-to-end speech recognition models."
Auxiliary Interference Speaker Loss for Target-Speaker Speech Recognition,"In this paper, we propose a novel auxiliary loss function for target-speaker automatic speech recognition (ASR). Our method automatically extracts and transcribes target speaker's utterances from a monaural mixture of multiple speakers speech given a short sample of the target speaker. The proposed auxiliary loss function attempts to additionally maximize interference speaker ASR accuracy during training. This will regularize the network to achieve a better representation for speaker separation, thus achieving better accuracy on the target-speaker ASR. We evaluated our proposed method using two-speaker-mixed speech in various signal-to-interference-ratio conditions. We first built a strong target-speaker ASR baseline based on the state-of-the-art lattice-free maximum mutual information. This baseline achieved a word error rate (WER) of 18.06% on the test set while a normal ASR trained with clean data produced a completely corrupted result (WER of 84.71%). Then, our proposed loss further reduced the WER by 6.6% relative to this strong baseline, achieving a WER of 16.87%. In addition to the accuracy improvement, we also showed that the auxiliary output branch for the proposed loss can even be used for a secondary ASR for interference speakers' speech."
Essence Knowledge Distillation for Speech Recognition,"It is well known that a speech recognition system that combines multiple acoustic models trained on the same data significantly outperforms a single-model system. Unfortunately, real time speech recognition using a whole ensemble of models is too computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose to distill the knowledge of essence in an ensemble of models (i.e. the teacher model) to a single model (i.e. the student model) that needs much less computation to deploy. Previously, all the soften outputs of the teacher model are used to optimize the student model. We argue that not all the outputs of the ensemble are necessary to be distilled. Some of the outputs may even contain noisy information that is useless or even harmful to the training of the student model. In addition, we propose to train the student model with a multitask learning approach by utilizing both the soften outputs of the teacher model and the correct hard labels. The proposed method achieves some surprising results on the Switchboard data set. When the student model is trained together with the correct labels and the essence knowledge from the teacher model, it not only significantly outperforms another single model with the same architecture that is trained only with the correct labels, but also consistently outperforms the teacher model that is used to generate the soft labels."
Phoneme-Based Contextualization for Cross-Lingual Speech Recognition in End-to-End Models,"Contextual automatic speech recognition, i.e., biasing recognition towards a given context (e.g. user's playlists, or contacts), is challenging in end-to-end (E2E) models. Such models maintain a limited number of candidates during beam-search decoding, and have been found to recognize rare named entities poorly. The problem is exacerbated when biasing towards proper nouns in foreign languages, e.g., geographic location names, which are virtually unseen in training and are thus out-of-vocabulary (OOV). While grapheme or wordpiece E2E models might have a difficult time spelling OOV words, phonemes are more acoustically salient and past work has shown that E2E phoneme models can better predict such words. In this work, we propose an E2E model containing both English wordpieces and phonemes in the modeling space, and perform contextual biasing of foreign words at the phoneme level by mapping pronunciations of foreign words into similar English phonemes. In experimental evaluations, we find that the proposed approach performs 16% better than a grapheme-only biasing model, and 8% better than a wordpiece-only biasing model on a foreign place name recognition task, with only slight degradation on regular English tasks."
Learning Discriminative features using Center Loss and Reconstruction as Regularizer for Speech Emotion Recognition,"This paper proposes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) inspired by Multitask Learning (MTL) and based on speech features trained under the joint supervision of softmax loss and center loss, a powerful metric learning strategy, for the recognition of emotion in speech. Speech features such as Spectrograms and Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficient s (MFCCs) help retain emotion-related low-level characteristics in speech. We experimented with several Deep Neural Network (DNN) architectures that take in speech features as input and trained them under both softmax and center loss, which resulted in highly discriminative features ideal for Speech Emotion Recognition (SER). Our networks also employ a regularizing effect by simultaneously performing the auxiliary task of reconstructing the input speech features. This sharing of representations among related tasks enables our network to better generalize the original task of SER. Some of our proposed networks contain far fewer parameters when compared to state-of-the-art architectures."
Advancing Speech Recognition With No Speech Or With Noisy Speech,In this paper we demonstrate end-to-end continuous speech recognition (CSR) using electroencephalography (EEG) signals with no speech signal as input. An attention model based automatic speech recognition (ASR) and connectionist temporal classification (CTC) based ASR systems were implemented for performing recognition. We further demonstrate CSR for noisy speech by fusing with EEG features.
Speech Recognition With No Speech Or With Noisy Speech Beyond English,In this paper we demonstrate continuous noisy speech recognition using connectionist temporal classification (CTC) model on limited Chinese vocabulary using electroencephalography (EEG) features with no speech signal as input and we further demonstrate single CTC model based continuous noisy speech recognition on limited joint English and Chinese vocabulary using EEG features with no speech signal as input. We demonstrate our results using various EEG feature sets recently introduced in [1] as well as we propose a new deep learning architecture in this paper which can perform continuous speech recognition using raw EEG signals on limited joint English and Chinese vocabulary.
Real to H-space Encoder for Speech Recognition,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) and more precisely recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are at the core of modern automatic speech recognition systems, due to their efficiency to process input sequences. Recently, it has been shown that different input representations, based on multidimensional algebras, such as complex and quaternion numbers, are able to bring to neural networks a more natural, compressive and powerful representation of the input signal by outperforming common real-valued NNs. Indeed, quaternion-valued neural networks (QNNs) better learn both internal dependencies, such as the relation between the Mel-filter-bank value of a specific time frame and its time derivatives, and global dependencies, describing the relations that exist between time frames. Nonetheless, QNNs are limited to quaternion-valued input signals, and it is difficult to benefit from this powerful representation with real-valued input data. This paper proposes to tackle this weakness by introducing a real-to-quaternion encoder that allows QNNs to process any one dimensional input features, such as traditional Mel-filter-banks for automatic speech recognition."
Multi-Stream End-to-End Speech Recognition,"Attention-based methods and Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) network have been promising research directions for end-to-end (E2E) Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). The joint CTC/Attention model has achieved great success by utilizing both architectures during multi-task training and joint decoding. In this work, we present a multi-stream framework based on joint CTC/Attention E2E ASR with parallel streams represented by separate encoders aiming to capture diverse information. On top of the regular attention networks, the Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) is introduced to steer the decoder toward the most informative encoders. A separate CTC network is assigned to each stream to force monotonic alignments. Two representative framework have been proposed and discussed, which are Multi-Encoder Multi-Resolution (MEM-Res) framework and Multi-Encoder Multi-Array (MEM-Array) framework, respectively. In MEM-Res framework, two heterogeneous encoders with different architectures, temporal resolutions and separate CTC networks work in parallel to extract complimentary information from same acoustics. Experiments are conducted on Wall Street Journal (WSJ) and CHiME-4, resulting in relative Word Error Rate (WER) reduction of 18.0-32.1% and the best WER of 3.6% in the WSJ eval92 test set. The MEM-Array framework aims at improving the far-field ASR robustness using multiple microphone arrays which are activated by separate encoders. Compared with the best single-array results, the proposed framework has achieved relative WER reduction of 3.7% and 9.7% in AMI and DIRHA multi-array corpora, respectively, which also outperforms conventional fusion strategies."
Deep Xi as a Front-End for Robust Automatic Speech Recognition,"Current front-ends for robust automatic speech recognition(ASR) include masking- and mapping-based deep learning approaches to speech enhancement. A recently proposed deep learning approach toa prioriSNR estimation, called DeepXi, was able to produce enhanced speech at a higher quality and intelligibility than current masking- and mapping-based approaches. Motivated by this, we investigate Deep Xi as a front-end for robust ASR. Deep Xi is evaluated using real-world non-stationary and coloured noise sources at multiple SNR levels. Our experimental investigation shows that DeepXi as a front-end is able to produce a lower word error rate than recent masking- and mapping-based deep learning front-ends. The results presented in this work show that Deep Xi is a viable front-end, and is able to significantly increase the robustness of an ASR system. Availability: Deep Xi is available at:https://github.com/anicolson/DeepXi"
On combining features for single-channel robust speech recognition in reverberant environments,"This paper addresses the combination of complementary parallel speech recognition systems to reduce the error rate of speech recognition systems operating in real highly-reverberant environments. First, the testing environment consists of recordings of speech in a calibrated real room with reverberation times from 0.47 to 1.77 seconds and speaker-to-microphone distances of 0.16 to 2.56 meters. We combined systems both at the level of the DNN outputs and at the level of the final ASR outputs. Second, recognition experiments with the reverb challenge are also reported. The results presented here show that the combination of features can lead to WER improvements between 7% and 18% with speech recorded in real reverberant environments. Also, the combination at DNN-output level is much more effective than at the system-output level. However, cascading both schemes can still lead to smaller reductions in WER."
Speaker-Targeted Audio-Visual Models for Speech Recognition in Cocktail-Party Environments,"Speech recognition in cocktail-party environments remains a significant challenge for state-of-the-art speech recognition systems, as it is extremely difficult to extract an acoustic signal of an individual speaker from a background of overlapping speech with similar frequency and temporal characteristics. We propose the use of speaker-targeted acoustic and audio-visual models for this task. We complement the acoustic features in a hybrid DNN-HMM model with information of the target speaker's identity as well as visual features from the mouth region of the target speaker. Experimentation was performed using simulated cocktail-party data generated from the GRID audio-visual corpus by overlapping two speakers's speech on a single acoustic channel. Our audio-only baseline achieved a WER of 26.3%. The audio-visual model improved the WER to 4.4%. Introducing speaker identity information had an even more pronounced effect, improving the WER to 3.6%. Combining both approaches, however, did not significantly improve performance further. Our work demonstrates that speaker-targeted models can significantly improve the speech recognition in cocktail party environments."
Focal Loss based Residual Convolutional Neural Network for Speech Emotion Recognition,"This paper proposes a Residual Convolutional Neural Network (ResNet) based on speech features and trained under Focal Loss to recognize emotion in speech. Speech features such as Spectrogram and Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) have shown the ability to characterize emotion better than just plain text. Further Focal Loss, first used in One-Stage Object Detectors, has shown the ability to focus the training process more towards hard-examples and down-weight the loss assigned to well-classified examples, thus preventing the model from being overwhelmed by easily classifiable examples."
Deep Learning based Emotion Recognition System Using Speech Features and Transcriptions,"This paper proposes a speech emotion recognition method based on speech features and speech transcriptions (text). Speech features such as Spectrogram and Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) help retain emotion-related low-level characteristics in speech whereas text helps capture semantic meaning, both of which help in different aspects of emotion detection. We experimented with several Deep Neural Network (DNN) architectures, which take in different combinations of speech features and text as inputs. The proposed network architectures achieve higher accuracies when compared to state-of-the-art methods on a benchmark dataset. The combined MFCC-Text Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model proved to be the most accurate in recognizing emotions in IEMOCAP data."
Word-level Speech Recognition with a Letter to Word Encoder,"We propose a direct-to-word sequence model which uses a word network to learn word embeddings from letters. The word network can be integrated seamlessly with arbitrary sequence models including Connectionist Temporal Classification and encoder-decoder models with attention. We show our direct-to-word model can achieve word error rate gains over sub-word level models for speech recognition. We also show that our direct-to-word approach retains the ability to predict words not seen at training time without any retraining. Finally, we demonstrate that a word-level model can use a larger stride than a sub-word level model while maintaining accuracy. This makes the model more efficient both for training and inference."
Role of non-linear data processing on speech recognition task in the framework of reservoir computing,"The reservoir computing neural network architecture is widely used to test hardware systems for neuromorphic computing. One of the preferred tasks for bench-marking such devices is automatic speech recognition. However, this task requires acoustic transformations from sound waveforms with varying amplitudes to frequency domain maps that can be seen as feature extraction techniques. Depending on the conversion method, these may obscure the contribution of the neuromorphic hardware to the overall speech recognition performance. Here, we quantify and separate the contributions of the acoustic transformations and the neuromorphic hardware to the speech recognition success rate. We show that the non-linearity in the acoustic transformation plays a critical role in feature extraction. We compute the gain in word success rate provided by a reservoir computing device compared to the acoustic transformation only, and show that it is an appropriate benchmark for comparing different hardware. Finally, we experimentally and numerically quantify the impact of the different acoustic transformations for neuromorphic hardware based on magnetic nano-oscillators."
Investigating the Lombard Effect Influence on End-to-End Audio-Visual Speech Recognition,"Several audio-visual speech recognition models have been recently proposed which aim to improve the robustness over audio-only models in the presence of noise. However, almost all of them ignore the impact of the Lombard effect, i.e., the change in speaking style in noisy environments which aims to make speech more intelligible and affects both the acoustic characteristics of speech and the lip movements. In this paper, we investigate the impact of the Lombard effect in audio-visual speech recognition. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work which does so using end-to-end deep architectures and presents results on unseen speakers. Our results show that properly modelling Lombard speech is always beneficial. Even if a relatively small amount of Lombard speech is added to the training set then the performance in a real scenario, where noisy Lombard speech is present, can be significantly improved. We also show that the standard approach followed in the literature, where a model is trained and tested on noisy plain speech, provides a correct estimate of the video-only performance and slightly underestimates the audio-visual performance. In case of audio-only approaches, performance is overestimated for SNRs higher than -3dB and underestimated for lower SNRs."
CIF: Continuous Integrate-and-Fire for End-to-End Speech Recognition,"In this paper, we propose a novel soft and monotonic alignment mechanism used for sequence transduction. It is inspired by the integrate-and-fire model in spiking neural networks and employed in the encoder-decoder framework consists of continuous functions, thus being named as: Continuous Integrate-and-Fire (CIF). Applied to the ASR task, CIF not only shows a concise calculation, but also supports online recognition and acoustic boundary positioning, thus suitable for various ASR scenarios. Several support strategies are also proposed to alleviate the unique problems of CIF-based model. With the joint action of these methods, the CIF-based model shows competitive performance. Notably, it achieves a word error rate (WER) of 2.86% on the test-clean of Librispeech and creates new state-of-the-art result on Mandarin telephone ASR benchmark."
End-to-end Adaptation with Backpropagation through WFST for On-device Speech Recognition System,"An on-device DNN-HMM speech recognition system efficiently works with a limited vocabulary in the presence of a variety of predictable noise. In such a case, vocabulary and environment adaptation is highly effective. In this paper, we propose a novel method of end-to-end (E2E) adaptation, which adjusts not only an acoustic model (AM) but also a weighted finite-state transducer (WFST). We convert a pretrained WFST to a trainable neural network and adapt the system to target environments/vocabulary by E2E joint training with an AM. We replicate Viterbi decoding with forward--backward neural network computation, which is similar to recurrent neural networks (RNNs). By pooling output score sequences, a vocabulary posterior for each utterance is obtained and used for discriminative loss computation. Experiments using 2--10 hours of English/Japanese adaptation datasets indicate that the fine-tuning of only WFSTs and that of only AMs are both comparable to a state-of-the-art adaptation method, and E2E joint training of the two components achieves the best recognition performance. We also adapt each language system to the other language using the adaptation data, and the results show that the proposed method also works well for language adaptations."
Almost Unsupervised Text to Speech and Automatic Speech Recognition,"Text to speech (TTS) and automatic speech recognition (ASR) are two dual tasks in speech processing and both achieve impressive performance thanks to the recent advance in deep learning and large amount of aligned speech and text data. However, the lack of aligned data poses a major practical problem for TTS and ASR on low-resource languages. In this paper, by leveraging the dual nature of the two tasks, we propose an almost unsupervised learning method that only leverages few hundreds of paired data and extra unpaired data for TTS and ASR. Our method consists of the following components: (1) a denoising auto-encoder, which reconstructs speech and text sequences respectively to develop the capability of language modeling both in speech and text domain; (2) dual transformation, where the TTS model transforms the text y into speech \hat{x}, and the ASR model leverages the transformed pair (\hat{x},y) for training, and vice versa, to boost the accuracy of the two tasks; (3) bidirectional sequence modeling, which addresses error propagation especially in the long speech and text sequence when training with few paired data; (4) a unified model structure, which combines all the above components for TTS and ASR based on Transformer model. Our method achieves 99.84% in terms of word level intelligible rate and 2.68 MOS for TTS, and 11.7% PER for ASR on LJSpeech dataset, by leveraging only 200 paired speech and text data (about 20 minutes audio), together with extra unpaired speech and text data."
Effective Sentence Scoring Method using Bidirectional Language Model for Speech Recognition,"In automatic speech recognition, many studies have shown performance improvements using language models (LMs). Recent studies have tried to use bidirectional LMs (biLMs) instead of conventional unidirectional LMs (uniLMs) for rescoring the N-best list decoded from the acoustic model. In spite of their theoretical benefits, the biLMs have not given notable improvements compared to the uniLMs in their experiments. This is because their biLMs do not consider the interaction between the two directions. In this paper, we propose a novel sentence scoring method considering the interaction between the past and the future words on the biLM. Our experimental results on the LibriSpeech corpus show that the biLM with the proposed sentence scoring outperforms the uniLM for the N-best list rescoring, consistently and significantly in all experimental conditions. The analysis of WERs by word position demonstrates that the biLM is more robust than the uniLM especially when a recognized sentence is short or a misrecognized word is at the beginning of the sentence."
Encrypted Speech Recognition using Deep Polynomial Networks,"The cloud-based speech recognition/API provides developers or enterprises an easy way to create speech-enabled features in their applications. However, sending audios about personal or company internal information to the cloud, raises concerns about the privacy and security issues. The recognition results generated in cloud may also reveal some sensitive information. This paper proposes a deep polynomial network (DPN) that can be applied to the encrypted speech as an acoustic model. It allows clients to send their data in an encrypted form to the cloud to ensure that their data remains confidential, at mean while the DPN can still make frame-level predictions over the encrypted speech and return them in encrypted form. One good property of the DPN is that it can be trained on unencrypted speech features in the traditional way. To keep the cloud away from the raw audio and recognition results, a cloud-local joint decoding framework is also proposed. We demonstrate the effectiveness of model and framework on the Switchboard and Cortana voice assistant tasks with small performance degradation and latency increased comparing with the traditional cloud-based DNNs."
MobiVSR: A Visual Speech Recognition Solution for Mobile Devices,"Visual speech recognition (VSR) is the task of recognizing spoken language from video input only, without any audio. VSR has many applications as an assistive technology, especially if it could be deployed in mobile devices and embedded systems. The need of intensive computational resources and large memory footprint are two of the major obstacles in developing neural network models for VSR in a resource constrained environment. We propose a novel end-to-end deep neural network architecture for word level VSR called MobiVSR with a design parameter that aids in balancing the model's accuracy and parameter count. We use depthwise-separable 3D convolution for the first time in the domain of VSR and show how it makes our model efficient. MobiVSR achieves an accuracy of 73\% on a challenging Lip Reading in the Wild dataset with 6 times fewer parameters and 20 times lesser memory footprint than the current state of the art. MobiVSR can also be compressed to 6 MB by applying post training quantization."
Universal Adversarial Perturbations for Speech Recognition Systems,"In this work, we demonstrate the existence of universal adversarial audio perturbations that cause mis-transcription of audio signals by automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. We propose an algorithm to find a single quasi-imperceptible perturbation, which when added to any arbitrary speech signal, will most likely fool the victim speech recognition model. Our experiments demonstrate the application of our proposed technique by crafting audio-agnostic universal perturbations for the state-of-the-art ASR system -- Mozilla DeepSpeech. Additionally, we show that such perturbations generalize to a significant extent across models that are not available during training, by performing a transferability test on a WaveNet based ASR system."
Analysis of Deep Clustering as Preprocessing for Automatic Speech Recognition of Sparsely Overlapping Speech,"Significant performance degradation of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems is observed when the audio signal contains cross-talk. One of the recently proposed approaches to solve the problem of multi-speaker ASR is the deep clustering (DPCL) approach. Combining DPCL with a state-of-the-art hybrid acoustic model, we obtain a word error rate (WER) of 16.5 % on the commonly used wsj0-2mix dataset, which is the best performance reported thus far to the best of our knowledge. The wsj0-2mix dataset contains simulated cross-talk where the speech of multiple speakers overlaps for almost the entire utterance. In a more realistic ASR scenario the audio signal contains significant portions of single-speaker speech and only part of the signal contains speech of multiple competing speakers. This paper investigates obstacles of applying DPCL as a preprocessing method for ASR in such a scenario of sparsely overlapping speech. To this end we present a data simulation approach, closely related to the wsj0-2mix dataset, generating sparsely overlapping speech datasets of arbitrary overlap ratio. The analysis of applying DPCL to sparsely overlapping speech is an important interim step between the fully overlapping datasets like wsj0-2mix and more realistic ASR datasets, such as CHiME-5 or AMI."
A Novel Task-Oriented Text Corpus in Silent Speech Recognition and its Natural Language Generation Construction Method,"Millions of people with severe speech disorders around the world may regain their communication capabilities through techniques of silent speech recognition (SSR). Using electroencephalography (EEG) as a biomarker for speech decoding has been popular for SSR. However, the lack of SSR text corpus has impeded the development of this technique. Here, we construct a novel task-oriented text corpus, which is utilized in the field of SSR. In the process of construction, we propose a task-oriented hybrid construction method based on natural language generation algorithm. The algorithm focuses on the strategy of data-to-text generation, and has two advantages including linguistic quality and high diversity. These two advantages use template-based method and deep neural networks respectively. In an SSR experiment with the generated text corpus, analysis results show that the performance of our hybrid construction method outperforms the pure method such as template-based natural language generation or neural natural language generation models."
Very Deep Self-Attention Networks for End-to-End Speech Recognition,"Recently, end-to-end sequence-to-sequence models for speech recognition have gained significant interest in the research community. While previous architecture choices revolve around time-delay neural networks (TDNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks, we propose to use self-attention via the Transformer architecture as an alternative. Our analysis shows that deep Transformer networks with high learning capacity are able to exceed performance from previous end-to-end approaches and even match the conventional hybrid systems. Moreover, we trained very deep models with up to 48 Transformer layers for both encoder and decoders combined with stochastic residual connections, which greatly improve generalizability and training efficiency. The resulting models outperform all previous end-to-end ASR approaches on the Switchboard benchmark. An ensemble of these models achieve 9.9% and 17.7% WER on Switchboard and CallHome test sets respectively. This finding brings our end-to-end models to competitive levels with previous hybrid systems. Further, with model ensembling the Transformers can outperform certain hybrid systems, which are more complicated in terms of both structure and training procedure."
English Broadcast News Speech Recognition by Humans and Machines,"With recent advances in deep learning, considerable attention has been given to achieving automatic speech recognition performance close to human performance on tasks like conversational telephone speech (CTS) recognition. In this paper we evaluate the usefulness of these proposed techniques on broadcast news (BN), a similar challenging task. We also perform a set of recognition measurements to understand how close the achieved automatic speech recognition results are to human performance on this task. On two publicly available BN test sets, DEV04F and RT04, our speech recognition system using LSTM and residual network based acoustic models with a combination of n-gram and neural network language models performs at 6.5% and 5.9% word error rate. By achieving new performance milestones on these test sets, our experiments show that techniques developed on other related tasks, like CTS, can be transferred to achieve similar performance. In contrast, the best measured human recognition performance on these test sets is much lower, at 3.6% and 2.8% respectively, indicating that there is still room for new techniques and improvements in this space, to reach human performance levels."
A Comparison of Online Automatic Speech Recognition Systems and the Nonverbal Responses to Unintelligible Speech,"Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems have proliferated over the recent years to the point that free platforms such as YouTube now provide speech recognition services. Given the wide selection of ASR systems, we contribute to the field of automatic speech recognition by comparing the relative performance of two sets of manual transcriptions and five sets of automatic transcriptions (Google Cloud, IBM Watson, Microsoft Azure, Trint, and YouTube) to help researchers to select accurate transcription services. In addition, we identify nonverbal behaviors that are associated with unintelligible speech, as indicated by high word error rates. We show that manual transcriptions remain superior to current automatic transcriptions. Amongst the automatic transcription services, YouTube offers the most accurate transcription service. For non-verbal behavioral involvement, we provide evidence that the variability of smile intensities from the listener is high (low) when the speaker is clear (unintelligible). These findings are derived from videoconferencing interactions between student doctors and simulated patients; therefore, we contribute towards both the ASR literature and the healthcare communication skills teaching community."
Phonetically-Oriented Word Error Alignment for Speech Recognition Error Analysis in Speech Translation,"We propose a variation to the commonly used Word Error Rate (WER) metric for speech recognition evaluation which incorporates the alignment of phonemes, in the absence of time boundary information. After computing the Levenshtein alignment on words in the reference and hypothesis transcripts, spans of adjacent errors are converted into phonemes with word and syllable boundaries and a phonetic Levenshtein alignment is performed. The aligned phonemes are recombined into aligned words that adjust the word alignment labels in each error region. We demonstrate that our Phonetically-Oriented Word Error Rate (POWER) yields similar scores to WER with the added advantages of better word alignments and the ability to capture one-to-many word alignments corresponding to homophonic errors in speech recognition hypotheses. These improved alignments allow us to better trace the impact of Levenshtein error types on downstream tasks such as speech translation."
Assessing the Tolerance of Neural Machine Translation Systems Against Speech Recognition Errors,"Machine translation systems are conventionally trained on textual resources that do not model phenomena that occur in spoken language. While the evaluation of neural machine translation systems on textual inputs is actively researched in the literature , little has been discovered about the complexities of translating spoken language data with neural models. We introduce and motivate interesting problems one faces when considering the translation of automatic speech recognition (ASR) outputs on neural machine translation (NMT) systems. We test the robustness of sentence encoding approaches for NMT encoder-decoder modeling, focusing on word-based over byte-pair encoding. We compare the translation of utterances containing ASR errors in state-of-the-art NMT encoder-decoder systems against a strong phrase-based machine translation baseline in order to better understand which phenomena present in ASR outputs are better represented under the NMT framework than approaches that represent translation as a linear model."
Speech Emotion Recognition Using Multi-hop Attention Mechanism,"In this paper, we are interested in exploiting textual and acoustic data of an utterance for the speech emotion classification task. The baseline approach models the information from audio and text independently using two deep neural networks (DNNs). The outputs from both the DNNs are then fused for classification. As opposed to using knowledge from both the modalities separately, we propose a framework to exploit acoustic information in tandem with lexical data. The proposed framework uses two bi-directional long short-term memory (BLSTM) for obtaining hidden representations of the utterance. Furthermore, we propose an attention mechanism, referred to as the multi-hop, which is trained to automatically infer the correlation between the modalities. The multi-hop attention first computes the relevant segments of the textual data corresponding to the audio signal. The relevant textual data is then applied to attend parts of the audio signal. To evaluate the performance of the proposed system, experiments are performed in the IEMOCAP dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed technique outperforms the state-of-the-art system by 6.5% relative improvement in terms of weighted accuracy."
Automatic Spelling Correction with Transformer for CTC-based End-to-End Speech Recognition,"Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) based end-to-end speech recognition system usually need to incorporate an external language model by using WFST-based decoding in order to achieve promising results. This is more essential to Mandarin speech recognition since it owns a special phenomenon, namely homophone, which causes a lot of substitution errors. The linguistic information introduced by language model will help to distinguish these substitution errors. In this work, we propose a transformer based spelling correction model to automatically correct errors especially the substitution errors made by CTC-based Mandarin speech recognition system. Specifically, we investigate using the recognition results generated by CTC-based systems as input and the ground-truth transcriptions as output to train a transformer with encoder-decoder architecture, which is much similar to machine translation. Results in a 20,000 hours Mandarin speech recognition task show that the proposed spelling correction model can achieve a CER of 3.41%, which results in 22.9% and 53.2% relative improvement compared to the baseline CTC-based systems decoded with and without language model respectively."
An Investigation of End-to-End Multichannel Speech Recognition for Reverberant and Mismatch Conditions,"Sequence-to-sequence (S2S) modeling is becoming a popular paradigm for automatic speech recognition (ASR) because of its ability to jointly optimize all the conventional ASR components in an end-to-end (E2E) fashion. This report investigates the ability of E2E ASR from standard close-talk to far-field applications by encompassing entire multichannel speech enhancement and ASR components within the S2S model. There have been previous studies on jointly optimizing neural beamforming alongside E2E ASR for denoising. It is clear from both recent challenge outcomes and successful products that far-field systems would be incomplete without solving both denoising and dereverberation simultaneously. This report uses a recently developed architecture for far-field ASR by composing neural extensions of dereverberation and beamforming modules with the S2S ASR module as a single differentiable neural network and also clearly defining the role of each subnetwork. The original implementation of this architecture was successfully applied to the noisy speech recognition task (CHiME-4), while we applied this implementation to noisy reverberant tasks (DIRHA and REVERB). Our investigation shows that the method achieves better performance than conventional pipeline methods on the DIRHA English dataset and comparable performance on the REVERB dataset. It also has additional advantages of being neither iterative nor requiring parallel noisy and clean speech data."
SpecAugment: A Simple Data Augmentation Method for Automatic Speech Recognition,"We present SpecAugment, a simple data augmentation method for speech recognition. SpecAugment is applied directly to the feature inputs of a neural network (i.e., filter bank coefficients). The augmentation policy consists of warping the features, masking blocks of frequency channels, and masking blocks of time steps. We apply SpecAugment on Listen, Attend and Spell networks for end-to-end speech recognition tasks. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on the LibriSpeech 960h and Swichboard 300h tasks, outperforming all prior work. On LibriSpeech, we achieve 6.8% WER on test-other without the use of a language model, and 5.8% WER with shallow fusion with a language model. This compares to the previous state-of-the-art hybrid system of 7.5% WER. For Switchboard, we achieve 7.2%/14.6% on the Switchboard/CallHome portion of the Hub5'00 test set without the use of a language model, and 6.8%/14.1% with shallow fusion, which compares to the previous state-of-the-art hybrid system at 8.3%/17.3% WER."
An Analysis of Speech Enhancement and Recognition Losses in Limited Resources Multi-talker Single Channel Audio-Visual ASR,"In this paper, we analyzed how audio-visual speech enhancement can help to perform the ASR task in a cocktail party scenario. Therefore we considered two simple end-to-end LSTM-based models that perform single-channel audio-visual speech enhancement and phone recognition respectively. Then, we studied how the two models interact, and how to train them jointly affects the final result. We analyzed different training strategies that reveal some interesting and unexpected behaviors. The experiments show that during optimization of the ASR task the speech enhancement capability of the model significantly decreases and vice-versa. Nevertheless the joint optimization of the two tasks shows a remarkable drop of the Phone Error Rate (PER) compared to the audio-visual baseline models trained only to perform phone recognition. We analyzed the behaviors of the proposed models by using two limited-size datasets, and in particular we used the mixed-speech versions of GRID and TCD-TIMIT."
A Multi-Task Learning Framework for Overcoming the Catastrophic Forgetting in Automatic Speech Recognition,"Recently, data-driven based Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems have achieved state-of-the-art results. And transfer learning is often used when those existing systems are adapted to the target domain, e.g., fine-tuning, retraining. However, in the processes, the system parameters may well deviate too much from the previously learned parameters. Thus, it is difficult for the system training process to learn knowledge from target domains meanwhile not forgetting knowledge from the previous learning process, which is called as catastrophic forgetting (CF). In this paper, we attempt to solve the CF problem with the lifelong learning and propose a novel multi-task learning (MTL) training framework for ASR. It considers reserving original knowledge and learning new knowledge as two independent tasks, respectively. On the one hand, we constrain the new parameters not to deviate too far from the original parameters and punish the new system when forgetting original knowledge. On the other hand, we force the new system to solve new knowledge quickly. Then, a MTL mechanism is employed to get the balance between the two tasks. We applied our method to an End2End ASR task and obtained the best performance in both target and original datasets."
Hard Sample Mining for the Improved Retraining of Automatic Speech Recognition,"It is an effective way that improves the performance of the existing Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems by retraining with more and more new training data in the target domain. Recently, Deep Neural Network (DNN) has become a successful model in the ASR field. In the training process of the DNN based methods, a back propagation of error between the transcription and the corresponding annotated text is used to update and optimize the parameters. Thus, the parameters are more influenced by the training samples with a big propagation error than the samples with a small one. In this paper, we define the samples with significant error as the hard samples and try to improve the performance of the ASR system by adding many of them. Unfortunately, the hard samples are sparse in the training data of the target domain, and manually label them is expensive. Therefore, we propose a hard samples mining method based on an enhanced deep multiple instance learning, which can find the hard samples from unlabeled training data by using a small subset of the dataset with manual labeling in the target domain. We applied our method to an End2End ASR task and obtained the best performance."
Mitigating the Impact of Speech Recognition Errors on Spoken Question Answering by Adversarial Domain Adaptation,"Spoken question answering (SQA) is challenging due to complex reasoning on top of the spoken documents. The recent studies have also shown the catastrophic impact of automatic speech recognition (ASR) errors on SQA. Therefore, this work proposes to mitigate the ASR errors by aligning the mismatch between ASR hypotheses and their corresponding reference transcriptions. An adversarial model is applied to this domain adaptation task, which forces the model to learn domain-invariant features the QA model can effectively utilize in order to improve the SQA results. The experiments successfully demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model, and the results are better than the previous best model by 2% EM score."
Unsupervised Speech Domain Adaptation Based on Disentangled Representation Learning for Robust Speech Recognition,"In general, the performance of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems is significantly degraded due to the mismatch between training and test environments. Recently, a deep-learning-based image-to-image translation technique to translate an image from a source domain to a desired domain was presented, and cycle-consistent adversarial network (CycleGAN) was applied to learn a mapping for speech-to-speech conversion from a speaker to a target speaker. However, this method might not be adequate to remove corrupting noise components for robust ASR because it was designed to convert speech itself. In this paper, we propose a domain adaptation method based on generative adversarial nets (GANs) with disentangled representation learning to achieve robustness in ASR systems. In particular, two separated encoders, context and domain encoders, are introduced to learn distinct latent variables. The latent variables allow us to convert the domain of speech according to its context and domain representation. We improved word accuracies by 6.55~15.70\% for the CHiME4 challenge corpus by applying a noisy-to-clean environment adaptation for robust ASR. In addition, similar to the method based on the CycleGAN, this method can be used for gender adaptation in gender-mismatched recognition."
Multimodal Speech Emotion Recognition and Ambiguity Resolution,"Identifying emotion from speech is a non-trivial task pertaining to the ambiguous definition of emotion itself. In this work, we adopt a feature-engineering based approach to tackle the task of speech emotion recognition. Formalizing our problem as a multi-class classification problem, we compare the performance of two categories of models. For both, we extract eight hand-crafted features from the audio signal. In the first approach, the extracted features are used to train six traditional machine learning classifiers, whereas the second approach is based on deep learning wherein a baseline feed-forward neural network and an LSTM-based classifier are trained over the same features. In order to resolve ambiguity in communication, we also include features from the text domain. We report accuracy, f-score, precision, and recall for the different experiment settings we evaluated our models in. Overall, we show that lighter machine learning based models trained over a few hand-crafted features are able to achieve performance comparable to the current deep learning based state-of-the-art method for emotion recognition."
wav2vec: Unsupervised Pre-training for Speech Recognition,"We explore unsupervised pre-training for speech recognition by learning representations of raw audio. wav2vec is trained on large amounts of unlabeled audio data and the resulting representations are then used to improve acoustic model training. We pre-train a simple multi-layer convolutional neural network optimized via a noise contrastive binary classification task. Our experiments on WSJ reduce WER of a strong character-based log-mel filterbank baseline by up to 36% when only a few hours of transcribed data is available. Our approach achieves 2.43% WER on the nov92 test set. This outperforms Deep Speech 2, the best reported character-based system in the literature while using two orders of magnitude less labeled training data."
SPEAK YOUR MIND! Towards Imagined Speech Recognition With Hierarchical Deep Learning,"Speech-related Brain Computer Interface (BCI) technologies provide effective vocal communication strategies for controlling devices through speech commands interpreted from brain signals. In order to infer imagined speech from active thoughts, we propose a novel hierarchical deep learning BCI system for subject-independent classification of 11 speech tokens including phonemes and words. Our novel approach exploits predicted articulatory information of six phonological categories (e.g., nasal, bilabial) as an intermediate step for classifying the phonemes and words, thereby finding discriminative signal responsible for natural speech synthesis. The proposed network is composed of hierarchical combination of spatial and temporal CNN cascaded with a deep autoencoder. Our best models on the KARA database achieve an average accuracy of 83.42% across the six different binary phonological classification tasks, and 53.36% for the individual token identification task, significantly outperforming our baselines. Ultimately, our work suggests the possible existence of a brain imagery footprint for the underlying articulatory movement related to different sounds that can be used to aid imagined speech decoding."
Practical Hidden Voice Attacks against Speech and Speaker Recognition Systems,"Voice Processing Systems (VPSes), now widely deployed, have been made significantly more accurate through the application of recent advances in machine learning. However, adversarial machine learning has similarly advanced and has been used to demonstrate that VPSes are vulnerable to the injection of hidden commands - audio obscured by noise that is correctly recognized by a VPS but not by human beings. Such attacks, though, are often highly dependent on white-box knowledge of a specific machine learning model and limited to specific microphones and speakers, making their use across different acoustic hardware platforms (and thus their practicality) limited. In this paper, we break these dependencies and make hidden command attacks more practical through model-agnostic (blackbox) attacks, which exploit knowledge of the signal processing algorithms commonly used by VPSes to generate the data fed into machine learning systems. Specifically, we exploit the fact that multiple source audio samples have similar feature vectors when transformed by acoustic feature extraction algorithms (e.g., FFTs). We develop four classes of perturbations that create unintelligible audio and test them against 12 machine learning models, including 7 proprietary models (e.g., Google Speech API, Bing Speech API, IBM Speech API, Azure Speaker API, etc), and demonstrate successful attacks against all targets. Moreover, we successfully use our maliciously generated audio samples in multiple hardware configurations, demonstrating effectiveness across both models and real systems. In so doing, we demonstrate that domain-specific knowledge of audio signal processing represents a practical means of generating successful hidden voice command attacks."
From Semi-supervised to Almost-unsupervised Speech Recognition with Very-low Resource by Jointly Learning Phonetic Structures from Audio and Text Embeddings,"Producing a large amount of annotated speech data for training ASR systems remains difficult for more than 95% of languages all over the world which are low-resourced. However, we note human babies start to learn the language by the sounds (or phonetic structures) of a small number of exemplar words, and ""generalize"" such knowledge to other words without hearing a large amount of data. We initiate some preliminary work in this direction. Audio Word2Vec is used to learn the phonetic structures from spoken words (signal segments), while another autoencoder is used to learn the phonetic structures from text words. The relationships among the above two can be learned jointly, or separately after the above two are well trained. This relationship can be used in speech recognition with very low resource. In the initial experiments on the TIMIT dataset, only 2.1 hours of speech data (in which 2500 spoken words were annotated and the rest unlabeled) gave a word error rate of 44.6%, and this number can be reduced to 34.2% if 4.1 hr of speech data (in which 20000 spoken words were annotated) were given. These results are not satisfactory, but a good starting point."
Distributed Deep Learning Strategies For Automatic Speech Recognition,"In this paper, we propose and investigate a variety of distributed deep learning strategies for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and evaluate them with a state-of-the-art Long short-term memory (LSTM) acoustic model on the 2000-hour Switchboard (SWB2000), which is one of the most widely used datasets for ASR performance benchmark. We first investigate what are the proper hyper-parameters (e.g., learning rate) to enable the training with sufficiently large batch size without impairing the model accuracy. We then implement various distributed strategies, including Synchronous (SYNC), Asynchronous Decentralized Parallel SGD (ADPSGD) and the hybrid of the two HYBRID, to study their runtime/accuracy trade-off. We show that we can train the LSTM model using ADPSGD in 14 hours with 16 NVIDIA P100 GPUs to reach a 7.6% WER on the Hub5- 2000 Switchboard (SWB) test set and a 13.1% WER on the CallHome (CH) test set. Furthermore, we can train the model using HYBRID in 11.5 hours with 32 NVIDIA V100 GPUs without loss in accuracy."
Performance Monitoring for End-to-End Speech Recognition,"Measuring performance of an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system without ground-truth could be beneficial in many scenarios, especially with data from unseen domains, where performance can be highly inconsistent. In conventional ASR systems, several performance monitoring (PM) techniques have been well-developed to monitor performance by looking at tri-phone posteriors or pre-softmax activations from neural network acoustic modeling. However, strategies for monitoring more recently developed end-to-end ASR systems have not yet been explored, and so that is the focus of this paper. We adapt previous PM measures (Entropy, M-measure and Auto-encoder) and apply our proposed RNN predictor in the end-to-end setting. These measures utilize the decoder output layer and attention probability vectors, and their predictive power is measured with simple linear models. Our findings suggest that decoder-level features are more feasible and informative than attention-level probabilities for PM measures, and that M-measure on the decoder posteriors achieves the best overall predictive performance with an average prediction error 8.8%. Entropy measures and RNN-based prediction also show competitive predictability, especially for unseen conditions."
Who Needs Words? Lexicon-Free Speech Recognition,"Lexicon-free speech recognition naturally deals with the problem of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. In this paper, we show that character-based language models (LM) can perform as well as word-based LMs for speech recognition, in word error rates (WER), even without restricting the decoding to a lexicon. We study character-based LMs and show that convolutional LMs can effectively leverage large (character) contexts, which is key for good speech recognition performance downstream. We specifically show that the lexicon-free decoding performance (WER) on utterances with OOV words using character-based LMs is better than lexicon-based decoding, both with character or word-based LMs."
Completely Unsupervised Speech Recognition By A Generative Adversarial Network Harmonized With Iteratively Refined Hidden Markov Models,"Producing a large annotated speech corpus for training ASR systems remains difficult for more than 95% of languages all over the world which are low-resourced, but collecting a relatively big unlabeled data set for such languages is more achievable. This is why some initial effort have been reported on completely unsupervised speech recognition learned from unlabeled data only, although with relatively high error rates. In this paper, we develop a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to achieve this purpose, in which a Generator and a Discriminator learn from each other iteratively to improve the performance. We further use a set of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) iteratively refined from the machine generated labels to work in harmony with the GAN. The initial experiments on TIMIT data set achieve an phone error rate of 33.1%, which is 8.5% lower than the previous state-of-the-art."
Adaptation of Hierarchical Structured Models for Speech Act Recognition in Asynchronous Conversation,"We address the problem of speech act recognition (SAR) in asynchronous conversations (forums, emails). Unlike synchronous conversations (e.g., meetings, phone), asynchronous domains lack large labeled datasets to train an effective SAR model. In this paper, we propose methods to effectively leverage abundant unlabeled conversational data and the available labeled data from synchronous domains. We carry out our research in three main steps. First, we introduce a neural architecture based on hierarchical LSTMs and conditional random fields (CRF) for SAR, and show that our method outperforms existing methods when trained on in-domain data only. Second, we improve our initial SAR models by semi-supervised learning in the form of pretrained word embeddings learned from a large unlabeled conversational corpus. Finally, we employ adversarial training to improve the results further by leveraging the labeled data from synchronous domains and by explicitly modeling the distributional shift in two domains."
Adversarial Audio: A New Information Hiding Method and Backdoor for DNN-based Speech Recognition Models,"Audio is an important medium in people's daily life, hidden information can be embedded into audio for covert communication. Current audio information hiding techniques can be roughly classed into time domain-based and transform domain-based techniques. Time domain-based techniques have large hiding capacity but low imperceptibility. Transform domain-based techniques have better imperceptibility, but the hiding capacity is poor. This paper proposes a new audio information hiding technique which shows high hiding capacity and good imperceptibility. The proposed audio information hiding method takes the original audio signal as input and obtains the audio signal embedded with hidden information (called stego audio) through the training of our private automatic speech recognition (ASR) model. Without knowing the internal parameters and structure of the private model, the hidden information can be extracted by the private model but cannot be extracted by public models. We use four other ASR models to extract the hidden information on the stego audios to evaluate the security of the private model. The experimental results show that the proposed audio information hiding technique has a high hiding capacity of 48 cps with good imperceptibility and high security. In addition, our proposed adversarial audio can be used to activate an intrinsic backdoor of DNN-based ASR models, which brings a serious threat to intelligent speakers."
Constrained Output Embeddings for End-to-End Code-Switching Speech Recognition with Only Monolingual Data,"The lack of code-switch training data is one of the major concerns in the development of end-to-end code-switching automatic speech recognition (ASR) models. In this work, we propose a method to train an improved end-to-end code-switching ASR using only monolingual data. Our method encourages the distributions of output token embeddings of monolingual languages to be similar, and hence, promotes the ASR model to easily code-switch between languages. Specifically, we propose to use Jensen-Shannon divergence and cosine distance based constraints. The former will enforce output embeddings of monolingual languages to possess similar distributions, while the later simply brings the centroids of two distributions to be close to each other. Experimental results demonstrate high effectiveness of the proposed method, yielding up to 4.5% absolute mixed error rate improvement on Mandarin-English code-switching ASR task."
Sequence-to-Sequence Speech Recognition with Time-Depth Separable Convolutions,"We propose a fully convolutional sequence-to-sequence encoder architecture with a simple and efficient decoder. Our model improves WER on LibriSpeech while being an order of magnitude more efficient than a strong RNN baseline. Key to our approach is a time-depth separable convolution block which dramatically reduces the number of parameters in the model while keeping the receptive field large. We also give a stable and efficient beam search inference procedure which allows us to effectively integrate a language model. Coupled with a convolutional language model, our time-depth separable convolution architecture improves by more than 22% relative WER over the best previously reported sequence-to-sequence results on the noisy LibriSpeech test set."
Massively Multilingual Adversarial Speech Recognition,"We report on adaptation of multilingual end-to-end speech recognition models trained on as many as 100 languages. Our findings shed light on the relative importance of similarity between the target and pretraining languages along the dimensions of phonetics, phonology, language family, geographical location, and orthography. In this context, experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of two additional pretraining objectives in encouraging language-independent encoder representations: a context-independent phoneme objective paired with a language-adversarial classification objective."
Learning Shared Encoding Representation for End-to-End Speech Recognition Models,"In this work, we learn a shared encoding representation for a multi-task neural network model optimized with connectionist temporal classification (CTC) and conventional framewise cross-entropy training criteria. Our experiments show that the multi-task training not only tackles the complexity of optimizing CTC models such as acoustic-to-word but also results in significant improvement compared to the plain-task training with an optimal setup. Furthermore, we propose to use the encoding representation learned by the multi-task network to initialize the encoder of attention-based models. Thereby, we train a deep attention-based end-to-end model with 10 long short-term memory (LSTM) layers of encoder which produces 12.2\% and 22.6\% word-error-rate on Switchboard and CallHome subsets of the Hub5 2000 evaluation."
End-to-End Visual Speech Recognition for Small-Scale Datasets,"Visual speech recognition models traditionally consist of two stages, feature extraction and classification. Several deep learning approaches have been recently presented aiming to replace the feature extraction stage by automatically extracting features from mouth images. However, research on joint learning of features and classification remains limited. In addition, most of the existing methods require large amounts of data in order to achieve state-of-the-art performance, otherwise they under-perform. In this work, we present an end-to-end visual speech recognition system based on fully-connected layers and Long-Short Memory (LSTM) networks which is suitable for small-scale datasets. The model consists of two streams which extract features directly from the mouth and difference images, respectively. The temporal dynamics in each stream are modelled by a Bidirectional LSTM (BLSTM) and the fusion of the two streams takes place via another BLSTM. An absolute improvement of 0.6%, 3.4%, 3.9%, 11.4% over the state-of-the-art is reported on the OuluVS2, CUAVE, AVLetters and AVLetters2 databases, respectively."
Acoustically Grounded Word Embeddings for Improved Acoustics-to-Word Speech Recognition,"Direct acoustics-to-word (A2W) systems for end-to-end automatic speech recognition are simpler to train, and more efficient to decode with, than sub-word systems. However, A2W systems can have difficulties at training time when data is limited, and at decoding time when recognizing words outside the training vocabulary. To address these shortcomings, we investigate the use of recently proposed acoustic and acoustically grounded word embedding techniques in A2W systems. The idea is based on treating the final pre-softmax weight matrix of an AWE recognizer as a matrix of word embedding vectors, and using an externally trained set of word embeddings to improve the quality of this matrix. In particular we introduce two ideas: (1) Enforcing similarity at training time between the external embeddings and the recognizer weights, and (2) using the word embeddings at test time for predicting out-of-vocabulary words. Our word embedding model is acoustically grounded, that is it is learned jointly with acoustic embeddings so as to encode the words' acoustic-phonetic content; and it is parametric, so that it can embed any arbitrary (potentially out-of-vocabulary) sequence of characters. We find that both techniques improve the performance of an A2W recognizer on conversational telephone speech."
Improving Cross-Corpus Speech Emotion Recognition with Adversarial Discriminative Domain Generalization (ADDoG),"Automatic speech emotion recognition provides computers with critical context to enable user understanding. While methods trained and tested within the same dataset have been shown successful, they often fail when applied to unseen datasets. To address this, recent work has focused on adversarial methods to find more generalized representations of emotional speech. However, many of these methods have issues converging, and only involve datasets collected in laboratory conditions. In this paper, we introduce Adversarial Discriminative Domain Generalization (ADDoG), which follows an easier to train ""meet in the middle"" approach. The model iteratively moves representations learned for each dataset closer to one another, improving cross-dataset generalization. We also introduce Multiclass ADDoG, or MADDoG, which is able to extend the proposed method to more than two datasets, simultaneously. Our results show consistent convergence for the introduced methods, with significantly improved results when not using labels from the target dataset. We also show how, in most cases, ADDoG and MADDoG can be used to improve upon baseline state-of-the-art methods when target dataset labels are added and in-the-wild data are considered. Even though our experiments focus on cross-corpus speech emotion, these methods could be used to remove unwanted factors of variation in other settings."
"Imperceptible, Robust, and Targeted Adversarial Examples for Automatic Speech Recognition","Adversarial examples are inputs to machine learning models designed by an adversary to cause an incorrect output. So far, adversarial examples have been studied most extensively in the image domain. In this domain, adversarial examples can be constructed by imperceptibly modifying images to cause misclassification, and are practical in the physical world. In contrast, current targeted adversarial examples applied to speech recognition systems have neither of these properties: humans can easily identify the adversarial perturbations, and they are not effective when played over-the-air. This paper makes advances on both of these fronts. First, we develop effectively imperceptible audio adversarial examples (verified through a human study) by leveraging the psychoacoustic principle of auditory masking, while retaining 100% targeted success rate on arbitrary full-sentence targets. Next, we make progress towards physical-world over-the-air audio adversarial examples by constructing perturbations which remain effective even after applying realistic simulated environmental distortions."
Towards adversarial learning of speaker-invariant representation for speech emotion recognition,"Speech emotion recognition (SER) has attracted great attention in recent years due to the high demand for emotionally intelligent speech interfaces. Deriving speaker-invariant representations for speech emotion recognition is crucial. In this paper, we propose to apply adversarial training to SER to learn speaker-invariant representations. Our model consists of three parts: a representation learning sub-network with time-delay neural network (TDNN) and LSTM with statistical pooling, an emotion classification network and a speaker classification network. Both the emotion and speaker classification network take the output of the representation learning network as input. Two training strategies are employed: one based on domain adversarial training (DAT) and the other one based on cross-gradient training (CGT). Besides the conventional data set, we also evaluate our proposed models on a much larger publicly available emotion data set with 250 speakers. Evaluation results show that on IEMOCAP, DAT and CGT provides 5.6% and 7.4% improvement respectively, over a baseline system without speaker-invariant representation learning on 5-fold cross validation. On the larger emotion data set, while CGT fails to yield better results than baseline, DAT can still provide 9.8% relative improvement on a standalone test set."
Unsupervised Speech Enhancement Based on Multichannel NMF-Informed Beamforming for Noise-Robust Automatic Speech Recognition,"This paper describes multichannel speech enhancement for improving automatic speech recognition (ASR) in noisy environments. Recently, the minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamforming has widely been used because it works well if the steering vector of speech and the spatial covariance matrix (SCM) of noise are given. To estimating such spatial information, conventional studies take a supervised approach that classifies each time-frequency (TF) bin into noise or speech by training a deep neural network (DNN). The performance of ASR, however, is degraded in an unknown noisy environment. To solve this problem, we take an unsupervised approach that decomposes each TF bin into the sum of speech and noise by using multichannel nonnegative matrix factorization (MNMF). This enables us to accurately estimate the SCMs of speech and noise not from observed noisy mixtures but from separated speech and noise components. In this paper we propose online MVDR beamforming by effectively initializing and incrementally updating the parameters of MNMF. Another main contribution is to comprehensively investigate the performances of ASR obtained by various types of spatial filters, i.e., time-invariant and variant versions of MVDR beamformers and those of rank-1 and full-rank multichannel Wiener filters, in combination with MNMF. The experimental results showed that the proposed method outperformed the state-of-the-art DNN-based beamforming method in unknown environments that did not match training data."
Multi-Geometry Spatial Acoustic Modeling for Distant Speech Recognition,"The use of spatial information with multiple microphones can improve far-field automatic speech recognition (ASR) accuracy. However, conventional microphone array techniques degrade speech enhancement performance when there is an array geometry mismatch between design and test conditions. Moreover, such speech enhancement techniques do not always yield ASR accuracy improvement due to the difference between speech enhancement and ASR optimization objectives. In this work, we propose to unify an acoustic model framework by optimizing spatial filtering and long short-term memory (LSTM) layers from multi-channel (MC) input. Our acoustic model subsumes beamformers with multiple types of array geometry. In contrast to deep clustering methods that treat a neural network as a black box tool, the network encoding the spatial filters can process streaming audio data in real time without the accumulation of target signal statistics. We demonstrate the effectiveness of such MC neural networks through ASR experiments on the real-world far-field data. We show that our two-channel acoustic model can on average reduce word error rates (WERs) by~13.4 and~12.7% compared to a single channel ASR system with the log-mel filter bank energy (LFBE) feature under the matched and mismatched microphone placement conditions, respectively. Our result also shows that our two-channel network achieves a relative WER reduction of over~7.0% compared to conventional beamforming with seven microphones overall."
Frequency Domain Multi-channel Acoustic Modeling for Distant Speech Recognition,"Conventional far-field automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems typically employ microphone array techniques for speech enhancement in order to improve robustness against noise or reverberation. However, such speech enhancement techniques do not always yield ASR accuracy improvement because the optimization criterion for speech enhancement is not directly relevant to the ASR objective. In this work, we develop new acoustic modeling techniques that optimize spatial filtering and long short-term memory (LSTM) layers from multi-channel (MC) input based on an ASR criterion directly. In contrast to conventional methods, we incorporate array processing knowledge into the acoustic model. Moreover, we initialize the network with beamformers' coefficients. We investigate effects of such MC neural networks through ASR experiments on the real-world far-field data where users are interacting with an ASR system in uncontrolled acoustic environments. We show that our MC acoustic model can reduce a word error rate (WER) by~16.5\% compared to a single channel ASR system with the traditional log-mel filter bank energy (LFBE) feature on average. Our result also shows that our network with the spatial filtering layer on two-channel input achieves a relative WER reduction of~9.5\% compared to conventional beamforming with seven microphones."
End-To-End Speech Recognition Using A High Rank LSTM-CTC Based Model,"Long Short Term Memory Connectionist Temporal Classification (LSTM-CTC) based end-to-end models are widely used in speech recognition due to its simplicity in training and efficiency in decoding. In conventional LSTM-CTC based models, a bottleneck projection matrix maps the hidden feature vectors obtained from LSTM to softmax output layer. In this paper, we propose to use a high rank projection layer to replace the projection matrix. The output from the high rank projection layer is a weighted combination of vectors that are projected from the hidden feature vectors via different projection matrices and non-linear activation function. The high rank projection layer is able to improve the expressiveness of LSTM-CTC models. The experimental results show that on Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus and LibriSpeech data set, the proposed method achieves 4%-6% relative word error rate (WER) reduction over the baseline CTC system. They outperform other published CTC based end-to-end (E2E) models under the condition that no external data or data augmentation is applied. Code has been made available at https://github.com/mobvoi/lstm_ctc."
Bridging the Gap Between Monaural Speech Enhancement and Recognition with Distortion-Independent Acoustic Modeling,"Monaural speech enhancement has made dramatic advances since the introduction of deep learning a few years ago. Although enhanced speech has been demonstrated to have better intelligibility and quality for human listeners, feeding it directly to automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems trained with noisy speech has not produced expected improvements in ASR performance. The lack of an enhancement benefit on recognition, or the gap between monaural speech enhancement and recognition, is often attributed to speech distortions introduced in the enhancement process. In this study, we analyze the distortion problem, compare different acoustic models, and investigate a distortion-independent training scheme for monaural speech recognition. Experimental results suggest that distortion-independent acoustic modeling is able to overcome the distortion problem. Such an acoustic model can also work with speech enhancement models different from the one used during training. Moreover, the models investigated in this paper outperform the previous best system on the CHiME-2 corpus."
Speech Recognition with no speech or with noisy speech,"The performance of automatic speech recognition systems(ASR) degrades in the presence of noisy speech. This paper demonstrates that using electroencephalography (EEG) can help automatic speech recognition systems overcome performance loss in the presence of noise. The paper also shows that distillation training of automatic speech recognition systems using EEG features will increase their performance. Finally, we demonstrate the ability to recognize words from EEG with no speech signal on a limited English vocabulary with high accuracy."
KT-Speech-Crawler: Automatic Dataset Construction for Speech Recognition from YouTube Videos,"In this paper, we describe KT-Speech-Crawler: an approach for automatic dataset construction for speech recognition by crawling YouTube videos. We outline several filtering and post-processing steps, which extract samples that can be used for training end-to-end neural speech recognition systems. In our experiments, we demonstrate that a single-core version of the crawler can obtain around 150 hours of transcribed speech within a day, containing an estimated 3.5% word error rate in the transcriptions. Automatically collected samples contain reading and spontaneous speech recorded in various conditions including background noise and music, distant microphone recordings, and a variety of accents and reverberation. When training a deep neural network on speech recognition, we observed around 40\% word error rate reduction on the Wall Street Journal dataset by integrating 200 hours of the collected samples into the training set. The demo (http://emnlp-demo.lakomkin.me/) and the crawler code (https://github.com/EgorLakomkin/KTSpeechCrawler) are publicly available."
Incorporating End-to-End Speech Recognition Models for Sentiment Analysis,"Previous work on emotion recognition demonstrated a synergistic effect of combining several modalities such as auditory, visual, and transcribed text to estimate the affective state of a speaker. Among these, the linguistic modality is crucial for the evaluation of an expressed emotion. However, manually transcribed spoken text cannot be given as input to a system practically. We argue that using ground-truth transcriptions during training and evaluation phases leads to a significant discrepancy in performance compared to real-world conditions, as the spoken text has to be recognized on the fly and can contain speech recognition mistakes. In this paper, we propose a method of integrating an automatic speech recognition (ASR) output with a character-level recurrent neural network for sentiment recognition. In addition, we conduct several experiments investigating sentiment recognition for human-robot interaction in a noise-realistic scenario which is challenging for the ASR systems. We quantify the improvement compared to using only the acoustic modality in sentiment recognition. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on the Multimodal Corpus of Sentiment Intensity (MOSI) by achieving 73,6% accuracy in a binary sentiment classification task, exceeding previously reported results that use only acoustic input. In addition, we set a new state-of-the-art performance on the MOSI dataset (80.4% accuracy, 2% absolute improvement)."
A spelling correction model for end-to-end speech recognition,"Attention-based sequence-to-sequence models for speech recognition jointly train an acoustic model, language model (LM), and alignment mechanism using a single neural network and require only parallel audio-text pairs. Thus, the language model component of the end-to-end model is only trained on transcribed audio-text pairs, which leads to performance degradation especially on rare words. While there have been a variety of work that look at incorporating an external LM trained on text-only data into the end-to-end framework, none of them have taken into account the characteristic error distribution made by the model. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to utilizing text-only data, by training a spelling correction (SC) model to explicitly correct those errors. On the LibriSpeech dataset, we demonstrate that the proposed model results in an 18.6% relative improvement in WER over the baseline model when directly correcting top ASR hypothesis, and a 29.0% relative improvement when further rescoring an expanded n-best list using an external LM."
Learned In Speech Recognition: Contextual Acoustic Word Embeddings,"End-to-end acoustic-to-word speech recognition models have recently gained popularity because they are easy to train, scale well to large amounts of training data, and do not require a lexicon. In addition, word models may also be easier to integrate with downstream tasks such as spoken language understanding, because inference (search) is much simplified compared to phoneme, character or any other sort of sub-word units. In this paper, we describe methods to construct contextual acoustic word embeddings directly from a supervised sequence-to-sequence acoustic-to-word speech recognition model using the learned attention distribution. On a suite of 16 standard sentence evaluation tasks, our embeddings show competitive performance against a word2vec model trained on the speech transcriptions. In addition, we evaluate these embeddings on a spoken language understanding task, and observe that our embeddings match the performance of text-based embeddings in a pipeline of first performing speech recognition and then constructing word embeddings from transcriptions."
Enhanced Robot Speech Recognition Using Biomimetic Binaural Sound Source Localization,"Inspired by the behavior of humans talking in noisy environments, we propose an embodied embedded cognition approach to improve automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems for robots in challenging environments, such as with ego noise, using binaural sound source localization (SSL). The approach is verified by measuring the impact of SSL with a humanoid robot head on the performance of an ASR system. More specifically, a robot orients itself toward the angle where the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of speech is maximized for one microphone before doing an ASR task. First, a spiking neural network inspired by the midbrain auditory system based on our previous work is applied to calculate the sound signal angle. Then, a feedforward neural network is used to handle high levels of ego noise and reverberation in the signal. Finally, the sound signal is fed into an ASR system. For ASR, we use a system developed by our group and compare its performance with and without the support from SSL. We test our SSL and ASR systems on two humanoid platforms with different structural and material properties. With our approach we halve the sentence error rate with respect to the common downmixing of both channels. Surprisingly, the ASR performance is more than two times better when the angle between the humanoid head and the sound source allows sound waves to be reflected most intensely from the pinna to the ear microphone, rather than when sound waves arrive perpendicularly to the membrane."
End-to-end Anchored Speech Recognition,"Voice-controlled house-hold devices, like Amazon Echo or Google Home, face the problem of performing speech recognition of device-directed speech in the presence of interfering background speech, i.e., background noise and interfering speech from another person or media device in proximity need to be ignored. We propose two end-to-end models to tackle this problem with information extracted from the ""anchored segment"". The anchored segment refers to the wake-up word part of an audio stream, which contains valuable speaker information that can be used to suppress interfering speech and background noise. The first method is called ""Multi-source Attention"" where the attention mechanism takes both the speaker information and decoder state into consideration. The second method directly learns a frame-level mask on top of the encoder output. We also explore a multi-task learning setup where we use the ground truth of the mask to guide the learner. Given that audio data with interfering speech is rare in our training data set, we also propose a way to synthesize ""noisy"" speech from ""clean"" speech to mitigate the mismatch between training and test data. Our proposed methods show up to 15% relative reduction in WER for Amazon Alexa live data with interfering background speech without significantly degrading on clean speech."
On the Choice of Modeling Unit for Sequence-to-Sequence Speech Recognition,"In conventional speech recognition, phoneme-based models outperform grapheme-based models for non-phonetic languages such as English. The performance gap between the two typically reduces as the amount of training data is increased. In this work, we examine the impact of the choice of modeling unit for attention-based encoder-decoder models. We conduct experiments on the LibriSpeech 100hr, 460hr, and 960hr tasks, using various target units (phoneme, grapheme, and word-piece); across all tasks, we find that grapheme or word-piece models consistently outperform phoneme-based models, even though they are evaluated without a lexicon or an external language model. We also investigate model complementarity: we find that we can improve WERs by up to 9% relative by rescoring N-best lists generated from a strong word-piece based baseline with either the phoneme or the grapheme model. Rescoring an N-best list generated by the phonemic system, however, provides limited improvements. Further analysis shows that the word-piece-based models produce more diverse N-best hypotheses, and thus lower oracle WERs, than phonemic models."
A Convolutional Neural Network model based on Neutrosophy for Noisy Speech Recognition,"Convolutional neural networks are sensitive to unknown noisy condition in the test phase and so their performance degrades for the noisy data classification task including noisy speech recognition. In this research, a new convolutional neural network (CNN) model with data uncertainty handling; referred as NCNN (Neutrosophic Convolutional Neural Network); is proposed for classification task. Here, speech signals are used as input data and their noise is modeled as uncertainty. In this task, using speech spectrogram, a definition of uncertainty is proposed in neutrosophic (NS) domain. Uncertainty is computed for each Time-frequency point of speech spectrogram as like a pixel. Therefore, uncertainty matrix with the same size of spectrogram is created in NS domain. In the next step, a two parallel paths CNN classification model is proposed. Speech spectrogram is used as input of the first path and uncertainty matrix for the second path. The outputs of two paths are combined to compute the final output of the classifier. To show the effectiveness of the proposed method, it has been compared with conventional CNN on the isolated words of Aurora2 dataset. The proposed method achieves the average accuracy of 85.96 in noisy train data. It is more robust against Car, Airport and Subway noises with accuracies 90, 88 and 81 in test sets A, B and C, respectively. Results show that the proposed method outperforms conventional CNN with the improvement of 6, 5 and 2 percentage in test set A, test set B and test sets C, respectively. It means that the proposed method is more robust against noisy data and handle these data effectively."
Harnessing GANs for Zero-shot Learning of New Classes in Visual Speech Recognition,"Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) is the process of recognizing or interpreting speech by watching the lip movements of the speaker. Recent machine learning based approaches model VSR as a classification problem; however, the scarcity of training data leads to error-prone systems with very low accuracies in predicting unseen classes. To solve this problem, we present a novel approach to zero-shot learning by generating new classes using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and show how the addition of unseen class samples increases the accuracy of a VSR system by a significant margin of 27% and allows it to handle speaker-independent out-of-vocabulary phrases. We also show that our models are language agnostic and therefore capable of seamlessly generating, using English training data, videos for a new language (Hindi). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to show empirical evidence of the use of GANs for generating training samples of unseen classes in the domain of VSR, hence facilitating zero-shot learning. We make the added videos for new classes publicly available along with our code."
Self-Attention Networks for Connectionist Temporal Classification in Speech Recognition,"The success of self-attention in NLP has led to recent applications in end-to-end encoder-decoder architectures for speech recognition. Separately, connectionist temporal classification (CTC) has matured as an alignment-free, non-autoregressive approach to sequence transduction, either by itself or in various multitask and decoding frameworks. We propose SAN-CTC, a deep, fully self-attentional network for CTC, and show it is tractable and competitive for end-to-end speech recognition. SAN-CTC trains quickly and outperforms existing CTC models and most encoder-decoder models, with character error rates (CERs) of 4.7% in 1 day on WSJ eval92 and 2.8% in 1 week on LibriSpeech test-clean, with a fixed architecture and one GPU. Similar improvements hold for WERs after LM decoding. We motivate the architecture for speech, evaluate position and downsampling approaches, and explore how label alphabets (character, phoneme, subword) affect attention heads and performance."
Towards Universal End-to-End Affect Recognition from Multilingual Speech by ConvNets,"We propose an end-to-end affect recognition approach using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that handles multiple languages, with applications to emotion and personality recognition from speech. We lay the foundation of a universal model that is trained on multiple languages at once. As affect is shared across all languages, we are able to leverage shared information between languages and improve the overall performance for each one. We obtained an average improvement of 12.8% on emotion and 10.1% on personality when compared with the same model trained on each language only. It is end-to-end because we directly take narrow-band raw waveforms as input. This allows us to accept as input audio recorded from any source and to avoid the overhead and information loss of feature extraction. It outperforms a similar CNN using spectrograms as input by 12.8% for emotion and 6.3% for personality, based on F-scores. Analysis of the network parameters and layers activation shows that the network learns and extracts significant features in the first layer, in particular pitch, energy and contour variations. Subsequent convolutional layers instead capture language-specific representations through the analysis of supra-segmental features. Our model represents an important step for the development of a fully universal affect recognizer, able to recognize additional descriptors, such as stress, and for the future implementation into affective interactive systems."
Phoneme-Based Persian Speech Recognition,"Undoubtedly, one of the most important issues in computer science is intelligent speech recognition. In these systems, computers try to detect and respond to the speeches they are listening to, like humans. In this research, presenting of a suitable method for the diagnosis of Persian phonemes by AI using the signal processing and classification algorithms have tried. For this purpose, the STFT algorithm has been used to process the audio signals, as well as to detect and classify the signals processed by the deep artificial neural network. At first, educational samples were provided as two phonological phrases in Persian language and then signal processing operations were performed on them. Then the results for the data training have been given to the artificial deep neural network. At the final stage, the experiment was conducted on new sounds."
Machine learning for the recognition of emotion in the speech of couples in psychotherapy using the Stanford Suppes Brain Lab Psychotherapy Dataset,"The automatic recognition of emotion in speech can inform our understanding of language, emotion, and the brain. It also has practical application to human-machine interactive systems. This paper examines the recognition of emotion in naturally occurring speech, where there are no constraints on what is said or the emotions expressed. This task is more difficult than that using data collected in scripted, experimentally controlled settings, and fewer results are published. Our data come from couples in psychotherapy. Video and audio recordings were made of three couples (A, B, C) over 18 hour-long therapy sessions. This paper describes the method used to code the audio recordings for the four emotions of Anger, Sadness, Joy and Tension, plus Neutral, also covering our approach to managing the unbalanced samples that a naturally occurring emotional speech dataset produces. Three groups of acoustic features were used in our analysis: filter-bank, frequency, and voice-quality features. The random forests model classified the features. Recognition rates are reported for each individual, the result of the speaker-dependent models that we built. In each case, the best recognition rates were achieved using the filter-bank features alone. For Couple A, these rates were 90% for the female and 87% for the male for the recognition of three emotions plus Neutral. For Couple B, the rates were 84% for the female and 78% for the male for the recognition of all four emotions plus Neutral. For Couple C, a rate of 88% was achieved for the female for the recognition of the four emotions plus Neutral and 95% for the male for three emotions plus Neutral. For pairwise recognition, the rates ranged from 76% to 99% across the three couples. Our results show that couple therapy is a rich context for the study of emotion in naturally occurring speech."
Improving noise robustness of automatic speech recognition via parallel data and teacher-student learning,"For real-world speech recognition applications, noise robustness is still a challenge. In this work, we adopt the teacher-student (T/S) learning technique using a parallel clean and noisy corpus for improving automatic speech recognition (ASR) performance under multimedia noise. On top of that, we apply a logits selection method which only preserves the k highest values to prevent wrong emphasis of knowledge from the teacher and to reduce bandwidth needed for transferring data. We incorporate up to 8000 hours of untranscribed data for training and present our results on sequence trained models apart from cross entropy trained ones. The best sequence trained student model yields relative word error rate (WER) reductions of approximately 10.1%, 28.7% and 19.6% on our clean, simulated noisy and real test sets respectively comparing to a sequence trained teacher."
Cross Lingual Speech Emotion Recognition: Urdu vs. Western Languages,"Cross-lingual speech emotion recognition is an important task for practical applications. The performance of automatic speech emotion recognition systems degrades in cross-corpus scenarios, particularly in scenarios involving multiple languages or a previously unseen language such as Urdu for which limited or no data is available. In this study, we investigate the problem of cross-lingual emotion recognition for Urdu language and contribute URDU---the first ever spontaneous Urdu-language speech emotion database. Evaluations are performed using three different Western languages against Urdu and experimental results on different possible scenarios suggest various interesting aspects for designing more adaptive emotion recognition system for such limited languages. In results, selecting training instances of multiple languages can deliver comparable results to baseline and augmentation a fraction of testing language data while training can help to boost accuracy for speech emotion recognition. URDU data is publicly available for further research."
Noise Flooding for Detecting Audio Adversarial Examples Against Automatic Speech Recognition,"Neural models enjoy widespread use across a variety of tasks and have grown to become crucial components of many industrial systems. Despite their effectiveness and extensive popularity, they are not without their exploitable flaws. Initially applied to computer vision systems, the generation of adversarial examples is a process in which seemingly imperceptible perturbations are made to an image, with the purpose of inducing a deep learning based classifier to misclassify the image. Due to recent trends in speech processing, this has become a noticeable issue in speech recognition models. In late 2017, an attack was shown to be quite effective against the Speech Commands classification model. Limited-vocabulary speech classifiers, such as the Speech Commands model, are used quite frequently in a variety of applications, particularly in managing automated attendants in telephony contexts. As such, adversarial examples produced by this attack could have real-world consequences. While previous work in defending against these adversarial examples has investigated using audio preprocessing to reduce or distort adversarial noise, this work explores the idea of flooding particular frequency bands of an audio signal with random noise in order to detect adversarial examples. This technique of flooding, which does not require retraining or modifying the model, is inspired by work done in computer vision and builds on the idea that speech classifiers are relatively robust to natural noise. A combined defense incorporating 5 different frequency bands for flooding the signal with noise outperformed other existing defenses in the audio space, detecting adversarial examples with 91.8% precision and 93.5% recall."
An Empirical Analysis of Deep Audio-Visual Models for Speech Recognition,"In this project, we worked on speech recognition, specifically predicting individual words based on both the video frames and audio. Empowered by convolutional neural networks, the recent speech recognition and lip reading models are comparable to human level performance. We re-implemented and made derivations of the state-of-the-art model. Then, we conducted rich experiments including the effectiveness of attention mechanism, more accurate residual network as the backbone with pre-trained weights and the sensitivity of our model with respect to audio input with/without noise."
Unsupervised Speech Recognition via Segmental Empirical Output Distribution Matching,"We consider the problem of training speech recognition systems without using any labeled data, under the assumption that the learner can only access to the input utterances and a phoneme language model estimated from a non-overlapping corpus. We propose a fully unsupervised learning algorithm that alternates between solving two sub-problems: (i) learn a phoneme classifier for a given set of phoneme segmentation boundaries, and (ii) refining the phoneme boundaries based on a given classifier. To solve the first sub-problem, we introduce a novel unsupervised cost function named Segmental Empirical Output Distribution Matching, which generalizes the work in (Liu et al., 2017) to segmental structures. For the second sub-problem, we develop an approximate MAP approach to refining the boundaries obtained from Wang et al. (2017). Experimental results on TIMIT dataset demonstrate the success of this fully unsupervised phoneme recognition system, which achieves a phone error rate (PER) of 41.6%. Although it is still far away from the state-of-the-art supervised systems, we show that with oracle boundaries and matching language model, the PER could be improved to 32.5%.This performance approaches the supervised system of the same model architecture, demonstrating the great potential of the proposed method."
wav2letter++: The Fastest Open-source Speech Recognition System,"This paper introduces wav2letter++, the fastest open-source deep learning speech recognition framework. wav2letter++ is written entirely in C++, and uses the ArrayFire tensor library for maximum efficiency. Here we explain the architecture and design of the wav2letter++ system and compare it to other major open-source speech recognition systems. In some cases wav2letter++ is more than 2x faster than other optimized frameworks for training end-to-end neural networks for speech recognition. We also show that wav2letter++'s training times scale linearly to 64 GPUs, the highest we tested, for models with 100 million parameters. High-performance frameworks enable fast iteration, which is often a crucial factor in successful research and model tuning on new datasets and tasks."
Persian Vowel recognition with MFCC and ANN on PCVC speech dataset,"In this paper a new method for recognition of consonant-vowel phonemes combination on a new Persian speech dataset titled as PCVC (Persian Consonant-Vowel Combination) is proposed which is used to recognize Persian phonemes. In PCVC dataset, there are 20 sets of audio samples from 10 speakers which are combinations of 23 consonant and 6 vowel phonemes of Persian language. In each sample, there is a combination of one vowel and one consonant. First, the consonant phoneme is pronounced and just after it, the vowel phoneme is pronounced. Each sound sample is a frame of 2 seconds of audio. In every 2 seconds, there is an average of 0.5 second speech and the rest is silence. In this paper, the proposed method is the implementations of the MFCC (Mel Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients) on every partitioned sound sample. Then, every train sample of MFCC vector is given to a multilayer perceptron feed-forward ANN (Artificial Neural Network) for training process. At the end, the test samples are examined on ANN model for phoneme recognition. After training and testing process, the results are presented in recognition of vowels. Then, the average percent of recognition for vowel phonemes are computed."
Fully Convolutional Speech Recognition,"Current state-of-the-art speech recognition systems build on recurrent neural networks for acoustic and/or language modeling, and rely on feature extraction pipelines to extract mel-filterbanks or cepstral coefficients. In this paper we present an alternative approach based solely on convolutional neural networks, leveraging recent advances in acoustic models from the raw waveform and language modeling. This fully convolutional approach is trained end-to-end to predict characters from the raw waveform, removing the feature extraction step altogether. An external convolutional language model is used to decode words. On Wall Street Journal, our model matches the current state-of-the-art. On Librispeech, we report state-of-the-art performance among end-to-end models, including Deep Speech 2 trained with 12 times more acoustic data and significantly more linguistic data."
Speech and Speaker Recognition from Raw Waveform with SincNet,"Deep neural networks can learn complex and abstract representations, that are progressively obtained by combining simpler ones. A recent trend in speech and speaker recognition consists in discovering these representations starting from raw audio samples directly. Differently from standard hand-crafted features such as MFCCs or FBANK, the raw waveform can potentially help neural networks discover better and more customized representations. The high-dimensional raw inputs, however, can make training significantly more challenging. This paper summarizes our recent efforts to develop a neural architecture that efficiently processes speech from audio waveforms. In particular, we propose SincNet, a novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that encourages the first layer to discover meaningful filters by exploiting parametrized sinc functions. In contrast to standard CNNs, which learn all the elements of each filter, only low and high cutoff frequencies of band-pass filters are directly learned from data. This inductive bias offers a very compact way to derive a customized front-end, that only depends on some parameters with a clear physical meaning. Our experiments, conducted on both speaker and speech recognition, show that the proposed architecture converges faster, performs better, and is more computationally efficient than standard CNNs."
To Reverse the Gradient or Not: An Empirical Comparison of Adversarial and Multi-task Learning in Speech Recognition,"Transcribed datasets typically contain speaker identity for each instance in the data. We investigate two ways to incorporate this information during training: Multi-Task Learning and Adversarial Learning. In multi-task learning, the goal is speaker prediction; we expect a performance improvement with this joint training if the two tasks of speech recognition and speaker recognition share a common set of underlying features. In contrast, adversarial learning is a means to learn representations invariant to the speaker. We then expect better performance if this learnt invariance helps generalizing to new speakers. While the two approaches seem natural in the context of speech recognition, they are incompatible because they correspond to opposite gradients back-propagated to the model. In order to better understand the effect of these approaches in terms of error rates, we compare both strategies in controlled settings. Moreover, we explore the use of additional untranscribed data in a semi-supervised, adversarial learning manner to improve error rates. Our results show that deep models trained on big datasets already develop invariant representations to speakers without any auxiliary loss. When considering adversarial learning and multi-task learning, the impact on the acoustic model seems minor. However, models trained in a semi-supervised manner can improve error-rates."
On the Inductive Bias of Word-Character-Level Multi-Task Learning for Speech Recognition,"End-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) commonly transcribes audio signals into sequences of characters while its performance is evaluated by measuring the word-error rate (WER). This suggests that predicting sequences of words directly may be helpful instead. However, training with word-level supervision can be more difficult due to the sparsity of examples per label class. In this paper we analyze an end-to-end ASR model that combines a word-and-character representation in a multi-task learning (MTL) framework. We show that it improves on the WER and study how the word-level model can benefit from character-level supervision by analyzing the learned inductive preference bias of each model component empirically. We find that by adding character-level supervision, the MTL model interpolates between recognizing more frequent words (preferred by the word-level model) and shorter words (preferred by the character-level model)."
End-to-end contextual speech recognition using class language models and a token passing decoder,"End-to-end modeling (E2E) of automatic speech recognition (ASR) blends all the components of a traditional speech recognition system into a unified model. Although it simplifies training and decoding pipelines, the unified model is hard to adapt when mismatch exists between training and test data. In this work, we focus on contextual speech recognition, which is particularly challenging for E2E models because it introduces significant mismatch between training and test data. To improve the performance in the presence of complex contextual information, we propose to use class-based language models(CLM) that can populate the classes with contextdependent information in real-time. To enable this approach to scale to a large number of class members and minimize search errors, we propose a token passing decoder with efficient token recombination for E2E systems for the first time. We evaluate the proposed system on general and contextual ASR, and achieve relative 62% Word Error Rate(WER) reduction for contextual ASR without hurting performance for general ASR. We show that the proposed method performs well without modification of the decoding hyper-parameters across tasks, making it a general solution for E2E ASR."
Adversarial Machine Learning And Speech Emotion Recognition: Utilizing Generative Adversarial Networks For Robustness,"Deep learning has undoubtedly offered tremendous improvements in the performance of state-of-the-art speech emotion recognition (SER) systems. However, recent research on adversarial examples poses enormous challenges on the robustness of SER systems by showing the susceptibility of deep neural networks to adversarial examples as they rely only on small and imperceptible perturbations. In this study, we evaluate how adversarial examples can be used to attack SER systems and propose the first black-box adversarial attack on SER systems. We also explore potential defenses including adversarial training and generative adversarial network (GAN) to enhance robustness. Experimental evaluations suggest various interesting aspects of the effective utilization of adversarial examples useful for achieving robustness for SER systems opening up opportunities for researchers to further innovate in this space."
Speech recognition with quaternion neural networks,"Neural network architectures are at the core of powerful automatic speech recognition systems (ASR). However, while recent researches focus on novel model architectures, the acoustic input features remain almost unchanged. Traditional ASR systems rely on multidimensional acoustic features such as the Mel filter bank energies alongside with the first, and second order derivatives to characterize time-frames that compose the signal sequence. Considering that these components describe three different views of the same element, neural networks have to learn both the internal relations that exist within these features, and external or global dependencies that exist between the time-frames. Quaternion-valued neural networks (QNN), recently received an important interest from researchers to process and learn such relations in multidimensional spaces. Indeed, quaternion numbers and QNNs have shown their efficiency to process multidimensional inputs as entities, to encode internal dependencies, and to solve many tasks with up to four times less learning parameters than real-valued models. We propose to investigate modern quaternion-valued models such as convolutional and recurrent quaternion neural networks in the context of speech recognition with the TIMIT dataset. The experiments show that QNNs always outperform real-valued equivalent models with way less free parameters, leading to a more efficient, compact, and expressive representation of the relevant information."
Improved Frequency Modulation Features for Multichannel Distant Speech Recognition,"Frequency modulation features capture the fine structure of speech formants that constitute beneficial and supplementary to the traditional energy-based cepstral features. Improvements have been demonstrated mainly in GMM-HMM systems for small and large vocabulary tasks. Yet, they have limited applications in DNN-HMM systems and Distant Speech Recognition (DSR) tasks. Herein, we elaborate on their integration within state-of-the-art front-end schemes that include post-processing of MFCCs resulting in discriminant and speaker adapted features of large temporal contexts. We explore 1) multichannel demodulation schemes for multi-microphone setups, 2) richer descriptors of frequency modulations, and 3) feature transformation and combination via hierarchical deep networks. We present results for tandem and hybrid recognition with GMM and DNN acoustic models, respectively. The improved modulation features are combined efficiently with MFCCs yielding modest and consistent improvements in multichannel distant speech recognition tasks on reverberant and noisy environments, where recognition rates are far from human performance."
Bytes are All You Need: End-to-End Multilingual Speech Recognition and Synthesis with Bytes,"We present two end-to-end models: Audio-to-Byte (A2B) and Byte-to-Audio (B2A), for multilingual speech recognition and synthesis. Prior work has predominantly used characters, sub-words or words as the unit of choice to model text. These units are difficult to scale to languages with large vocabularies, particularly in the case of multilingual processing. In this work, we model text via a sequence of Unicode bytes, specifically, the UTF-8 variable length byte sequence for each character. Bytes allow us to avoid large softmaxes in languages with large vocabularies, and share representations in multilingual models. We show that bytes are superior to grapheme characters over a wide variety of languages in monolingual end-to-end speech recognition. Additionally, our multilingual byte model outperform each respective single language baseline on average by 4.4% relatively. In Japanese-English code-switching speech, our multilingual byte model outperform our monolingual baseline by 38.6% relatively. Finally, we present an end-to-end multilingual speech synthesis model using byte representations which matches the performance of our monolingual baselines."
Improving speech emotion recognition via Transformer-based Predictive Coding through transfer learning,"I have submitted a new version to arXiv:1910.13806. I forget to choose to replace the old version, but submitted a new one. It's my mistake."
Analysis of DNN Speech Signal Enhancement for Robust Speaker Recognition,"In this work, we present an analysis of a DNN-based autoencoder for speech enhancement, dereverberation and denoising. The target application is a robust speaker verification (SV) system. We start our approach by carefully designing a data augmentation process to cover wide range of acoustic conditions and obtain rich training data for various components of our SV system. We augment several well-known databases used in SV with artificially noised and reverberated data and we use them to train a denoising autoencoder (mapping noisy and reverberated speech to its clean version) as well as an x-vector extractor which is currently considered as state-of-the-art in SV. Later, we use the autoencoder as a preprocessing step for text-independent SV system. We compare results achieved with autoencoder enhancement, multi-condition PLDA training and their simultaneous use. We present a detailed analysis with various conditions of NIST SRE 2010, 2016, PRISM and with re-transmitted data. We conclude that the proposed preprocessing can significantly improve both i-vector and x-vector baselines and that this technique can be used to build a robust SV system for various target domains."
The PyTorch-Kaldi Speech Recognition Toolkit,"The availability of open-source software is playing a remarkable role in the popularization of speech recognition and deep learning. Kaldi, for instance, is nowadays an established framework used to develop state-of-the-art speech recognizers. PyTorch is used to build neural networks with the Python language and has recently spawn tremendous interest within the machine learning community thanks to its simplicity and flexibility.  The PyTorch-Kaldi project aims to bridge the gap between these popular toolkits, trying to inherit the efficiency of Kaldi and the flexibility of PyTorch. PyTorch-Kaldi is not only a simple interface between these software, but it embeds several useful features for developing modern speech recognizers. For instance, the code is specifically designed to naturally plug-in user-defined acoustic models. As an alternative, users can exploit several pre-implemented neural networks that can be customized using intuitive configuration files. PyTorch-Kaldi supports multiple feature and label streams as well as combinations of neural networks, enabling the use of complex neural architectures. The toolkit is publicly-released along with a rich documentation and is designed to properly work locally or on HPC clusters.  Experiments, that are conducted on several datasets and tasks, show that PyTorch-Kaldi can effectively be used to develop modern state-of-the-art speech recognizers."
Streaming End-to-end Speech Recognition For Mobile Devices,"End-to-end (E2E) models, which directly predict output character sequences given input speech, are good candidates for on-device speech recognition. E2E models, however, present numerous challenges: In order to be truly useful, such models must decode speech utterances in a streaming fashion, in real time; they must be robust to the long tail of use cases; they must be able to leverage user-specific context (e.g., contact lists); and above all, they must be extremely accurate. In this work, we describe our efforts at building an E2E speech recognizer using a recurrent neural network transducer. In experimental evaluations, we find that the proposed approach can outperform a conventional CTC-based model in terms of both latency and accuracy in a number of evaluation categories."
Modality Attention for End-to-End Audio-visual Speech Recognition,"Audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) system is thought to be one of the most promising solutions for robust speech recognition, especially in noisy environment. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal attention based method for audio-visual speech recognition which could automatically learn the fused representation from both modalities based on their importance. Our method is realized using state-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence (Seq2seq) architectures. Experimental results show that relative improvements from 2% up to 36% over the auditory modality alone are obtained depending on the different signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). Compared to the traditional feature concatenation methods, our proposed approach can achieve better recognition performance under both clean and noisy conditions. We believe modality attention based end-to-end method can be easily generalized to other multimodal tasks with correlated information."
An Online Attention-based Model for Speech Recognition,"Attention-based end-to-end models such as Listen, Attend and Spell (LAS), simplify the whole pipeline of traditional automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems and become popular in the field of speech recognition. In previous work, researchers have shown that such architectures can acquire comparable results to state-of-the-art ASR systems, especially when using a bidirectional encoder and global soft attention (GSA) mechanism. However, bidirectional encoder and GSA are two obstacles for real-time speech recognition. In this work, we aim to stream LAS baseline by removing the above two obstacles. On the encoder side, we use a latency-controlled (LC) bidirectional structure to reduce the delay of forward computation. Meanwhile, an adaptive monotonic chunk-wise attention (AMoChA) mechanism is proposed to replace GSA for the calculation of attention weight distribution. Furthermore, we propose two methods to alleviate the huge performance degradation when combining LC and AMoChA. Finally, we successfully acquire an online LAS model, LC-AMoChA, which has only 3.5% relative performance reduction to LAS baseline on our internal Mandarin corpus."
Exploring RNN-Transducer for Chinese Speech Recognition,"End-to-end approaches have drawn much attention recently for significantly simplifying the construction of an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system. RNN transducer (RNN-T) is one of the popular end-to-end methods. Previous studies have shown that RNN-T is difficult to train and a very complex training process is needed for a reasonable performance. In this paper, we explore RNN-T for a Chinese large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) task and aim to simplify the training process while maintaining performance. First, a new strategy of learning rate decay is proposed to accelerate the model convergence. Second, we find that adding convolutional layers at the beginning of the network and using ordered data can discard the pre-training process of the encoder without loss of performance. Besides, we design experiments to find a balance among the usage of GPU memory, training circle and model performance. Finally, we achieve 16.9% character error rate (CER) on our test set which is 2% absolute improvement from a strong BLSTM CE system with language model trained on the same text corpus."
Stream attention-based multi-array end-to-end speech recognition,"Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) using multiple microphone arrays has achieved great success in the far-field robustness. Taking advantage of all the information that each array shares and contributes is crucial in this task. Motivated by the advances of joint Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)/attention mechanism in the End-to-End (E2E) ASR, a stream attention-based multi-array framework is proposed in this work. Microphone arrays, acting as information streams, are activated by separate encoders and decoded under the instruction of both CTC and attention networks. In terms of attention, a hierarchical structure is adopted. On top of the regular attention networks, stream attention is introduced to steer the decoder toward the most informative encoders. Experiments have been conducted on AMI and DIRHA multi-array corpora using the encoder-decoder architecture. Compared with the best single-array results, the proposed framework has achieved relative Word Error Rates (WERs) reduction of 3.7% and 9.7% in the two datasets, respectively, which is better than conventional strategies as well."
Multi-encoder multi-resolution framework for end-to-end speech recognition,"Attention-based methods and Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) network have been promising research directions for end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). The joint CTC/Attention model has achieved great success by utilizing both architectures during multi-task training and joint decoding. In this work, we present a novel Multi-Encoder Multi-Resolution (MEMR) framework based on the joint CTC/Attention model. Two heterogeneous encoders with different architectures, temporal resolutions and separate CTC networks work in parallel to extract complimentary acoustic information. A hierarchical attention mechanism is then used to combine the encoder-level information. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, experiments are conducted on Wall Street Journal (WSJ) and CHiME-4, resulting in relative Word Error Rate (WER) reduction of 18.0-32.1%. Moreover, the proposed MEMR model achieves 3.6% WER in the WSJ eval92 test set, which is the best WER reported for an end-to-end system on this benchmark."
Vectorization of hypotheses and speech for faster beam search in encoder decoder-based speech recognition,"Attention-based encoder decoder network uses a left-to-right beam search algorithm in the inference step. The current beam search expands hypotheses and traverses the expanded hypotheses at the next time step. This traversal is implemented using a for-loop program in general, and it leads to speed down of the recognition process. In this paper, we propose a parallelism technique for beam search, which accelerates the search process by vectorizing multiple hypotheses to eliminate the for-loop program. We also propose a technique to batch multiple speech utterances for off-line recognition use, which reduces the for-loop program with regard to the traverse of multiple utterances. This extension is not trivial during beam search unlike during training due to several pruning and thresholding techniques for efficient decoding. In addition, our method can combine scores of external modules, RNNLM and CTC, in a batch as shallow fusion. We achieved 3.7 x speedup compared with the original beam search algorithm by vectoring hypotheses, and achieved 10.5 x speedup by further changing processing unit to GPU."
Sequence-Level Knowledge Distillation for Model Compression of Attention-based Sequence-to-Sequence Speech Recognition,"We investigate the feasibility of sequence-level knowledge distillation of Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) models for Large Vocabulary Continuous Speech Recognition (LVSCR). We first use a pre-trained larger teacher model to generate multiple hypotheses per utterance with beam search. With the same input, we then train the student model using these hypotheses generated from the teacher as pseudo labels in place of the original ground truth labels. We evaluate our proposed method using Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus. It achieved up to  9.8 \times parameter reduction with accuracy loss of up to 7.0\% word-error rate (WER) increase"
Improving End-to-end Speech Recognition with Pronunciation-assisted Sub-word Modeling,"Most end-to-end speech recognition systems model text directly as a sequence of characters or sub-words. Current approaches to sub-word extraction only consider character sequence frequencies, which at times produce inferior sub-word segmentation that might lead to erroneous speech recognition output. We propose pronunciation-assisted sub-word modeling (PASM), a sub-word extraction method that leverages the pronunciation information of a word. Experiments show that the proposed method can greatly improve upon the character-based baseline, and also outperform commonly used byte-pair encoding methods."
Reinforcement Learning Based Speech Enhancement for Robust Speech Recognition,"Conventional deep neural network (DNN)-based speech enhancement (SE) approaches aim to minimize the mean square error (MSE) between enhanced speech and clean reference. The MSE-optimized model may not directly improve the performance of an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system. If the target is to minimize the recognition error, the recognition results should be used to design the objective function for optimizing the SE model. However, the structure of an ASR system, which consists of multiple units, such as acoustic and language models, is usually complex and not differentiable. In this study, we proposed to adopt the reinforcement learning algorithm to optimize the SE model based on the recognition results. We evaluated the propsoed SE system on the Mandarin Chinese broadcast news corpus (MATBN). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively improve the ASR results with a notable 12.40% and 19.23% error rate reductions for signal to noise ratio at 0 dB and 5 dB conditions, respectively."
Integrating Recurrence Dynamics for Speech Emotion Recognition,"We investigate the performance of features that can capture nonlinear recurrence dynamics embedded in the speech signal for the task of Speech Emotion Recognition (SER). Reconstruction of the phase space of each speech frame and the computation of its respective Recurrence Plot (RP) reveals complex structures which can be measured by performing Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA). These measures are aggregated by using statistical functionals over segment and utterance periods. We report SER results for the proposed feature set on three databases using different classification methods. When fusing the proposed features with traditional feature sets, we show an improvement in unweighted accuracy of up to 5.7% and 10.7% on Speaker-Dependent (SD) and Speaker-Independent (SI) SER tasks, respectively, over the baseline. Following a segment-based approach we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on IEMOCAP using a Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network."
Multimodal Grounding for Sequence-to-Sequence Speech Recognition,"Humans are capable of processing speech by making use of multiple sensory modalities. For example, the environment where a conversation takes place generally provides semantic and/or acoustic context that helps us to resolve ambiguities or to recall named entities. Motivated by this, there have been many works studying the integration of visual information into the speech recognition pipeline. Specifically, in our previous work, we propose a multistep visual adaptive training approach which improves the accuracy of an audio-based Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system. This approach, however, is not end-to-end as it requires fine-tuning the whole model with an adaptation layer. In this paper, we propose novel end-to-end multimodal ASR systems and compare them to the adaptive approach by using a range of visual representations obtained from state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks. We show that adaptive training is effective for S2S models leading to an absolute improvement of 1.4% in word error rate. As for the end-to-end systems, although they perform better than baseline, the improvements are slightly less than adaptive training, 0.8 absolute WER reduction in single-best models. Using ensemble decoding, end-to-end models reach a WER of 15% which is the lowest score among all systems."
Analysis of Multilingual Sequence-to-Sequence speech recognition systems,"This paper investigates the applications of various multilingual approaches developed in conventional hidden Markov model (HMM) systems to sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) automatic speech recognition (ASR). On a set composed of Babel data, we first show the effectiveness of multi-lingual training with stacked bottle-neck (SBN) features. Then we explore various architectures and training strategies of multi-lingual seq2seq models based on CTC-attention networks including combinations of output layer, CTC and/or attention component re-training. We also investigate the effectiveness of language-transfer learning in a very low resource scenario when the target language is not included in the original multi-lingual training data. Interestingly, we found multilingual features superior to multilingual models, and this finding suggests that we can efficiently combine the benefits of the HMM system with the seq2seq system through these multilingual feature techniques."
CNN-based MultiChannel End-to-End Speech Recognition for everyday home environments,"Casual conversations involving multiple speakers and noises from surrounding devices are common in everyday environments, which degrades the performances of automatic speech recognition systems. These challenging characteristics of environments are the target of the CHiME-5 challenge. By employing a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based multichannel end-to-end speech recognition system, this study attempts to overcome the presents difficulties in everyday environments. The system comprises of an attention-based encoder-decoder neural network that directly generates a text as an output from a sound input. The multichannel CNN encoder, which uses residual connections and batch renormalization, is trained with augmented data, including white noise injection. The experimental results show that the word error rate is reduced by 8.5% and 0.6% absolute from a single channel end-to-end and the best baseline (LF-MMI TDNN) on the CHiME-5 corpus, respectively."
Bidirectional Quaternion Long-Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks for Speech Recognition,"Recurrent neural networks (RNN) are at the core of modern automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. In particular, long-short term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art results in many speech recognition tasks, due to their efficient representation of long and short term dependencies in sequences of inter-dependent features. Nonetheless, internal dependencies within the element composing multidimensional features are weakly considered by traditional real-valued representations. We propose a novel quaternion long-short term memory (QLSTM) recurrent neural network that takes into account both the external relations between the features composing a sequence, and these internal latent structural dependencies with the quaternion algebra. QLSTMs are compared to LSTMs during a memory copy-task and a realistic application of speech recognition on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) dataset. QLSTM reaches better performances during the two experiments with up to 2.8 times less learning parameters, leading to a more expressive representation of the information."
Unpaired Speech Enhancement by Acoustic and Adversarial Supervision for Speech Recognition,"Many speech enhancement methods try to learn the relationship between noisy and clean speech, obtained using an acoustic room simulator. We point out several limitations of enhancement methods relying on clean speech targets; the goal of this work is proposing an alternative learning algorithm, called acoustic and adversarial supervision (AAS). AAS makes the enhanced output both maximizing the likelihood of transcription on the pre-trained acoustic model and having general characteristics of clean speech, which improve generalization on unseen noisy speeches. We employ the connectionist temporal classification and the unpaired conditional boundary equilibrium generative adversarial network as the loss function of AAS. AAS is tested on two datasets including additive noise without and with reverberation, Librispeech + DEMAND and CHiME-4. By visualizing the enhanced speech with different loss combinations, we demonstrate the role of each supervision. AAS achieves a lower word error rate than other state-of-the-art methods using the clean speech target in both datasets."
Language model integration based on memory control for sequence to sequence speech recognition,"In this paper, we explore several new schemes to train a seq2seq model to integrate a pre-trained LM. Our proposed fusion methods focus on the memory cell state and the hidden state in the seq2seq decoder long short-term memory (LSTM), and the memory cell state is updated by the LM unlike the prior studies. This means the memory retained by the main seq2seq would be adjusted by the external LM. These fusion methods have several variants depending on the architecture of this memory cell update and the use of memory cell and hidden states which directly affects the final label inference. We performed the experiments to show the effectiveness of the proposed methods in a mono-lingual ASR setup on the Librispeech corpus and in a transfer learning setup from a multilingual ASR (MLASR) base model to a low-resourced language. In Librispeech, our best model improved WER by 3.7%, 2.4% for test clean, test other relatively to the shallow fusion baseline, with multi-level decoding. In transfer learning from an MLASR base model to the IARPA Babel Swahili model, the best scheme improved the transferred model on eval set by 9.9%, 9.8% in CER, WER relatively to the 2-stage transfer baseline."
The Marchex 2018 English Conversational Telephone Speech Recognition System,"In this paper, we describe recent performance improvements to the production Marchex speech recognition system for our spontaneous customer-to-business telephone conversations. In our previous work, we focused on in-domain language and acoustic model training. In this work we employ state-of-the-art semi-supervised lattice-free maximum mutual information (LF-MMI) training process which can supervise over full lattices from unlabeled audio. On Marchex English (ME), a modern evaluation set of conversational North American English, we observed a 3.3% (3.2% for agent, 3.6% for caller) reduction in absolute word error rate (WER) with 3x faster decoding speed over the performance of the 2017 production system. We expect this improvement boost Marchex Call Analytics system performance especially for natural language processing pipeline."
Cycle-consistency training for end-to-end speech recognition,"This paper presents a method to train end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) models using unpaired data. Although the end-to-end approach can eliminate the need for expert knowledge such as pronunciation dictionaries to build ASR systems, it still requires a large amount of paired data, i.e., speech utterances and their transcriptions. Cycle-consistency losses have been recently proposed as a way to mitigate the problem of limited paired data. These approaches compose a reverse operation with a given transformation, e.g., text-to-speech (TTS) with ASR, to build a loss that only requires unsupervised data, speech in this example. Applying cycle consistency to ASR models is not trivial since fundamental information, such as speaker traits, are lost in the intermediate text bottleneck. To solve this problem, this work presents a loss that is based on the speech encoder state sequence instead of the raw speech signal. This is achieved by training a Text-To-Encoder model and defining a loss based on the encoder reconstruction error. Experimental results on the LibriSpeech corpus show that the proposed cycle-consistency training reduced the word error rate by 14.7% from an initial model trained with 100-hour paired data, using an additional 360 hours of audio data without transcriptions. We also investigate the use of text-only data mainly for language modeling to further improve the performance in the unpaired data training scenario."
Manner of Articulation Detection using Connectionist Temporal Classification to Improve Automatic Speech Recognition Performance,"Conventionally, the manner of articulations in speech signal are derived using discriminative signal processing techniques or deep learning approaches. However, training such complex systems involves feature extraction, phoneme force alignment and deep neural network training. In our work, we initially detect the manner of articulations without phoneme alignment using an end-to-end manner of articulation modeling based on connectionist temporal classification (CTC). The manner of articulation knowledge is deployed in the conventional character CTC path to regenerate the new character CTC path. The modified manner based character CTC is evaluated on open source speech datasets such as AN4, LibriSpeech and TEDLIUM-2 and it outperforms over the baseline character CTC."
Adversarial Black-Box Attacks on Automatic Speech Recognition Systems using Multi-Objective Evolutionary Optimization,"Fooling deep neural networks with adversarial input have exposed a significant vulnerability in the current state-of-the-art systems in multiple domains. Both black-box and white-box approaches have been used to either replicate the model itself or to craft examples which cause the model to fail. In this work, we propose a framework which uses multi-objective evolutionary optimization to perform both targeted and un-targeted black-box attacks on Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. We apply this framework on two ASR systems: Deepspeech and Kaldi-ASR, which increases the Word Error Rates (WER) of these systems by upto 980%, indicating the potency of our approach. During both un-targeted and targeted attacks, the adversarial samples maintain a high acoustic similarity of 0.98 and 0.97 with the original audio."
Adversarial Training of End-to-end Speech Recognition Using a Criticizing Language Model,"In this paper we proposed a novel Adversarial Training (AT) approach for end-to-end speech recognition using a Criticizing Language Model (CLM). In this way the CLM and the automatic speech recognition (ASR) model can challenge and learn from each other iteratively to improve the performance. Since the CLM only takes the text as input, huge quantities of unpaired text data can be utilized in this approach within end-to-end training. Moreover, AT can be applied to any end-to-end ASR model using any deep-learning-based language modeling frameworks, and compatible with any existing end-to-end decoding method. Initial results with an example experimental setup demonstrated the proposed approach is able to gain consistent improvements efficiently from auxiliary text data under different scenarios."
Training Neural Speech Recognition Systems with Synthetic Speech Augmentation,"Building an accurate automatic speech recognition (ASR) system requires a large dataset that contains many hours of labeled speech samples produced by a diverse set of speakers. The lack of such open free datasets is one of the main issues preventing advancements in ASR research. To address this problem, we propose to augment a natural speech dataset with synthetic speech. We train very large end-to-end neural speech recognition models using the LibriSpeech dataset augmented with synthetic speech. These new models achieve state of the art Word Error Rate (WER) for character-level based models without an external language model."
On the End-to-End Solution to Mandarin-English Code-switching Speech Recognition,"Code-switching (CS) refers to a linguistic phenomenon where a speaker uses different languages in an utterance or between alternating utterances. In this work, we study end-to-end (E2E) approaches to the Mandarin-English code-switching speech recognition (CSSR) task. We first examine the effectiveness of using data augmentation and byte-pair encoding (BPE) subword units. More importantly, we propose a multitask learning recipe, where a language identification task is explicitly learned in addition to the E2E speech recognition task. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient word vocabulary expansion method for language modeling to alleviate data sparsity issues under the code-switching scenario. Experimental results on the SEAME data, a Mandarin-English CS corpus, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods."
Low-Dimensional Bottleneck Features for On-Device Continuous Speech Recognition,"Low power digital signal processors (DSPs) typically have a very limited amount of memory in which to cache data. In this paper we develop efficient bottleneck feature (BNF) extractors that can be run on a DSP, and retrain a baseline large-vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) system to use these BNFs with only a minimal loss of accuracy. The small BNFs allow the DSP chip to cache more audio features while the main application processor is suspended, thereby reducing the overall battery usage. Our presented system is able to reduce the footprint of standard, fixed point DSP spectral features by a factor of 10 without any loss in word error rate (WER) and by a factor of 64 with only a 5.8% relative increase in WER."
Towards End-to-End Code-Switching Speech Recognition,"Code-switching speech recognition has attracted an increasing interest recently, but the need for expert linguistic knowledge has always been a big issue. End-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) simplifies the building of ASR systems considerably by predicting graphemes or characters directly from acoustic input. In the mean time, the need of expert linguistic knowledge is also eliminated, which makes it an attractive choice for code-switching ASR. This paper presents a hybrid CTC-Attention based end-to-end Mandarin-English code-switching (CS) speech recognition system and studies the effect of hybrid CTC-Attention based models, different modeling units, the inclusion of language identification and different decoding strategies on the task of code-switching ASR. On the SEAME corpus, our system achieves a mixed error rate (MER) of 34.24%."
Attention-based sequence-to-sequence model for speech recognition: development of state-of-the-art system on LibriSpeech and its application to non-native English,"Recent research has shown that attention-based sequence-to-sequence models such as Listen, Attend, and Spell (LAS) yield comparable results to state-of-the-art ASR systems on various tasks. In this paper, we describe the development of such a system and demonstrate its performance on two tasks: first we achieve a new state-of-the-art word error rate of 3.43% on the test clean subset of LibriSpeech English data; second on non-native English speech, including both read speech and spontaneous speech, we obtain very competitive results compared to a conventional system built with the most updated Kaldi recipe."
Transferable Positive/Negative Speech Emotion Recognition via Class-wise Adversarial Domain Adaptation,"Speech emotion recognition plays an important role in building more intelligent and human-like agents. Due to the difficulty of collecting speech emotional data, an increasingly popular solution is leveraging a related and rich source corpus to help address the target corpus. However, domain shift between the corpora poses a serious challenge, making domain shift adaptation difficult to function even on the recognition of positive/negative emotions. In this work, we propose class-wise adversarial domain adaptation to address this challenge by reducing the shift for all classes between different corpora. Experiments on the well-known corpora EMODB and Aibo demonstrate that our method is effective even when only a very limited number of target labeled examples are provided."
Hypergraph based semi-supervised learning algorithms applied to speech recognition problem: a novel approach,"Most network-based speech recognition methods are based on the assumption that the labels of two adjacent speech samples in the network are likely to be the same. However, assuming the pairwise relationship between speech samples is not complete. The information a group of speech samples that show very similar patterns and tend to have similar labels is missed. The natural way overcoming the information loss of the above assumption is to represent the feature data of speech samples as the hypergraph. Thus, in this paper, the three un-normalized, random walk, and symmetric normalized hypergraph Laplacian based semi-supervised learning methods applied to hypergraph constructed from the feature data of speech samples in order to predict the labels of speech samples are introduced. Experiment results show that the sensitivity performance measures of these three hypergraph Laplacian based semi-supervised learning methods are greater than the sensitivity performance measures of the Hidden Markov Model method (the current state of the art method applied to speech recognition problem) and graph based semi-supervised learning methods (i.e. the current state of the art network-based method for classification problems) applied to network created from the feature data of speech samples."
Towards End-to-end Automatic Code-Switching Speech Recognition,"Speech recognition in mixed language has difficulties to adapt end-to-end framework due to the lack of data and overlapping phone sets, for example in words such as ""one"" in English and ""wàn"" in Chinese. We propose a CTC-based end-to-end automatic speech recognition model for intra-sentential English-Mandarin code-switching. The model is trained by joint training on monolingual datasets, and fine-tuning with the mixed-language corpus. During the decoding process, we apply a beam search and combine CTC predictions and language model score. The proposed method is effective in leveraging monolingual corpus and detecting language transitions and it improves the CER by 5%."
The Airbus Air Traffic Control speech recognition 2018 challenge: towards ATC automatic transcription and call sign detection,"In this paper, we describe the outcomes of the challenge organized and run by Airbus and partners in 2018. The challenge consisted of two tasks applied to Air Traffic Control (ATC) speech in English: 1) automatic speech-to-text transcription, 2) call sign detection (CSD). The registered participants were provided with 40 hours of speech along with manual transcriptions. Twenty-two teams submitted predictions on a five hour evaluation set. ATC speech processing is challenging for several reasons: high speech rate, foreign-accented speech with a great diversity of accents, noisy communication channels. The best ranked team achieved a 7.62% Word Error Rate and a 82.41% CSD F1-score. Transcribing pilots' speech was found to be twice as harder as controllers' speech. Remaining issues towards solving ATC ASR are also discussed."
Almost-unsupervised Speech Recognition with Close-to-zero Resource Based on Phonetic Structures Learned from Very Small Unpaired Speech and Text Data,"Producing a large amount of annotated speech data for training ASR systems remains difficult for more than 95% of languages all over the world which are low-resourced. However, we note human babies start to learn the language by the sounds of a small number of exemplar words without hearing a large amount of data. We initiate some preliminary work in this direction in this paper. Audio Word2Vec is used to obtain embeddings of spoken words which carry phonetic information extracted from the signals. An autoencoder is used to generate embeddings of text words based on the articulatory features for the phoneme sequences. Both sets of embeddings for spoken and text words describe similar phonetic structures among words in their respective latent spaces. A mapping relation from the audio embeddings to text embeddings actually gives the word-level ASR. This can be learned by aligning a small number of spoken words and the corresponding text words in the embedding spaces. In the initial experiments only 200 annotated spoken words and one hour of speech data without annotation gave a word accuracy of 27.5%, which is low but a good starting point."
Contextual Speech Recognition with Difficult Negative Training Examples,"Improving the representation of contextual information is key to unlocking the potential of end-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR). In this work, we present a novel and simple approach for training an ASR context mechanism with difficult negative examples. The main idea is to focus on proper nouns (e.g., unique entities such as names of people and places) in the reference transcript, and use phonetically similar phrases as negative examples, encouraging the neural model to learn more discriminative representations. We apply our approach to an end-to-end contextual ASR model that jointly learns to transcribe and select the correct context items, and show that our proposed method gives up to 53.1\% relative improvement in word error rate (WER) across several benchmarks."
An improved hybrid CTC-Attention model for speech recognition,"Recently, end-to-end speech recognition with a hybrid model consisting of the connectionist temporal classification(CTC) and the attention encoder-decoder achieved state-of-the-art results. In this paper, we propose a novel CTC decoder structure based on the experiments we conducted and explore the relation between decoding performance and the depth of encoder. We also apply attention smoothing mechanism to acquire more context information for subword-based decoding. Taken together, these strategies allow us to achieve a word error rate(WER) of 4.43% without LM and 3.34% with RNN-LM on the test-clean subset of the LibriSpeech corpora, which by far are the best reported WERs for end-to-end ASR systems on this dataset."
Cascaded CNN-resBiLSTM-CTC: An End-to-End Acoustic Model For Speech Recognition,"Automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks are resolved by end-to-end deep learning models, which benefits us by less preparation of raw data, and easier transformation between languages. We propose a novel end-to-end deep learning model architecture namely cascaded CNN-resBiLSTM-CTC. In the proposed model, we add residual blocks in BiLSTM layers to extract sophisticated phoneme and semantic information together, and apply cascaded structure to pay more attention mining information of hard negative samples. By applying both simple Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) technique and n-gram language model (LM) rescoring method, we manage to achieve word error rate (WER) of 3.41% on LibriSpeech test clean corpora. Furthermore, we propose a new batch-varied method to speed up the training process in length-varied tasks, which result in 25% less training time."
A novel pyramidal-FSMN architecture with lattice-free MMI for speech recognition,"Deep Feedforward Sequential Memory Network (DFSMN) has shown superior performance on speech recognition tasks. Based on this work, we propose a novel network architecture which introduces pyramidal memory structure to represent various context information in different layers. Additionally, res-CNN layers are added in the front to extract more sophisticated features as well. Together with lattice-free maximum mutual information (LF-MMI) and cross entropy (CE) joint training criteria, experimental results show that this approach achieves word error rates (WERs) of 3.62% and 10.89% respectively on Librispeech and LDC97S62 (Switchboard 300 hours) corpora. Furthermore, Recurrent neural network language model (RNNLM) rescoring is applied and a WER of 2.97% is obtained on Librispeech."
Multi-Channel Auto-Encoder for Speech Emotion Recognition,"Inferring emotion status from users' queries plays an important role to enhance the capacity in voice dialogues applications. Even though several related works obtained satisfactory results, the performance can still be further improved. In this paper, we proposed a novel framework named multi-channel auto-encoder (MTC-AE) on emotion recognition from acoustic information. MTC-AE contains multiple local DNNs based on different low-level descriptors with different statistics functions that are partly concatenated together, by which the structure is enabled to consider both local and global features simultaneously. Experiment based on a benchmark dataset IEMOCAP shows that our method significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art results, achieving 64.8\% leave-one-speaker-out unweighted accuracy, which is 2.4\% higher than the best result on this dataset."
Proactive Security: Embedded AI Solution for Violent and Abusive Speech Recognition,"Violence is an epidemic in Brazil and a problem on the rise world-wide. Mobile devices provide communication technologies which can be used to monitor and alert about violent situations. However, current solutions, like panic buttons or safe words, might increase the loss of life in violent situations. We propose an embedded artificial intelligence solution, using natural language and speech processing technology, to silently alert someone who can help in this situation. The corpus used contains 400 positive phrases and 800 negative phrases, totaling 1,200 sentences which are classified using two well-known extraction methods for natural language processing tasks: bag-of-words and word embeddings and classified with a support vector machine. We describe the proof-of-concept product in development with promising results, indicating a path towards a commercial product. More importantly we show that model improvements via word embeddings and data augmentation techniques provide an intrinsically robust model. The final embedded solution also has a small footprint of less than 10 MB."
EdgeSpeechNets: Highly Efficient Deep Neural Networks for Speech Recognition on the Edge,"Despite showing state-of-the-art performance, deep learning for speech recognition remains challenging to deploy in on-device edge scenarios such as mobile and other consumer devices. Recently, there have been greater efforts in the design of small, low-footprint deep neural networks (DNNs) that are more appropriate for edge devices, with much of the focus on design principles for hand-crafting efficient network architectures. In this study, we explore a human-machine collaborative design strategy for building low-footprint DNN architectures for speech recognition through a marriage of human-driven principled network design prototyping and machine-driven design exploration. The efficacy of this design strategy is demonstrated through the design of a family of highly-efficient DNNs (nicknamed EdgeSpeechNets) for limited-vocabulary speech recognition. Experimental results using the Google Speech Commands dataset for limited-vocabulary speech recognition showed that EdgeSpeechNets have higher accuracies than state-of-the-art DNNs (with the best EdgeSpeechNet achieving ~97% accuracy), while achieving significantly smaller network sizes (as much as 7.8x smaller) and lower computational cost (as much as 36x fewer multiply-add operations, 10x lower prediction latency, and 16x smaller memory footprint on a Motorola Moto E phone), making them very well-suited for on-device edge voice interface applications."
3D Feature Pyramid Attention Module for Robust Visual Speech Recognition,"Visual speech recognition is the task to decode the speech content from a video based on visual information, especially the movements of lips. It is also referenced as lipreading. Motivated by two problems existing in lipreading, words with similar pronunciation and the variation of word duration, we propose a novel 3D Feature Pyramid Attention (3D-FPA) module to jointly improve the representation power of features in both the spatial and temporal domains. Specifically, the input features are downsampled for 3 times in both the spatial and temporal dimensions to construct spatiotemporal feature pyramids. Then high-level features are upsampled and combined with low-level features, finally generating a pixel-level soft attention mask to be multiplied with the input features.It enhances the discriminative power of features and exploits the temporal multi-scale information while decoding the visual speeches. Also, this module provides a new method to construct and utilize temporal pyramid structures in video analysis tasks. The field of temporal featrue pyramids are still under exploring compared to the plentiful works on spatial feature pyramids for image analysis tasks. To validate the effectiveness and adaptability of our proposed module, we embed the module in a sentence-level lipreading model, LipNet, with the result of 3.6% absolute decrease in word error rate, and a word-level model, with the result of 1.4% absolute improvement in accuracy."
Multimodal Speech Emotion Recognition Using Audio and Text,"Speech emotion recognition is a challenging task, and extensive reliance has been placed on models that use audio features in building well-performing classifiers. In this paper, we propose a novel deep dual recurrent encoder model that utilizes text data and audio signals simultaneously to obtain a better understanding of speech data. As emotional dialogue is composed of sound and spoken content, our model encodes the information from audio and text sequences using dual recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and then combines the information from these sources to predict the emotion class. This architecture analyzes speech data from the signal level to the language level, and it thus utilizes the information within the data more comprehensively than models that focus on audio features. Extensive experiments are conducted to investigate the efficacy and properties of the proposed model. Our proposed model outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in assigning data to one of four emotion categories (i.e., angry, happy, sad and neutral) when the model is applied to the IEMOCAP dataset, as reflected by accuracies ranging from 68.8% to 71.8%."
"Multilingual sequence-to-sequence speech recognition: architecture, transfer learning, and language modeling","Sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) approach for low-resource ASR is a relatively new direction in speech research. The approach benefits by performing model training without using lexicon and alignments. However, this poses a new problem of requiring more data compared to conventional DNN-HMM systems. In this work, we attempt to use data from 10 BABEL languages to build a multi-lingual seq2seq model as a prior model, and then port them towards 4 other BABEL languages using transfer learning approach. We also explore different architectures for improving the prior multilingual seq2seq model. The paper also discusses the effect of integrating a recurrent neural network language model (RNNLM) with a seq2seq model during decoding. Experimental results show that the transfer learning approach from the multilingual model shows substantial gains over monolingual models across all 4 BABEL languages. Incorporating an RNNLM also brings significant improvements in terms of %WER, and achieves recognition performance comparable to the models trained with twice more training data."
Audio-Visual Speech Recognition With A Hybrid CTC/Attention Architecture,"Recent works in speech recognition rely either on connectionist temporal classification (CTC) or sequence-to-sequence models for character-level recognition. CTC assumes conditional independence of individual characters, whereas attention-based models can provide nonsequential alignments. Therefore, we could use a CTC loss in combination with an attention-based model in order to force monotonic alignments and at the same time get rid of the conditional independence assumption. In this paper, we use the recently proposed hybrid CTC/attention architecture for audio-visual recognition of speech in-the-wild. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that such a hybrid architecture architecture is used for audio-visual recognition of speech. We use the LRS2 database and show that the proposed audio-visual model leads to an 1.3% absolute decrease in word error rate over the audio-only model and achieves the new state-of-the-art performance on LRS2 database (7% word error rate). We also observe that the audio-visual model significantly outperforms the audio-based model (up to 32.9% absolute improvement in word error rate) for several different types of noise as the signal-to-noise ratio decreases."
Non-native children speech recognition through transfer learning,"This work deals with non-native children's speech and investigates both multi-task and transfer learning approaches to adapt a multi-language Deep Neural Network (DNN) to speakers, specifically children, learning a foreign language. The application scenario is characterized by young students learning English and German and reading sentences in these second-languages, as well as in their mother language. The paper analyzes and discusses techniques for training effective DNN-based acoustic models starting from children native speech and performing adaptation with limited non-native audio material. A multi-lingual model is adopted as baseline, where a common phonetic lexicon, defined in terms of the units of the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), is shared across the three languages at hand (Italian, German and English); DNN adaptation methods based on transfer learning are evaluated on significant non-native evaluation sets. Results show that the resulting non-native models allow a significant improvement with respect to a mono-lingual system adapted to speakers of the target language."
Isolated and Ensemble Audio Preprocessing Methods for Detecting Adversarial Examples against Automatic Speech Recognition,"An adversarial attack is an exploitative process in which minute alterations are made to natural inputs, causing the inputs to be misclassified by neural models. In the field of speech recognition, this has become an issue of increasing significance. Although adversarial attacks were originally introduced in computer vision, they have since infiltrated the realm of speech recognition. In 2017, a genetic attack was shown to be quite potent against the Speech Commands Model. Limited-vocabulary speech classifiers, such as the Speech Commands Model, are used in a variety of applications, particularly in telephony; as such, adversarial examples produced by this attack pose as a major security threat. This paper explores various methods of detecting these adversarial examples with combinations of audio preprocessing. One particular combined defense incorporating compressions, speech coding, filtering, and audio panning was shown to be quite effective against the attack on the Speech Commands Model, detecting audio adversarial examples with 93.5% precision and 91.2% recall."
Deep Audio-Visual Speech Recognition,"The goal of this work is to recognise phrases and sentences being spoken by a talking face, with or without the audio. Unlike previous works that have focussed on recognising a limited number of words or phrases, we tackle lip reading as an open-world problem - unconstrained natural language sentences, and in the wild videos. Our key contributions are: (1) we compare two models for lip reading, one using a CTC loss, and the other using a sequence-to-sequence loss. Both models are built on top of the transformer self-attention architecture; (2) we investigate to what extent lip reading is complementary to audio speech recognition, especially when the audio signal is noisy; (3) we introduce and publicly release a new dataset for audio-visual speech recognition, LRS2-BBC, consisting of thousands of natural sentences from British television. The models that we train surpass the performance of all previous work on a lip reading benchmark dataset by a significant margin."
Attention-based Audio-Visual Fusion for Robust Automatic Speech Recognition,"Automatic speech recognition can potentially benefit from the lip motion patterns, complementing acoustic speech to improve the overall recognition performance, particularly in noise. In this paper we propose an audio-visual fusion strategy that goes beyond simple feature concatenation and learns to automatically align the two modalities, leading to enhanced representations which increase the recognition accuracy in both clean and noisy conditions. We test our strategy on the TCD-TIMIT and LRS2 datasets, designed for large vocabulary continuous speech recognition, applying three types of noise at different power ratios. We also exploit state of the art Sequence-to-Sequence architectures, showing that our method can be easily integrated. Results show relative improvements from 7% up to 30% on TCD-TIMIT over the acoustic modality alone, depending on the acoustic noise level. We anticipate that the fusion strategy can easily generalise to many other multimodal tasks which involve correlated modalities.

HASP: A High-Performance Adaptive Mobile Security Enhancement Against Malicious Speech Recognition,"Nowadays, machine learning based Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technique has widely spread in smartphones, home devices, and public facilities. As convenient as this technology can be, a considerable security issue also raises -- the users' speech content might be exposed to malicious ASR monitoring and cause severe privacy leakage. In this work, we propose HASP -- a high-performance security enhancement approach to solve this security issue on mobile devices. Leveraging ASR systems' vulnerability to the adversarial examples, HASP is designed to cast human imperceptible adversarial noises to real-time speech and effectively perturb malicious ASR monitoring by increasing the Word Error Rate (WER). To enhance the practical performance on mobile devices, HASP is also optimized for effective adaptation to the human speech characteristics, environmental noises, and mobile computation scenarios. The experiments show that HASP can achieve optimal real-time security enhancement: it can lead an average WER of 84.55% for perturbing the malicious ASR monitoring, and the data processing speed is 15x to 40x faster compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, HASP can effectively perturb various ASR systems, demonstrating a strong transferability."
Pre-training on high-resource speech recognition improves low-resource speech-to-text translation,"We present a simple approach to improve direct speech-to-text translation (ST) when the source language is low-resource: we pre-train the model on a high-resource automatic speech recognition (ASR) task, and then fine-tune its parameters for ST. We demonstrate that our approach is effective by pre-training on 300 hours of English ASR data to improve Spanish-English ST from 10.8 to 20.2 BLEU when only 20 hours of Spanish-English ST training data are available. Through an ablation study, we find that the pre-trained encoder (acoustic model) accounts for most of the improvement, despite the fact that the shared language in these tasks is the target language text, not the source language audio. Applying this insight, we show that pre-training on ASR helps ST even when the ASR language differs from both source and target ST languages: pre-training on French ASR also improves Spanish-English ST. Finally, we show that the approach improves performance on a true low-resource task: pre-training on a combination of English ASR and French ASR improves Mboshi-French ST, where only 4 hours of data are available, from 3.5 to 7.1 BLEU."
LRS3-TED: a large-scale dataset for visual speech recognition,"This paper introduces a new multi-modal dataset for visual and audio-visual speech recognition. It includes face tracks from over 400 hours of TED and TEDx videos, along with the corresponding subtitles and word alignment boundaries. The new dataset is substantially larger in scale compared to other public datasets that are available for general research."
End-to-end Speech Recognition with Adaptive Computation Steps,"In this paper, we present Adaptive Computation Steps (ACS) algo-rithm, which enables end-to-end speech recognition models to dy-namically decide how many frames should be processed to predict a linguistic output. The model that applies ACS algorithm follows the encoder-decoder framework, while unlike the attention-based mod-els, it produces alignments independently at the encoder side using the correlation between adjacent frames. Thus, predictions can be made as soon as sufficient acoustic information is received, which makes the model applicable in online cases. Besides, a small change is made to the decoding stage of the encoder-decoder framework, which allows the prediction to exploit bidirectional contexts. We verify the ACS algorithm on a Mandarin speech corpus AIShell-1, and it achieves a 31.2% CER in the online occasion, compared to the 32.4% CER of the attention-based model. To fully demonstrate the advantage of ACS algorithm, offline experiments are conducted, in which our ACS model achieves an 18.7% CER, outperforming the attention-based counterpart with the CER of 22.0%."
A neural attention model for speech command recognition,"This paper introduces a convolutional recurrent network with attention for speech command recognition. Attention models are powerful tools to improve performance on natural language, image captioning and speech tasks. The proposed model establishes a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 94.1% on Google Speech Commands dataset V1 and 94.5% on V2 (for the 20-commands recognition task), while still keeping a small footprint of only 202K trainable parameters. Results are compared with previous convolutional implementations on 5 different tasks (20 commands recognition (V1 and V2), 12 commands recognition (V1), 35 word recognition (V1) and left-right (V1)). We show detailed performance results and demonstrate that the proposed attention mechanism not only improves performance but also allows inspecting what regions of the audio were taken into consideration by the network when outputting a given category."
Augmenting Bottleneck Features of Deep Neural Network Employing Motor State for Speech Recognition at Humanoid Robots,"As for the humanoid robots, the internal noise, which is generated by motors, fans and mechanical components when the robot is moving or shaking its body, severely degrades the performance of the speech recognition accuracy. In this paper, a novel speech recognition system robust to ego-noise for humanoid robots is proposed, in which on/off state of the motor is employed as auxiliary information for finding the relevant input features. For this, we consider the bottleneck features, which have been successfully applied to deep neural network (DNN) based automatic speech recognition (ASR) system. When learning the bottleneck features to catch, we first exploit the motor on/off state data as supplementary information in addition to the acoustic features as the input of the first deep neural network (DNN) for preliminary acoustic modeling. Then, the second DNN for primary acoustic modeling employs both the bottleneck features tossed from the first DNN and the acoustics features. When the proposed method is evaluated in terms of phoneme error rate (PER) on TIMIT database, the experimental results show that achieve obvious improvement (11% relative) is achieved by our algorithm over the conventional systems."
Adversarial Attacks Against Automatic Speech Recognition Systems via Psychoacoustic Hiding,"Voice interfaces are becoming accepted widely as input methods for a diverse set of devices. This development is driven by rapid improvements in automatic speech recognition (ASR), which now performs on par with human listening in many tasks. These improvements base on an ongoing evolution of DNNs as the computational core of ASR. However, recent research results show that DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, which allow attackers to force the transcription into a malicious output.  In this paper, we introduce a new type of adversarial examples based on psychoacoustic hiding. Our attack exploits the characteristics of DNN-based ASR systems, where we extend the original analysis procedure by an additional backpropagation step. We use this backpropagation to learn the degrees of freedom for the adversarial perturbation of the input signal, i.e., we apply a psychoacoustic model and manipulate the acoustic signal below the thresholds of human perception. To further minimize the perceptibility of the perturbations, we use forced alignment to find the best fitting temporal alignment between the original audio sample and the malicious target transcription. These extensions allow us to embed an arbitrary audio input with a malicious voice command that is then transcribed by the ASR system, with the audio signal remaining barely distinguishable from the original signal. In an experimental evaluation, we attack the state-of-the-art speech recognition system Kaldi and determine the best performing parameter and analysis setup for different types of input. Our results show that we are successful in up to 98% of cases with a computational effort of fewer than two minutes for a ten-second audio file. Based on user studies, we found that none of our target transcriptions were audible to human listeners, who still understand the original speech content with unchanged accuracy."
Emotion Recognition in Speech using Cross-Modal Transfer in the Wild,"Obtaining large, human labelled speech datasets to train models for emotion recognition is a notoriously challenging task, hindered by annotation cost and label ambiguity. In this work, we consider the task of learning embeddings for speech classification without access to any form of labelled audio. We base our approach on a simple hypothesis: that the emotional content of speech correlates with the facial expression of the speaker. By exploiting this relationship, we show that annotations of expression can be transferred from the visual domain (faces) to the speech domain (voices) through cross-modal distillation. We make the following contributions: (i) we develop a strong teacher network for facial emotion recognition that achieves the state of the art on a standard benchmark; (ii) we use the teacher to train a student, tabula rasa, to learn representations (embeddings) for speech emotion recognition without access to labelled audio data; and (iii) we show that the speech emotion embedding can be used for speech emotion recognition on external benchmark datasets. Code, models and data are available."
Toward domain-invariant speech recognition via large scale training,"Current state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition systems are trained to work in specific `domains', defined based on factors like application, sampling rate and codec. When such recognizers are used in conditions that do not match the training domain, performance significantly drops. This work explores the idea of building a single domain-invariant model for varied use-cases by combining large scale training data from multiple application domains. Our final system is trained using 162,000 hours of speech. Additionally, each utterance is artificially distorted during training to simulate effects like background noise, codec distortion, and sampling rates. Our results show that, even at such a scale, a model thus trained works almost as well as those fine-tuned to specific subsets: A single model can be robust to multiple application domains, and variations like codecs and noise. More importantly, such models generalize better to unseen conditions and allow for rapid adaptation -- we show that by using as little as 10 hours of data from a new domain, an adapted domain-invariant model can match performance of a domain-specific model trained from scratch using 70 times as much data. We also highlight some of the limitations of such models and areas that need addressing in future work."
Densely Connected Convolutional Networks for Speech Recognition,"This paper presents our latest investigation on Densely Connected Convolutional Networks (DenseNets) for acoustic modelling (AM) in automatic speech recognition. DenseN-ets are very deep, compact convolutional neural networks, which have demonstrated incredible improvements over the state-of-the-art results on several data sets in computer vision. Our experimental results show that DenseNet can be used for AM significantly outperforming other neural-based models such as DNNs, CNNs, VGGs. Furthermore, results on Wall Street Journal revealed that with only a half of the training data DenseNet was able to outperform other models trained with the full data set by a large margin."
End-to-end Speech Recognition with Word-based RNN Language Models,"This paper investigates the impact of word-based RNN language models (RNN-LMs) on the performance of end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR). In our prior work, we have proposed a multi-level LM, in which character-based and word-based RNN-LMs are combined in hybrid CTC/attention-based ASR. Although this multi-level approach achieves significant error reduction in the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) task, two different LMs need to be trained and used for decoding, which increase the computational cost and memory usage. In this paper, we further propose a novel word-based RNN-LM, which allows us to decode with only the word-based LM, where it provides look-ahead word probabilities to predict next characters instead of the character-based LM, leading competitive accuracy with less computation compared to the multi-level LM. We demonstrate the efficacy of the word-based RNN-LMs using a larger corpus, LibriSpeech, in addition to WSJ we used in the prior work. Furthermore, we show that the proposed model achieves 5.1 %WER for WSJ Eval'92 test set when the vocabulary size is increased, which is the best WER reported for end-to-end ASR systems on this benchmark."
Deep context: end-to-end contextual speech recognition,"In automatic speech recognition (ASR) what a user says depends on the particular context she is in. Typically, this context is represented as a set of word n-grams. In this work, we present a novel, all-neural, end-to-end (E2E) ASR sys- tem that utilizes such context. Our approach, which we re- fer to as Contextual Listen, Attend and Spell (CLAS) jointly- optimizes the ASR components along with embeddings of the context n-grams. During inference, the CLAS system can be presented with context phrases which might contain out-of- vocabulary (OOV) terms not seen during training. We com- pare our proposed system to a more traditional contextualiza- tion approach, which performs shallow-fusion between inde- pendently trained LAS and contextual n-gram models during beam search. Across a number of tasks, we find that the pro- posed CLAS system outperforms the baseline method by as much as 68% relative WER, indicating the advantage of joint optimization over individually trained components. Index Terms: speech recognition, sequence-to-sequence models, listen attend and spell, LAS, attention, embedded speech recognition."
Dialog-context aware end-to-end speech recognition,"Existing speech recognition systems are typically built at the sentence level, although it is known that dialog context, e.g. higher-level knowledge that spans across sentences or speakers, can help the processing of long conversations. The recent progress in end-to-end speech recognition systems promises to integrate all available information (e.g. acoustic, language resources) into a single model, which is then jointly optimized. It seems natural that such dialog context information should thus also be integrated into the end-to-end models to improve further recognition accuracy. In this work, we present a dialog-context aware speech recognition model, which explicitly uses context information beyond sentence-level information, in an end-to-end fashion. Our dialog-context model captures a history of sentence-level context so that the whole system can be trained with dialog-context information in an end-to-end manner. We evaluate our proposed approach on the Switchboard conversational speech corpus and show that our system outperforms a comparable sentence-level end-to-end speech recognition system."
Normalization Before Shaking Toward Learning Symmetrically Distributed Representation Without Margin in Speech Emotion Recognition,"Regularization is crucial to the success of many practical deep learning models, in particular in a more often than not scenario where there are only a few to a moderate number of accessible training samples. In addition to weight decay, data augmentation and dropout, regularization based on multi-branch architectures, such as Shake-Shake regularization, has been proven successful in many applications and attracted more and more attention. However, beyond model-based representation augmentation, it is unclear how Shake-Shake regularization helps to provide further improvement on classification tasks, let alone the baffling interaction between batch normalization and shaking. In this work, we present our investigation on Shake-Shake regularization, drawing connections to the vicinal risk minimization principle and discriminative feature learning in verification tasks. Furthermore, we identify a strong resemblance between batch normalized residual blocks and batch normalized recurrent neural networks, where both of them share a similar convergence behavior, which could be mitigated by a proper initialization of batch normalization. Based on the findings, our experiments on speech emotion recognition demonstrate simultaneously an improvement on the classification accuracy and a reduction on the generalization gap both with statistical significance."
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation by Adversarial Learning for Robust Speech Recognition,"In this paper, we investigate the use of adversarial learning for unsupervised adaptation to unseen recording conditions, more specifically, single microphone far-field speech. We adapt neural networks based acoustic models trained with close-talk clean speech to the new recording conditions using untranscribed adaptation data. Our experimental results on Italian SPEECON data set show that our proposed method achieves 19.8% relative word error rate (WER) reduction compared to the unadapted models. Furthermore, this adaptation method is beneficial even when performed on data from another language (i.e. French) giving 12.6% relative WER reduction."
A Comparison of Techniques for Language Model Integration in Encoder-Decoder Speech Recognition,"Attention-based recurrent neural encoder-decoder models present an elegant solution to the automatic speech recognition problem. This approach folds the acoustic model, pronunciation model, and language model into a single network and requires only a parallel corpus of speech and text for training. However, unlike in conventional approaches that combine separate acoustic and language models, it is not clear how to use additional (unpaired) text. While there has been previous work on methods addressing this problem, a thorough comparison among methods is still lacking. In this paper, we compare a suite of past methods and some of our own proposed methods for using unpaired text data to improve encoder-decoder models. For evaluation, we use the medium-sized Switchboard data set and the large-scale Google voice search and dictation data sets. Our results confirm the benefits of using unpaired text across a range of methods and data sets. Surprisingly, for first-pass decoding, the rather simple approach of shallow fusion performs best across data sets. However, for Google data sets we find that cold fusion has a lower oracle error rate and outperforms other approaches after second-pass rescoring on the Google voice search data set."
Open Source Automatic Speech Recognition for German,"High quality Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is a prerequisite for speech-based applications and research. While state-of-the-art ASR software is freely available, the language dependent acoustic models are lacking for languages other than English, due to the limited amount of freely available training data. We train acoustic models for German with Kaldi on two datasets, which are both distributed under a Creative Commons license. The resulting model is freely redistributable, lowering the cost of entry for German ASR. The models are trained on a total of 412 hours of German read speech data and we achieve a relative word error reduction of 26% by adding data from the Spoken Wikipedia Corpus to the previously best freely available German acoustic model recipe and dataset. Our best model achieves a word error rate of 14.38 on the Tuda-De test set. Due to the large amount of speakers and the diversity of topics included in the training data, our model is robust against speaker variation and topic shift."
Automatic Speech Recognition for Humanitarian Applications in Somali,"We present our first efforts in building an automatic speech recognition system for Somali, an under-resourced language, using 1.57 hrs of annotated speech for acoustic model training. The system is part of an ongoing effort by the United Nations (UN) to implement keyword spotting systems supporting humanitarian relief programmes in parts of Africa where languages are severely under-resourced. We evaluate several types of acoustic model, including recent neural architectures. Language model data augmentation using a combination of recurrent neural networks (RNN) and long short-term memory neural networks (LSTMs) as well as the perturbation of acoustic data are also considered. We find that both types of data augmentation are beneficial to performance, with our best system using a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), time-delay neural networks (TDNNs) and bi-directional long short term memory (BLSTMs) to achieve a word error rate of 53.75%."
Zero-shot keyword spotting for visual speech recognition in-the-wild,"Visual keyword spotting (KWS) is the problem of estimating whether a text query occurs in a given recording using only video information. This paper focuses on visual KWS for words unseen during training, a real-world, practical setting which so far has received no attention by the community. To this end, we devise an end-to-end architecture comprising (a) a state-of-the-art visual feature extractor based on spatiotemporal Residual Networks, (b) a grapheme-to-phoneme model based on sequence-to-sequence neural networks, and (c) a stack of recurrent neural networks which learn how to correlate visual features with the keyword representation. Different to prior works on KWS, which try to learn word representations merely from sequences of graphemes (i.e. letters), we propose the use of a grapheme-to-phoneme encoder-decoder model which learns how to map words to their pronunciation. We demonstrate that our system obtains very promising visual-only KWS results on the challenging LRS2 database, for keywords unseen during training. We also show that our system outperforms a baseline which addresses KWS via automatic speech recognition (ASR), while it drastically improves over other recently proposed ASR-free KWS methods."
Learning Noise-Invariant Representations for Robust Speech Recognition,"Despite rapid advances in speech recognition, current models remain brittle to superficial perturbations to their inputs. Small amounts of noise can destroy the performance of an otherwise state-of-the-art model. To harden models against background noise, practitioners often perform data augmentation, adding artificially-noised examples to the training set, carrying over the original label. In this paper, we hypothesize that a clean example and its superficially perturbed counterparts shouldn't merely map to the same class --- they should map to the same representation. We propose invariant-representation-learning (IRL): At each training iteration, for each training example,we sample a noisy counterpart. We then apply a penalty term to coerce matched representations at each layer (above some chosen layer). Our key results, demonstrated on the Librispeech dataset are the following: (i) IRL significantly reduces character error rates (CER) on both 'clean' (3.3% vs 6.5%) and 'other' (11.0% vs 18.1%) test sets; (ii) on several out-of-domain noise settings (different from those seen during training), IRL's benefits are even more pronounced. Careful ablations confirm that our results are not simply due to shrinking activations at the chosen layers."
Hierarchical Multitask Learning for CTC-based Speech Recognition,"Previous work has shown that neural encoder-decoder speech recognition can be improved with hierarchical multitask learning, where auxiliary tasks are added at intermediate layers of a deep encoder. We explore the effect of hierarchical multitask learning in the context of connectionist temporal classification (CTC)-based speech recognition, and investigate several aspects of this approach. Consistent with previous work, we observe performance improvements on telephone conversational speech recognition (specifically the Eval2000 test sets) when training a subword-level CTC model with an auxiliary phone loss at an intermediate layer. We analyze the effects of a number of experimental variables (like interpolation constant and position of the auxiliary loss function), performance in lower-resource settings, and the relationship between pretraining and multitask learning. We observe that the hierarchical multitask approach improves over standard multitask training in our higher-data experiments, while in the low-resource settings standard multitask training works well. The best results are obtained by combining hierarchical multitask learning and pretraining, which improves word error rates by 3.4% absolute on the Eval2000 test sets."
A Fast-Converged Acoustic Modeling for Korean Speech Recognition: A Preliminary Study on Time Delay Neural Network,"In this paper, a time delay neural network (TDNN) based acoustic model is proposed to implement a fast-converged acoustic modeling for Korean speech recognition. The TDNN has an advantage in fast-convergence where the amount of training data is limited, due to subsampling which excludes duplicated weights. The TDNN showed an absolute improvement of 2.12% in terms of character error rate compared to feed forward neural network (FFNN) based modelling for Korean speech corpora. The proposed model converged 1.67 times faster than a FFNN-based model did."
Large-Scale Visual Speech Recognition,"This work presents a scalable solution to open-vocabulary visual speech recognition. To achieve this, we constructed the largest existing visual speech recognition dataset, consisting of pairs of text and video clips of faces speaking (3,886 hours of video). In tandem, we designed and trained an integrated lipreading system, consisting of a video processing pipeline that maps raw video to stable videos of lips and sequences of phonemes, a scalable deep neural network that maps the lip videos to sequences of phoneme distributions, and a production-level speech decoder that outputs sequences of words. The proposed system achieves a word error rate (WER) of 40.9% as measured on a held-out set. In comparison, professional lipreaders achieve either 86.4% or 92.9% WER on the same dataset when having access to additional types of contextual information. Our approach significantly improves on other lipreading approaches, including variants of LipNet and of Watch, Attend, and Spell (WAS), which are only capable of 89.8% and 76.8% WER respectively."
Hybrid CTC-Attention based End-to-End Speech Recognition using Subword Units,"In this paper, we present an end-to-end automatic speech recognition system, which successfully employs subword units in a hybrid CTC-Attention based system. The subword units are obtained by the byte-pair encoding (BPE) compression algorithm. Compared to using words as modeling units, using characters or subword units does not suffer from the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) problem. Furthermore, using subword units further offers a capability in modeling longer context than using characters. We evaluate different systems over the LibriSpeech 1000h dataset. The subword-based hybrid CTC-Attention system obtains 6.8% word error rate (WER) on the test_clean subset without any dictionary or external language model. This represents a significant improvement (a 12.8% WER relative reduction) over the character-based hybrid CTC-Attention system."
Emotion Recognition from Speech based on Relevant Feature and Majority Voting,"This paper proposes an approach to detect emotion from human speech employing majority voting technique over several machine learning techniques. The contribution of this work is in two folds: firstly it selects those features of speech which is most promising for classification and secondly it uses the majority voting technique that selects the exact class of emotion. Here, majority voting technique has been applied over Neural Network (NN), Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). Input vector of NN, DT, SVM and KNN consists of various acoustic and prosodic features like Pitch, Mel-Frequency Cepstral coefficients etc. From speech signal many feature have been extracted and only promising features have been selected. To consider a feature as promising, Fast Correlation based feature selection (FCBF) and Fisher score algorithms have been used and only those features are selected which are highly ranked by both of them. The proposed approach has been tested on Berlin dataset of emotional speech [3] and Electromagnetic Articulography (EMA) dataset [4]. The experimental result shows that majority voting technique attains better accuracy over individual machine learning techniques. The employment of the proposed approach can effectively recognize the emotion of human beings in case of social robot, intelligent chat client, call-center of a company etc."
Big-Little Net: An Efficient Multi-Scale Feature Representation for Visual and Speech Recognition,"In this paper, we propose a novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for learning multi-scale feature representations with good tradeoffs between speed and accuracy. This is achieved by using a multi-branch network, which has different computational complexity at different branches. Through frequent merging of features from branches at distinct scales, our model obtains multi-scale features while using less computation. The proposed approach demonstrates improvement of model efficiency and performance on both object recognition and speech recognition tasks,using popular architectures including ResNet and ResNeXt. For object recognition, our approach reduces computation by 33% on object recognition while improving accuracy with 0.9%. Furthermore, our model surpasses state-of-the-art CNN acceleration approaches by a large margin in accuracy and FLOPs reduction. On the task of speech recognition, our proposed multi-scale CNNs save 30% FLOPs with slightly better word error rates, showing good generalization across domains. The codes are available at https://github.com/IBM/BigLittleNet"
On Training Recurrent Networks with Truncated Backpropagation Through Time in Speech Recognition,"Recurrent neural networks have been the dominant models for many speech and language processing tasks. However, we understand little about the behavior and the class of functions recurrent networks can realize. Moreover, the heuristics used during training complicate the analyses. In this paper, we study recurrent networks' ability to learn long-term dependency in the context of speech recognition. We consider two decoding approaches, online and batch decoding, and show the classes of functions to which the decoding approaches correspond. We then draw a connection between batch decoding and a popular training approach for recurrent networks, truncated backpropagation through time. Changing the decoding approach restricts the amount of past history recurrent networks can use for prediction, allowing us to analyze their ability to remember. Empirically, we utilize long-term dependency in subphonetic states, phonemes, and words, and show how the design decisions, such as the decoding approach, lookahead, context frames, and consecutive prediction, characterize the behavior of recurrent networks. Finally, we draw a connection between Markov processes and vanishing gradients. These results have implications for studying the long-term dependency in speech data and how these properties are learned by recurrent networks."
Exploring End-to-End Techniques for Low-Resource Speech Recognition,"In this work we present simple grapheme-based system for low-resource speech recognition using Babel data for Turkish spontaneous speech (80 hours). We have investigated different neural network architectures performance, including fully-convolutional, recurrent and ResNet with GRU. Different features and normalization techniques are compared as well. We also proposed CTC-loss modification using segmentation during training, which leads to improvement while decoding with small beam size. Our best model achieved word error rate of 45.8%, which is the best reported result for end-to-end systems using in-domain data for this task, according to our knowledge."
Evaluating Gammatone Frequency Cepstral Coefficients with Neural Networks for Emotion Recognition from Speech,Current approaches to speech emotion recognition focus on speech features that can capture the emotional content of a speech signal. Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) are one of the most commonly used representations for audio speech recognition and classification. This paper proposes Gammatone Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (GFCCs) as a potentially better representation of speech signals for emotion recognition. The effectiveness of MFCC and GFCC representations are compared and evaluated over emotion and intensity classification tasks with fully connected and recurrent neural network architectures. The results provide evidence that GFCCs outperform MFCCs in speech emotion recognition.
Quaternion Convolutional Neural Networks for End-to-End Automatic Speech Recognition,"Recently, the connectionist temporal classification (CTC) model coupled with recurrent (RNN) or convolutional neural networks (CNN), made it easier to train speech recognition systems in an end-to-end fashion. However in real-valued models, time frame components such as mel-filter-bank energies and the cepstral coefficients obtained from them, together with their first and second order derivatives, are processed as individual elements, while a natural alternative is to process such components as composed entities. We propose to group such elements in the form of quaternions and to process these quaternions using the established quaternion algebra. Quaternion numbers and quaternion neural networks have shown their efficiency to process multidimensional inputs as entities, to encode internal dependencies, and to solve many tasks with less learning parameters than real-valued models. This paper proposes to integrate multiple feature views in quaternion-valued convolutional neural network (QCNN), to be used for sequence-to-sequence mapping with the CTC model. Promising results are reported using simple QCNNs in phoneme recognition experiments with the TIMIT corpus. More precisely, QCNNs obtain a lower phoneme error rate (PER) with less learning parameters than a competing model based on real-valued CNNs."
Speaker Adapted Beamforming for Multi-Channel Automatic Speech Recognition,"This paper presents, in the context of multi-channel ASR, a method to adapt a mask based, statistically optimal beamforming approach to a speaker of interest. The beamforming vector of the statistically optimal beamformer is computed by utilizing speech and noise masks, which are estimated by a neural network. The proposed adaptation approach is based on the integration of the beamformer, which includes the mask estimation network, and the acoustic model of the ASR system. This allows for the propagation of the training error, from the acoustic modeling cost function, all the way through the beamforming operation and through the mask estimation network. By using the results of a first pass recognition and by keeping all other parameters fixed, the mask estimation network can therefore be fine tuned by retraining. Utterances of a speaker of interest can thus be used in a two pass approach, to optimize the beamforming for the speech characteristics of that specific speaker. It is shown that this approach improves the ASR performance of a state-of-the-art multi-channel ASR system on the CHiME-4 data. Furthermore the effect of the adaptation on the estimated speech masks is discussed."
End-to-End Speech Recognition From the Raw Waveform,"State-of-the-art speech recognition systems rely on fixed, hand-crafted features such as mel-filterbanks to preprocess the waveform before the training pipeline. In this paper, we study end-to-end systems trained directly from the raw waveform, building on two alternatives for trainable replacements of mel-filterbanks that use a convolutional architecture. The first one is inspired by gammatone filterbanks (Hoshen et al., 2015; Sainath et al, 2015), and the second one by the scattering transform (Zeghidour et al., 2017). We propose two modifications to these architectures and systematically compare them to mel-filterbanks, on the Wall Street Journal dataset. The first modification is the addition of an instance normalization layer, which greatly improves on the gammatone-based trainable filterbanks and speeds up the training of the scattering-based filterbanks. The second one relates to the low-pass filter used in these approaches. These modifications consistently improve performances for both approaches, and remove the need for a careful initialization in scattering-based trainable filterbanks. In particular, we show a consistent improvement in word error rate of the trainable filterbanks relatively to comparable mel-filterbanks. It is the first time end-to-end models trained from the raw signal significantly outperform mel-filterbanks on a large vocabulary task under clean recording conditions."
On Enhancing Speech Emotion Recognition using Generative Adversarial Networks,"Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have gained a lot of attention from machine learning community due to their ability to learn and mimic an input data distribution. GANs consist of a discriminator and a generator working in tandem playing a min-max game to learn a target underlying data distribution; when fed with data-points sampled from a simpler distribution (like uniform or Gaussian distribution). Once trained, they allow synthetic generation of examples sampled from the target distribution. We investigate the application of GANs to generate synthetic feature vectors used for speech emotion recognition. Specifically, we investigate two set ups: (i) a vanilla GAN that learns the distribution of a lower dimensional representation of the actual higher dimensional feature vector and, (ii) a conditional GAN that learns the distribution of the higher dimensional feature vectors conditioned on the labels or the emotional class to which it belongs. As a potential practical application of these synthetically generated samples, we measure any improvement in a classifier's performance when the synthetic data is used along with real data for training. We perform cross-validation analyses followed by a cross-corpus study."
Extending Recurrent Neural Aligner for Streaming End-to-End Speech Recognition in Mandarin,"End-to-end models have been showing superiority in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). At the same time, the capacity of streaming recognition has become a growing requirement for end-to-end models. Following these trends, an encoder-decoder recurrent neural network called Recurrent Neural Aligner (RNA) has been freshly proposed and shown its competitiveness on two English ASR tasks. However, it is not clear if RNA can be further improved and applied to other spoken language. In this work, we explore the applicability of RNA in Mandarin Chinese and present four effective extensions: In the encoder, we redesign the temporal down-sampling and introduce a powerful convolutional structure. In the decoder, we utilize a regularizer to smooth the output distribution and conduct joint training with a language model. On two Mandarin Chinese conversational telephone speech recognition (MTS) datasets, our Extended-RNA obtains promising performance. Particularly, it achieves 27.7% character error rate (CER), which is superior to current state-of-the-art result on the popular HKUST task."
Study of Semi-supervised Approaches to Improving English-Mandarin Code-Switching Speech Recognition,"In this paper, we present our overall efforts to improve the performance of a code-switching speech recognition system using semi-supervised training methods from lexicon learning to acoustic modeling, on the South East Asian Mandarin-English (SEAME) data. We first investigate semi-supervised lexicon learning approach to adapt the canonical lexicon, which is meant to alleviate the heavily accented pronunciation issue within the code-switching conversation of the local area. As a result, the learned lexicon yields improved performance. Furthermore, we attempt to use semi-supervised training to deal with those transcriptions that are highly mismatched between human transcribers and ASR system. Specifically, we conduct semi-supervised training assuming those poorly transcribed data as unsupervised data. We found the semi-supervised acoustic modeling can lead to improved results. Finally, to make up for the limitation of the conventional n-gram language models due to data sparsity issue, we perform lattice rescoring using neural network language models, and significant WER reduction is obtained."
Multilingual End-to-End Speech Recognition with A Single Transformer on Low-Resource Languages,"Sequence-to-sequence attention-based models integrate an acoustic, pronunciation and language model into a single neural network, which make them very suitable for multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR). In this paper, we are concerned with multilingual speech recognition on low-resource languages by a single Transformer, one of sequence-to-sequence attention-based models. Sub-words are employed as the multilingual modeling unit without using any pronunciation lexicon. First, we show that a single multilingual ASR Transformer performs well on low-resource languages despite of some language confusion. We then look at incorporating language information into the model by inserting the language symbol at the beginning or at the end of the original sub-words sequence under the condition of language information being known during training. Experiments on CALLHOME datasets demonstrate that the multilingual ASR Transformer with the language symbol at the end performs better and can obtain relatively 10.5\% average word error rate (WER) reduction compared to SHL-MLSTM with residual learning. We go on to show that, assuming the language information being known during training and testing, about relatively 12.4\% average WER reduction can be observed compared to SHL-MLSTM with residual learning through giving the language symbol as the sentence start token."
Unsupervised Adaptation with Interpretable Disentangled Representations for Distant Conversational Speech Recognition,"The current trend in automatic speech recognition is to leverage large amounts of labeled data to train supervised neural network models. Unfortunately, obtaining data for a wide range of domains to train robust models can be costly. However, it is relatively inexpensive to collect large amounts of unlabeled data from domains that we want the models to generalize to. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised adaptation method that learns to synthesize labeled data for the target domain from unlabeled in-domain data and labeled out-of-domain data. We first learn without supervision an interpretable latent representation of speech that encodes linguistic and nuisance factors (e.g., speaker and channel) using different latent variables. To transform a labeled out-of-domain utterance without altering its transcript, we transform the latent nuisance variables while maintaining the linguistic variables. To demonstrate our approach, we focus on a channel mismatch setting, where the domain of interest is distant conversational speech, and labels are only available for close-talking speech. Our proposed method is evaluated on the AMI dataset, outperforming all baselines and bridging the gap between unadapted and in-domain models by over 77% without using any parallel data."
"A Study of Enhancement, Augmentation, and Autoencoder Methods for Domain Adaptation in Distant Speech Recognition","Speech recognizers trained on close-talking speech do not generalize to distant speech and the word error rate degradation can be as large as 40% absolute. Most studies focus on tackling distant speech recognition as a separate problem, leaving little effort to adapting close-talking speech recognizers to distant speech. In this work, we review several approaches from a domain adaptation perspective. These approaches, including speech enhancement, multi-condition training, data augmentation, and autoencoders, all involve a transformation of the data between domains. We conduct experiments on the AMI data set, where these approaches can be realized under the same controlled setting. These approaches lead to different amounts of improvement under their respective assumptions. The purpose of this paper is to quantify and characterize the performance gap between the two domains, setting up the basis for studying adaptation of speech recognizers from close-talking speech to distant speech. Our results also have implications for improving distant speech recognition."
Domain Adversarial Training for Accented Speech Recognition,"In this paper, we propose a domain adversarial training (DAT) algorithm to alleviate the accented speech recognition problem. In order to reduce the mismatch between labeled source domain data (""standard"" accent) and unlabeled target domain data (with heavy accents), we augment the learning objective for a Kaldi TDNN network with a domain adversarial training (DAT) objective to encourage the model to learn accent-invariant features. In experiments with three Mandarin accents, we show that DAT yields up to 7.45% relative character error rate reduction when we do not have transcriptions of the accented speech, compared with the baseline trained on standard accent data only. We also find a benefit from DAT when used in combination with training from automatic transcriptions on the accented data. Furthermore, we find that DAT is superior to multi-task learning for accented speech recognition."
Training Augmentation with Adversarial Examples for Robust Speech Recognition,"This paper explores the use of adversarial examples in training speech recognition systems to increase robustness of deep neural network acoustic models. During training, the fast gradient sign method is used to generate adversarial examples augmenting the original training data. Different from conventional data augmentation based on data transformations, the examples are dynamically generated based on current acoustic model parameters. We assess the impact of adversarial data augmentation in experiments on the Aurora-4 and CHiME-4 single-channel tasks, showing improved robustness against noise and channel variation. Further improvement is obtained when combining adversarial examples with teacher/student training, leading to a 23% relative word error rate reduction on Aurora-4."
Adversarial Auto-encoders for Speech Based Emotion Recognition,"Recently, generative adversarial networks and adversarial autoencoders have gained a lot of attention in machine learning community due to their exceptional performance in tasks such as digit classification and face recognition. They map the autoencoder's bottleneck layer output (termed as code vectors) to different noise Probability Distribution Functions (PDFs), that can be further regularized to cluster based on class information. In addition, they also allow a generation of synthetic samples by sampling the code vectors from the mapped PDFs. Inspired by these properties, we investigate the application of adversarial autoencoders to the domain of emotion recognition. Specifically, we conduct experiments on the following two aspects: (i) their ability to encode high dimensional feature vector representations for emotional utterances into a compressed space (with a minimal loss of emotion class discriminability in the compressed space), and (ii) their ability to regenerate synthetic samples in the original feature space, to be later used for purposes such as training emotion recognition classifiers. We demonstrate the promise of adversarial autoencoders with regards to these aspects on the Interactive Emotional Dyadic Motion Capture (IEMOCAP) corpus and present our analysis."
Attention Based Fully Convolutional Network for Speech Emotion Recognition,"Speech emotion recognition is a challenging task for three main reasons: 1) human emotion is abstract, which means it is hard to distinguish; 2) in general, human emotion can only be detected in some specific moments during a long utterance; 3) speech data with emotional labeling is usually limited. In this paper, we present a novel attention based fully convolutional network for speech emotion recognition. We employ fully convolutional network as it is able to handle variable-length speech, free of the demand of segmentation to keep critical information not lost. The proposed attention mechanism can make our model be aware of which time-frequency region of speech spectrogram is more emotion-relevant. Considering limited data, the transfer learning is also adapted to improve the accuracy. Especially, it's interesting to observe obvious improvement obtained with natural scene image based pre-trained model. Validated on the publicly available IEMOCAP corpus, the proposed model outperformed the state-of-the-art methods with a weighted accuracy of 70.4% and an unweighted accuracy of 63.9% respectively."
Automatic context window composition for distant speech recognition,"Distant speech recognition is being revolutionized by deep learning, that has contributed to significantly outperform previous HMM-GMM systems. A key aspect behind the rapid rise and success of DNNs is their ability to better manage large time contexts. With this regard, asymmetric context windows that embed more past than future frames have been recently used with feed-forward neural networks. This context configuration turns out to be useful not only to address low-latency speech recognition, but also to boost the recognition performance under reverberant conditions. This paper investigates on the mechanisms occurring inside DNNs, which lead to an effective application of asymmetric contexts.In particular, we propose a novel method for automatic context window composition based on a gradient analysis. The experiments, performed with different acoustic environments, features, DNN architectures, microphone settings, and recognition tasks show that our simple and efficient strategy leads to a less redundant frame configuration, which makes DNN training more effective in reverberant scenarios."
Mixed-Precision Training for NLP and Speech Recognition with OpenSeq2Seq,"We present OpenSeq2Seq - a TensorFlow-based toolkit for training sequence-to-sequence models that features distributed and mixed-precision training. Benchmarks on machine translation and speech recognition tasks show that models built using OpenSeq2Seq give state-of-the-art performance at 1.5-3x less training time. OpenSeq2Seq currently provides building blocks for models that solve a wide range of tasks including neural machine translation, automatic speech recognition, and speech synthesis."
Curriculum Learning for Speech Emotion Recognition from Crowdsourced Labels,"This study introduces a method to design a curriculum for machine-learning to maximize the efficiency during the training process of deep neural networks (DNNs) for speech emotion recognition. Previous studies in other machine-learning problems have shown the benefits of training a classifier following a curriculum where samples are gradually presented in increasing level of difficulty. For speech emotion recognition, the challenge is to establish a natural order of difficulty in the training set to create the curriculum. We address this problem by assuming that ambiguous samples for humans are also ambiguous for computers. Speech samples are often annotated by multiple evaluators to account for differences in emotion perception across individuals. While some sentences with clear emotional content are consistently annotated, sentences with more ambiguous emotional content present important disagreement between individual evaluations. We propose to use the disagreement between evaluators as a measure of difficulty for the classification task. We propose metrics that quantify the inter-evaluation agreement to define the curriculum for regression problems and binary and multi-class classification problems. The experimental results consistently show that relying on a curriculum based on agreement between human judgments leads to statistically significant improvements over baselines trained without a curriculum."
Adversarial Learning of Raw Speech Features for Domain Invariant Speech Recognition,"Recent advances in neural network based acoustic modelling have shown significant improvements in automatic speech recognition (ASR) performance. In order for acoustic models to be able to handle large acoustic variability, large amounts of labeled data is necessary, which are often expensive to obtain. This paper explores the application of adversarial training to learn features from raw speech that are invariant to acoustic variability. This acoustic variability is referred to as a domain shift in this paper. The experimental study presented in this paper leverages the architecture of Domain Adversarial Neural Networks (DANNs) [1] which uses data from two different domains. The DANN is a Y-shaped network that consists of a multi-layer CNN feature extractor module that is common to a label (senone) classifier and a so-called domain classifier. The utility of DANNs is evaluated on multiple datasets with domain shifts caused due to differences in gender and speaker accents. Promising empirical results indicate the strength of adversarial training for unsupervised domain adaptation in ASR, thereby emphasizing the ability of DANNs to learn domain invariant features from raw speech."
Convolutional Attention Networks for Multimodal Emotion Recognition from Speech and Text Data,"Emotion recognition has become a popular topic of interest, especially in the field of human computer interaction. Previous works involve unimodal analysis of emotion, while recent efforts focus on multi-modal emotion recognition from vision and speech. In this paper, we propose a new method of learning about the hidden representations between just speech and text data using convolutional attention networks. Compared to the shallow model which employs simple concatenation of feature vectors, the proposed attention model performs much better in classifying emotion from speech and text data contained in the CMU-MOSEI dataset."
A Comparison of Modeling Units in Sequence-to-Sequence Speech Recognition with the Transformer on Mandarin Chinese,"The choice of modeling units is critical to automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks. Conventional ASR systems typically choose context-dependent states (CD-states) or context-dependent phonemes (CD-phonemes) as their modeling units. However, it has been challenged by sequence-to-sequence attention-based models, which integrate an acoustic, pronunciation and language model into a single neural network. On English ASR tasks, previous attempts have already shown that the modeling unit of graphemes can outperform that of phonemes by sequence-to-sequence attention-based model.  In this paper, we are concerned with modeling units on Mandarin Chinese ASR tasks using sequence-to-sequence attention-based models with the Transformer. Five modeling units are explored including context-independent phonemes (CI-phonemes), syllables, words, sub-words and characters. Experiments on HKUST datasets demonstrate that the lexicon free modeling units can outperform lexicon related modeling units in terms of character error rate (CER). Among five modeling units, character based model performs best and establishes a new state-of-the-art CER of 26.64\% on HKUST datasets without a hand-designed lexicon and an extra language model integration, which corresponds to a 4.8\% relative improvement over the existing best CER of 28.0\% by the joint CTC-attention based encoder-decoder network."
A Purely End-to-end System for Multi-speaker Speech Recognition,"Recently, there has been growing interest in multi-speaker speech recognition, where the utterances of multiple speakers are recognized from their mixture. Promising techniques have been proposed for this task, but earlier works have required additional training data such as isolated source signals or senone alignments for effective learning. In this paper, we propose a new sequence-to-sequence framework to directly decode multiple label sequences from a single speech sequence by unifying source separation and speech recognition functions in an end-to-end manner. We further propose a new objective function to improve the contrast between the hidden vectors to avoid generating similar hypotheses. Experimental results show that the model is directly able to learn a mapping from a speech mixture to multiple label sequences, achieving 83.1 % relative improvement compared to a model trained without the proposed objective. Interestingly, the results are comparable to those produced by previous end-to-end works featuring explicit separation and recognition modules."
RETURNN as a Generic Flexible Neural Toolkit with Application to Translation and Speech Recognition,"We compare the fast training and decoding speed of RETURNN of attention models for translation, due to fast CUDA LSTM kernels, and a fast pure TensorFlow beam search decoder. We show that a layer-wise pretraining scheme for recurrent attention models gives over 1% BLEU improvement absolute and it allows to train deeper recurrent encoder networks. Promising preliminary results on max. expected BLEU training are presented. We are able to train state-of-the-art models for translation and end-to-end models for speech recognition and show results on WMT 2017 and Switchboard. The flexibility of RETURNN allows a fast research feedback loop to experiment with alternative architectures, and its generality allows to use it on a wide range of applications."
A comparable study of modeling units for end-to-end Mandarin speech recognition,"End-To-End speech recognition have become increasingly popular in mandarin speech recognition and achieved delightful performance.  Mandarin is a tonal language which is different from English and requires special treatment for the acoustic modeling units. There have been several different kinds of modeling units for mandarin such as phoneme, syllable and Chinese character.  In this work, we explore two major end-to-end models: connectionist temporal classification (CTC) model and attention based encoder-decoder model for mandarin speech recognition. We compare the performance of three different scaled modeling units: context dependent phoneme(CDP), syllable with tone and Chinese character.  We find that all types of modeling units can achieve approximate character error rate (CER) in CTC model and the performance of Chinese character attention model is better than syllable attention model. Furthermore, we find that Chinese character is a reasonable unit for mandarin speech recognition. On DidiCallcenter task, Chinese character attention model achieves a CER of 5.68% and CTC model gets a CER of 7.29%, on the other DidiReading task, CER are 4.89% and 5.79%, respectively. Moreover, attention model achieves a better performance than CTC model on both datasets."
"Transfer Learning from Adult to Children for Speech Recognition: Evaluation, Analysis and Recommendations","Children speech recognition is challenging mainly due to the inherent high variability in children's physical and articulatory characteristics and expressions. This variability manifests in both acoustic constructs and linguistic usage due to the rapidly changing developmental stage in children's life. Part of the challenge is due to the lack of large amounts of available children speech data for efficient modeling. This work attempts to address the key challenges using transfer learning from adult's models to children's models in a Deep Neural Network (DNN) framework for children's Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) task evaluating on multiple children's speech corpora with a large vocabulary. The paper presents a systematic and an extensive analysis of the proposed transfer learning technique considering the key factors affecting children's speech recognition from prior literature. Evaluations are presented on (i) comparisons of earlier GMM-HMM and the newer DNN Models, (ii) effectiveness of standard adaptation techniques versus transfer learning, (iii) various adaptation configurations in tackling the variabilities present in children speech, in terms of (a) acoustic spectral variability, and (b) pronunciation variability and linguistic constraints. Our Analysis spans over (i) number of DNN model parameters (for adaptation), (ii) amount of adaptation data, (iii) ages of children, (iv) age dependent-independent adaptation. Finally, we provide Recommendations on (i) the favorable strategies over various aforementioned - analyzed parameters, and (ii) potential future research directions and relevant challenges/problems persisting in DNN based ASR for children's speech."
Improved training of end-to-end attention models for speech recognition,"Sequence-to-sequence attention-based models on subword units allow simple open-vocabulary end-to-end speech recognition. In this work, we show that such models can achieve competitive results on the Switchboard 300h and LibriSpeech 1000h tasks. In particular, we report the state-of-the-art word error rates (WER) of 3.54% on the dev-clean and 3.82% on the test-clean evaluation subsets of LibriSpeech. We introduce a new pretraining scheme by starting with a high time reduction factor and lowering it during training, which is crucial both for convergence and final performance. In some experiments, we also use an auxiliary CTC loss function to help the convergence. In addition, we train long short-term memory (LSTM) language models on subword units. By shallow fusion, we report up to 27% relative improvements in WER over the attention baseline without a language model."
Automatic Documentation of ICD Codes with Far-Field Speech Recognition,"Documentation errors increase healthcare costs and cause unnecessary patient deaths. As the standard language for diagnoses and billing, ICD codes serve as the foundation for medical documentation worldwide. Despite the prevalence of electronic medical records, hospitals still witness high levels of ICD miscoding. In this paper, we propose to automatically document ICD codes with far-field speech recognition. Far-field speech occurs when the microphone is located several meters from the source, as is common with smart homes and security systems. Our method combines acoustic signal processing with recurrent neural networks to recognize and document ICD codes in real time. To evaluate our model, we collected a far-field speech dataset of ICD-10 codes and found our model to achieve 87% accuracy with a BLEU score of 85%. By sampling from an unsupervised medical language model, our method is able to outperform existing methods. Overall, this work shows the potential of automatic speech recognition to provide efficient, accurate, and cost-effective healthcare documentation."
Syllable-Based Sequence-to-Sequence Speech Recognition with the Transformer in Mandarin Chinese,"Sequence-to-sequence attention-based models have recently shown very promising results on automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks, which integrate an acoustic, pronunciation and language model into a single neural network. In these models, the Transformer, a new sequence-to-sequence attention-based model relying entirely on self-attention without using RNNs or convolutions, achieves a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU on neural machine translation (NMT) tasks. Since the outstanding performance of the Transformer, we extend it to speech and concentrate on it as the basic architecture of sequence-to-sequence attention-based model on Mandarin Chinese ASR tasks. Furthermore, we investigate a comparison between syllable based model and context-independent phoneme (CI-phoneme) based model with the Transformer in Mandarin Chinese. Additionally, a greedy cascading decoder with the Transformer is proposed for mapping CI-phoneme sequences and syllable sequences into word sequences. Experiments on HKUST datasets demonstrate that syllable based model with the Transformer performs better than CI-phoneme based counterpart, and achieves a character error rate (CER) of \emph{28.77\%}, which is competitive to the state-of-the-art CER of 28.0\% by the joint CTC-attention based encoder-decoder network."
End-to-End Multimodal Speech Recognition,"Transcription or sub-titling of open-domain videos is still a challenging domain for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) due to the data's challenging acoustics, variable signal processing and the essentially unrestricted domain of the data. In previous work, we have shown that the visual channel -- specifically object and scene features -- can help to adapt the acoustic model (AM) and language model (LM) of a recognizer, and we are now expanding this work to end-to-end approaches. In the case of a Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)-based approach, we retain the separation of AM and LM, while for a sequence-to-sequence (S2S) approach, both information sources are adapted together, in a single model. This paper also analyzes the behavior of CTC and S2S models on noisy video data (How-To corpus), and compares it to results on the clean Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus, providing insight into the robustness of both approaches."
Automatic speech recognition for launch control center communication using recurrent neural networks with data augmentation and custom language model,"Transcribing voice communications in NASA's launch control center is important for information utilization. However, automatic speech recognition in this environment is particularly challenging due to the lack of training data, unfamiliar words in acronyms, multiple different speakers and accents, and conversational characteristics of speaking. We used bidirectional deep recurrent neural networks to train and test speech recognition performance. We showed that data augmentation and custom language models can improve speech recognition accuracy. Transcribing communications from the launch control center will help the machine analyze information and accelerate knowledge generation."
Multi-Head Decoder for End-to-End Speech Recognition,"This paper presents a new network architecture called multi-head decoder for end-to-end speech recognition as an extension of a multi-head attention model. In the multi-head attention model, multiple attentions are calculated, and then, they are integrated into a single attention. On the other hand, instead of the integration in the attention level, our proposed method uses multiple decoders for each attention and integrates their outputs to generate a final output. Furthermore, in order to make each head to capture the different modalities, different attention functions are used for each head, leading to the improvement of the recognition performance with an ensemble effect. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conduct an experimental evaluation using Corpus of Spontaneous Japanese. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the conventional methods such as location-based and multi-head attention models, and that it can capture different speech/linguistic contexts within the attention-based encoder-decoder framework."
Twin Regularization for online speech recognition,"Online speech recognition is crucial for developing natural human-machine interfaces. This modality, however, is significantly more challenging than off-line ASR, since real-time/low-latency constraints inevitably hinder the use of future information, that is known to be very helpful to perform robust predictions. A popular solution to mitigate this issue consists of feeding neural acoustic models with context windows that gather some future frames. This introduces a latency which depends on the number of employed look-ahead features. This paper explores a different approach, based on estimating the future rather than waiting for it. Our technique encourages the hidden representations of a unidirectional recurrent network to embed some useful information about the future. Inspired by a recently proposed technique called Twin Networks, we add a regularization term that forces forward hidden states to be as close as possible to cotemporal backward ones, computed by a ""twin"" neural network running backwards in time. The experiments, conducted on a number of datasets, recurrent architectures, input features, and acoustic conditions, have shown the effectiveness of this approach. One important advantage is that our method does not introduce any additional computation at test time if compared to standard unidirectional recurrent networks."
Speech Commands: A Dataset for Limited-Vocabulary Speech Recognition,"Describes an audio dataset of spoken words designed to help train and evaluate keyword spotting systems. Discusses why this task is an interesting challenge, and why it requires a specialized dataset that is different from conventional datasets used for automatic speech recognition of full sentences. Suggests a methodology for reproducible and comparable accuracy metrics for this task. Describes how the data was collected and verified, what it contains, previous versions and properties. Concludes by reporting baseline results of models trained on this dataset."
On the Robustness of Speech Emotion Recognition for Human-Robot Interaction with Deep Neural Networks,"Speech emotion recognition (SER) is an important aspect of effective human-robot collaboration and received a lot of attention from the research community. For example, many neural network-based architectures were proposed recently and pushed the performance to a new level. However, the applicability of such neural SER models trained only on in-domain data to noisy conditions is currently under-researched. In this work, we evaluate the robustness of state-of-the-art neural acoustic emotion recognition models in human-robot interaction scenarios. We hypothesize that a robot's ego noise, room conditions, and various acoustic events that can occur in a home environment can significantly affect the performance of a model. We conduct several experiments on the iCub robot platform and propose several novel ways to reduce the gap between the model's performance during training and testing in real-world conditions. Furthermore, we observe large improvements in the model performance on the robot and demonstrate the necessity of introducing several data augmentation techniques like overlaying background noise and loudness variations to improve the robustness of the neural approaches."
Spoken SQuAD: A Study of Mitigating the Impact of Speech Recognition Errors on Listening Comprehension,"Reading comprehension has been widely studied. One of the most representative reading comprehension tasks is Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD), on which machine is already comparable with human. On the other hand, accessing large collections of multimedia or spoken content is much more difficult and time-consuming than plain text content for humans. It's therefore highly attractive to develop machines which can automatically understand spoken content. In this paper, we propose a new listening comprehension task - Spoken SQuAD. On the new task, we found that speech recognition errors have catastrophic impact on machine comprehension, and several approaches are proposed to mitigate the impact."
Reusing Neural Speech Representations for Auditory Emotion Recognition,"Acoustic emotion recognition aims to categorize the affective state of the speaker and is still a difficult task for machine learning models. The difficulties come from the scarcity of training data, general subjectivity in emotion perception resulting in low annotator agreement, and the uncertainty about which features are the most relevant and robust ones for classification. In this paper, we will tackle the latter problem. Inspired by the recent success of transfer learning methods we propose a set of architectures which utilize neural representations inferred by training on large speech databases for the acoustic emotion recognition task. Our experiments on the IEMOCAP dataset show ~10% relative improvements in the accuracy and F1-score over the baseline recurrent neural network which is trained end-to-end for emotion recognition."
Towards Unsupervised Automatic Speech Recognition Trained by Unaligned Speech and Text only,"Automatic speech recognition (ASR) has been widely researched with supervised approaches, while many low-resourced languages lack audio-text aligned data, and supervised methods cannot be applied on them.  In this work, we propose a framework to achieve unsupervised ASR on a read English speech dataset, where audio and text are unaligned. In the first stage, each word-level audio segment in the utterances is represented by a vector representation extracted by a sequence-of-sequence autoencoder, in which phonetic information and speaker information are disentangled.  Secondly, semantic embeddings of audio segments are trained from the vector representations using a skip-gram model. Last but not the least, an unsupervised method is utilized to transform semantic embeddings of audio segments to text embedding space, and finally the transformed embeddings are mapped to words.  With the above framework, we are towards unsupervised ASR trained by unaligned text and speech only."
"The fifth 'CHiME' Speech Separation and Recognition Challenge: Dataset, task and baselines","The CHiME challenge series aims to advance robust automatic speech recognition (ASR) technology by promoting research at the interface of speech and language processing, signal processing , and machine learning. This paper introduces the 5th CHiME Challenge, which considers the task of distant multi-microphone conversational ASR in real home environments. Speech material was elicited using a dinner party scenario with efforts taken to capture data that is representative of natural conversational speech and recorded by 6 Kinect microphone arrays and 4 binaural microphone pairs. The challenge features a single-array track and a multiple-array track and, for each track, distinct rankings will be produced for systems focusing on robustness with respect to distant-microphone capture vs. systems attempting to address all aspects of the task including conversational language modeling. We discuss the rationale for the challenge and provide a detailed description of the data collection procedure, the task, and the baseline systems for array synchronization, speech enhancement, and conventional and end-to-end ASR."
Light Gated Recurrent Units for Speech Recognition,"A field that has directly benefited from the recent advances in deep learning is Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). Despite the great achievements of the past decades, however, a natural and robust human-machine speech interaction still appears to be out of reach, especially in challenging environments characterized by significant noise and reverberation. To improve robustness, modern speech recognizers often employ acoustic models based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), that are naturally able to exploit large time contexts and long-term speech modulations. It is thus of great interest to continue the study of proper techniques for improving the effectiveness of RNNs in processing speech signals.  In this paper, we revise one of the most popular RNN models, namely Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), and propose a simplified architecture that turned out to be very effective for ASR. The contribution of this work is two-fold: First, we analyze the role played by the reset gate, showing that a significant redundancy with the update gate occurs. As a result, we propose to remove the former from the GRU design, leading to a more efficient and compact single-gate model. Second, we propose to replace hyperbolic tangent with ReLU activations. This variation couples well with batch normalization and could help the model learn long-term dependencies without numerical issues.  Results show that the proposed architecture, called Light GRU (Li-GRU), not only reduces the per-epoch training time by more than 30% over a standard GRU, but also consistently improves the recognition accuracy across different tasks, input features, noisy conditions, as well as across different ASR paradigms, ranging from standard DNN-HMM speech recognizers to end-to-end CTC models."
Investigating Generative Adversarial Networks based Speech Dereverberation for Robust Speech Recognition,"We investigate the use of generative adversarial networks (GANs) in speech dereverberation for robust speech recognition. GANs have been recently studied for speech enhancement to remove additive noises, but there still lacks of a work to examine their ability in speech dereverberation and the advantages of using GANs have not been fully established. In this paper, we provide deep investigations in the use of GAN-based dereverberation front-end in ASR. First, we study the effectiveness of different dereverberation networks (the generator in GAN) and find that LSTM leads a significant improvement as compared with feed-forward DNN and CNN in our dataset. Second, further adding residual connections in the deep LSTMs can boost the performance as well. Finally, we find that, for the success of GAN, it is important to update the generator and the discriminator using the same mini-batch data during training. Moreover, using reverberant spectrogram as a condition to discriminator, as suggested in previous studies, may degrade the performance. In summary, our GAN-based dereverberation front-end achieves 14%-19% relative CER reduction as compared to the baseline DNN dereverberation network when tested on a strong multi-condition training acoustic model."
Building state-of-the-art distant speech recognition using the CHiME-4 challenge with a setup of speech enhancement baseline,"This paper describes a new baseline system for automatic speech recognition (ASR) in the CHiME-4 challenge to promote the development of noisy ASR in speech processing communities by providing 1) state-of-the-art system with a simplified single system comparable to the complicated top systems in the challenge, 2) publicly available and reproducible recipe through the main repository in the Kaldi speech recognition toolkit. The proposed system adopts generalized eigenvalue beamforming with bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) mask estimation. We also propose to use a time delay neural network (TDNN) based on the lattice-free version of the maximum mutual information (LF-MMI) trained with augmented all six microphones plus the enhanced data after beamforming. Finally, we use a LSTM language model for lattice and n-best re-scoring. The final system achieved 2.74\% WER for the real test set in the 6-channel track, which corresponds to the 2nd place in the challenge. In addition, the proposed baseline recipe includes four different speech enhancement measures, short-time objective intelligibility measure (STOI), extended STOI (eSTOI), perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) and speech distortion ratio (SDR) for the simulation test set. Thus, the recipe also provides an experimental platform for speech enhancement studies with these performance measures."
Spectral feature mapping with mimic loss for robust speech recognition,"For the task of speech enhancement, local learning objectives are agnostic to phonetic structures helpful for speech recognition. We propose to add a global criterion to ensure de-noised speech is useful for downstream tasks like ASR. We first train a spectral classifier on clean speech to predict senone labels. Then, the spectral classifier is joined with our speech enhancer as a noisy speech recognizer. This model is taught to imitate the output of the spectral classifier alone on clean speech. This \textit{mimic loss} is combined with the traditional local criterion to train the speech enhancer to produce de-noised speech. Feeding the de-noised speech to an off-the-shelf Kaldi training recipe for the CHiME-2 corpus shows significant improvements in WER."
An improved DNN-based spectral feature mapping that removes noise and reverberation for robust automatic speech recognition,"Reverberation and additive noise have detrimental effects on the performance of automatic speech recognition systems. In this paper we explore the ability of a DNN-based spectral feature mapping to remove the effects of reverberation and additive noise. Experiments with the CHiME-2 database show that this DNN can achieve an average reduction in WER of 4.5%, when compared to the baseline system, at SNRs equal to -6 dB, -3 dB, 0 dB and 3 dB, and just 0.8% at greater SNRs of 6 dB and 9 dB. These results suggest that this DNN is more effective in removing additive noise than reverberation. To improve the DNN performance, we combine it with the weighted prediction error (WPE) method that shows a complementary behavior. While this combination provided a reduction in WER of approximately 11% when compared with the baseline, the observed improvement is not as great as that obtained using WPE alone. However, modifications to the DNN training process were applied and an average reduction in WER equal to 18.3% was achieved when compared with the baseline system. Furthermore, the improved DNN combined with WPE achieves a reduction in WER of 7.9% when compared with WPE alone."
Exploring the robustness of features and enhancement on speech recognition systems in highly-reverberant real environments,"This paper evaluates the robustness of a DNN-HMM-based speech recognition system in highly-reverberant real environments using the HRRE database. The performance of locally-normalized filter bank (LNFB) and Mel filter bank (MelFB) features in combination with Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), Suppression of Slowly-varying components and the Falling edge (SSF) and Weighted Prediction Error (WPE) enhancement methods are discussed and evaluated. Two training conditions were considered: clean and reverberated (Reverb). With Reverb training the use of WPE and LNFB provides WERs that are 3% and 20% lower in average than SSF and NMF, respectively. WPE and MelFB provides WERs that are 11% and 24% lower in average than SSF and NMF, respectively. With clean training, which represents a significant mismatch between testing and training conditions, LNFB features clearly outperform MelFB features. The results show that different types of training, parametrization, and enhancement techniques may work better for a specific combination of speaker-microphone distance and reverberation time. This suggests that there could be some degree of complementarity between systems trained with different enhancement and parametrization methods."
Speech Emotion Recognition Considering Local Dynamic Features,"Recently, increasing attention has been directed to the study of the speech emotion recognition, in which global acoustic features of an utterance are mostly used to eliminate the content differences. However, the expression of speech emotion is a dynamic process, which is reflected through dynamic durations, energies, and some other prosodic information when one speaks. In this paper, a novel local dynamic pitch probability distribution feature, which is obtained by drawing the histogram, is proposed to improve the accuracy of speech emotion recognition. Compared with most of the previous works using global features, the proposed method takes advantage of the local dynamic information conveyed by the emotional speech. Several experiments on Berlin Database of Emotional Speech are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate that the local dynamic information obtained with the proposed method is more effective for speech emotion recognition than the traditional global features."
Deep-FSMN for Large Vocabulary Continuous Speech Recognition,"In this paper, we present an improved feedforward sequential memory networks (FSMN) architecture, namely Deep-FSMN (DFSMN), by introducing skip connections between memory blocks in adjacent layers. These skip connections enable the information flow across different layers and thus alleviate the gradient vanishing problem when building very deep structure. As a result, DFSMN significantly benefits from these skip connections and deep structure. We have compared the performance of DFSMN to BLSTM both with and without lower frame rate (LFR) on several large speech recognition tasks, including English and Mandarin. Experimental results shown that DFSMN can consistently outperform BLSTM with dramatic gain, especially trained with LFR using CD-Phone as modeling units. In the 2000 hours Fisher (FSH) task, the proposed DFSMN can achieve a word error rate of 9.4% by purely using the cross-entropy criterion and decoding with a 3-gram language model, which achieves a 1.5% absolute improvement compared to the BLSTM. In a 20000 hours Mandarin recognition task, the LFR trained DFSMN can achieve more than 20% relative improvement compared to the LFR trained BLSTM. Moreover, we can easily design the lookahead filter order of the memory blocks in DFSMN to control the latency for real-time applications."
Resource aware design of a deep convolutional-recurrent neural network for speech recognition through audio-visual sensor fusion,"Today's Automatic Speech Recognition systems only rely on acoustic signals and often don't perform well under noisy conditions. Performing multi-modal speech recognition - processing acoustic speech signals and lip-reading video simultaneously - significantly enhances the performance of such systems, especially in noisy environments. This work presents the design of such an audio-visual system for Automated Speech Recognition, taking memory and computation requirements into account. First, a Long-Short-Term-Memory neural network for acoustic speech recognition is designed. Second, Convolutional Neural Networks are used to model lip-reading features. These are combined with an LSTM network to model temporal dependencies and perform automatic lip-reading on video. Finally, acoustic-speech and visual lip-reading networks are combined to process acoustic and visual features simultaneously. An attention mechanism ensures performance of the model in noisy environments. This system is evaluated on the TCD-TIMIT 'lipspeaker' dataset for audio-visual phoneme recognition with clean audio and with additive white noise at an SNR of 0dB. It achieves 75.70% and 58.55% phoneme accuracy respectively, over 14 percentage points better than the state-of-the-art for all noise levels."
Speech Recognition: Keyword Spotting Through Image Recognition,"The problem of identifying voice commands has always been a challenge due to the presence of noise and variability in speed, pitch, etc. We will compare the efficacies of several neural network architectures for the speech recognition problem. In particular, we will build a model to determine whether a one second audio clip contains a particular word (out of a set of 10), an unknown word, or silence. The models to be implemented are a CNN recommended by the Tensorflow Speech Recognition tutorial, a low-latency CNN, and an adversarially trained CNN. The result is a demonstration of how to convert a problem in audio recognition to the better-studied domain of image classification, where the powerful techniques of convolutional neural networks are fully developed. Additionally, we demonstrate the applicability of the technique of Virtual Adversarial Training (VAT) to this problem domain, functioning as a powerful regularizer with promising potential future applications."
Extracting Domain Invariant Features by Unsupervised Learning for Robust Automatic Speech Recognition,"The performance of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems can be significantly compromised by previously unseen conditions, which is typically due to a mismatch between training and testing distributions. In this paper, we address robustness by studying domain invariant features, such that domain information becomes transparent to ASR systems, resolving the mismatch problem. Specifically, we investigate a recent model, called the Factorized Hierarchical Variational Autoencoder (FHVAE). FHVAEs learn to factorize sequence-level and segment-level attributes into different latent variables without supervision. We argue that the set of latent variables that contain segment-level information is our desired domain invariant feature for ASR. Experiments are conducted on Aurora-4 and CHiME-4, which demonstrate 41% and 27% absolute word error rate reductions respectively on mismatched domains."
SpeechPy - A Library for Speech Processing and Recognition,"SpeechPy is an open source Python package that contains speech preprocessing techniques, speech features, and important post-processing operations. It provides most frequent used speech features including MFCCs and filterbank energies alongside with the log-energy of filter-banks. The aim of the package is to provide researchers with a simple tool for speech feature extraction and processing purposes in applications such as Automatic Speech Recognition and Speaker Verification."
Cross-lingual and Multilingual Speech Emotion Recognition on English and French,"Research on multilingual speech emotion recognition faces the problem that most available speech corpora differ from each other in important ways, such as annotation methods or interaction scenarios. These inconsistencies complicate building a multilingual system. We present results for cross-lingual and multilingual emotion recognition on English and French speech data with similar characteristics in terms of interaction (human-human conversations). Further, we explore the possibility of fine-tuning a pre-trained cross-lingual model with only a small number of samples from the target language, which is of great interest for low-resource languages. To gain more insights in what is learned by the deployed convolutional neural network, we perform an analysis on the attention mechanism inside the network."
Automatic Speech Recognition and Topic Identification for Almost-Zero-Resource Languages,"Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems often need to be developed for extremely low-resource languages to serve end-uses such as audio content categorization and search. While universal phone recognition is natural to consider when no transcribed speech is available to train an ASR system in a language, adapting universal phone models using very small amounts (minutes rather than hours) of transcribed speech also needs to be studied, particularly with state-of-the-art DNN-based acoustic models. The DARPA LORELEI program provides a framework for such very-low-resource ASR studies, and provides an extrinsic metric for evaluating ASR performance in a humanitarian assistance, disaster relief setting. This paper presents our Kaldi-based systems for the program, which employ a universal phone modeling approach to ASR, and describes recipes for very rapid adaptation of this universal ASR system. The results we obtain significantly outperform results obtained by many competing approaches on the NIST LoReHLT 2017 Evaluation datasets."
Sequence-based Multi-lingual Low Resource Speech Recognition,"Techniques for multi-lingual and cross-lingual speech recognition can help in low resource scenarios, to bootstrap systems and enable analysis of new languages and domains. End-to-end approaches, in particular sequence-based techniques, are attractive because of their simplicity and elegance. While it is possible to integrate traditional multi-lingual bottleneck feature extractors as front-ends, we show that end-to-end multi-lingual training of sequence models is effective on context independent models trained using Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss. We show that our model improves performance on Babel languages by over 6% absolute in terms of word/phoneme error rate when compared to mono-lingual systems built in the same setting for these languages. We also show that the trained model can be adapted cross-lingually to an unseen language using just 25% of the target data. We show that training on multiple languages is important for very low resource cross-lingual target scenarios, but not for multi-lingual testing scenarios. Here, it appears beneficial to include large well prepared datasets."
Distilling Knowledge Using Parallel Data for Far-field Speech Recognition,"In order to improve the performance for far-field speech recognition, this paper proposes to distill knowledge from the close-talking model to the far-field model using parallel data. The close-talking model is called the teacher model. The far-field model is called the student model. The student model is trained to imitate the output distributions of the teacher model. This constraint can be realized by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the output distribution of the student model and the teacher model. Experimental results on AMI corpus show that the best student model achieves up to 4.7% absolute word error rate (WER) reduction when compared with the conventionally-trained baseline models."
Interpreting DNN output layer activations: A strategy to cope with unseen data in speech recognition,"Unseen data can degrade performance of deep neural net acoustic models. To cope with unseen data, adaptation techniques are deployed. For unlabeled unseen data, one must generate some hypothesis given an existing model, which is used as the label for model adaptation. However, assessing the goodness of the hypothesis can be difficult, and an erroneous hypothesis can lead to poorly trained models. In such cases, a strategy to select data having reliable hypothesis can ensure better model adaptation. This work proposes a data-selection strategy for DNN model adaptation, where DNN output layer activations are used to ascertain the goodness of a generated hypothesis. In a DNN acoustic model, the output layer activations are used to generate target class probabilities. Under unseen data conditions, the difference between the most probable target and the next most probable target is decreased compared to the same for seen data, indicating that the model may be uncertain while generating its hypothesis. This work proposes a strategy to assess a model's performance by analyzing the output layer activations by using a distance measure between the most likely target and the next most likely target, which is used for data selection for performing unsupervised adaptation."
End-to-end Audiovisual Speech Recognition,"Several end-to-end deep learning approaches have been recently presented which extract either audio or visual features from the input images or audio signals and perform speech recognition. However, research on end-to-end audiovisual models is very limited. In this work, we present an end-to-end audiovisual model based on residual networks and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (BGRUs). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first audiovisual fusion model which simultaneously learns to extract features directly from the image pixels and audio waveforms and performs within-context word recognition on a large publicly available dataset (LRW). The model consists of two streams, one for each modality, which extract features directly from mouth regions and raw waveforms. The temporal dynamics in each stream/modality are modeled by a 2-layer BGRU and the fusion of multiple streams/modalities takes place via another 2-layer BGRU. A slight improvement in the classification rate over an end-to-end audio-only and MFCC-based model is reported in clean audio conditions and low levels of noise. In presence of high levels of noise, the end-to-end audiovisual model significantly outperforms both audio-only models."
"Visual-Only Recognition of Normal, Whispered and Silent Speech","Silent speech interfaces have been recently proposed as a way to enable communication when the acoustic signal is not available. This introduces the need to build visual speech recognition systems for silent and whispered speech. However, almost all the recently proposed systems have been trained on vocalised data only. This is in contrast with evidence in the literature which suggests that lip movements change depending on the speech mode. In this work, we introduce a new audiovisual database which is publicly available and contains normal, whispered and silent speech. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study which investigates the differences between the three speech modes using the visual modality only. We show that an absolute decrease in classification rate of up to 3.7% is observed when training and testing on normal and whispered, respectively, and vice versa. An even higher decrease of up to 8.5% is reported when the models are tested on silent speech. This reveals that there are indeed visual differences between the 3 speech modes and the common assumption that vocalized training data can be used directly to train a silent speech recognition system may not be true."
Constrained Convolutional-Recurrent Networks to Improve Speech Quality with Low Impact on Recognition Accuracy,"For a speech-enhancement algorithm, it is highly desirable to simultaneously improve perceptual quality and recognition rate. Thanks to computational costs and model complexities, it is challenging to train a model that effectively optimizes both metrics at the same time. In this paper, we propose a method for speech enhancement that combines local and global contextual structures information through convolutional-recurrent neural networks that improves perceptual quality. At the same time, we introduce a new constraint on the objective function using a language model/decoder that limits the impact on recognition rate. Based on experiments conducted with real user data, we demonstrate that our new context-augmented machine-learning approach for speech enhancement improves PESQ and WER by an additional 24.5% and 51.3%, respectively, when compared to the best-performing methods in the literature."
Articulatory information and Multiview Features for Large Vocabulary Continuous Speech Recognition,"This paper explores the use of multi-view features and their discriminative transforms in a convolutional deep neural network (CNN) architecture for a continuous large vocabulary speech recognition task. Mel-filterbank energies and perceptually motivated forced damped oscillator coefficient (DOC) features are used after feature-space maximum-likelihood linear regression (fMLLR) transforms, which are combined and fed as a multi-view feature to a single CNN acoustic model. Use of multi-view feature representation demonstrated significant reduction in word error rates (WERs) compared to the use of individual features by themselves. In addition, when articulatory information was used as an additional input to a fused deep neural network (DNN) and CNN acoustic model, it was found to demonstrate further reduction in WER for the Switchboard subset and the CallHome subset (containing partly non-native accented speech) of the NIST 2000 conversational telephone speech test set, reducing the error rate by 12% relative to the baseline in both cases. This work shows that multi-view features in association with articulatory information can improve speech recognition robustness to spontaneous and non-native speech."
CNN+LSTM Architecture for Speech Emotion Recognition with Data Augmentation,"In this work we design a neural network for recognizing emotions in speech, using the IEMOCAP dataset. Following the latest advances in audio analysis, we use an architecture involving both convolutional layers, for extracting high-level features from raw spectrograms, and recurrent ones for aggregating long-term dependencies. We examine the techniques of data augmentation with vocal track length perturbation, layer-wise optimizer adjustment, batch normalization of recurrent layers and obtain highly competitive results of 64.5% for weighted accuracy and 61.7% for unweighted accuracy on four emotions."
Joint Modeling of Accents and Acoustics for Multi-Accent Speech Recognition,"The performance of automatic speech recognition systems degrades with increasing mismatch between the training and testing scenarios. Differences in speaker accents are a significant source of such mismatch. The traditional approach to deal with multiple accents involves pooling data from several accents during training and building a single model in multi-task fashion, where tasks correspond to individual accents. In this paper, we explore an alternate model where we jointly learn an accent classifier and a multi-task acoustic model. Experiments on the American English Wall Street Journal and British English Cambridge corpora demonstrate that our joint model outperforms the strong multi-task acoustic model baseline. We obtain a 5.94% relative improvement in word error rate on British English, and 9.47% relative improvement on American English. This illustrates that jointly modeling with accent information improves acoustic model performance."
Learning from Past Mistakes: Improving Automatic Speech Recognition Output via Noisy-Clean Phrase Context Modeling,"Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems often make unrecoverable errors due to subsystem pruning (acoustic, language and pronunciation models); for example pruning words due to acoustics using short-term context, prior to rescoring with long-term context based on linguistics. In this work we model ASR as a phrase-based noisy transformation channel and propose an error correction system that can learn from the aggregate errors of all the independent modules constituting the ASR and attempt to invert those. The proposed system can exploit long-term context using a neural network language model and can better choose between existing ASR output possibilities as well as re-introduce previously pruned or unseen (out-of-vocabulary) phrases. It provides corrections under poorly performing ASR conditions without degrading any accurate transcriptions; such corrections are greater on top of out-of-domain and mismatched data ASR. Our system consistently provides improvements over the baseline ASR, even when baseline is further optimized through recurrent neural network language model rescoring. This demonstrates that any ASR improvements can be exploited independently and that our proposed system can potentially still provide benefits on highly optimized ASR. Finally, we present an extensive analysis of the type of errors corrected by our system."
Accelerating recurrent neural network language model based online speech recognition system,"This paper presents methods to accelerate recurrent neural network based language models (RNNLMs) for online speech recognition systems. Firstly, a lossy compression of the past hidden layer outputs (history vector) with caching is introduced in order to reduce the number of LM queries. Next, RNNLM computations are deployed in a CPU-GPU hybrid manner, which computes each layer of the model on a more advantageous platform. The added overhead by data exchanges between CPU and GPU is compensated through a frame-wise batching strategy. The performance of the proposed methods evaluated on LibriSpeech test sets indicates that the reduction in history vector precision improves the average recognition speed by 1.23 times with minimum degradation in accuracy. On the other hand, the CPU-GPU hybrid parallelization enables RNNLM based real-time recognition with a four times improvement in speed."
A pairwise discriminative task for speech emotion recognition,"I have submitted a new version to arXiv:1910.11174. I forget to choose to replace the old version, but submitted a new one. It's my mistake."
"Exploring Architectures, Data and Units For Streaming End-to-End Speech Recognition with RNN-Transducer","We investigate training end-to-end speech recognition models with the recurrent neural network transducer (RNN-T): a streaming, all-neural, sequence-to-sequence architecture which jointly learns acoustic and language model components from transcribed acoustic data. We explore various model architectures and demonstrate how the model can be improved further if additional text or pronunciation data are available. The model consists of an `encoder', which is initialized from a connectionist temporal classification-based (CTC) acoustic model, and a `decoder' which is partially initialized from a recurrent neural network language model trained on text data alone. The entire neural network is trained with the RNN-T loss and directly outputs the recognized transcript as a sequence of graphemes, thus performing end-to-end speech recognition. We find that performance can be improved further through the use of sub-word units (`wordpieces') which capture longer context and significantly reduce substitution errors. The best RNN-T system, a twelve-layer LSTM encoder with a two-layer LSTM decoder trained with 30,000 wordpieces as output targets achieves a word error rate of 8.5\% on voice-search and 5.2\% on voice-dictation tasks and is comparable to a state-of-the-art baseline at 8.3\% on voice-search and 5.4\% voice-dictation."
Did you hear that? Adversarial Examples Against Automatic Speech Recognition,"Speech is a common and effective way of communication between humans, and modern consumer devices such as smartphones and home hubs are equipped with deep learning based accurate automatic speech recognition to enable natural interaction between humans and machines. Recently, researchers have demonstrated powerful attacks against machine learning models that can fool them to produceincorrect results. However, nearly all previous research in adversarial attacks has focused on image recognition and object detection models. In this short paper, we present a first of its kind demonstration of adversarial attacks against speech classification model. Our algorithm performs targeted attacks with 87% success by adding small background noise without having to know the underlying model parameter and architecture. Our attack only changes the least significant bits of a subset of audio clip samples, and the noise does not change 89% the human listener's perception of the audio clip as evaluated in our human study."
Multichannel Robot Speech Recognition Database: MChRSR,"In real human robot interaction (HRI) scenarios, speech recognition represents a major challenge due to robot noise, background noise and time-varying acoustic channel. This document describes the procedure used to obtain the Multichannel Robot Speech Recognition Database (MChRSR). It is composed of 12 hours of multichannel evaluation data recorded in a real mobile HRI scenario. This database was recorded with a PR2 robot performing different translational and azimuthal movements. Accordingly, 16 evaluation sets were obtained re-recording the clean set of the Aurora 4 database in different movement conditions."
The CAPIO 2017 Conversational Speech Recognition System,"In this paper we show how we have achieved the state-of-the-art performance on the industry-standard NIST 2000 Hub5 English evaluation set. We explore densely connected LSTMs, inspired by the densely connected convolutional networks recently introduced for image classification tasks. We also propose an acoustic model adaptation scheme that simply averages the parameters of a seed neural network acoustic model and its adapted version. This method was applied with the CallHome training corpus and improved individual system performances by on average 6.1% (relative) against the CallHome portion of the evaluation set with no performance loss on the Switchboard portion. With RNN-LM rescoring and lattice combination on the 5 systems trained across three different phone sets, our 2017 speech recognition system has obtained 5.0% and 9.1% on Switchboard and CallHome, respectively, both of which are the best word error rates reported thus far. According to IBM in their latest work to compare human and machine transcriptions, our reported Switchboard word error rate can be considered to surpass the human parity (5.1%) of transcribing conversational telephone speech."
Letter-Based Speech Recognition with Gated ConvNets,"In the recent literature, ""end-to-end"" speech systems often refer to letter-based acoustic models trained in a sequence-to-sequence manner, either via a recurrent model or via a structured output learning approach (such as CTC). In contrast to traditional phone (or senone)-based approaches, these ""end-to-end'' approaches alleviate the need of word pronunciation modeling, and do not require a ""forced alignment"" step at training time. Phone-based approaches remain however state of the art on classical benchmarks. In this paper, we propose a letter-based speech recognition system, leveraging a ConvNet acoustic model. Key ingredients of the ConvNet are Gated Linear Units and high dropout. The ConvNet is trained to map audio sequences to their corresponding letter transcriptions, either via a classical CTC approach, or via a recent variant called ASG. Coupled with a simple decoder at inference time, our system matches the best existing letter-based systems on WSJ (in word error rate), and shows near state of the art performance on LibriSpeech."
Improved Regularization Techniques for End-to-End Speech Recognition,"Regularization is important for end-to-end speech models, since the models are highly flexible and easy to overfit. Data augmentation and dropout has been important for improving end-to-end models in other domains. However, they are relatively under explored for end-to-end speech models. Therefore, we investigate the effectiveness of both methods for end-to-end trainable, deep speech recognition models. We augment audio data through random perturbations of tempo, pitch, volume, temporal alignment, and adding random noise.We further investigate the effect of dropout when applied to the inputs of all layers of the network. We show that the combination of data augmentation and dropout give a relative performance improvement on both Wall Street Journal (WSJ) and LibriSpeech dataset of over 20%. Our model performance is also competitive with other end-to-end speech models on both datasets."
Improving End-to-End Speech Recognition with Policy Learning,"Connectionist temporal classification (CTC) is widely used for maximum likelihood learning in end-to-end speech recognition models. However, there is usually a disparity between the negative maximum likelihood and the performance metric used in speech recognition, e.g., word error rate (WER). This results in a mismatch between the objective function and metric during training. We show that the above problem can be mitigated by jointly training with maximum likelihood and policy gradient. In particular, with policy learning we are able to directly optimize on the (otherwise non-differentiable) performance metric. We show that joint training improves relative performance by 4% to 13% for our end-to-end model as compared to the same model learned through maximum likelihood. The model achieves 5.53% WER on Wall Street Journal dataset, and 5.42% and 14.70% on Librispeech test-clean and test-other set, respectively."
Deep Learning for Distant Speech Recognition,"Deep learning is an emerging technology that is considered one of the most promising directions for reaching higher levels of artificial intelligence. Among the other achievements, building computers that understand speech represents a crucial leap towards intelligent machines. Despite the great efforts of the past decades, however, a natural and robust human-machine speech interaction still appears to be out of reach, especially when users interact with a distant microphone in noisy and reverberant environments. The latter disturbances severely hamper the intelligibility of a speech signal, making Distant Speech Recognition (DSR) one of the major open challenges in the field.  This thesis addresses the latter scenario and proposes some novel techniques, architectures, and algorithms to improve the robustness of distant-talking acoustic models. We first elaborate on methodologies for realistic data contamination, with a particular emphasis on DNN training with simulated data. We then investigate on approaches for better exploiting speech contexts, proposing some original methodologies for both feed-forward and recurrent neural networks. Lastly, inspired by the idea that cooperation across different DNNs could be the key for counteracting the harmful effects of noise and reverberation, we propose a novel deep learning paradigm called network of deep neural networks. The analysis of the original concepts were based on extensive experimental validations conducted on both real and simulated data, considering different corpora, microphone configurations, environments, noisy conditions, and ASR tasks."
Learning Spontaneity to Improve Emotion Recognition In Speech,"We investigate the effect and usefulness of spontaneity (i.e. whether a given speech is spontaneous or not) in speech in the context of emotion recognition. We hypothesize that emotional content in speech is interrelated with its spontaneity, and use spontaneity classification as an auxiliary task to the problem of emotion recognition. We propose two supervised learning settings that utilize spontaneity to improve speech emotion recognition: a hierarchical model that performs spontaneity detection before performing emotion recognition, and a multitask learning model that jointly learns to recognize both spontaneity and emotion. Through various experiments on the well known IEMOCAP database, we show that by using spontaneity detection as an additional task, significant improvement can be achieved over emotion recognition systems that are unaware of spontaneity. We achieve state-of-the-art emotion recognition accuracy (4-class, 69.1%) on the IEMOCAP database outperforming several relevant and competitive baselines."
Review of Design of Speech Recognition and Text Analytics based Digital Banking Customer Interface and Future Directions of Technology Adoption,"Banking is one of the most significant adopters of cutting-edge information technologies. Since its modern era beginning in the form of paper based accounting maintained in the branch, adoption of computerized system made it possible to centralize the processing in data centre and improve customer experience by making a more available and efficient system. The latest twist in this evolution is adoption of natural language processing and speech recognition in the user interface between the human and the system and use of machine learning and advanced analytics, in general, for backend processing as well. The paper reviews the progress of technology adoption in the field and comments on the maturity level of solutions involving less studied or low-resource languages like Hindi and also other Indian, regional languages. Furthermore, it also provides an analysis from a prototype built by us. The future directions of this area are also highlighted."
Building competitive direct acoustics-to-word models for English conversational speech recognition,"Direct acoustics-to-word (A2W) models in the end-to-end paradigm have received increasing attention compared to conventional sub-word based automatic speech recognition models using phones, characters, or context-dependent hidden Markov model states. This is because A2W models recognize words from speech without any decoder, pronunciation lexicon, or externally-trained language model, making training and decoding with such models simple. Prior work has shown that A2W models require orders of magnitude more training data in order to perform comparably to conventional models. Our work also showed this accuracy gap when using the English Switchboard-Fisher data set. This paper describes a recipe to train an A2W model that closes this gap and is at-par with state-of-the-art sub-word based models. We achieve a word error rate of 8.8%/13.9% on the Hub5-2000 Switchboard/CallHome test sets without any decoder or language model. We find that model initialization, training data order, and regularization have the most impact on the A2W model performance. Next, we present a joint word-character A2W model that learns to first spell the word and then recognize it. This model provides a rich output to the user instead of simple word hypotheses, making it especially useful in the case of words unseen or rarely-seen during training."
State-of-the-art Speech Recognition With Sequence-to-Sequence Models,"Attention-based encoder-decoder architectures such as Listen, Attend, and Spell (LAS), subsume the acoustic, pronunciation and language model components of a traditional automatic speech recognition (ASR) system into a single neural network. In previous work, we have shown that such architectures are comparable to state-of-theart ASR systems on dictation tasks, but it was not clear if such architectures would be practical for more challenging tasks such as voice search. In this work, we explore a variety of structural and optimization improvements to our LAS model which significantly improve performance. On the structural side, we show that word piece models can be used instead of graphemes. We also introduce a multi-head attention architecture, which offers improvements over the commonly-used single-head attention. On the optimization side, we explore synchronous training, scheduled sampling, label smoothing, and minimum word error rate optimization, which are all shown to improve accuracy. We present results with a unidirectional LSTM encoder for streaming recognition. On a 12, 500 hour voice search task, we find that the proposed changes improve the WER from 9.2% to 5.6%, while the best conventional system achieves 6.7%; on a dictation task our model achieves a WER of 4.1% compared to 5% for the conventional system."
Multi-Dialect Speech Recognition With A Single Sequence-To-Sequence Model,"Sequence-to-sequence models provide a simple and elegant solution for building speech recognition systems by folding separate components of a typical system, namely acoustic (AM), pronunciation (PM) and language (LM) models into a single neural network. In this work, we look at one such sequence-to-sequence model, namely listen, attend and spell (LAS), and explore the possibility of training a single model to serve different English dialects, which simplifies the process of training multi-dialect systems without the need for separate AM, PM and LMs for each dialect. We show that simply pooling the data from all dialects into one LAS model falls behind the performance of a model fine-tuned on each dialect. We then look at incorporating dialect-specific information into the model, both by modifying the training targets by inserting the dialect symbol at the end of the original grapheme sequence and also feeding a 1-hot representation of the dialect information into all layers of the model. Experimental results on seven English dialects show that our proposed system is effective in modeling dialect variations within a single LAS model, outperforming a LAS model trained individually on each of the seven dialects by 3.1 ~ 16.5% relative."
Visual Features for Context-Aware Speech Recognition,"Automatic transcriptions of consumer-generated multi-media content such as ""Youtube"" videos still exhibit high word error rates. Such data typically occupies a very broad domain, has been recorded in challenging conditions, with cheap hardware and a focus on the visual modality, and may have been post-processed or edited. In this paper, we extend our earlier work on adapting the acoustic model of a DNN-based speech recognition system to an RNN language model and show how both can be adapted to the objects and scenes that can be automatically detected in the video. We are working on a corpus of ""how-to"" videos from the web, and the idea is that an object that can be seen (""car""), or a scene that is being detected (""kitchen"") can be used to condition both models on the ""context"" of the recording, thereby reducing perplexity and improving transcription. We achieve good improvements in both cases and compare and analyze the respective reductions in word error rate. We expect that our results can be used for any type of speech processing in which ""context"" information is available, for example in robotics, man-machine interaction, or when indexing large audio-visual archives, and should ultimately help to bring together the ""video-to-text"" and ""speech-to-text"" communities."
Exploiting Nontrivial Connectivity for Automatic Speech Recognition,"Nontrivial connectivity has allowed the training of very deep networks by addressing the problem of vanishing gradients and offering a more efficient method of reusing parameters. In this paper we make a comparison between residual networks, densely-connected networks and highway networks on an image classification task. Next, we show that these methodologies can easily be deployed into automatic speech recognition and provide significant improvements to existing models."
Realistic multi-microphone data simulation for distant speech recognition,"The availability of realistic simulated corpora is of key importance for the future progress of distant speech recognition technology. The reliability, flexibility and low computational cost of a data simulation process may ultimately allow researchers to train, tune and test different techniques in a variety of acoustic scenarios, avoiding the laborious effort of directly recording real data from the targeted environment.  In the last decade, several simulated corpora have been released to the research community, including the data-sets distributed in the context of projects and international challenges, such as CHiME and REVERB. These efforts were extremely useful to derive baselines and common evaluation frameworks for comparison purposes. At the same time, in many cases they highlighted the need of a better coherence between real and simulated conditions.  In this paper, we examine this issue and we describe our approach to the generation of realistic corpora in a domestic context. Experimental validation, conducted in a multi-microphone scenario, shows that a comparable performance trend can be observed with both real and simulated data across different recognition frameworks, acoustic models, as well as multi-microphone processing techniques."
Deep Long Short-Term Memory Adaptive Beamforming Networks For Multichannel Robust Speech Recognition,"Far-field speech recognition in noisy and reverberant conditions remains a challenging problem despite recent deep learning breakthroughs. This problem is commonly addressed by acquiring a speech signal from multiple microphones and performing beamforming over them. In this paper, we propose to use a recurrent neural network with long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture to adaptively estimate real-time beamforming filter coefficients to cope with non-stationary environmental noise and dynamic nature of source and microphones positions which results in a set of timevarying room impulse responses. The LSTM adaptive beamformer is jointly trained with a deep LSTM acoustic model to predict senone labels. Further, we use hidden units in the deep LSTM acoustic model to assist in predicting the beamforming filter coefficients. The proposed system achieves 7.97% absolute gain over baseline systems with no beamforming on CHiME-3 real evaluation set."
Unsupervised Adaptation with Domain Separation Networks for Robust Speech Recognition,"Unsupervised domain adaptation of speech signal aims at adapting a well-trained source-domain acoustic model to the unlabeled data from target domain. This can be achieved by adversarial training of deep neural network (DNN) acoustic models to learn an intermediate deep representation that is both senone-discriminative and domain-invariant. Specifically, the DNN is trained to jointly optimize the primary task of senone classification and the secondary task of domain classification with adversarial objective functions. In this work, instead of only focusing on learning a domain-invariant feature (i.e. the shared component between domains), we also characterize the difference between the source and target domain distributions by explicitly modeling the private component of each domain through a private component extractor DNN. The private component is trained to be orthogonal with the shared component and thus implicitly increases the degree of domain-invariance of the shared component. A reconstructor DNN is used to reconstruct the original speech feature from the private and shared components as a regularization. This domain separation framework is applied to the unsupervised environment adaptation task and achieved 11.08% relative WER reduction from the gradient reversal layer training, a representative adversarial training method, for automatic speech recognition on CHiME-3 dataset."
Speech recognition for medical conversations,"In this work we explored building automatic speech recognition models for transcribing doctor patient conversation. We collected a large scale dataset of clinical conversations (14,000 hr), designed the task to represent the real word scenario, and explored several alignment approaches to iteratively improve data quality. We explored both CTC and LAS systems for building speech recognition models. The LAS was more resilient to noisy data and CTC required more data clean up. A detailed analysis is provided for understanding the performance for clinical tasks. Our analysis showed the speech recognition models performed well on important medical utterances, while errors occurred in causal conversations. Overall we believe the resulting models can provide reasonable quality in practice."
Exploring Speech Enhancement with Generative Adversarial Networks for Robust Speech Recognition,"We investigate the effectiveness of generative adversarial networks (GANs) for speech enhancement, in the context of improving noise robustness of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Prior work demonstrates that GANs can effectively suppress additive noise in raw waveform speech signals, improving perceptual quality metrics; however this technique was not justified in the context of ASR. In this work, we conduct a detailed study to measure the effectiveness of GANs in enhancing speech contaminated by both additive and reverberant noise. Motivated by recent advances in image processing, we propose operating GANs on log-Mel filterbank spectra instead of waveforms, which requires less computation and is more robust to reverberant noise. While GAN enhancement improves the performance of a clean-trained ASR system on noisy speech, it falls short of the performance achieved by conventional multi-style training (MTR). By appending the GAN-enhanced features to the noisy inputs and retraining, we achieve a 7% WER improvement relative to the MTR system."
Lattice Rescoring Strategies for Long Short Term Memory Language Models in Speech Recognition,"Recurrent neural network (RNN) language models (LMs) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) LMs, a variant of RNN LMs, have been shown to outperform traditional N-gram LMs on speech recognition tasks. However, these models are computationally more expensive than N-gram LMs for decoding, and thus, challenging to integrate into speech recognizers. Recent research has proposed the use of lattice-rescoring algorithms using RNNLMs and LSTMLMs as an efficient strategy to integrate these models into a speech recognition system. In this paper, we evaluate existing lattice rescoring algorithms along with new variants on a YouTube speech recognition task. Lattice rescoring using LSTMLMs reduces the word error rate (WER) for this task by 8\% relative to the WER obtained using an N-gram LM."
Phonemic and Graphemic Multilingual CTC Based Speech Recognition,"Training automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems requires large amounts of data in the target language in order to achieve good performance. Whereas large training corpora are readily available for languages like English, there exists a long tail of languages which do suffer from a lack of resources. One method to handle data sparsity is to use data from additional source languages and build a multilingual system. Recently, ASR systems based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained with connectionist temporal classification (CTC) have gained substantial research interest. In this work, we extended our previous approach towards training CTC-based systems multilingually. Our systems feature a global phone set, based on the joint phone sets of each source language. We evaluated the use of different language combinations as well as the addition of Language Feature Vectors (LFVs). As contrastive experiment, we built systems based on graphemes as well. Systems having a multilingual phone set are known to suffer in performance compared to their monolingual counterparts. With our proposed approach, we could reduce the gap between these mono- and multilingual setups, using either graphemes or phonemes."
Reinforcement Learning of Speech Recognition System Based on Policy Gradient and Hypothesis Selection,"Speech recognition systems have achieved high recognition performance for several tasks. However, the performance of such systems is dependent on the tremendously costly development work of preparing vast amounts of task-matched transcribed speech data for supervised training. The key problem here is the cost of transcribing speech data. The cost is repeatedly required to support new languages and new tasks. Assuming broad network services for transcribing speech data for many users, a system would become more self-sufficient and more useful if it possessed the ability to learn from very light feedback from the users without annoying them. In this paper, we propose a general reinforcement learning framework for speech recognition systems based on the policy gradient method. As a particular instance of the framework, we also propose a hypothesis selection-based reinforcement learning method. The proposed framework provides a new view for several existing training and adaptation methods. The experimental results show that the proposed method improves the recognition performance compared to unsupervised adaptation."
Improved training for online end-to-end speech recognition systems,"Achieving high accuracy with end-to-end speech recognizers requires careful parameter initialization prior to training. Otherwise, the networks may fail to find a good local optimum. This is particularly true for online networks, such as unidirectional LSTMs. Currently, the best strategy to train such systems is to bootstrap the training from a tied-triphone system. However, this is time consuming, and more importantly, is impossible for languages without a high-quality pronunciation lexicon. In this work, we propose an initialization strategy that uses teacher-student learning to transfer knowledge from a large, well-trained, offline end-to-end speech recognition model to an online end-to-end model, eliminating the need for a lexicon or any other linguistic resources. We also explore curriculum learning and label smoothing and show how they can be combined with the proposed teacher-student learning for further improvements. We evaluate our methods on a Microsoft Cortana personal assistant task and show that the proposed method results in a 19 % relative improvement in word error rate compared to a randomly-initialized baseline system."
Towards Language-Universal End-to-End Speech Recognition,"Building speech recognizers in multiple languages typically involves replicating a monolingual training recipe for each language, or utilizing a multi-task learning approach where models for different languages have separate output labels but share some internal parameters. In this work, we exploit recent progress in end-to-end speech recognition to create a single multilingual speech recognition system capable of recognizing any of the languages seen in training. To do so, we propose the use of a universal character set that is shared among all languages. We also create a language-specific gating mechanism within the network that can modulate the network's internal representations in a language-specific way. We evaluate our proposed approach on the Microsoft Cortana task across three languages and show that our system outperforms both the individual monolingual systems and systems built with a multi-task learning approach. We also show that this model can be used to initialize a monolingual speech recognizer, and can be used to create a bilingual model for use in code-switching scenarios."
Multilingual Speech Recognition With A Single End-To-End Model,"Training a conventional automatic speech recognition (ASR) system to support multiple languages is challenging because the sub-word unit, lexicon and word inventories are typically language specific. In contrast, sequence-to-sequence models are well suited for multilingual ASR because they encapsulate an acoustic, pronunciation and language model jointly in a single network. In this work we present a single sequence-to-sequence ASR model trained on 9 different Indian languages, which have very little overlap in their scripts. Specifically, we take a union of language-specific grapheme sets and train a grapheme-based sequence-to-sequence model jointly on data from all languages. We find that this model, which is not explicitly given any information about language identity, improves recognition performance by 21% relative compared to analogous sequence-to-sequence models trained on each language individually. By modifying the model to accept a language identifier as an additional input feature, we further improve performance by an additional 7% relative and eliminate confusion between different languages."
Robust Speech Recognition Using Generative Adversarial Networks,"This paper describes a general, scalable, end-to-end framework that uses the generative adversarial network (GAN) objective to enable robust speech recognition. Encoders trained with the proposed approach enjoy improved invariance by learning to map noisy audio to the same embedding space as that of clean audio. Unlike previous methods, the new framework does not rely on domain expertise or simplifying assumptions as are often needed in signal processing, and directly encourages robustness in a data-driven way. We show the new approach improves simulated far-field speech recognition of vanilla sequence-to-sequence models without specialized front-ends or preprocessing."
Learning Filterbanks from Raw Speech for Phone Recognition,"We train a bank of complex filters that operates on the raw waveform and is fed into a convolutional neural network for end-to-end phone recognition. These time-domain filterbanks (TD-filterbanks) are initialized as an approximation of mel-filterbanks, and then fine-tuned jointly with the remaining convolutional architecture. We perform phone recognition experiments on TIMIT and show that for several architectures, models trained on TD-filterbanks consistently outperform their counterparts trained on comparable mel-filterbanks. We get our best performance by learning all front-end steps, from pre-emphasis up to averaging. Finally, we observe that the filters at convergence have an asymmetric impulse response, and that some of them remain almost analytic."
Dual Language Models for Code Switched Speech Recognition,"In this work, we present a simple and elegant approach to language modeling for bilingual code-switched text. Since code-switching is a blend of two or more different languages, a standard bilingual language model can be improved upon by using structures of the monolingual language models. We propose a novel technique called dual language models, which involves building two complementary monolingual language models and combining them using a probabilistic model for switching between the two. We evaluate the efficacy of our approach using a conversational Mandarin-English speech corpus. We prove the robustness of our model by showing significant improvements in perplexity measures over the standard bilingual language model without the use of any external information. Similar consistent improvements are also reflected in automatic speech recognition error rates."
Deep word embeddings for visual speech recognition,"In this paper we present a deep learning architecture for extracting word embeddings for visual speech recognition. The embeddings summarize the information of the mouth region that is relevant to the problem of word recognition, while suppressing other types of variability such as speaker, pose and illumination. The system is comprised of a spatiotemporal convolutional layer, a Residual Network and bidirectional LSTMs and is trained on the Lipreading in-the-wild database. We first show that the proposed architecture goes beyond state-of-the-art on closed-set word identification, by attaining 11.92% error rate on a vocabulary of 500 words. We then examine the capacity of the embeddings in modelling words unseen during training. We deploy Probabilistic Linear Discriminant Analysis (PLDA) to model the embeddings and perform low-shot learning experiments on words unseen during training. The experiments demonstrate that word-level visual speech recognition is feasible even in cases where the target words are not included in the training set."
BridgeNets: Student-Teacher Transfer Learning Based on Recursive Neural Networks and its Application to Distant Speech Recognition,"Despite the remarkable progress achieved on automatic speech recognition, recognizing far-field speeches mixed with various noise sources is still a challenging task. In this paper, we introduce novel student-teacher transfer learning, BridgeNet which can provide a solution to improve distant speech recognition. There are two key features in BridgeNet. First, BridgeNet extends traditional student-teacher frameworks by providing multiple hints from a teacher network. Hints are not limited to the soft labels from a teacher network. Teacher's intermediate feature representations can better guide a student network to learn how to denoise or dereverberate noisy input. Second, the proposed recursive architecture in the BridgeNet can iteratively improve denoising and recognition performance. The experimental results of BridgeNet showed significant improvements in tackling the distant speech recognition problem, where it achieved up to 13.24% relative WER reductions on AMI corpus compared to a baseline neural network without teacher's hints."
Acoustic Landmarks Contain More Information About the Phone String than Other Frames for Automatic Speech Recognition with Deep Neural Network Acoustic Model,"Most mainstream Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems consider all feature frames equally important. However, acoustic landmark theory is based on a contradictory idea, that some frames are more important than others. Acoustic landmark theory exploits quantal non-linearities in the articulatory-acoustic and acoustic-perceptual relations to define landmark times at which the speech spectrum abruptly changes or reaches an extremum; frames overlapping landmarks have been demonstrated to be sufficient for speech perception. In this work, we conduct experiments on the TIMIT corpus, with both GMM and DNN based ASR systems and find that frames containing landmarks are more informative for ASR than others. We find that altering the level of emphasis on landmarks by re-weighting acoustic likelihood tends to reduce the phone error rate (PER). Furthermore, by leveraging the landmark as a heuristic, one of our hybrid DNN frame dropping strategies maintained a PER within 0.44% of optimal when scoring less than half (45.8% to be precise) of the frames. This hybrid strategy out-performs other non-heuristic-based methods and demonstrate the potential of landmarks for reducing computation."
Trace norm regularization and faster inference for embedded speech recognition RNNs,"We propose and evaluate new techniques for compressing and speeding up dense matrix multiplications as found in the fully connected and recurrent layers of neural networks for embedded large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR). For compression, we introduce and study a trace norm regularization technique for training low rank factored versions of matrix multiplications. Compared to standard low rank training, we show that our method leads to good accuracy versus number of parameter trade-offs and can be used to speed up training of large models. For speedup, we enable faster inference on ARM processors through new open sourced kernels optimized for small batch sizes, resulting in 3x to 7x speed ups over the widely used gemmlowp library. Beyond LVCSR, we expect our techniques and kernels to be more generally applicable to embedded neural networks with large fully connected or recurrent layers."
Listening to the World Improves Speech Command Recognition,"We study transfer learning in convolutional network architectures applied to the task of recognizing audio, such as environmental sound events and speech commands. Our key finding is that not only is it possible to transfer representations from an unrelated task like environmental sound classification to a voice-focused task like speech command recognition, but also that doing so improves accuracies significantly. We also investigate the effect of increased model capacity for transfer learning audio, by first validating known results from the field of Computer Vision of achieving better accuracies with increasingly deeper networks on two audio datasets: UrbanSound8k and the newly released Google Speech Commands dataset. Then we propose a simple multiscale input representation using dilated convolutions and show that it is able to aggregate larger contexts and increase classification performance. Further, the models trained using a combination of transfer learning and multiscale input representations need only 40% of the training data to achieve similar accuracies as a freshly trained model with 100% of the training data. Finally, we demonstrate a positive interaction effect for the multiscale input and transfer learning, making a case for the joint application of the two techniques."
Combining Multiple Views for Visual Speech Recognition,"Visual speech recognition is a challenging research problem with a particular practical application of aiding audio speech recognition in noisy scenarios. Multiple camera setups can be beneficial for the visual speech recognition systems in terms of improved performance and robustness. In this paper, we explore this aspect and provide a comprehensive study on combining multiple views for visual speech recognition. The thorough analysis covers fusion of all possible view angle combinations both at feature level and decision level. The employed visual speech recognition system in this study extracts features through a PCA-based convolutional neural network, followed by an LSTM network. Finally, these features are processed in a tandem system, being fed into a GMM-HMM scheme. The decision fusion acts after this point by combining the Viterbi path log-likelihoods. The results show that the complementary information contained in recordings from different view angles improves the results significantly. For example, the sentence correctness on the test set is increased from 76% for the highest performing single view (30^\circ) to up to 83% when combining this view with the frontal and 60^\circ view angles."
Visual Speech Recognition Using PCA Networks and LSTMs in a Tandem GMM-HMM System,"Automatic visual speech recognition is an interesting problem in pattern recognition especially when audio data is noisy or not readily available. It is also a very challenging task mainly because of the lower amount of information in the visual articulations compared to the audible utterance. In this work, principle component analysis is applied to the image patches - extracted from the video data - to learn the weights of a two-stage convolutional network. Block histograms are then extracted as the unsupervised learning features. These features are employed to learn a recurrent neural network with a set of long short-term memory cells to obtain spatiotemporal features. Finally, the obtained features are used in a tandem GMM-HMM system for speech recognition. Our results show that the proposed method has outperformed the baseline techniques applied to the OuluVS2 audiovisual database for phrase recognition with the frontal view cross-validation and testing sentence correctness reaching 79% and 73%, respectively, as compared to the baseline of 74% on cross-validation."
Adapting general-purpose speech recognition engine output for domain-specific natural language question answering,"Speech-based natural language question-answering interfaces to enterprise systems are gaining a lot of attention. General-purpose speech engines can be integrated with NLP systems to provide such interfaces. Usually, general-purpose speech engines are trained on large `general' corpus. However, when such engines are used for specific domains, they may not recognize domain-specific words well, and may produce erroneous output. Further, the accent and the environmental conditions in which the speaker speaks a sentence may induce the speech engine to inaccurately recognize certain words. The subsequent natural language question-answering does not produce the requisite results as the question does not accurately represent what the speaker intended. Thus, the speech engine's output may need to be adapted for a domain before further natural language processing is carried out. We present two mechanisms for such an adaptation, one based on evolutionary development and the other based on machine learning, and show how we can repair the speech-output to make the subsequent natural language question-answering better."
Contaminated speech training methods for robust DNN-HMM distant speech recognition,"Despite the significant progress made in the last years, state-of-the-art speech recognition technologies provide a satisfactory performance only in the close-talking condition. Robustness of distant speech recognition in adverse acoustic conditions, on the other hand, remains a crucial open issue for future applications of human-machine interaction. To this end, several advances in speech enhancement, acoustic scene analysis as well as acoustic modeling, have recently contributed to improve the state-of-the-art in the field. One of the most effective approaches to derive a robust acoustic modeling is based on using contaminated speech, which proved helpful in reducing the acoustic mismatch between training and testing conditions.  In this paper, we revise this classical approach in the context of modern DNN-HMM systems, and propose the adoption of three methods, namely, asymmetric context windowing, close-talk based supervision, and close-talk based pre-training. The experimental results, obtained using both real and simulated data, show a significant advantage in using these three methods, overall providing a 15% error rate reduction compared to the baseline systems. The same trend in performance is confirmed either using a high-quality training set of small size, and a large one."
The DIRHA-English corpus and related tasks for distant-speech recognition in domestic environments,"This paper introduces the contents and the possible usage of the DIRHA-ENGLISH multi-microphone corpus, recently realized under the EC DIRHA project. The reference scenario is a domestic environment equipped with a large number of microphones and microphone arrays distributed in space.  The corpus is composed of both real and simulated material, and it includes 12 US and 12 UK English native speakers. Each speaker uttered different sets of phonetically-rich sentences, newspaper articles, conversational speech, keywords, and commands. From this material, a large set of 1-minute sequences was generated, which also includes typical domestic background noise as well as inter/intra-room reverberation effects. Dev and test sets were derived, which represent a very precious material for different studies on multi-microphone speech processing and distant-speech recognition. Various tasks and corresponding Kaldi recipes have already been developed.  The paper reports a first set of baseline results obtained using different techniques, including Deep Neural Networks (DNN), aligned with the state-of-the-art at international level."
Visual speech recognition: aligning terminologies for better understanding,"We are at an exciting time for machine lipreading. Traditional research stemmed from the adaptation of audio recognition systems. But now, the computer vision community is also participating. This joining of two previously disparate areas with different perspectives on computer lipreading is creating opportunities for collaborations, but in doing so the literature is experiencing challenges in knowledge sharing due to multiple uses of terms and phrases and the range of methods for scoring results.  In particular we highlight three areas with the intention to improve communication between those researching lipreading; the effects of interchanging between speech reading and lipreading; speaker dependence across train, validation, and test splits; and the use of accuracy, correctness, errors, and varying units (phonemes, visemes, words, and sentences) to measure system performance. We make recommendations as to how we can be more consistent."
Resolution limits on visual speech recognition,"Visual-only speech recognition is dependent upon a number of factors that can be difficult to control, such as: lighting; identity; motion; emotion and expression. But some factors, such as video resolution are controllable, so it is surprising that there is not yet a systematic study of the effect of resolution on lip-reading. Here we use a new data set, the Rosetta Raven data, to train and test recognizers so we can measure the affect of video resolution on recognition accuracy. We conclude that, contrary to common practice, resolution need not be that great for automatic lip-reading. However it is highly unlikely that automatic lip-reading can work reliably when the distance between the bottom of the lower lip and the top of the upper lip is less than four pixels at rest."
Improving speech recognition by revising gated recurrent units,"Speech recognition is largely taking advantage of deep learning, showing that substantial benefits can be obtained by modern Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). The most popular RNNs are Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs), which typically reach state-of-the-art performance in many tasks thanks to their ability to learn long-term dependencies and robustness to vanishing gradients. Nevertheless, LSTMs have a rather complex design with three multiplicative gates, that might impair their efficient implementation. An attempt to simplify LSTMs has recently led to Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), which are based on just two multiplicative gates.  This paper builds on these efforts by further revising GRUs and proposing a simplified architecture potentially more suitable for speech recognition. The contribution of this work is two-fold. First, we suggest to remove the reset gate in the GRU design, resulting in a more efficient single-gate architecture. Second, we propose to replace tanh with ReLU activations in the state update equations. Results show that, in our implementation, the revised architecture reduces the per-epoch training time with more than 30% and consistently improves recognition performance across different tasks, input features, and noisy conditions when compared to a standard GRU."
Towards Indonesian Speech-Emotion Automatic Recognition (I-SpEAR),"Even though speech-emotion recognition (SER) has been receiving much attention as research topic, there are still some disputes about which vocal features can identify certain emotion. Emotion expression is also known to be differed according to the cultural backgrounds that make it important to study SER specific to the culture where the language belongs to. Furthermore, only a few studies addresses the SER in Indonesian which what this study attempts to explore. In this study, we extract simple features from 3420 voice data gathered from 38 participants. The features are compared by means of linear mixed effect model which shows that people who are in emotional and non-emotional state can be differentiated by their speech duration. Using SVM and speech duration as input feature, we achieve 76.84% average accuracy in classifying emotional and non-emotional speech."
Research on several key technologies in practical speech emotion recognition,"In this dissertation the practical speech emotion recognition technology is studied, including several cognitive related emotion types, namely fidgetiness, confidence and tiredness. The high quality of naturalistic emotional speech data is the basis of this research. The following techniques are used for inducing practical emotional speech: cognitive task, computer game, noise stimulation, sleep deprivation and movie clips.  A practical speech emotion recognition system is studied based on Gaussian mixture model. A two-class classifier set is adopted for performance improvement under the small sample case. Considering the context information in continuous emotional speech, a Gaussian mixture model embedded with Markov networks is proposed.  A further study is carried out for system robustness analysis. First, noise reduction algorithm based on auditory masking properties is fist introduced to the practical speech emotion recognition. Second, to deal with the complicated unknown emotion types under real situation, an emotion recognition method with rejection ability is proposed, which enhanced the system compatibility against unknown emotion samples. Third, coping with the difficulties brought by a large number of unknown speakers, an emotional feature normalization method based on speaker-sensitive feature clustering is proposed. Fourth, by adding the electrocardiogram channel, a bi-modal emotion recognition system based on speech signals and electrocardiogram signals is first introduced.  The speech emotion recognition methods studied in this dissertation may be extended into the cross-language speech emotion recognition and the whispered speech emotion recognition."
Mitigating the Impact of Speech Recognition Errors on Chatbot using Sequence-to-Sequence Model,"We apply sequence-to-sequence model to mitigate the impact of speech recognition errors on open domain end-to-end dialog generation. We cast the task as a domain adaptation problem where ASR transcriptions and original text are in two different domains. In this paper, our proposed model includes two individual encoders for each domain data and make their hidden states similar to ensure the decoder predict the same dialog text. The method shows that the sequence-to-sequence model can learn the ASR transcriptions and original text pair having the same meaning and eliminate the speech recognition errors. Experimental results on Cornell movie dialog dataset demonstrate that the domain adaption system help the spoken dialog system generate more similar responses with the original text answers."
WERd: Using Social Text Spelling Variants for Evaluating Dialectal Speech Recognition,"We study the problem of evaluating automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems that target dialectal speech input. A major challenge in this case is that the orthography of dialects is typically not standardized. From an ASR evaluation perspective, this means that there is no clear gold standard for the expected output, and several possible outputs could be considered correct according to different human annotators, which makes standard word error rate (WER) inadequate as an evaluation metric. Such a situation is typical for machine translation (MT), and thus we borrow ideas from an MT evaluation metric, namely TERp, an extension of translation error rate which is closely-related to WER. In particular, in the process of comparing a hypothesis to a reference, we make use of spelling variants for words and phrases, which we mine from Twitter in an unsupervised fashion. Our experiments with evaluating ASR output for Egyptian Arabic, and further manual analysis, show that the resulting WERd (i.e., WER for dialects) metric, a variant of TERp, is more adequate than WER for evaluating dialectal ASR."
Speech Recognition Challenge in the Wild: Arabic MGB-3,"This paper describes the Arabic MGB-3 Challenge - Arabic Speech Recognition in the Wild. Unlike last year's Arabic MGB-2 Challenge, for which the recognition task was based on more than 1,200 hours broadcast TV news recordings from Aljazeera Arabic TV programs, MGB-3 emphasises dialectal Arabic using a multi-genre collection of Egyptian YouTube videos. Seven genres were used for the data collection: comedy, cooking, family/kids, fashion, drama, sports, and science (TEDx). A total of 16 hours of videos, split evenly across the different genres, were divided into adaptation, development and evaluation data sets. The Arabic MGB-Challenge comprised two tasks: A) Speech transcription, evaluated on the MGB-3 test set, along with the 10 hour MGB-2 test set to report progress on the MGB-2 evaluation; B) Arabic dialect identification, introduced this year in order to distinguish between four major Arabic dialects - Egyptian, Levantine, North African, Gulf, as well as Modern Standard Arabic. Two hours of audio per dialect were released for development and a further two hours were used for evaluation. For dialect identification, both lexical features and i-vector bottleneck features were shared with participants in addition to the raw audio recordings. Overall, thirteen teams submitted ten systems to the challenge. We outline the approaches adopted in each system, and summarise the evaluation results."
AISHELL-1: An Open-Source Mandarin Speech Corpus and A Speech Recognition Baseline,"An open-source Mandarin speech corpus called AISHELL-1 is released. It is by far the largest corpus which is suitable for conducting the speech recognition research and building speech recognition systems for Mandarin. The recording procedure, including audio capturing devices and environments are presented in details. The preparation of the related resources, including transcriptions and lexicon are described. The corpus is released with a Kaldi recipe. Experimental results implies that the quality of audio recordings and transcriptions are promising."
Analyzing Hidden Representations in End-to-End Automatic Speech Recognition Systems,"Neural models have become ubiquitous in automatic speech recognition systems. While neural networks are typically used as acoustic models in more complex systems, recent studies have explored end-to-end speech recognition systems based on neural networks, which can be trained to directly predict text from input acoustic features. Although such systems are conceptually elegant and simpler than traditional systems, it is less obvious how to interpret the trained models. In this work, we analyze the speech representations learned by a deep end-to-end model that is based on convolutional and recurrent layers, and trained with a connectionist temporal classification (CTC) loss. We use a pre-trained model to generate frame-level features which are given to a classifier that is trained on frame classification into phones. We evaluate representations from different layers of the deep model and compare their quality for predicting phone labels. Our experiments shed light on important aspects of the end-to-end model such as layer depth, model complexity, and other design choices."
Leveraging Deep Neural Network Activation Entropy to cope with Unseen Data in Speech Recognition,"Unseen data conditions can inflict serious performance degradation on systems relying on supervised machine learning algorithms. Because data can often be unseen, and because traditional machine learning algorithms are trained in a supervised manner, unsupervised adaptation techniques must be used to adapt the model to the unseen data conditions. However, unsupervised adaptation is often challenging, as one must generate some hypothesis given a model and then use that hypothesis to bootstrap the model to the unseen data conditions. Unfortunately, reliability of such hypotheses is often poor, given the mismatch between the training and testing datasets. In such cases, a model hypothesis confidence measure enables performing data selection for the model adaptation. Underlying this approach is the fact that for unseen data conditions, data variability is introduced to the model, which the model propagates to its output decision, impacting decision reliability. In a fully connected network, this data variability is propagated as distortions from one layer to the next. This work aims to estimate the propagation of such distortion in the form of network activation entropy, which is measured over a short- time running window on the activation from each neuron of a given hidden layer, and these measurements are then used to compute summary entropy. This work demonstrates that such an entropy measure can help to select data for unsupervised model adaptation, resulting in performance gains in speech recognition tasks. Results from standard benchmark speech recognition tasks show that the proposed approach can alleviate the performance degradation experienced under unseen data conditions by iteratively adapting the model to the unseen datas acoustic condition."
The Microsoft 2017 Conversational Speech Recognition System,"We describe the 2017 version of Microsoft's conversational speech recognition system, in which we update our 2016 system with recent developments in neural-network-based acoustic and language modeling to further advance the state of the art on the Switchboard speech recognition task. The system adds a CNN-BLSTM acoustic model to the set of model architectures we combined previously, and includes character-based and dialog session aware LSTM language models in rescoring. For system combination we adopt a two-stage approach, whereby subsets of acoustic models are first combined at the senone/frame level, followed by a word-level voting via confusion networks. We also added a confusion network rescoring step after system combination. The resulting system yields a 5.1\% word error rate on the 2000 Switchboard evaluation set."
Learning spectro-temporal features with 3D CNNs for speech emotion recognition,"In this paper, we propose to use deep 3-dimensional convolutional networks (3D CNNs) in order to address the challenge of modelling spectro-temporal dynamics for speech emotion recognition (SER). Compared to a hybrid of Convolutional Neural Network and Long-Short-Term-Memory (CNN-LSTM), our proposed 3D CNNs simultaneously extract short-term and long-term spectral features with a moderate number of parameters. We evaluated our proposed and other state-of-the-art methods in a speaker-independent manner using aggregated corpora that give a large and diverse set of speakers. We found that 1) shallow temporal and moderately deep spectral kernels of a homogeneous architecture are optimal for the task; and 2) our 3D CNNs are more effective for spectro-temporal feature learning compared to other methods. Finally, we visualised the feature space obtained with our proposed method using t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (T-SNE) and could observe distinct clusters of emotions."
"Towards Speech Emotion Recognition ""in the wild"" using Aggregated Corpora and Deep Multi-Task Learning","One of the challenges in Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) ""in the wild"" is the large mismatch between training and test data (e.g. speakers and tasks). In order to improve the generalisation capabilities of the emotion models, we propose to use Multi-Task Learning (MTL) and use gender and naturalness as auxiliary tasks in deep neural networks. This method was evaluated in within-corpus and various cross-corpus classification experiments that simulate conditions ""in the wild"". In comparison to Single-Task Learning (STL) based state of the art methods, we found that our MTL method proposed improved performance significantly. Particularly, models using both gender and naturalness achieved more gains than those using either gender or naturalness separately. This benefit was also found in the high-level representations of the feature space, obtained from our method proposed, where discriminative emotional clusters could be observed."
End-to-End Neural Segmental Models for Speech Recognition,"Segmental models are an alternative to frame-based models for sequence prediction, where hypothesized path weights are based on entire segment scores rather than a single frame at a time. Neural segmental models are segmental models that use neural network-based weight functions. Neural segmental models have achieved competitive results for speech recognition, and their end-to-end training has been explored in several studies. In this work, we review neural segmental models, which can be viewed as consisting of a neural network-based acoustic encoder and a finite-state transducer decoder. We study end-to-end segmental models with different weight functions, including ones based on frame-level neural classifiers and on segmental recurrent neural networks. We study how reducing the search space size impacts performance under different weight functions. We also compare several loss functions for end-to-end training. Finally, we explore training approaches, including multi-stage vs. end-to-end training and multitask training that combines segmental and frame-level losses."
A breakthrough in Speech emotion recognition using Deep Retinal Convolution Neural Networks,"Speech emotion recognition (SER) is to study the formation and change of speaker's emotional state from the speech signal perspective, so as to make the interaction between human and computer more intelligent. SER is a challenging task that has encountered the problem of less training data and low prediction accuracy. Here we propose a data augmentation algorithm based on the imaging principle of the retina and convex lens, to acquire the different sizes of spectrogram and increase the amount of training data by changing the distance between the spectrogram and the convex lens. Meanwhile, with the help of deep learning to get the high-level features, we propose the Deep Retinal Convolution Neural Networks (DRCNNs) for SER and achieve the average accuracy over 99%. The experimental results indicate that DRCNNs outperforms the previous studies in terms of both the number of emotions and the accuracy of recognition. Predictably, our results will dramatically improve human-computer interaction."
Exploring Neural Transducers for End-to-End Speech Recognition,"In this work, we perform an empirical comparison among the CTC, RNN-Transducer, and attention-based Seq2Seq models for end-to-end speech recognition. We show that, without any language model, Seq2Seq and RNN-Transducer models both outperform the best reported CTC models with a language model, on the popular Hub5'00 benchmark. On our internal diverse dataset, these trends continue - RNNTransducer models rescored with a language model after beam search outperform our best CTC models. These results simplify the speech recognition pipeline so that decoding can now be expressed purely as neural network operations. We also study how the choice of encoder architecture affects the performance of the three models - when all encoder layers are forward only, and when encoders downsample the input representation aggressively."
Attention-Based End-to-End Speech Recognition on Voice Search,"Recently, there has been a growing interest in end-to-end speech recognition that directly transcribes speech to text without any predefined alignments. In this paper, we explore the use of attention-based encoder-decoder model for Mandarin speech recognition on a voice search task. Previous attempts have shown that applying attention-based encoder-decoder to Mandarin speech recognition was quite difficult due to the logographic orthography of Mandarin, the large vocabulary and the conditional dependency of the attention model. In this paper, we use character embedding to deal with the large vocabulary. Several tricks are used for effective model training, including L2 regularization, Gaussian weight noise and frame skipping. We compare two attention mechanisms and use attention smoothing to cover long context in the attention model. Taken together, these tricks allow us to finally achieve a character error rate (CER) of 3.58% and a sentence error rate (SER) of 7.43% on the MiTV voice search dataset. While together with a trigram language model, CER and SER reach 2.81% and 5.77%, respectively."
Progressive Joint Modeling in Unsupervised Single-channel Overlapped Speech Recognition,"Unsupervised single-channel overlapped speech recognition is one of the hardest problems in automatic speech recognition (ASR). Permutation invariant training (PIT) is a state of the art model-based approach, which applies a single neural network to solve this single-input, multiple-output modeling problem. We propose to advance the current state of the art by imposing a modular structure on the neural network, applying a progressive pretraining regimen, and improving the objective function with transfer learning and a discriminative training criterion. The modular structure splits the problem into three sub-tasks: frame-wise interpreting, utterance-level speaker tracing, and speech recognition. The pretraining regimen uses these modules to solve progressively harder tasks. Transfer learning leverages parallel clean speech to improve the training targets for the network. Our discriminative training formulation is a modification of standard formulations, that also penalizes competing outputs of the system. Experiments are conducted on the artificial overlapped Switchboard and hub5e-swb dataset. The proposed framework achieves over 30% relative improvement of WER over both a strong jointly trained system, PIT for ASR, and a separately optimized system, PIT for speech separation with clean speech ASR model. The improvement comes from better model generalization, training efficiency and the sequence level linguistic knowledge integration."
Single-Channel Multi-talker Speech Recognition with Permutation Invariant Training,"Although great progresses have been made in automatic speech recognition (ASR), significant performance degradation is still observed when recognizing multi-talker mixed speech. In this paper, we propose and evaluate several architectures to address this problem under the assumption that only a single channel of mixed signal is available. Our technique extends permutation invariant training (PIT) by introducing the front-end feature separation module with the minimum mean square error (MSE) criterion and the back-end recognition module with the minimum cross entropy (CE) criterion. More specifically, during training we compute the average MSE or CE over the whole utterance for each possible utterance-level output-target assignment, pick the one with the minimum MSE or CE, and optimize for that assignment. This strategy elegantly solves the label permutation problem observed in the deep learning based multi-talker mixed speech separation and recognition systems. The proposed architectures are evaluated and compared on an artificially mixed AMI dataset with both two- and three-talker mixed speech. The experimental results indicate that our proposed architectures can cut the word error rate (WER) by 45.0% and 25.0% relatively against the state-of-the-art single-talker speech recognition system across all speakers when their energies are comparable, for two- and three-talker mixed speech, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first work on the multi-talker mixed speech recognition on the challenging speaker-independent spontaneous large vocabulary continuous speech task."
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Robust Speech Recognition via Variational Autoencoder-Based Data Augmentation,"Domain mismatch between training and testing can lead to significant degradation in performance in many machine learning scenarios. Unfortunately, this is not a rare situation for automatic speech recognition deployments in real-world applications. Research on robust speech recognition can be regarded as trying to overcome this domain mismatch issue. In this paper, we address the unsupervised domain adaptation problem for robust speech recognition, where both source and target domain speech are presented, but word transcripts are only available for the source domain speech. We present novel augmentation-based methods that transform speech in a way that does not change the transcripts. Specifically, we first train a variational autoencoder on both source and target domain data (without supervision) to learn a latent representation of speech. We then transform nuisance attributes of speech that are irrelevant to recognition by modifying the latent representations, in order to augment labeled training data with additional data whose distribution is more similar to the target domain. The proposed method is evaluated on the CHiME-4 dataset and reduces the absolute word error rate (WER) by as much as 35% compared to the non-adapted baseline."
Dynamic Layer Normalization for Adaptive Neural Acoustic Modeling in Speech Recognition,"Layer normalization is a recently introduced technique for normalizing the activities of neurons in deep neural networks to improve the training speed and stability. In this paper, we introduce a new layer normalization technique called Dynamic Layer Normalization (DLN) for adaptive neural acoustic modeling in speech recognition. By dynamically generating the scaling and shifting parameters in layer normalization, DLN adapts neural acoustic models to the acoustic variability arising from various factors such as speakers, channel noises, and environments. Unlike other adaptive acoustic models, our proposed approach does not require additional adaptation data or speaker information such as i-vectors. Moreover, the model size is fixed as it dynamically generates adaptation parameters. We apply our proposed DLN to deep bidirectional LSTM acoustic models and evaluate them on two benchmark datasets for large vocabulary ASR experiments: WSJ and TED-LIUM release 2. The experimental results show that our DLN improves neural acoustic models in terms of transcription accuracy by dynamically adapting to various speakers and environments."
Automatic Speech Recognition with Very Large Conversational Finnish and Estonian Vocabularies,"Today, the vocabulary size for language models in large vocabulary speech recognition is typically several hundreds of thousands of words. While this is already sufficient in some applications, the out-of-vocabulary words are still limiting the usability in others. In agglutinative languages the vocabulary for conversational speech should include millions of word forms to cover the spelling variations due to colloquial pronunciations, in addition to the word compounding and inflections. Very large vocabularies are also needed, for example, when the recognition of rare proper names is important."
Rank-1 Constrained Multichannel Wiener Filter for Speech Recognition in Noisy Environments,"Multichannel linear filters, such as the Multichannel Wiener Filter (MWF) and the Generalized Eigenvalue (GEV) beamformer are popular signal processing techniques which can improve speech recognition performance. In this paper, we present an experimental study on these linear filters in a specific speech recognition task, namely the CHiME-4 challenge, which features real recordings in multiple noisy environments. Specifically, the rank-1 MWF is employed for noise reduction and a new constant residual noise power constraint is derived which enhances the recognition performance. To fulfill the underlying rank-1 assumption, the speech covariance matrix is reconstructed based on eigenvectors or generalized eigenvectors. Then the rank-1 constrained MWF is evaluated with alternative multichannel linear filters under the same framework, which involves a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) network for mask estimation. The proposed filter outperforms alternative ones, leading to a 40% relative Word Error Rate (WER) reduction compared with the baseline Weighted Delay and Sum (WDAS) beamformer on the real test set, and a 15% relative WER reduction compared with the GEV-BAN method. The results also suggest that the speech recognition accuracy correlates more with the Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) feature variance than with the noise reduction or the speech distortion level."
Improving Speech Related Facial Action Unit Recognition by Audiovisual Information Fusion,"It is challenging to recognize facial action unit (AU) from spontaneous facial displays, especially when they are accompanied by speech. The major reason is that the information is extracted from a single source, i.e., the visual channel, in the current practice. However, facial activity is highly correlated with voice in natural human communications.  Instead of solely improving visual observations, this paper presents a novel audiovisual fusion framework, which makes the best use of visual and acoustic cues in recognizing speech-related facial AUs. In particular, a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) is employed to explicitly model the semantic and dynamic physiological relationships between AUs and phonemes as well as measurement uncertainty. A pilot audiovisual AU-coded database has been collected to evaluate the proposed framework, which consists of a ""clean"" subset containing frontal faces under well controlled circumstances and a challenging subset with large head movements and occlusions. Experiments on this database have demonstrated that the proposed framework yields significant improvement in recognizing speech-related AUs compared to the state-of-the-art visual-based methods especially for those AUs whose visual observations are impaired during speech, and more importantly also outperforms feature-level fusion methods by explicitly modeling and exploiting physiological relationships between AUs and phonemes."
An online sequence-to-sequence model for noisy speech recognition,"Generative models have long been the dominant approach for speech recognition. The success of these models however relies on the use of sophisticated recipes and complicated machinery that is not easily accessible to non-practitioners. Recent innovations in Deep Learning have given rise to an alternative - discriminative models called Sequence-to-Sequence models, that can almost match the accuracy of state of the art generative models. While these models are easy to train as they can be trained end-to-end in a single step, they have a practical limitation that they can only be used for offline recognition. This is because the models require that the entirety of the input sequence be available at the beginning of inference, an assumption that is not valid for instantaneous speech recognition. To address this problem, online sequence-to-sequence models were recently introduced. These models are able to start producing outputs as data arrives, and the model feels confident enough to output partial transcripts. These models, like sequence-to-sequence are causal - the output produced by the model until any time, t, affects the features that are computed subsequently. This makes the model inherently more powerful than generative models that are unable to change features that are computed from the data. This paper highlights two main contributions - an improvement to online sequence-to-sequence model training, and its application to noisy settings with mixed speech from two speakers."
Characterizing Types of Convolution in Deep Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks for Robust Speech Emotion Recognition,"Deep convolutional neural networks are being actively investigated in a wide range of speech and audio processing applications including speech recognition, audio event detection and computational paralinguistics, owing to their ability to reduce factors of variations, for learning from speech. However, studies have suggested to favor a certain type of convolutional operations when building a deep convolutional neural network for speech applications although there has been promising results using different types of convolutional operations. In this work, we study four types of convolutional operations on different input features for speech emotion recognition under noisy and clean conditions in order to derive a comprehensive understanding. Since affective behavioral information has been shown to reflect temporally varying of mental state and convolutional operation are applied locally in time, all deep neural networks share a deep recurrent sub-network architecture for further temporal modeling. We present detailed quantitative module-wise performance analysis to gain insights into information flows within the proposed architectures. In particular, we demonstrate the interplay of affective information and the other irrelevant information during the progression from one module to another. Finally we show that all of our deep neural networks provide state-of-the-art performance on the eNTERFACE'05 corpus."
Optimizing expected word error rate via sampling for speech recognition,"State-level minimum Bayes risk (sMBR) training has become the de facto standard for sequence-level training of speech recognition acoustic models. It has an elegant formulation using the expectation semiring, and gives large improvements in word error rate (WER) over models trained solely using cross-entropy (CE) or connectionist temporal classification (CTC). sMBR training optimizes the expected number of frames at which the reference and hypothesized acoustic states differ. It may be preferable to optimize the expected WER, but WER does not interact well with the expectation semiring, and previous approaches based on computing expected WER exactly involve expanding the lattices used during training. In this paper we show how to perform optimization of the expected WER by sampling paths from the lattices used during conventional sMBR training. The gradient of the expected WER is itself an expectation, and so may be approximated using Monte Carlo sampling. We show experimentally that optimizing WER during acoustic model training gives 5% relative improvement in WER over a well-tuned sMBR baseline on a 2-channel query recognition task (Google Home)."
Advances in Joint CTC-Attention based End-to-End Speech Recognition with a Deep CNN Encoder and RNN-LM,"We present a state-of-the-art end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model. We learn to listen and write characters with a joint Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) and attention-based encoder-decoder network. The encoder is a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on the VGG network. The CTC network sits on top of the encoder and is jointly trained with the attention-based decoder. During the beam search process, we combine the CTC predictions, the attention-based decoder predictions and a separately trained LSTM language model. We achieve a 5-10\% error reduction compared to prior systems on spontaneous Japanese and Chinese speech, and our end-to-end model beats out traditional hybrid ASR systems."
"Attentive Convolutional Neural Network based Speech Emotion Recognition: A Study on the Impact of Input Features, Signal Length, and Acted Speech","Speech emotion recognition is an important and challenging task in the realm of human-computer interaction. Prior work proposed a variety of models and feature sets for training a system. In this work, we conduct extensive experiments using an attentive convolutional neural network with multi-view learning objective function. We compare system performance using different lengths of the input signal, different types of acoustic features and different types of emotion speech (improvised/scripted). Our experimental results on the Interactive Emotional Motion Capture (IEMOCAP) database reveal that the recognition performance strongly depends on the type of speech data independent of the choice of input features. Furthermore, we achieved state-of-the-art results on the improvised speech data of IEMOCAP."
Transfer Learning for Speech Recognition on a Budget,"End-to-end training of automated speech recognition (ASR) systems requires massive data and compute resources. We explore transfer learning based on model adaptation as an approach for training ASR models under constrained GPU memory, throughput and training data. We conduct several systematic experiments adapting a Wav2Letter convolutional neural network originally trained for English ASR to the German language. We show that this technique allows faster training on consumer-grade resources while requiring less training data in order to achieve the same accuracy, thereby lowering the cost of training ASR models in other languages. Model introspection revealed that small adaptations to the network's weights were sufficient for good performance, especially for inner layers."
"Real-Time Robot Localization, Vision, and Speech Recognition on Nvidia Jetson TX1","Robotics systems are complex, often consisted of basic services including SLAM for localization and mapping, Convolution Neural Networks for scene understanding, and Speech Recognition for user interaction, etc. Meanwhile, robots are mobile and usually have tight energy constraints, integrating these services onto an embedded platform with around 10 W of power consumption is critical to the proliferation of mobile robots. In this paper, we present a case study on integrating real-time localization, vision, and speech recognition services on a mobile SoC, Nvidia Jetson TX1, within about 10 W of power envelope. In addition, we explore whether offloading some of the services to cloud platform can lead to further energy efficiency while meeting the real-time requirements"
Deep Learning for Environmentally Robust Speech Recognition: An Overview of Recent Developments,"Eliminating the negative effect of non-stationary environmental noise is a long-standing research topic for automatic speech recognition that stills remains an important challenge. Data-driven supervised approaches, including ones based on deep neural networks, have recently emerged as potential alternatives to traditional unsupervised approaches and with sufficient training, can alleviate the shortcomings of the unsupervised methods in various real-life acoustic environments. In this light, we review recently developed, representative deep learning approaches for tackling non-stationary additive and convolutional degradation of speech with the aim of providing guidelines for those involved in the development of environmentally robust speech recognition systems. We separately discuss single- and multi-channel techniques developed for the front-end and back-end of speech recognition systems, as well as joint front-end and back-end training frameworks."
Semi-Supervised Model Training for Unbounded Conversational Speech Recognition,"For conversational large-vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) tasks, up to about two thousand hours of audio is commonly used to train state of the art models. Collection of labeled conversational audio however, is prohibitively expensive, laborious and error-prone. Furthermore, academic corpora like Fisher English (2004) or Switchboard (1992) are inadequate to train models with sufficient accuracy in the unbounded space of conversational speech. These corpora are also timeworn due to dated acoustic telephony features and the rapid advancement of colloquial vocabulary and idiomatic speech over the last decades. Utilizing the colossal scale of our unlabeled telephony dataset, we propose a technique to construct a modern, high quality conversational speech training corpus on the order of hundreds of millions of utterances (or tens of thousands of hours) for both acoustic and language model training. We describe the data collection, selection and training, evaluating the results of our updated speech recognition system on a test corpus of 7K manually transcribed utterances. We show relative word error rate (WER) reductions of {35%, 19%} on {agent, caller} utterances over our seed model and 5% absolute WER improvements over IBM Watson STT on this conversational speech task."
Improved I-vector-based Speaker Recognition for Utterances with Speaker Generated Non-speech sounds,"Conversational speech not only contains several variants of neutral speech but is also prominently interlaced with several speaker generated non-speech sounds such as laughter and breath. A robust speaker recognition system should be capable of recognizing a speaker irrespective of these variations in his speech. An understanding of whether the speaker-specific information represented by these variations is similar or not helps build a good speaker recognition system. In this paper, speaker variations captured by neutral speech of a speaker is analyzed by considering speech-laugh (a variant of neutral speech) and laughter (non-speech) sounds of the speaker. We study an i-vector-based speaker recognition system trained only on neutral speech and evaluate its performance on speech-laugh and laughter. Further, we analyze the effect of including laughter sounds during training of an i-vector-basedspeaker recognition system. Our experimental results show that the inclusion of laughter sounds during training seem to provide complementary speaker-specific information which results in an overall improved performance of the speaker recognition system, especially on the utterances with speech-laugh segments."
Use of Knowledge Graph in Rescoring the N-Best List in Automatic Speech Recognition,"With the evolution of neural network based methods, automatic speech recognition (ASR) field has been advanced to a level where building an application with speech interface is a reality. In spite of these advances, building a real-time speech recogniser faces several problems such as low recognition accuracy, domain constraint, and out-of-vocabulary words. The low recognition accuracy problem is addressed by improving the acoustic model, language model, decoder and by rescoring the N-best list at the output of the decoder. We are considering the N-best list rescoring approach to improve the recognition accuracy. Most of the methods in the literature use the grammatical, lexical, syntactic and semantic connection between the words in a recognised sentence as a feature to rescore. In this paper, we have tried to see the semantic relatedness between the words in a sentence to rescore the N-best list. Semantic relatedness is computed using TransE~\cite{bordes2013translating}, a method for low dimensional embedding of a triple in a knowledge graph. The novelty of the paper is the application of semantic web to automatic speech recognition."
Towards Estimating the Upper Bound of Visual-Speech Recognition: The Visual Lip-Reading Feasibility Database,"Speech is the most used communication method between humans and it involves the perception of auditory and visual channels. Automatic speech recognition focuses on interpreting the audio signals, although the video can provide information that is complementary to the audio. Exploiting the visual information, however, has proven challenging. On one hand, researchers have reported that the mapping between phonemes and visemes (visual units) is one-to-many because there are phonemes which are visually similar and indistinguishable between them. On the other hand, it is known that some people are very good lip-readers (e.g: deaf people). We study the limit of visual only speech recognition in controlled conditions. With this goal, we designed a new database in which the speakers are aware of being read and aim to facilitate lip-reading. In the literature, there are discrepancies on whether hearing-impaired people are better lip-readers than normal-hearing people. Then, we analyze if there are differences between the lip-reading abilities of 9 hearing-impaired and 15 normal-hearing people. Finally, human abilities are compared with the performance of a visual automatic speech recognition system. In our tests, hearing-impaired participants outperformed the normal-hearing participants but without reaching statistical significance. Human observers were able to decode 44% of the spoken message. In contrast, the visual only automatic system achieved 20% of word recognition rate. However, if we repeat the comparison in terms of phonemes both obtained very similar recognition rates, just above 50%. This suggests that the gap between human lip-reading and automatic speech-reading might be more related to the use of context than to the ability to interpret mouth appearance."
Multitask Learning with Low-Level Auxiliary Tasks for Encoder-Decoder Based Speech Recognition,"End-to-end training of deep learning-based models allows for implicit learning of intermediate representations based on the final task loss. However, the end-to-end approach ignores the useful domain knowledge encoded in explicit intermediate-level supervision. We hypothesize that using intermediate representations as auxiliary supervision at lower levels of deep networks may be a good way of combining the advantages of end-to-end training and more traditional pipeline approaches. We present experiments on conversational speech recognition where we use lower-level tasks, such as phoneme recognition, in a multitask training approach with an encoder-decoder model for direct character transcription. We compare multiple types of lower-level tasks and analyze the effects of the auxiliary tasks. Our results on the Switchboard corpus show that this approach improves recognition accuracy over a standard encoder-decoder model on the Eval2000 test set."
Batch-normalized joint training for DNN-based distant speech recognition,"Improving distant speech recognition is a crucial step towards flexible human-machine interfaces. Current technology, however, still exhibits a lack of robustness, especially when adverse acoustic conditions are met. Despite the significant progress made in the last years on both speech enhancement and speech recognition, one potential limitation of state-of-the-art technology lies in composing modules that are not well matched because they are not trained jointly. To address this concern, a promising approach consists in concatenating a speech enhancement and a speech recognition deep neural network and to jointly update their parameters as if they were within a single bigger network. Unfortunately, joint training can be difficult because the output distribution of the speech enhancement system may change substantially during the optimization procedure. The speech recognition module would have to deal with an input distribution that is non-stationary and unnormalized. To mitigate this issue, we propose a joint training approach based on a fully batch-normalized architecture. Experiments, conducted using different datasets, tasks and acoustic conditions, revealed that the proposed framework significantly overtakes other competitive solutions, especially in challenging environments."
A network of deep neural networks for distant speech recognition,"Despite the remarkable progress recently made in distant speech recognition, state-of-the-art technology still suffers from a lack of robustness, especially when adverse acoustic conditions characterized by non-stationary noises and reverberation are met. A prominent limitation of current systems lies in the lack of matching and communication between the various technologies involved in the distant speech recognition process. The speech enhancement and speech recognition modules are, for instance, often trained independently. Moreover, the speech enhancement normally helps the speech recognizer, but the output of the latter is not commonly used, in turn, to improve the speech enhancement. To address both concerns, we propose a novel architecture based on a network of deep neural networks, where all the components are jointly trained and better cooperate with each other thanks to a full communication scheme between them. Experiments, conducted using different datasets, tasks and acoustic conditions, revealed that the proposed framework can overtake other competitive solutions, including recent joint training approaches."
Direct Acoustics-to-Word Models for English Conversational Speech Recognition,"Recent work on end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) has shown that the connectionist temporal classification (CTC) loss can be used to convert acoustics to phone or character sequences. Such systems are used with a dictionary and separately-trained Language Model (LM) to produce word sequences. However, they are not truly end-to-end in the sense of mapping acoustics directly to words without an intermediate phone representation. In this paper, we present the first results employing direct acoustics-to-word CTC models on two well-known public benchmark tasks: Switchboard and CallHome. These models do not require an LM or even a decoder at run-time and hence recognize speech with minimal complexity. However, due to the large number of word output units, CTC word models require orders of magnitude more data to train reliably compared to traditional systems. We present some techniques to mitigate this issue. Our CTC word model achieves a word error rate of 13.0%/18.8% on the Hub5-2000 Switchboard/CallHome test sets without any LM or decoder compared with 9.6%/16.0% for phone-based CTC with a 4-gram LM. We also present rescoring results on CTC word model lattices to quantify the performance benefits of a LM, and contrast the performance of word and phone CTC models."
Deep LSTM for Large Vocabulary Continuous Speech Recognition,"Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), especially long short-term memory (LSTM) RNNs, are effective network for sequential task like speech recognition. Deeper LSTM models perform well on large vocabulary continuous speech recognition, because of their impressive learning ability. However, it is more difficult to train a deeper network. We introduce a training framework with layer-wise training and exponential moving average methods for deeper LSTM models. It is a competitive framework that LSTM models of more than 7 layers are successfully trained on Shenma voice search data in Mandarin and they outperform the deep LSTM models trained by conventional approach. Moreover, in order for online streaming speech recognition applications, the shallow model with low real time factor is distilled from the very deep model. The recognition accuracy have little loss in the distillation process. Therefore, the model trained with the proposed training framework reduces relative 14\% character error rate, compared to original model which has the similar real-time capability. Furthermore, the novel transfer learning strategy with segmental Minimum Bayes-Risk is also introduced in the framework. The strategy makes it possible that training with only a small part of dataset could outperform full dataset training from the beginning."
Multichannel End-to-end Speech Recognition,"The field of speech recognition is in the midst of a paradigm shift: end-to-end neural networks are challenging the dominance of hidden Markov models as a core technology. Using an attention mechanism in a recurrent encoder-decoder architecture solves the dynamic time alignment problem, allowing joint end-to-end training of the acoustic and language modeling components. In this paper we extend the end-to-end framework to encompass microphone array signal processing for noise suppression and speech enhancement within the acoustic encoding network. This allows the beamforming components to be optimized jointly within the recognition architecture to improve the end-to-end speech recognition objective. Experiments on the noisy speech benchmarks (CHiME-4 and AMI) show that our multichannel end-to-end system outperformed the attention-based baseline with input from a conventional adaptive beamformer."
English Conversational Telephone Speech Recognition by Humans and Machines,"One of the most difficult speech recognition tasks is accurate recognition of human to human communication. Advances in deep learning over the last few years have produced major speech recognition improvements on the representative Switchboard conversational corpus. Word error rates that just a few years ago were 14% have dropped to 8.0%, then 6.6% and most recently 5.8%, and are now believed to be within striking range of human performance. This then raises two issues - what IS human performance, and how far down can we still drive speech recognition error rates? A recent paper by Microsoft suggests that we have already achieved human performance. In trying to verify this statement, we performed an independent set of human performance measurements on two conversational tasks and found that human performance may be considerably better than what was earlier reported, giving the community a significantly harder goal to achieve. We also report on our own efforts in this area, presenting a set of acoustic and language modeling techniques that lowered the word error rate of our own English conversational telephone LVCSR system to the level of 5.5%/10.3% on the Switchboard/CallHome subsets of the Hub5 2000 evaluation, which - at least at the writing of this paper - is a new performance milestone (albeit not at what we measure to be human performance!). On the acoustic side, we use a score fusion of three models: one LSTM with multiple feature inputs, a second LSTM trained with speaker-adversarial multi-task learning and a third residual net (ResNet) with 25 convolutional layers and time-dilated convolutions. On the language modeling side, we use word and character LSTMs and convolutional WaveNet-style language models."
Exponential Moving Average Model in Parallel Speech Recognition Training,"As training data rapid growth, large-scale parallel training with multi-GPUs cluster is widely applied in the neural network model learning currently.We present a new approach that applies exponential moving average method in large-scale parallel training of neural network model. It is a non-interference strategy that the exponential moving average model is not broadcasted to distributed workers to update their local models after model synchronization in the training process, and it is implemented as the final model of the training system. Fully-connected feed-forward neural networks (DNNs) and deep unidirectional Long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are successfully trained with proposed method for large vocabulary continuous speech recognition on Shenma voice search data in Mandarin. The character error rate (CER) of Mandarin speech recognition further degrades than state-of-the-art approaches of parallel training."
Residual Convolutional CTC Networks for Automatic Speech Recognition,"Deep learning approaches have been widely used in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and they have achieved a significant accuracy improvement. Especially, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been revisited in ASR recently. However, most CNNs used in existing work have less than 10 layers which may not be deep enough to capture all human speech signal information. In this paper, we propose a novel deep and wide CNN architecture denoted as RCNN-CTC, which has residual connections and Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss function. RCNN-CTC is an end-to-end system which can exploit temporal and spectral structures of speech signals simultaneously. Furthermore, we introduce a CTC-based system combination, which is different from the conventional frame-wise senone-based one. The basic subsystems adopted in the combination are different types and thus mutually complementary to each other. Experimental results show that our proposed single system RCNN-CTC can achieve the lowest word error rate (WER) on WSJ and Tencent Chat data sets, compared to several widely used neural network systems in ASR. In addition, the proposed system combination can offer a further error reduction on these two data sets, resulting in relative WER reductions of 14.91\% and 6.52\% on WSJ dev93 and Tencent Chat data sets respectively."
Multitask Learning with CTC and Segmental CRF for Speech Recognition,"Segmental conditional random fields (SCRFs) and connectionist temporal classification (CTC) are two sequence labeling methods used for end-to-end training of speech recognition models. Both models define a transcription probability by marginalizing decisions about latent segmentation alternatives to derive a sequence probability: the former uses a globally normalized joint model of segment labels and durations, and the latter classifies each frame as either an output symbol or a ""continuation"" of the previous label. In this paper, we train a recognition model by optimizing an interpolation between the SCRF and CTC losses, where the same recurrent neural network (RNN) encoder is used for feature extraction for both outputs. We find that this multitask objective improves recognition accuracy when decoding with either the SCRF or CTC models. Additionally, we show that CTC can also be used to pretrain the RNN encoder, which improves the convergence rate when learning the joint model."
On the Relevance of Auditory-Based Gabor Features for Deep Learning in Automatic Speech Recognition,"Previous studies support the idea of merging auditory-based Gabor features with deep learning architectures to achieve robust automatic speech recognition, however, the cause behind the gain of such combination is still unknown. We believe these representations provide the deep learning decoder with more discriminable cues. Our aim with this paper is to validate this hypothesis by performing experiments with three different recognition tasks (Aurora 4, CHiME 2 and CHiME 3) and assess the discriminability of the information encoded by Gabor filterbank features. Additionally, to identify the contribution of low, medium and high temporal modulation frequencies subsets of the Gabor filterbank were used as features (dubbed LTM, MTM and HTM respectively). With temporal modulation frequencies between 16 and 25 Hz, HTM consistently outperformed the remaining ones in every condition, highlighting the robustness of these representations against channel distortions, low signal-to-noise ratios and acoustically challenging real-life scenarios with relative improvements from 11 to 56% against a Mel-filterbank-DNN baseline. To explain the results, a measure of similarity between phoneme classes from DNN activations is proposed and linked to their acoustic properties. We find this measure to be consistent with the observed error rates and highlight specific differences on phoneme level to pinpoint the benefit of the proposed features."
Towards speech-to-text translation without speech recognition,"We explore the problem of translating speech to text in low-resource scenarios where neither automatic speech recognition (ASR) nor machine translation (MT) are available, but we have training data in the form of audio paired with text translations. We present the first system for this problem applied to a realistic multi-speaker dataset, the CALLHOME Spanish-English speech translation corpus. Our approach uses unsupervised term discovery (UTD) to cluster repeated patterns in the audio, creating a pseudotext, which we pair with translations to create a parallel text and train a simple bag-of-words MT model. We identify the challenges faced by the system, finding that the difficulty of cross-speaker UTD results in low recall, but that our system is still able to correctly translate some content words in test data."
Emotion Recognition From Speech With Recurrent Neural Networks,"In this paper the task of emotion recognition from speech is considered. Proposed approach uses deep recurrent neural network trained on a sequence of acoustic features calculated over small speech intervals. At the same time special probabilistic-nature CTC loss function allows to consider long utterances containing both emotional and neutral parts. The effectiveness of such an approach is shown in two ways. Firstly, the comparison with recent advances in this field is carried out. Secondly, human performance on the same task is measured. Both criteria show the high quality of the proposed method."
End-To-End Visual Speech Recognition With LSTMs,"Traditional visual speech recognition systems consist of two stages, feature extraction and classification. Recently, several deep learning approaches have been presented which automatically extract features from the mouth images and aim to replace the feature extraction stage. However, research on joint learning of features and classification is very limited. In this work, we present an end-to-end visual speech recognition system based on Long-Short Memory (LSTM) networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model which simultaneously learns to extract features directly from the pixels and perform classification and also achieves state-of-the-art performance in visual speech classification. The model consists of two streams which extract features directly from the mouth and difference images, respectively. The temporal dynamics in each stream are modelled by an LSTM and the fusion of the two streams takes place via a Bidirectional LSTM (BLSTM). An absolute improvement of 9.7% over the base line is reported on the OuluVS2 database, and 1.5% on the CUAVE database when compared with other methods which use a similar visual front-end."
Auxiliary Multimodal LSTM for Audio-visual Speech Recognition and Lipreading,"The Aduio-visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) which employs both the video and audio information to do Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is one of the application of multimodal leaning making ASR system more robust and accuracy. The traditional models usually treated AVSR as inference or projection but strict prior limits its ability. As the revival of deep learning, Deep Neural Networks (DNN) becomes an important toolkit in many traditional classification tasks including ASR, image classification, natural language processing. Some DNN models were used in AVSR like Multimodal Deep Autoencoders (MDAEs), Multimodal Deep Belief Network (MDBN) and Multimodal Deep Boltzmann Machine (MDBM) that actually work better than traditional methods. However, such DNN models have several shortcomings: (1) They don't balance the modal fusion and temporal fusion, or even haven't temporal fusion; (2)The architecture of these models isn't end-to-end, the training and testing getting cumbersome. We propose a DNN model, Auxiliary Multimodal LSTM (am-LSTM), to overcome such weakness. The am-LSTM could be trained and tested once, moreover easy to train and preventing overfitting automatically. The extensibility and flexibility are also take into consideration. The experiments show that am-LSTM is much better than traditional methods and other DNN models in three datasets."
Kernel Approximation Methods for Speech Recognition,"We study large-scale kernel methods for acoustic modeling in speech recognition and compare their performance to deep neural networks (DNNs). We perform experiments on four speech recognition datasets, including the TIMIT and Broadcast News benchmark tasks, and compare these two types of models on frame-level performance metrics (accuracy, cross-entropy), as well as on recognition metrics (word/character error rate). In order to scale kernel methods to these large datasets, we use the random Fourier feature method of Rahimi and Recht (2007). We propose two novel techniques for improving the performance of kernel acoustic models. First, in order to reduce the number of random features required by kernel models, we propose a simple but effective method for feature selection. The method is able to explore a large number of non-linear features while maintaining a compact model more efficiently than existing approaches. Second, we present a number of frame-level metrics which correlate very strongly with recognition performance when computed on the heldout set; we take advantage of these correlations by monitoring these metrics during training in order to decide when to stop learning. This technique can noticeably improve the recognition performance of both DNN and kernel models, while narrowing the gap between them. Additionally, we show that the linear bottleneck method of Sainath et al. (2013) improves the performance of our kernel models significantly, in addition to speeding up training and making the models more compact. Together, these three methods dramatically improve the performance of kernel acoustic models, making their performance comparable to DNNs on the tasks we explored."
Residual LSTM: Design of a Deep Recurrent Architecture for Distant Speech Recognition,"In this paper, a novel architecture for a deep recurrent neural network, residual LSTM is introduced. A plain LSTM has an internal memory cell that can learn long term dependencies of sequential data. It also provides a temporal shortcut path to avoid vanishing or exploding gradients in the temporal domain. The residual LSTM provides an additional spatial shortcut path from lower layers for efficient training of deep networks with multiple LSTM layers. Compared with the previous work, highway LSTM, residual LSTM separates a spatial shortcut path with temporal one by using output layers, which can help to avoid a conflict between spatial and temporal-domain gradient flows. Furthermore, residual LSTM reuses the output projection matrix and the output gate of LSTM to control the spatial information flow instead of additional gate networks, which effectively reduces more than 10% of network parameters. An experiment for distant speech recognition on the AMI SDM corpus shows that 10-layer plain and highway LSTM networks presented 13.7% and 6.2% increase in WER over 3-layer aselines, respectively. On the contrary, 10-layer residual LSTM networks provided the lowest WER 41.0%, which corresponds to 3.3% and 2.8% WER reduction over plain and highway LSTM networks, respectively."
Towards End-to-End Speech Recognition with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks,"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are effective models for reducing spectral variations and modeling spectral correlations in acoustic features for automatic speech recognition (ASR). Hybrid speech recognition systems incorporating CNNs with Hidden Markov Models/Gaussian Mixture Models (HMMs/GMMs) have achieved the state-of-the-art in various benchmarks. Meanwhile, Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which is proposed for labeling unsegmented sequences, makes it feasible to train an end-to-end speech recognition system instead of hybrid settings. However, RNNs are computationally expensive and sometimes difficult to train. In this paper, inspired by the advantages of both CNNs and the CTC approach, we propose an end-to-end speech framework for sequence labeling, by combining hierarchical CNNs with CTC directly without recurrent connections. By evaluating the approach on the TIMIT phoneme recognition task, we show that the proposed model is not only computationally efficient, but also competitive with the existing baseline systems. Moreover, we argue that CNNs have the capability to model temporal correlations with appropriate context information."
Multi-task Learning Of Deep Neural Networks For Audio Visual Automatic Speech Recognition,"Multi-task learning (MTL) involves the simultaneous training of two or more related tasks over shared representations. In this work, we apply MTL to audio-visual automatic speech recognition(AV-ASR). Our primary task is to learn a mapping between audio-visual fused features and frame labels obtained from acoustic GMM/HMM model. This is combined with an auxiliary task which maps visual features to frame labels obtained from a separate visual GMM/HMM model. The MTL model is tested at various levels of babble noise and the results are compared with a base-line hybrid DNN-HMM AV-ASR model. Our results indicate that MTL is especially useful at higher level of noise. Compared to base-line, upto 7\% relative improvement in WER is reported at -3 SNR dB"
Recurrent Deep Stacking Networks for Speech Recognition,"This paper presented our work on applying Recurrent Deep Stacking Networks (RDSNs) to Robust Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) tasks. In the paper, we also proposed a more efficient yet comparable substitute to RDSN, Bi- Pass Stacking Network (BPSN). The main idea of these two models is to add phoneme-level information into acoustic models, transforming an acoustic model to the combination of an acoustic model and a phoneme-level N-gram model. Experiments showed that RDSN and BPsn can substantially improve the performances over conventional DNNs."
Evaluating Automatic Speech Recognition Systems in Comparison With Human Perception Results Using Distinctive Feature Measures,"This paper describes methods for evaluating automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems in comparison with human perception results, using measures derived from linguistic distinctive features. Error patterns in terms of manner, place and voicing are presented, along with an examination of confusion matrices via a distinctive-feature-distance metric. These evaluation methods contrast with conventional performance criteria that focus on the phone or word level, and are intended to provide a more detailed profile of ASR system performance,as well as a means for direct comparison with human perception results at the sub-phonemic level."
Active Learning for Speech Recognition: the Power of Gradients,"In training speech recognition systems, labeling audio clips can be expensive, and not all data is equally valuable. Active learning aims to label only the most informative samples to reduce cost. For speech recognition, confidence scores and other likelihood-based active learning methods have been shown to be effective. Gradient-based active learning methods, however, are still not well-understood. This work investigates the Expected Gradient Length (EGL) approach in active learning for end-to-end speech recognition. We justify EGL from a variance reduction perspective, and observe that EGL's measure of informativeness picks novel samples uncorrelated with confidence scores. Experimentally, we show that EGL can reduce word errors by 11\%, or alternatively, reduce the number of samples to label by 50\%, when compared to random sampling."
Invariant Representations for Noisy Speech Recognition,"Modern automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems need to be robust under acoustic variability arising from environmental, speaker, channel, and recording conditions. Ensuring such robustness to variability is a challenge in modern day neural network-based ASR systems, especially when all types of variability are not seen during training. We attempt to address this problem by encouraging the neural network acoustic model to learn invariant feature representations. We use ideas from recent research on image generation using Generative Adversarial Networks and domain adaptation ideas extending adversarial gradient-based training. A recent work from Ganin et al. proposes to use adversarial training for image domain adaptation by using an intermediate representation from the main target classification network to deteriorate the domain classifier performance through a separate neural network. Our work focuses on investigating neural architectures which produce representations invariant to noise conditions for ASR. We evaluate the proposed architecture on the Aurora-4 task, a popular benchmark for noise robust ASR. We show that our method generalizes better than the standard multi-condition training especially when only a few noise categories are seen during training."
ESE: Efficient Speech Recognition Engine with Sparse LSTM on FPGA,"Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is widely used in speech recognition. In order to achieve higher prediction accuracy, machine learning scientists have built larger and larger models. Such large model is both computation intensive and memory intensive. Deploying such bulky model results in high power consumption and leads to high total cost of ownership (TCO) of a data center. In order to speedup the prediction and make it energy efficient, we first propose a load-balance-aware pruning method that can compress the LSTM model size by 20x (10x from pruning and 2x from quantization) with negligible loss of the prediction accuracy. The pruned model is friendly for parallel processing. Next, we propose scheduler that encodes and partitions the compressed model to each PE for parallelism, and schedule the complicated LSTM data flow. Finally, we design the hardware architecture, named Efficient Speech Recognition Engine (ESE) that works directly on the compressed model. Implemented on Xilinx XCKU060 FPGA running at 200MHz, ESE has a performance of 282 GOPS working directly on the compressed LSTM network, corresponding to 2.52 TOPS on the uncompressed one, and processes a full LSTM for speech recognition with a power dissipation of 41 Watts. Evaluated on the LSTM for speech recognition benchmark, ESE is 43x and 3x faster than Core i7 5930k CPU and Pascal Titan X GPU implementations. It achieves 40x and 11.5x higher energy efficiency compared with the CPU and GPU respectively."
Dense Prediction on Sequences with Time-Dilated Convolutions for Speech Recognition,"In computer vision pixelwise dense prediction is the task of predicting a label for each pixel in the image. Convolutional neural networks achieve good performance on this task, while being computationally efficient. In this paper we carry these ideas over to the problem of assigning a sequence of labels to a set of speech frames, a task commonly known as framewise classification. We show that dense prediction view of framewise classification offers several advantages and insights, including computational efficiency and the ability to apply batch normalization. When doing dense prediction we pay specific attention to strided pooling in time and introduce an asymmetric dilated convolution, called time-dilated convolution, that allows for efficient and elegant implementation of pooling in time. We show results using time-dilated convolutions in a very deep VGG-style CNN with batch normalization on the Hub5 Switchboard-2000 benchmark task. With a big n-gram language model, we achieve 7.7% WER which is the best single model single-pass performance reported so far."
Deep Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network: Improving Performance For Speech Recognition,"A deep learning approach has been widely applied in sequence modeling problems. In terms of automatic speech recognition (ASR), its performance has significantly been improved by increasing large speech corpus and deeper neural network. Especially, recurrent neural network and deep convolutional neural network have been applied in ASR successfully. Given the arising problem of training speed, we build a novel deep recurrent convolutional network for acoustic modeling and then apply deep residual learning to it. Our experiments show that it has not only faster convergence speed but better recognition accuracy over traditional deep convolutional recurrent network. In the experiments, we compare the convergence speed of our novel deep recurrent convolutional networks and traditional deep convolutional recurrent networks. With faster convergence speed, our novel deep recurrent convolutional networks can reach the comparable performance. We further show that applying deep residual learning can boost the convergence speed of our novel deep recurret convolutional networks. Finally, we evaluate all our experimental networks by phoneme error rate (PER) with our proposed bidirectional statistical n-gram language model. Our evaluation results show that our newly proposed deep recurrent convolutional network applied with deep residual learning can reach the best PER of 17.33\% with the fastest convergence speed on TIMIT database. The outstanding performance of our novel deep recurrent convolutional neural network with deep residual learning indicates that it can be potentially adopted in other sequential problems."
Robust end-to-end deep audiovisual speech recognition,"Speech is one of the most effective ways of communication among humans. Even though audio is the most common way of transmitting speech, very important information can be found in other modalities, such as vision. Vision is particularly useful when the acoustic signal is corrupted. Multi-modal speech recognition however has not yet found wide-spread use, mostly because the temporal alignment and fusion of the different information sources is challenging.  This paper presents an end-to-end audiovisual speech recognizer (AVSR), based on recurrent neural networks (RNN) with a connectionist temporal classification (CTC) loss function. CTC creates sparse ""peaky"" output activations, and we analyze the differences in the alignments of output targets (phonemes or visemes) between audio-only, video-only, and audio-visual feature representations. We present the first such experiments on the large vocabulary IBM ViaVoice database, which outperform previously published approaches on phone accuracy in clean and noisy conditions."
Study on Feature Subspace of Archetypal Emotions for Speech Emotion Recognition,"Feature subspace selection is an important part in speech emotion recognition. Most of the studies are devoted to finding a feature subspace for representing all emotions. However, some studies have indicated that the features associated with different emotions are not exactly the same. Hence, traditional methods may fail to distinguish some of the emotions with just one global feature subspace. In this work, we propose a new divide and conquer idea to solve the problem. First, the feature subspaces are constructed for all the combinations of every two different emotions (emotion-pair). Bi-classifiers are then trained on these feature subspaces respectively. The final emotion recognition result is derived by the voting and competition method. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can get better results than the traditional multi-classification method."
Audio Visual Speech Recognition using Deep Recurrent Neural Networks,"In this work, we propose a training algorithm for an audio-visual automatic speech recognition (AV-ASR) system using deep recurrent neural network (RNN).First, we train a deep RNN acoustic model with a Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) objective function. The frame labels obtained from the acoustic model are then used to perform a non-linear dimensionality reduction of the visual features using a deep bottleneck network. Audio and visual features are fused and used to train a fusion RNN. The use of bottleneck features for visual modality helps the model to converge properly during training. Our system is evaluated on GRID corpus. Our results show that presence of visual modality gives significant improvement in character error rate (CER) at various levels of noise even when the model is trained without noisy data. We also provide a comparison of two fusion methods: feature fusion and decision fusion."
Automatic recognition of child speech for robotic applications in noisy environments,"Automatic speech recognition (ASR) allows a natural and intuitive interface for robotic educational applications for children. However there are a number of challenges to overcome to allow such an interface to operate robustly in realistic settings, including the intrinsic difficulties of recognising child speech and high levels of background noise often present in classrooms. As part of the EU EASEL project we have provided several contributions to address these challenges, implementing our own ASR module for use in robotics applications. We used the latest deep neural network algorithms which provide a leap in performance over the traditional GMM approach, and apply data augmentation methods to improve robustness to noise and speaker variation. We provide a close integration between the ASR module and the rest of the dialogue system, allowing the ASR to receive in real-time the language models relevant to the current section of the dialogue, greatly improving the accuracy. We integrated our ASR module into an interactive, multimodal system using a small humanoid robot to help children learn about exercise and energy. The system was installed at a public museum event as part of a research study where 320 children (aged 3 to 14) interacted with the robot, with our ASR achieving 90% accuracy for fluent and near-fluent speech."
Neural Speech Recognizer: Acoustic-to-Word LSTM Model for Large Vocabulary Speech Recognition,"We present results that show it is possible to build a competitive, greatly simplified, large vocabulary continuous speech recognition system with whole words as acoustic units. We model the output vocabulary of about 100,000 words directly using deep bi-directional LSTM RNNs with CTC loss. The model is trained on 125,000 hours of semi-supervised acoustic training data, which enables us to alleviate the data sparsity problem for word models. We show that the CTC word models work very well as an end-to-end all-neural speech recognition model without the use of traditional context-dependent sub-word phone units that require a pronunciation lexicon, and without any language model removing the need to decode. We demonstrate that the CTC word models perform better than a strong, more complex, state-of-the-art baseline with sub-word units."
Small-footprint Highway Deep Neural Networks for Speech Recognition,"State-of-the-art speech recognition systems typically employ neural network acoustic models. However, compared to Gaussian mixture models, deep neural network (DNN) based acoustic models often have many more model parameters, making it challenging for them to be deployed on resource-constrained platforms, such as mobile devices. In this paper, we study the application of the recently proposed highway deep neural network (HDNN) for training small-footprint acoustic models. HDNNs are a depth-gated feedforward neural network, which include two types of gate functions to facilitate the information flow through different layers. Our study demonstrates that HDNNs are more compact than regular DNNs for acoustic modeling, i.e., they can achieve comparable recognition accuracy with many fewer model parameters. Furthermore, HDNNs are more controllable than DNNs: the gate functions of an HDNN can control the behavior of the whole network using a very small number of model parameters. Finally, we show that HDNNs are more adaptable than DNNs. For example, simply updating the gate functions using adaptation data can result in considerable gains in accuracy. We demonstrate these aspects by experiments using the publicly available AMI corpus, which has around 80 hours of training data."
End-to-end attention-based distant speech recognition with Highway LSTM,"End-to-end attention-based models have been shown to be competitive alternatives to conventional DNN-HMM models in the Speech Recognition Systems. In this paper, we extend existing end-to-end attention-based models that can be applied for Distant Speech Recognition (DSR) task. Specifically, we propose an end-to-end attention-based speech recognizer with multichannel input that performs sequence prediction directly at the character level. To gain a better performance, we also incorporate Highway long short-term memory (HLSTM) which outperforms previous models on AMI distant speech recognition task."
Achieving Human Parity in Conversational Speech Recognition,"Conversational speech recognition has served as a flagship speech recognition task since the release of the Switchboard corpus in the 1990s. In this paper, we measure the human error rate on the widely used NIST 2000 test set, and find that our latest automated system has reached human parity. The error rate of professional transcribers is 5.9% for the Switchboard portion of the data, in which newly acquainted pairs of people discuss an assigned topic, and 11.3% for the CallHome portion where friends and family members have open-ended conversations. In both cases, our automated system establishes a new state of the art, and edges past the human benchmark, achieving error rates of 5.8% and 11.0%, respectively. The key to our system's performance is the use of various convolutional and LSTM acoustic model architectures, combined with a novel spatial smoothing method and lattice-free MMI acoustic training, multiple recurrent neural network language modeling approaches, and a systematic use of system combination."
Long Short-Term Memory based Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks for Large Vocabulary Speech Recognition,"Long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been shown to give state-of-the-art performance on many speech recognition tasks, as they are able to provide the learned dynamically changing contextual window of all sequence history. On the other hand, the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have brought significant improvements to deep feed-forward neural networks (FFNNs), as they are able to better reduce spectral variation in the input signal. In this paper, a network architecture called as convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) is proposed by combining the CNN and LSTM RNN. In the proposed CRNNs, each speech frame, without adjacent context frames, is organized as a number of local feature patches along the frequency axis, and then a LSTM network is performed on each feature patch along the time axis. We train and compare FFNNs, LSTM RNNs and the proposed LSTM CRNNs at various number of configurations. Experimental results show that the LSTM CRNNs can exceed state-of-the-art speech recognition performance."
Very Deep Convolutional Networks for End-to-End Speech Recognition,"Sequence-to-sequence models have shown success in end-to-end speech recognition. However these models have only used shallow acoustic encoder networks. In our work, we successively train very deep convolutional networks to add more expressive power and better generalization for end-to-end ASR models. We apply network-in-network principles, batch normalization, residual connections and convolutional LSTMs to build very deep recurrent and convolutional structures. Our models exploit the spectral structure in the feature space and add computational depth without overfitting issues. We experiment with the WSJ ASR task and achieve 10.5\% word error rate without any dictionary or language using a 15 layer deep network."
Monaural Multi-Talker Speech Recognition using Factorial Speech Processing Models,"A Pascal challenge entitled monaural multi-talker speech recognition was developed, targeting the problem of robust automatic speech recognition against speech like noises which significantly degrades the performance of automatic speech recognition systems. In this challenge, two competing speakers say a simple command simultaneously and the objective is to recognize speech of the target speaker. Surprisingly during the challenge, a team from IBM research, could achieve a performance better than human listeners on this task. The proposed method of the IBM team, consist of an intermediate speech separation and then a single-talker speech recognition. This paper reconsiders the task of this challenge based on gain adapted factorial speech processing models. It develops a joint-token passing algorithm for direct utterance decoding of both target and masker speakers, simultaneously. Comparing it to the challenge winner, it uses maximum uncertainty during the decoding which cannot be used in the past two-phased method. It provides detailed derivation of inference on these models based on general inference procedures of probabilistic graphical models. As another improvement, it uses deep neural networks for joint-speaker identification and gain estimation which makes these two steps easier than before producing competitive results for these steps. The proposed method of this work outperforms past super-human results and even the results were achieved recently by Microsoft research, using deep neural networks. It achieved 5.5% absolute task performance improvement compared to the first super-human system and 2.7% absolute task performance improvement compared to its recent competitor."
FPGA-Based Low-Power Speech Recognition with Recurrent Neural Networks,"In this paper, a neural network based real-time speech recognition (SR) system is developed using an FPGA for very low-power operation. The implemented system employs two recurrent neural networks (RNNs); one is a speech-to-character RNN for acoustic modeling (AM) and the other is for character-level language modeling (LM). The system also employs a statistical word-level LM to improve the recognition accuracy. The results of the AM, the character-level LM, and the word-level LM are combined using a fairly simple N-best search algorithm instead of the hidden Markov model (HMM) based network. The RNNs are implemented using massively parallel processing elements (PEs) for low latency and high throughput. The weights are quantized to 6 bits to store all of them in the on-chip memory of an FPGA. The proposed algorithm is implemented on a Xilinx XC7Z045, and the system can operate much faster than real-time."
Very Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Robust Speech Recognition,"This paper describes the extension and optimization of our previous work on very deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for effective recognition of noisy speech in the Aurora 4 task. The appropriate number of convolutional layers, the sizes of the filters, pooling operations and input feature maps are all modified: the filter and pooling sizes are reduced and dimensions of input feature maps are extended to allow adding more convolutional layers. Furthermore appropriate input padding and input feature map selection strategies are developed. In addition, an adaptation framework using joint training of very deep CNN with auxiliary features i-vector and fMLLR features is developed. These modifications give substantial word error rate reductions over the standard CNN used as baseline. Finally the very deep CNN is combined with an LSTM-RNN acoustic model and it is shown that state-level weighted log likelihood score combination in a joint acoustic model decoding scheme is very effective. On the Aurora 4 task, the very deep CNN achieves a WER of 8.81%, further 7.99% with auxiliary feature joint training, and 7.09% with LSTM-RNN joint decoding."
Memory Visualization for Gated Recurrent Neural Networks in Speech Recognition,"Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have shown clear superiority in sequence modeling, particularly the ones with gated units, such as long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU). However, the dynamic properties behind the remarkable performance remain unclear in many applications, e.g., automatic speech recognition (ASR). This paper employs visualization techniques to study the behavior of LSTM and GRU when performing speech recognition tasks. Our experiments show some interesting patterns in the gated memory, and some of them have inspired simple yet effective modifications on the network structure. We report two of such modifications: (1) lazy cell update in LSTM, and (2) shortcut connections for residual learning. Both modifications lead to more comprehensible and powerful networks."
OC16-CE80: A Chinese-English Mixlingual Database and A Speech Recognition Baseline,"We present the OC16-CE80 Chinese-English mixlingual speech database which was released as a main resource for training, development and test for the Chinese-English mixlingual speech recognition (MixASR-CHEN) challenge on O-COCOSDA 2016. This database consists of 80 hours of speech signals recorded from more than 1,400 speakers, where the utterances are in Chinese but each involves one or several English words. Based on the database and another two free data resources (THCHS30 and the CMU dictionary), a speech recognition (ASR) baseline was constructed with the deep neural network-hidden Markov model (DNN-HMM) hybrid system. We then report the baseline results following the MixASR-CHEN evaluation rules and demonstrate that OC16-CE80 is a reasonable data resource for mixlingual research."
Multi-task Recurrent Model for True Multilingual Speech Recognition,"Research on multilingual speech recognition remains attractive yet challenging. Recent studies focus on learning shared structures under the multi-task paradigm, in particular a feature sharing structure. This approach has been found effective to improve performance on each individual language. However, this approach is only useful when the deployed system supports just one language. In a true multilingual scenario where multiple languages are allowed, performance will be significantly reduced due to the competition among languages in the decoding space. This paper presents a multi-task recurrent model that involves a multilingual speech recognition (ASR) component and a language recognition (LR) component, and the ASR component is informed of the language information by the LR component, leading to a language-aware recognition. We tested the approach on an English-Chinese bilingual recognition task. The results show that the proposed multi-task recurrent model can improve performance of multilingual recognition systems."
Speaker Recognition for Children's Speech,"This paper presents results on Speaker Recognition (SR) for children's speech, using the OGI Kids corpus and GMM-UBM and GMM-SVM SR systems. Regions of the spectrum containing important speaker information for children are identified by conducting SR experiments over 21 frequency bands. As for adults, the spectrum can be split into four regions, with the first (containing primary vocal tract resonance information) and third (corresponding to high frequency speech sounds) being most useful for SR. However, the frequencies at which these regions occur are from 11% to 38% higher for children. It is also noted that subband SR rates are lower for younger children. Finally results are presented of SR experiments to identify a child in a class (30 children, similar age) and school (288 children, varying ages). Class performance depends on age, with accuracy varying from 90% for young children to 99% for older children. The identification rate achieved for a child in a school is 81%."
Joint CTC-Attention based End-to-End Speech Recognition using Multi-task Learning,"Recently, there has been an increasing interest in end-to-end speech recognition that directly transcribes speech to text without any predefined alignments. One approach is the attention-based encoder-decoder framework that learns a mapping between variable-length input and output sequences in one step using a purely data-driven method. The attention model has often been shown to improve the performance over another end-to-end approach, the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC), mainly because it explicitly uses the history of the target character without any conditional independence assumptions. However, we observed that the performance of the attention has shown poor results in noisy condition and is hard to learn in the initial training stage with long input sequences. This is because the attention model is too flexible to predict proper alignments in such cases due to the lack of left-to-right constraints as used in CTC. This paper presents a novel method for end-to-end speech recognition to improve robustness and achieve fast convergence by using a joint CTC-attention model within the multi-task learning framework, thereby mitigating the alignment issue. An experiment on the WSJ and CHiME-4 tasks demonstrates its advantages over both the CTC and attention-based encoder-decoder baselines, showing 5.4-14.6% relative improvements in Character Error Rate (CER)."
Advances in All-Neural Speech Recognition,"This paper advances the design of CTC-based all-neural (or end-to-end) speech recognizers. We propose a novel symbol inventory, and a novel iterated-CTC method in which a second system is used to transform a noisy initial output into a cleaner version. We present a number of stabilization and initialization methods we have found useful in training these networks. We evaluate our system on the commonly used NIST 2000 conversational telephony test set, and significantly exceed the previously published performance of similar systems, both with and without the use of an external language model and decoding technology."
An Adaptive Psychoacoustic Model for Automatic Speech Recognition,"Compared with automatic speech recognition (ASR), the human auditory system is more adept at handling noise-adverse situations, including environmental noise and channel distortion. To mimic this adeptness, auditory models have been widely incorporated in ASR systems to improve their robustness. This paper proposes a novel auditory model which incorporates psychoacoustics and otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) into ASR. In particular, we successfully implement the frequency-dependent property of psychoacoustic models and effectively improve resulting system performance. We also present a novel double-transform spectrum-analysis technique, which can qualitatively predict ASR performance for different noise types. Detailed theoretical analysis is provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Experiments are carried out on the AURORA2 database and show that the word recognition rate using our proposed feature extraction method is significantly increased over the baseline. Given models trained with clean speech, our proposed method achieves up to 85.39% word recognition accuracy on noisy data."
The Microsoft 2016 Conversational Speech Recognition System,"We describe Microsoft's conversational speech recognition system, in which we combine recent developments in neural-network-based acoustic and language modeling to advance the state of the art on the Switchboard recognition task. Inspired by machine learning ensemble techniques, the system uses a range of convolutional and recurrent neural networks. I-vector modeling and lattice-free MMI training provide significant gains for all acoustic model architectures. Language model rescoring with multiple forward and backward running RNNLMs, and word posterior-based system combination provide a 20% boost. The best single system uses a ResNet architecture acoustic model with RNNLM rescoring, and achieves a word error rate of 6.9% on the NIST 2000 Switchboard task. The combined system has an error rate of 6.2%, representing an improvement over previously reported results on this benchmark task."
Wav2Letter: an End-to-End ConvNet-based Speech Recognition System,"This paper presents a simple end-to-end model for speech recognition, combining a convolutional network based acoustic model and a graph decoding. It is trained to output letters, with transcribed speech, without the need for force alignment of phonemes. We introduce an automatic segmentation criterion for training from sequence annotation without alignment that is on par with CTC while being simpler. We show competitive results in word error rate on the Librispeech corpus with MFCC features, and promising results from raw waveform."
A three-dimensional approach to Visual Speech Recognition using Discrete Cosine Transforms,"Visual speech recognition aims to identify the sequence of phonemes from continuous speech. Unlike the traditional approach of using 2D image feature extraction methods to derive features of each video frame separately, this paper proposes a new approach using a 3D (spatio-temporal) Discrete Cosine Transform to extract features of each feasible sub-sequence of an input video which are subsequently classified individually using Support Vector Machines and combined to find the most likely phoneme sequence using a tailor-made Hidden Markov Model. The algorithm is trained and tested on the VidTimit database to recognise sequences of phonemes as well as visemes (visual speech units). Furthermore, the system is extended with the training on phoneme or viseme pairs (biphones) to counteract the human speech ambiguity of co-articulation. The test set accuracy for the recognition of phoneme sequences is 20%, and the accuracy of viseme sequences is 39%. Both results improve the best values reported in other papers by approximately 2%. The contribution of the result is three-fold: Firstly, this paper is the first to show that 3D feature extraction methods can be applied to continuous sequence recognition tasks despite the unknown start positions and durations of each phoneme. Secondly, the result confirms that 3D feature extraction methods improve the accuracy compared to 2D features extraction methods. Thirdly, the paper is the first to specifically compare an otherwise identical method with and without using biphones, verifying that the usage of biphones has a positive impact on the result."
Ensemble of Jointly Trained Deep Neural Network-Based Acoustic Models for Reverberant Speech Recognition,"Distant speech recognition is a challenge, particularly due to the corruption of speech signals by reverberation caused by large distances between the speaker and microphone. In order to cope with a wide range of reverberations in real-world situations, we present novel approaches for acoustic modeling including an ensemble of deep neural networks (DNNs) and an ensemble of jointly trained DNNs. First, multiple DNNs are established, each of which corresponds to a different reverberation time 60 (RT60) in a setup step. Also, each model in the ensemble of DNN acoustic models is further jointly trained, including both feature mapping and acoustic modeling, where the feature mapping is designed for the dereverberation as a front-end. In a testing phase, the two most likely DNNs are chosen from the DNN ensemble using maximum a posteriori (MAP) probabilities, computed in an online fashion by using maximum likelihood (ML)-based blind RT60 estimation and then the posterior probability outputs from two DNNs are combined using the ML-based weights as a simple average. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach leads to substantial improvements in speech recognition accuracy over the conventional DNN baseline systems under diverse reverberant conditions."
Incorporation of Speech Duration Information in Score Fusion of Speaker Recognition Systems,"In recent years identity-vector (i-vector) based speaker verification (SV) systems have become very successful. Nevertheless, environmental noise and speech duration variability still have a significant effect on degrading the performance of these systems. In many real-life applications, duration of recordings are very short; as a result, extracted i-vectors cannot reliably represent the attributes of the speaker. Here, we investigate the effect of speech duration on the performance of three state-of-the-art speaker recognition systems. In addition, using a variety of available score fusion methods, we investigate the effect of score fusion for those speaker verification techniques to benefit from the performance difference of different methods under different enrollment and test speech duration conditions. This technique performed significantly better than the baseline score fusion methods."
Efficient Segmental Cascades for Speech Recognition,"Discriminative segmental models offer a way to incorporate flexible feature functions into speech recognition. However, their appeal has been limited by their computational requirements, due to the large number of possible segments to consider. Multi-pass cascades of segmental models introduce features of increasing complexity in different passes, where in each pass a segmental model rescores lattices produced by a previous (simpler) segmental model. In this paper, we explore several ways of making segmental cascades efficient and practical: reducing the feature set in the first pass, frame subsampling, and various pruning approaches. In experiments on phonetic recognition, we find that with a combination of such techniques, it is possible to maintain competitive performance while greatly reducing decoding, pruning, and training time."
NN-grams: Unifying neural network and n-gram language models for Speech Recognition,"We present NN-grams, a novel, hybrid language model integrating n-grams and neural networks (NN) for speech recognition. The model takes as input both word histories as well as n-gram counts. Thus, it combines the memorization capacity and scalability of an n-gram model with the generalization ability of neural networks. We report experiments where the model is trained on 26B words. NN-grams are efficient at run-time since they do not include an output soft-max layer. The model is trained using noise contrastive estimation (NCE), an approach that transforms the estimation problem of neural networks into one of binary classification between data samples and noise samples. We present results with noise samples derived from either an n-gram distribution or from speech recognition lattices. NN-grams outperforms an n-gram model on an Italian speech recognition dictation task."
A segmental framework for fully-unsupervised large-vocabulary speech recognition,"Zero-resource speech technology is a growing research area that aims to develop methods for speech processing in the absence of transcriptions, lexicons, or language modelling text. Early term discovery systems focused on identifying isolated recurring patterns in a corpus, while more recent full-coverage systems attempt to completely segment and cluster the audio into word-like units---effectively performing unsupervised speech recognition. This article presents the first attempt we are aware of to apply such a system to large-vocabulary multi-speaker data. Our system uses a Bayesian modelling framework with segmental word representations: each word segment is represented as a fixed-dimensional acoustic embedding obtained by mapping the sequence of feature frames to a single embedding vector. We compare our system on English and Xitsonga datasets to state-of-the-art baselines, using a variety of measures including word error rate (obtained by mapping the unsupervised output to ground truth transcriptions). Very high word error rates are reported---in the order of 70--80% for speaker-dependent and 80--95% for speaker-independent systems---highlighting the difficulty of this task. Nevertheless, in terms of cluster quality and word segmentation metrics, we show that by imposing a consistent top-down segmentation while also using bottom-up knowledge from detected syllable boundaries, both single-speaker and multi-speaker versions of our system outperform a purely bottom-up single-speaker syllable-based approach. We also show that the discovered clusters can be made less speaker- and gender-specific by using an unsupervised autoencoder-like feature extractor to learn better frame-level features (prior to embedding). Our system's discovered clusters are still less pure than those of unsupervised term discovery systems, but provide far greater coverage."
A Comprehensive Study of Deep Bidirectional LSTM RNNs for Acoustic Modeling in Speech Recognition,"We present a comprehensive study of deep bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) based acoustic models for automatic speech recognition (ASR). We study the effect of size and depth and train models of up to 8 layers. We investigate the training aspect and study different variants of optimization methods, batching, truncated backpropagation, different regularization techniques such as dropout and L_2 regularization, and different gradient clipping variants.  The major part of the experimental analysis was performed on the Quaero corpus. Additional experiments also were performed on the Switchboard corpus. Our best LSTM model has a relative improvement in word error rate of over 14\% compared to our best feed-forward neural network (FFNN) baseline on the Quaero task. On this task, we get our best result with an 8 layer bidirectional LSTM and we show that a pretraining scheme with layer-wise construction helps for deep LSTMs.  Finally we compare the training calculation time of many of the presented experiments in relation with recognition performance.  All the experiments were done with RETURNN, the RWTH extensible training framework for universal recurrent neural networks in combination with RASR, the RWTH ASR toolkit."
A Curriculum Learning Method for Improved Noise Robustness in Automatic Speech Recognition,"The performance of automatic speech recognition systems under noisy environments still leaves room for improvement. Speech enhancement or feature enhancement techniques for increasing noise robustness of these systems usually add components to the recognition system that need careful optimization. In this work, we propose the use of a relatively simple curriculum training strategy called accordion annealing (ACCAN). It uses a multi-stage training schedule where samples at signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values as low as 0dB are first added and samples at increasing higher SNR values are gradually added up to an SNR value of 50dB. We also use a method called per-epoch noise mixing (PEM) that generates noisy training samples online during training and thus enables dynamically changing the SNR of our training data. Both the ACCAN and the PEM methods are evaluated on a end-to-end speech recognition pipeline on the Wall Street Journal corpus. ACCAN decreases the average word error rate (WER) on the 20dB to -10dB SNR range by up to 31.4% when compared to a conventional multi-condition training method."
Graph based manifold regularized deep neural networks for automatic speech recognition,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been successfully applied to a wide variety of acoustic modeling tasks in recent years. These include the applications of DNNs either in a discriminative feature extraction or in a hybrid acoustic modeling scenario. Despite the rapid progress in this area, a number of challenges remain in training DNNs. This paper presents an effective way of training DNNs using a manifold learning based regularization framework. In this framework, the parameters of the network are optimized to preserve underlying manifold based relationships between speech feature vectors while minimizing a measure of loss between network outputs and targets. This is achieved by incorporating manifold based locality constraints in the objective criterion of DNNs. Empirical evidence is provided to demonstrate that training a network with manifold constraints preserves structural compactness in the hidden layers of the network. Manifold regularization is applied to train bottleneck DNNs for feature extraction in hidden Markov model (HMM) based speech recognition. The experiments in this work are conducted on the Aurora-2 spoken digits and the Aurora-4 read news large vocabulary continuous speech recognition tasks. The performance is measured in terms of word error rate (WER) on these tasks. It is shown that the manifold regularized DNNs result in up to 37% reduction in WER relative to standard DNNs."
Calibration of Phone Likelihoods in Automatic Speech Recognition,"In this paper we study the probabilistic properties of the posteriors in a speech recognition system that uses a deep neural network (DNN) for acoustic modeling. We do this by reducing Kaldi's DNN shared pdf-id posteriors to phone likelihoods, and using test set forced alignments to evaluate these using a calibration sensitive metric. Individual frame posteriors are in principle well-calibrated, because the DNN is trained using cross entropy as the objective function, which is a proper scoring rule. When entire phones are assessed, we observe that it is best to average the log likelihoods over the duration of the phone. Further scaling of the average log likelihoods by the logarithm of the duration slightly improves the calibration, and this improvement is retained when tested on independent test data."
On model architecture for a children's speech recognition interactive dialog system,This report presents a general model of the architecture of information systems for the speech recognition of children. It presents a model of the speech data stream and how it works. The result of these studies and presented veins architectural model shows that research needs to be focused on acoustic-phonetic modeling in order to improve the quality of children's speech recognition and the sustainability of the systems to noise and changes in transmission environment. Another important aspect is the development of more accurate algorithms for modeling of spontaneous child speech.
The IBM 2016 English Conversational Telephone Speech Recognition System,"We describe a collection of acoustic and language modeling techniques that lowered the word error rate of our English conversational telephone LVCSR system to a record 6.6% on the Switchboard subset of the Hub5 2000 evaluation testset. On the acoustic side, we use a score fusion of three strong models: recurrent nets with maxout activations, very deep convolutional nets with 3x3 kernels, and bidirectional long short-term memory nets which operate on FMLLR and i-vector features. On the language modeling side, we use an updated model ""M"" and hierarchical neural network LMs."
Robust coherence-based spectral enhancement for speech recognition in adverse real-world environments,"Speech recognition in adverse real-world environments is highly affected by reverberation and nonstationary background noise. A well-known strategy to reduce such undesired signal components in multi-microphone scenarios is spatial filtering of the microphone signals. In this article, we demonstrate that an additional coherence-based postfilter, which is applied to the beamformer output signal to remove diffuse interference components from the latter, is an effective means to further improve the recognition accuracy of modern deep learning speech recognition systems. To this end, the recently updated 3rd CHiME Speech Separation and Recognition Challenge (CHiME-3) baseline speech recognition system is extended by a coherence-based postfilter and the postfilter's impact on the word error rates is investigated for the noisy environments provided by CHiME-3. To determine the time- and frequency-dependent postfilter gains, we use a Direction-of-Arrival (DOA)-dependent and a DOA-independent estimator of the coherent-to-diffuse power ratio as an approximation of the short-time signal-to-noise ratio. Our experiments show that incorporating coherence-based postfiltering into the CHiME-3 baseline speech recognition system leads to a significant reduction of the word error rate scores for the noisy and reverberant environments provided as part of CHiME-3."
Noise Robust Speech Recognition Using Multi-Channel Based Channel Selection And ChannelWeighting,"In this paper, we study several microphone channel selection and weighting methods for robust automatic speech recognition (ASR) in noisy conditions. For channel selection, we investigate two methods based on the maximum likelihood (ML) criterion and minimum autoencoder reconstruction criterion, respectively. For channel weighting, we produce enhanced log Mel filterbank coefficients as a weighted sum of the coefficients of all channels. The weights of the channels are estimated by using the ML criterion with constraints. We evaluate the proposed methods on the CHiME-3 noisy ASR task. Experiments show that channel weighting significantly outperforms channel selection due to its higher flexibility. Furthermore, on real test data in which different channels have different gains of the target signal, the channel weighting method performs equally well or better than the MVDR beamforming, despite the fact that the channel weighting does not make use of the phase delay information which is normally used in beamforming."
Multi-task Recurrent Model for Speech and Speaker Recognition,"Although highly correlated, speech and speaker recognition have been regarded as two independent tasks and studied by two communities. This is certainly not the way that people behave: we decipher both speech content and speaker traits at the same time. This paper presents a unified model to perform speech and speaker recognition simultaneously and altogether. The model is based on a unified neural network where the output of one task is fed to the input of the other, leading to a multi-task recurrent network. Experiments show that the joint model outperforms the task-specific models on both the two tasks."
Model Interpolation with Trans-dimensional Random Field Language Models for Speech Recognition,"The dominant language models (LMs) such as n-gram and neural network (NN) models represent sentence probabilities in terms of conditionals. In contrast, a new trans-dimensional random field (TRF) LM has been recently introduced to show superior performances, where the whole sentence is modeled as a random field. In this paper, we examine how the TRF models can be interpolated with the NN models, and obtain 12.1\% and 17.9\% relative error rate reductions over 6-gram LMs for English and Chinese speech recognition respectively through log-linear combination."
On the Compression of Recurrent Neural Networks with an Application to LVCSR acoustic modeling for Embedded Speech Recognition,"We study the problem of compressing recurrent neural networks (RNNs). In particular, we focus on the compression of RNN acoustic models, which are motivated by the goal of building compact and accurate speech recognition systems which can be run efficiently on mobile devices. In this work, we present a technique for general recurrent model compression that jointly compresses both recurrent and non-recurrent inter-layer weight matrices. We find that the proposed technique allows us to reduce the size of our Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) acoustic model to a third of its original size with negligible loss in accuracy."
A Comparison between Deep Neural Nets and Kernel Acoustic Models for Speech Recognition,"We study large-scale kernel methods for acoustic modeling and compare to DNNs on performance metrics related to both acoustic modeling and recognition. Measuring perplexity and frame-level classification accuracy, kernel-based acoustic models are as effective as their DNN counterparts. However, on token-error-rates DNN models can be significantly better. We have discovered that this might be attributed to DNN's unique strength in reducing both the perplexity and the entropy of the predicted posterior probabilities. Motivated by our findings, we propose a new technique, entropy regularized perplexity, for model selection. This technique can noticeably improve the recognition performance of both types of models, and reduces the gap between them. While effective on Broadcast News, this technique could be also applicable to other tasks."
Personalized Speech recognition on mobile devices,"We describe a large vocabulary speech recognition system that is accurate, has low latency, and yet has a small enough memory and computational footprint to run faster than real-time on a Nexus 5 Android smartphone. We employ a quantized Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) acoustic model trained with connectionist temporal classification (CTC) to directly predict phoneme targets, and further reduce its memory footprint using an SVD-based compression scheme. Additionally, we minimize our memory footprint by using a single language model for both dictation and voice command domains, constructed using Bayesian interpolation. Finally, in order to properly handle device-specific information, such as proper names and other context-dependent information, we inject vocabulary items into the decoder graph and bias the language model on-the-fly. Our system achieves 13.5% word error rate on an open-ended dictation task, running with a median speed that is seven times faster than real-time."
Segmental Recurrent Neural Networks for End-to-end Speech Recognition,"We study the segmental recurrent neural network for end-to-end acoustic modelling. This model connects the segmental conditional random field (CRF) with a recurrent neural network (RNN) used for feature extraction. Compared to most previous CRF-based acoustic models, it does not rely on an external system to provide features or segmentation boundaries. Instead, this model marginalises out all the possible segmentations, and features are extracted from the RNN trained together with the segmental CRF. In essence, this model is self-contained and can be trained end-to-end. In this paper, we discuss practical training and decoding issues as well as the method to speed up the training in the context of speech recognition. We performed experiments on the TIMIT dataset. We achieved 17.3 phone error rate (PER) from the first-pass decoding --- the best reported result using CRFs, despite the fact that we only used a zeroth-order CRF and without using any language model."
Robust Recognition of Simultaneous Speech By a Mobile Robot,"This paper describes a system that gives a mobile robot the ability to perform automatic speech recognition with simultaneous speakers. A microphone array is used along with a real-time implementation of Geometric Source Separation and a post-filter that gives a further reduction of interference from other sources. The post-filter is also used to estimate the reliability of spectral features and compute a missing feature mask. The mask is used in a missing feature theory-based speech recognition system to recognize the speech from simultaneous Japanese speakers in the context of a humanoid robot. Recognition rates are presented for three simultaneous speakers located at 2 meters from the robot. The system was evaluated on a 200 word vocabulary at different azimuths between sources, ranging from 10 to 90 degrees. Compared to the use of the microphone array source separation alone, we demonstrate an average reduction in relative recognition error rate of 24% with the post-filter and of 42% when the missing features approach is combined with the post-filter. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our multi-source microphone array post-filter and the improvement it provides when used in conjunction with the missing features theory."
Character-Level Incremental Speech Recognition with Recurrent Neural Networks,"In real-time speech recognition applications, the latency is an important issue. We have developed a character-level incremental speech recognition (ISR) system that responds quickly even during the speech, where the hypotheses are gradually improved while the speaking proceeds. The algorithm employs a speech-to-character unidirectional recurrent neural network (RNN), which is end-to-end trained with connectionist temporal classification (CTC), and an RNN-based character-level language model (LM). The output values of the CTC-trained RNN are character-level probabilities, which are processed by beam search decoding. The RNN LM augments the decoding by providing long-term dependency information. We propose tree-based online beam search with additional depth-pruning, which enables the system to process infinitely long input speech with low latency. This system not only responds quickly on speech but also can dictate out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words according to pronunciation. The proposed model achieves the word error rate (WER) of 8.90% on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) Nov'92 20K evaluation set when trained on the WSJ SI-284 training set."
Exploiting Low-dimensional Structures to Enhance DNN Based Acoustic Modeling in Speech Recognition,"We propose to model the acoustic space of deep neural network (DNN) class-conditional posterior probabilities as a union of low-dimensional subspaces. To that end, the training posteriors are used for dictionary learning and sparse coding. Sparse representation of the test posteriors using this dictionary enables projection to the space of training data. Relying on the fact that the intrinsic dimensions of the posterior subspaces are indeed very small and the matrix of all posteriors belonging to a class has a very low rank, we demonstrate how low-dimensional structures enable further enhancement of the posteriors and rectify the spurious errors due to mismatch conditions. The enhanced acoustic modeling method leads to improvements in continuous speech recognition task using hybrid DNN-HMM (hidden Markov model) framework in both clean and noisy conditions, where upto 15.4% relative reduction in word error rate (WER) is achieved."
Manifold-Kernels Comparison in MKPLS for Visual Speech Recognition,"Speech recognition is a challenging problem. Due to the acoustic limitations, using visual information is essential for improving the recognition accuracy in real-life unconstraint situations. One common approach is to model the visual recognition as nonlinear optimization problem. Measuring the distances between visual units is essential for solving this problem. Embedding the visual units on a manifold and using manifold kernels is one way to measure these distances. This work is intended to evaluate the performance of several manifold kernels for solving the problem of visual speech recognition. We show the theory behind each kernel. We apply manifold kernel partial least squares framework to OuluVs and AvLetters databases, and show empirical comparison between all kernels. This framework provides convenient way to explore different kernels."
Environmental Noise Embeddings for Robust Speech Recognition,"We propose a novel deep neural network architecture for speech recognition that explicitly employs knowledge of the background environmental noise within a deep neural network acoustic model. A deep neural network is used to predict the acoustic environment in which the system in being used. The discriminative embedding generated at the bottleneck layer of this network is then concatenated with traditional acoustic features as input to a deep neural network acoustic model. Through a series of experiments on Resource Management, CHiME-3 task, and Aurora4, we show that the proposed approach significantly improves speech recognition accuracy in noisy and highly reverberant environments, outperforming multi-condition training, noise-aware training, i-vector framework, and multi-task learning on both in-domain noise and unseen noise."
Evaluating the Performance of a Speech Recognition based System,"Speech based solutions have taken center stage with growth in the services industry where there is a need to cater to a very large number of people from all strata of the society. While natural language speech interfaces are the talk in the research community, yet in practice, menu based speech solutions thrive. Typically in a menu based speech solution the user is required to respond by speaking from a closed set of words when prompted by the system. A sequence of human speech response to the IVR prompts results in the completion of a transaction. A transaction is deemed successful if the speech solution can correctly recognize all the spoken utterances of the user whenever prompted by the system. The usual mechanism to evaluate the performance of a speech solution is to do an extensive test of the system by putting it to actual people use and then evaluating the performance by analyzing the logs for successful transactions. This kind of evaluation could lead to dissatisfied test users especially if the performance of the system were to result in a poor transaction completion rate. To negate this the Wizard of Oz approach is adopted during evaluation of a speech system. Overall this kind of evaluations is an expensive proposition both in terms of time and cost. In this paper, we propose a method to evaluate the performance of a speech solution without actually putting it to people use. We first describe the methodology and then show experimentally that this can be used to identify the performance bottlenecks of the speech solution even before the system is actually used thus saving evaluation time and expenses."
Small-footprint Deep Neural Networks with Highway Connections for Speech Recognition,"For speech recognition, deep neural networks (DNNs) have significantly improved the recognition accuracy in most of benchmark datasets and application domains. However, compared to the conventional Gaussian mixture models, DNN-based acoustic models usually have much larger number of model parameters, making it challenging for their applications in resource constrained platforms, e.g., mobile devices. In this paper, we study the application of the recently proposed highway network to train small-footprint DNNs, which are {\it thinner} and {\it deeper}, and have significantly smaller number of model parameters compared to conventional DNNs. We investigated this approach on the AMI meeting speech transcription corpus which has around 70 hours of audio data. The highway neural networks constantly outperformed their plain DNN counterparts, and the number of model parameters can be reduced significantly without sacrificing the recognition accuracy."
Deep Speech 2: End-to-End Speech Recognition in English and Mandarin,"We show that an end-to-end deep learning approach can be used to recognize either English or Mandarin Chinese speech--two vastly different languages. Because it replaces entire pipelines of hand-engineered components with neural networks, end-to-end learning allows us to handle a diverse variety of speech including noisy environments, accents and different languages. Key to our approach is our application of HPC techniques, resulting in a 7x speedup over our previous system. Because of this efficiency, experiments that previously took weeks now run in days. This enables us to iterate more quickly to identify superior architectures and algorithms. As a result, in several cases, our system is competitive with the transcription of human workers when benchmarked on standard datasets. Finally, using a technique called Batch Dispatch with GPUs in the data center, we show that our system can be inexpensively deployed in an online setting, delivering low latency when serving users at scale."
Recurrent Models for Auditory Attention in Multi-Microphone Distance Speech Recognition,"Integration of multiple microphone data is one of the key ways to achieve robust speech recognition in noisy environments or when the speaker is located at some distance from the input device. Signal processing techniques such as beamforming are widely used to extract a speech signal of interest from background noise. These techniques, however, are highly dependent on prior spatial information about the microphones and the environment in which the system is being used. In this work, we present a neural attention network that directly combines multi-channel audio to generate phonetic states without requiring any prior knowledge of the microphone layout or any explicit signal preprocessing for speech enhancement. We embed an attention mechanism within a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based acoustic model to automatically tune its attention to a more reliable input source. Unlike traditional multi-channel preprocessing, our system can be optimized towards the desired output in one step. Although attention-based models have recently achieved impressive results on sequence-to-sequence learning, no attention mechanisms have previously been applied to learn potentially asynchronous and non-stationary multiple inputs. We evaluate our neural attention model on the CHiME-3 challenge task, and show that the model achieves comparable performance to beamforming using a purely data-driven method."
Learning to retrieve out-of-vocabulary words in speech recognition,"Many Proper Names (PNs) are Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) words for speech recognition systems used to process diachronic audio data. To help recovery of the PNs missed by the system, relevant OOV PNs can be retrieved out of the many OOVs by exploiting semantic context of the spoken content. In this paper, we propose two neural network models targeted to retrieve OOV PNs relevant to an audio document: (a) Document level Continuous Bag of Words (D-CBOW), (b) Document level Continuous Bag of Weighted Words (D-CBOW2). Both these models take document words as input and learn with an objective to maximise the retrieval of co-occurring OOV PNs. With the D-CBOW2 model we propose a new approach in which the input embedding layer is augmented with a context anchor layer. This layer learns to assign importance to input words and has the ability to capture (task specific) key-words in a bag-of-word neural network model. With experiments on French broadcast news videos we show that these two models outperform the baseline methods based on raw embeddings from LDA, Skip-gram and Paragraph Vectors. Combining the D-CBOW and D-CBOW2 models gives faster convergence during training."
Towards Structured Deep Neural Network for Automatic Speech Recognition,"In this paper we propose the Structured Deep Neural Network (structured DNN) as a structured and deep learning framework. This approach can learn to find the best structured object (such as a label sequence) given a structured input (such as a vector sequence) by globally considering the mapping relationships between the structures rather than item by item.  When automatic speech recognition is viewed as a special case of such a structured learning problem, where we have the acoustic vector sequence as the input and the phoneme label sequence as the output, it becomes possible to comprehensively learn utterance by utterance as a whole, rather than frame by frame.  Structured Support Vector Machine (structured SVM) was proposed to perform ASR with structured learning previously, but limited by the linear nature of SVM. Here we propose structured DNN to use nonlinear transformations in multi-layers as a structured and deep learning approach. This approach was shown to beat structured SVM in preliminary experiments on TIMIT."
Prediction-Adaptation-Correction Recurrent Neural Networks for Low-Resource Language Speech Recognition,"In this paper, we investigate the use of prediction-adaptation-correction recurrent neural networks (PAC-RNNs) for low-resource speech recognition. A PAC-RNN is comprised of a pair of neural networks in which a {\it correction} network uses auxiliary information given by a {\it prediction} network to help estimate the state probability. The information from the correction network is also used by the prediction network in a recurrent loop. Our model outperforms other state-of-the-art neural networks (DNNs, LSTMs) on IARPA-Babel tasks. Moreover, transfer learning from a language that is similar to the target language can help improve performance further."
Highway Long Short-Term Memory RNNs for Distant Speech Recognition,"In this paper, we extend the deep long short-term memory (DLSTM) recurrent neural networks by introducing gated direct connections between memory cells in adjacent layers. These direct links, called highway connections, enable unimpeded information flow across different layers and thus alleviate the gradient vanishing problem when building deeper LSTMs. We further introduce the latency-controlled bidirectional LSTMs (BLSTMs) which can exploit the whole history while keeping the latency under control. Efficient algorithms are proposed to train these novel networks using both frame and sequence discriminative criteria. Experiments on the AMI distant speech recognition (DSR) task indicate that we can train deeper LSTMs and achieve better improvement from sequence training with highway LSTMs (HLSTMs). Our novel model obtains 43.9/47.7\% WER on AMI (SDM) dev and eval sets, outperforming all previous works. It beats the strong DNN and DLSTM baselines with 15.7\% and 5.3\% relative improvement respectively."
Robust coherence-based spectral enhancement for distant speech recognition,In this contribution to the 3rd CHiME Speech Separation and Recognition Challenge (CHiME-3) we extend the acoustic front-end of the CHiME-3 baseline speech recognition system by a coherence-based Wiener filter which is applied to the output signal of the baseline beamformer. To compute the time- and frequency-dependent postfilter gains the ratio between direct and diffuse signal components at the output of the baseline beamformer is estimated and used as approximation of the short-time signal-to-noise ratio. The proposed spectral enhancement technique is evaluated with respect to word error rates of the CHiME-3 challenge baseline speech recognition system using real speech recorded in public environments. Results confirm the effectiveness of the coherence-based postfilter when integrated into the front-end signal enhancement.
Noise Robust IOA/CAS Speech Separation and Recognition System For The Third 'CHIME' Challenge,"This paper presents the contribution to the third 'CHiME' speech separation and recognition challenge including both front-end signal processing and back-end speech recognition. In the front-end, Multi-channel Wiener filter (MWF) is designed to achieve background noise reduction. Different from traditional MWF, optimized parameter for the tradeoff between noise reduction and target signal distortion is built according to the desired noise reduction level. In the back-end, several techniques are taken advantage to improve the noisy Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) performance including Deep Neural Network (DNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long short-term memory (LSTM) using medium vocabulary, Lattice rescoring with a big vocabulary language model finite state transducer, and ROVER scheme. Experimental results show the proposed system combining front-end and back-end is effective to improve the ASR performance."
Unsupervised Domain Discovery using Latent Dirichlet Allocation for Acoustic Modelling in Speech Recognition,"Speech recognition systems are often highly domain dependent, a fact widely reported in the literature. However the concept of domain is complex and not bound to clear criteria. Hence it is often not evident if data should be considered to be out-of-domain. While both acoustic and language models can be domain specific, work in this paper concentrates on acoustic modelling. We present a novel method to perform unsupervised discovery of domains using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) modelling. Here a set of hidden domains is assumed to exist in the data, whereby each audio segment can be considered to be a weighted mixture of domain properties. The classification of audio segments into domains allows the creation of domain specific acoustic models for automatic speech recognition. Experiments are conducted on a dataset of diverse speech data covering speech from radio and TV broadcasts, telephone conversations, meetings, lectures and read speech, with a joint training set of 60 hours and a test set of 6 hours. Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) adaptation to LDA based domains was shown to yield relative Word Error Rate (WER) improvements of up to 16% relative, compared to pooled training, and up to 10%, compared with models adapted with human-labelled prior domain knowledge."
Data-selective Transfer Learning for Multi-Domain Speech Recognition,"Negative transfer in training of acoustic models for automatic speech recognition has been reported in several contexts such as domain change or speaker characteristics. This paper proposes a novel technique to overcome negative transfer by efficient selection of speech data for acoustic model training. Here data is chosen on relevance for a specific target. A submodular function based on likelihood ratios is used to determine how acoustically similar each training utterance is to a target test set. The approach is evaluated on a wide-domain data set, covering speech from radio and TV broadcasts, telephone conversations, meetings, lectures and read speech. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed technique both finds relevant data and limits negative transfer. Results on a 6--hour test set show a relative improvement of 4% with data selection over using all data in PLP based models, and 2% with DNN features."
Enhancement and Recognition of Reverberant and Noisy Speech by Extending Its Coherence,"Most speech enhancement algorithms make use of the short-time Fourier transform (STFT), which is a simple and flexible time-frequency decomposition that estimates the short-time spectrum of a signal. However, the duration of short STFT frames are inherently limited by the nonstationarity of speech signals. The main contribution of this paper is a demonstration of speech enhancement and automatic speech recognition in the presence of reverberation and noise by extending the length of analysis windows. We accomplish this extension by performing enhancement in the short-time fan-chirp transform (STFChT) domain, an overcomplete time-frequency representation that is coherent with speech signals over longer analysis window durations than the STFT. This extended coherence is gained by using a linear model of fundamental frequency variation of voiced speech signals. Our approach centers around using a single-channel minimum mean-square error log-spectral amplitude (MMSE-LSA) estimator proposed by Habets, which scales coefficients in a time-frequency domain to suppress noise and reverberation. In the case of multiple microphones, we preprocess the data with either a minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer, or a delay-and-sum beamformer (DSB). We evaluate our algorithm on both speech enhancement and recognition tasks for the REVERB challenge dataset. Compared to the same processing done in the STFT domain, our approach achieves significant improvement in terms of objective enhancement metrics (including PESQ---the ITU-T standard measurement for speech quality). In terms of automatic speech recognition (ASR) performance as measured by word error rate (WER), our experiments indicate that the STFT with a long window is more effective for ASR."
End-to-End Attention-based Large Vocabulary Speech Recognition,"Many of the current state-of-the-art Large Vocabulary Continuous Speech Recognition Systems (LVCSR) are hybrids of neural networks and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). Most of these systems contain separate components that deal with the acoustic modelling, language modelling and sequence decoding. We investigate a more direct approach in which the HMM is replaced with a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that performs sequence prediction directly at the character level. Alignment between the input features and the desired character sequence is learned automatically by an attention mechanism built into the RNN. For each predicted character, the attention mechanism scans the input sequence and chooses relevant frames. We propose two methods to speed up this operation: limiting the scan to a subset of most promising frames and pooling over time the information contained in neighboring frames, thereby reducing source sequence length. Integrating an n-gram language model into the decoding process yields recognition accuracies similar to other HMM-free RNN-based approaches."
EESEN: End-to-End Speech Recognition using Deep RNN Models and WFST-based Decoding,"The performance of automatic speech recognition (ASR) has improved tremendously due to the application of deep neural networks (DNNs). Despite this progress, building a new ASR system remains a challenging task, requiring various resources, multiple training stages and significant expertise. This paper presents our Eesen framework which drastically simplifies the existing pipeline to build state-of-the-art ASR systems. Acoustic modeling in Eesen involves learning a single recurrent neural network (RNN) predicting context-independent targets (phonemes or characters). To remove the need for pre-generated frame labels, we adopt the connectionist temporal classification (CTC) objective function to infer the alignments between speech and label sequences. A distinctive feature of Eesen is a generalized decoding approach based on weighted finite-state transducers (WFSTs), which enables the efficient incorporation of lexicons and language models into CTC decoding. Experiments show that compared with the standard hybrid DNN systems, Eesen achieves comparable word error rates (WERs), while at the same time speeding up decoding significantly."
Fast and Accurate Recurrent Neural Network Acoustic Models for Speech Recognition,"We have recently shown that deep Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks (RNNs) outperform feed forward deep neural networks (DNNs) as acoustic models for speech recognition. More recently, we have shown that the performance of sequence trained context dependent (CD) hidden Markov model (HMM) acoustic models using such LSTM RNNs can be equaled by sequence trained phone models initialized with connectionist temporal classification (CTC). In this paper, we present techniques that further improve performance of LSTM RNN acoustic models for large vocabulary speech recognition. We show that frame stacking and reduced frame rate lead to more accurate models and faster decoding. CD phone modeling leads to further improvements. We also present initial results for LSTM RNN models outputting words directly."
Robust speech recognition using consensus function based on multi-layer networks,"The clustering ensembles mingle numerous partitions of a specified data into a single clustering solution. Clustering ensemble has emerged as a potent approach for ameliorating both the forcefulness and the stability of unsupervised classification results. One of the major problems in clustering ensembles is to find the best consensus function. Finding final partition from different clustering results requires skillfulness and robustness of the classification algorithm. In addition, the major problem with the consensus function is its sensitivity to the used data sets quality. This limitation is due to the existence of noisy, silence or redundant data. This paper proposes a novel consensus function of cluster ensembles based on Multilayer networks technique and a maintenance database method. This maintenance database approach is used in order to handle any given noisy speech and, thus, to guarantee the quality of databases. This can generates good results and efficient data partitions. To show its effectiveness, we support our strategy with empirical evaluation using distorted speech from Aurora speech databases."
Feature Normalisation for Robust Speech Recognition,"Speech recognition system performance degrades in noisy environments. If the acoustic models are built using features of clean utterances, the features of a noisy test utterance would be acoustically mismatched with the trained model. This gives poor likelihoods and poor recognition accuracy. Model adaptation and feature normalisation are two broad areas that address this problem. While the former often gives better performance, the latter involves estimation of lesser number of parameters, making the system feasible for practical implementations.  This research focuses on the efficacies of various subspace, statistical and stereo based feature normalisation techniques. A subspace projection based method has been investigated as a standalone and adjunct technique involving reconstruction of noisy speech features from a precomputed set of clean speech building-blocks. The building blocks are learned using non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) on log-Mel filter bank coefficients, which form a basis for the clean speech subspace. The work provides a detailed study on how the method can be incorporated into the extraction process of Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients. Experimental results show that the new features are robust to noise, and achieve better results when combined with the existing techniques.  The work also proposes a modification to the training process of SPLICE algorithm for noise robust speech recognition. It is based on feature correlations, and enables this stereo-based algorithm to improve the performance in all noise conditions, especially in unseen cases. Further, the modified framework is extended to work for non-stereo datasets where clean and noisy training utterances, but not stereo counterparts, are required. An MLLR-based computationally efficient run-time noise adaptation method in SPLICE framework has been proposed."
Attention-Based Models for Speech Recognition,"Recurrent sequence generators conditioned on input data through an attention mechanism have recently shown very good performance on a range of tasks in- cluding machine translation, handwriting synthesis and image caption gen- eration. We extend the attention-mechanism with features needed for speech recognition. We show that while an adaptation of the model used for machine translation in reaches a competitive 18.7% phoneme error rate (PER) on the TIMIT phoneme recognition task, it can only be applied to utterances which are roughly as long as the ones it was trained on. We offer a qualitative explanation of this failure and propose a novel and generic method of adding location-awareness to the attention mechanism to alleviate this issue. The new method yields a model that is robust to long inputs and achieves 18% PER in single utterances and 20% in 10-times longer (repeated) utterances. Finally, we propose a change to the at- tention mechanism that prevents it from concentrating too much on single frames, which further reduces PER to 17.6% level."
Hybridized Feature Extraction and Acoustic Modelling Approach for Dysarthric Speech Recognition,Dysarthria is malfunctioning of motor speech caused by faintness in the human nervous system. It is characterized by the slurred speech along with physical impairment which restricts their communication and creates the lack of confidence and affects the lifestyle. This paper attempt to increase the efficiency of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system for unimpaired speech signal. It describes state of art of research into improving ASR for speakers with dysarthria by means of incorporated knowledge of their speech production. Hybridized approach for feature extraction and acoustic modelling technique along with evolutionary algorithm is proposed for increasing the efficiency of the overall system. Here number of feature vectors are varied and tested the system performance. It is observed that system performance is boosted by genetic algorithm. System with 16 acoustic features optimized with genetic algorithm has obtained highest recognition rate of 98.28% with training time of 5:30:17.
Towards Structured Deep Neural Network for Automatic Speech Recognition,"In this paper we propose the Structured Deep Neural Network (Structured DNN) as a structured and deep learning algorithm, learning to find the best structured object (such as a label sequence) given a structured input (such as a vector sequence) by globally considering the mapping relationships between the structure rather than item by item.  When automatic speech recognition is viewed as a special case of such a structured learning problem, where we have the acoustic vector sequence as the input and the phoneme label sequence as the output, it becomes possible to comprehensively learned utterance by utterance as a whole, rather than frame by frame.  Structured Support Vector Machine (structured SVM) was proposed to perform ASR with structured learning previously, but limited by the linear nature of SVM. Here we propose structured DNN to use nonlinear transformations in multi-layers as a structured and deep learning algorithm. It was shown to beat structured SVM in preliminary experiments on TIMIT."
Learning Speech Rate in Speech Recognition,"A significant performance reduction is often observed in speech recognition when the rate of speech (ROS) is too low or too high. Most of present approaches to addressing the ROS variation focus on the change of speech signals in dynamic properties caused by ROS, and accordingly modify the dynamic model, e.g., the transition probabilities of the hidden Markov model (HMM). However, an abnormal ROS changes not only the dynamic but also the static property of speech signals, and thus can not be compensated for purely by modifying the dynamic model. This paper proposes an ROS learning approach based on deep neural networks (DNN), which involves an ROS feature as the input of the DNN model and so the spectrum distortion caused by ROS can be learned and compensated for. The experimental results show that this approach can deliver better performance for too slow and too fast utterances, demonstrating our conjecture that ROS impacts both the dynamic and the static property of speech. In addition, the proposed approach can be combined with the conventional HMM transition adaptation method, offering additional performance gains."
The IBM 2015 English Conversational Telephone Speech Recognition System,"We describe the latest improvements to the IBM English conversational telephone speech recognition system. Some of the techniques that were found beneficial are: maxout networks with annealed dropout rates; networks with a very large number of outputs trained on 2000 hours of data; joint modeling of partially unfolded recurrent neural networks and convolutional nets by combining the bottleneck and output layers and retraining the resulting model; and lastly, sophisticated language model rescoring with exponential and neural network LMs. These techniques result in an 8.0% word error rate on the Switchboard part of the Hub5-2000 evaluation test set which is 23% relative better than our previous best published result."
Feature selection using Fisher's ratio technique for automatic speech recognition,"Automatic Speech Recognition involves mainly two steps; feature extraction and classification . Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient is used as one of the prominent feature extraction techniques in ASR. Usually, the set of all 12 MFCC coefficients is used as the feature vector in the classification step. But the question is whether the same or improved classification accuracy can be achieved by using a subset of 12 MFCC as feature vector. In this paper, Fisher's ratio technique is used for selecting a subset of 12 MFCC coefficients that contribute more in discriminating a pattern. The selected coefficients are used in classification with Hidden Markov Model algorithm. The classification accuracies that we get by using 12 coefficients and by using the selected coefficients are compared."
Belief Hidden Markov Model for speech recognition,"Speech Recognition searches to predict the spoken words automatically. These systems are known to be very expensive because of using several pre-recorded hours of speech. Hence, building a model that minimizes the cost of the recognizer will be very interesting. In this paper, we present a new approach for recognizing speech based on belief HMMs instead of proba-bilistic HMMs. Experiments shows that our belief recognizer is insensitive to the lack of the data and it can be trained using only one exemplary of each acoustic unit and it gives a good recognition rates. Consequently, using the belief HMM recognizer can greatly minimize the cost of these systems."
Deep Multimodal Learning for Audio-Visual Speech Recognition,"In this paper, we present methods in deep multimodal learning for fusing speech and visual modalities for Audio-Visual Automatic Speech Recognition (AV-ASR). First, we study an approach where uni-modal deep networks are trained separately and their final hidden layers fused to obtain a joint feature space in which another deep network is built. While the audio network alone achieves a phone error rate (PER) of 41\% under clean condition on the IBM large vocabulary audio-visual studio dataset, this fusion model achieves a PER of 35.83\% demonstrating the tremendous value of the visual channel in phone classification even in audio with high signal to noise ratio. Second, we present a new deep network architecture that uses a bilinear softmax layer to account for class specific correlations between modalities. We show that combining the posteriors from the bilinear networks with those from the fused model mentioned above results in a further significant phone error rate reduction, yielding a final PER of 34.03\%."
Learning linearly separable features for speech recognition using convolutional neural networks,"Automatic speech recognition systems usually rely on spectral-based features, such as MFCC of PLP. These features are extracted based on prior knowledge such as, speech perception or/and speech production. Recently, convolutional neural networks have been shown to be able to estimate phoneme conditional probabilities in a completely data-driven manner, i.e. using directly temporal raw speech signal as input. This system was shown to yield similar or better performance than HMM/ANN based system on phoneme recognition task and on large scale continuous speech recognition task, using less parameters. Motivated by these studies, we investigate the use of simple linear classifier in the CNN-based framework. Thus, the network learns linearly separable features from raw speech. We show that such system yields similar or better performance than MLP based system using cepstral-based features as input."
Deep Speech: Scaling up end-to-end speech recognition,"We present a state-of-the-art speech recognition system developed using end-to-end deep learning. Our architecture is significantly simpler than traditional speech systems, which rely on laboriously engineered processing pipelines; these traditional systems also tend to perform poorly when used in noisy environments. In contrast, our system does not need hand-designed components to model background noise, reverberation, or speaker variation, but instead directly learns a function that is robust to such effects. We do not need a phoneme dictionary, nor even the concept of a ""phoneme."" Key to our approach is a well-optimized RNN training system that uses multiple GPUs, as well as a set of novel data synthesis techniques that allow us to efficiently obtain a large amount of varied data for training. Our system, called Deep Speech, outperforms previously published results on the widely studied Switchboard Hub5'00, achieving 16.0% error on the full test set. Deep Speech also handles challenging noisy environments better than widely used, state-of-the-art commercial speech systems."
End-to-end Continuous Speech Recognition using Attention-based Recurrent NN: First Results,"We replace the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) which is traditionally used in in continuous speech recognition with a bi-directional recurrent neural network encoder coupled to a recurrent neural network decoder that directly emits a stream of phonemes. The alignment between the input and output sequences is established using an attention mechanism: the decoder emits each symbol based on a context created with a subset of input symbols elected by the attention mechanism. We report initial results demonstrating that this new approach achieves phoneme error rates that are comparable to the state-of-the-art HMM-based decoders, on the TIMIT dataset."
Tied Probabilistic Linear Discriminant Analysis for Speech Recognition,"Acoustic models using probabilistic linear discriminant analysis (PLDA) capture the correlations within feature vectors using subspaces which do not vastly expand the model. This allows high dimensional and correlated feature spaces to be used, without requiring the estimation of multiple high dimension covariance matrices. In this letter we extend the recently presented PLDA mixture model for speech recognition through a tied PLDA approach, which is better able to control the model size to avoid overfitting. We carried out experiments using the Switchboard corpus, with both mel frequency cepstral coefficient features and bottleneck feature derived from a deep neural network. Reductions in word error rate were obtained by using tied PLDA, compared with the PLDA mixture model, subspace Gaussian mixture models, and deep neural networks."
On the use of Stress information in Speech for Speaker Recognition,"The performance of a speaker recognition system decreases when the speaker is under stress or emotion. In this paper we explore and identify a mechanism that enables use of inherent stress-in-speech or speaking style information present in speech of a person as additional cues for speaker recognition. We quantify the the inherent stress present in the speech of a speaker mainly using 3 features, namely, pitch, amplitude and duration (together called PAD) We experimentally observe that the PAD vectors of similar phones in different words of a speaker are close to each other in the three dimensional (PAD) space confirming that the way a speaker stresses different syllables in their speech is unique to them, thus we propose the use of PAD based speaking style of a speaker as an additional feature for speaker recognition applications."
Constructing Long Short-Term Memory based Deep Recurrent Neural Networks for Large Vocabulary Speech Recognition,"Long short-term memory (LSTM) based acoustic modeling methods have recently been shown to give state-of-the-art performance on some speech recognition tasks. To achieve a further performance improvement, in this research, deep extensions on LSTM are investigated considering that deep hierarchical model has turned out to be more efficient than a shallow one. Motivated by previous research on constructing deep recurrent neural networks (RNNs), alternative deep LSTM architectures are proposed and empirically evaluated on a large vocabulary conversational telephone speech recognition task. Meanwhile, regarding to multi-GPU devices, the training process for LSTM networks is introduced and discussed. Experimental results demonstrate that the deep LSTM networks benefit from the depth and yield the state-of-the-art performance on this task."
Spatial Diffuseness Features for DNN-Based Speech Recognition in Noisy and Reverberant Environments,"We propose a spatial diffuseness feature for deep neural network (DNN)-based automatic speech recognition to improve recognition accuracy in reverberant and noisy environments. The feature is computed in real-time from multiple microphone signals without requiring knowledge or estimation of the direction of arrival, and represents the relative amount of diffuse noise in each time and frequency bin. It is shown that using the diffuseness feature as an additional input to a DNN-based acoustic model leads to a reduced word error rate for the REVERB challenge corpus, both compared to logmelspec features extracted from noisy signals, and features enhanced by spectral subtraction."
Visual Speech Recognition,"Lip reading is used to understand or interpret speech without hearing it, a technique especially mastered by people with hearing difficulties. The ability to lip read enables a person with a hearing impairment to communicate with others and to engage in social activities, which otherwise would be difficult. Recent advances in the fields of computer vision, pattern recognition, and signal processing has led to a growing interest in automating this challenging task of lip reading. Indeed, automating the human ability to lip read, a process referred to as visual speech recognition (VSR) (or sometimes speech reading), could open the door for other novel related applications. VSR has received a great deal of attention in the last decade for its potential use in applications such as human-computer interaction (HCI), audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR), speaker recognition, talking heads, sign language recognition and video surveillance. Its main aim is to recognise spoken word(s) by using only the visual signal that is produced during speech. Hence, VSR deals with the visual domain of speech and involves image processing, artificial intelligence, object detection, pattern recognition, statistical modelling, etc."
First-Pass Large Vocabulary Continuous Speech Recognition using Bi-Directional Recurrent DNNs,"We present a method to perform first-pass large vocabulary continuous speech recognition using only a neural network and language model. Deep neural network acoustic models are now commonplace in HMM-based speech recognition systems, but building such systems is a complex, domain-specific task. Recent work demonstrated the feasibility of discarding the HMM sequence modeling framework by directly predicting transcript text from audio. This paper extends this approach in two ways. First, we demonstrate that a straightforward recurrent neural network architecture can achieve a high level of accuracy. Second, we propose and evaluate a modified prefix-search decoding algorithm. This approach to decoding enables first-pass speech recognition with a language model, completely unaided by the cumbersome infrastructure of HMM-based systems. Experiments on the Wall Street Journal corpus demonstrate fairly competitive word error rates, and the importance of bi-directional network recurrence."
Recognition of Isolated Words using Zernike and MFCC features for Audio Visual Speech Recognition,"Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) by machine is an attractive research topic in signal processing domain and has attracted many researchers to contribute in this area. In recent year, there have been many advances in automatic speech reading system with the inclusion of audio and visual speech features to recognize words under noisy conditions. The objective of audio-visual speech recognition system is to improve recognition accuracy. In this paper we computed visual features using Zernike moments and audio feature using Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) on vVISWa (Visual Vocabulary of Independent Standard Words) dataset which contains collection of isolated set of city names of 10 speakers. The visual features were normalized and dimension of features set was reduced by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in order to recognize the isolated word utterance on PCA space.The performance of recognition of isolated words based on visual only and audio only features results in 63.88 and 100 respectively."
Building DNN Acoustic Models for Large Vocabulary Speech Recognition,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) are now a central component of nearly all state-of-the-art speech recognition systems. Building neural network acoustic models requires several design decisions including network architecture, size, and training loss function. This paper offers an empirical investigation on which aspects of DNN acoustic model design are most important for speech recognition system performance. We report DNN classifier performance and final speech recognizer word error rates, and compare DNNs using several metrics to quantify factors influencing differences in task performance. Our first set of experiments use the standard Switchboard benchmark corpus, which contains approximately 300 hours of conversational telephone speech. We compare standard DNNs to convolutional networks, and present the first experiments using locally-connected, untied neural networks for acoustic modeling. We additionally build systems on a corpus of 2,100 hours of training data by combining the Switchboard and Fisher corpora. This larger corpus allows us to more thoroughly examine performance of large DNN models -- with up to ten times more parameters than those typically used in speech recognition systems. Our results suggest that a relatively simple DNN architecture and optimization technique produces strong results. These findings, along with previous work, help establish a set of best practices for building DNN hybrid speech recognition systems with maximum likelihood training. Our experiments in DNN optimization additionally serve as a case study for training DNNs with discriminative loss functions for speech tasks, as well as DNN classifiers more generally."
Realization and design of a pilot assist decision-making system based on speech recognition,"A system based on speech recognition is proposed for pilot assist decision-making. It is based on a HIL aircraft simulation platform and uses the microcontroller SPCE061A as the central processor to achieve better reliability and higher cost-effect performance. Technologies of LPCC (linear predictive cepstral coding) and DTW (Dynamic Time Warping) are applied for isolated-word speech recognition to gain a smaller amount of calculation and a better real-time performance. Besides, we adopt the PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) regulation technology to effectively regulate each control surface by speech, and thus to assist the pilot to make decisions. By trial and error, it is proved that we have a satisfactory accuracy rate of speech recognition and control effect. More importantly, our paper provides a creative idea for intelligent human-computer interaction and applications of speech recognition in the field of aviation control. Our system is also very easy to be extended and applied."
Improving Computer Assisted Speech Therapy Through Speech Based Emotion Recognition,"Speech therapy consists in a wide range of services whose aim is to prevent, diagnose and treat different types of speech impairments. One of the most important conditions for obtaining favourable and steady results is the ""immersing"" of the subject as long as possible into therapeutic context: at home, at school/work, on the street. Since nowadays portable computers tend to become habitual accessories, it seems a good idea to create virtual versions of human SLTs and to integrate them into these devices. However one of the main distinctions between a Speech and Language Therapist (SLT) and a Computer Based Speech Therapy System (CBST) arise from the field of emotion intelligence. The inability of current CBSTs to detect emotional state of human subjects leads to inadequate behavioural responses. Furthermore, this ""unresponsive"" behaviour is perceived as a lack of empathy and, especially when subjects are children, leads to negative emotional state such as frustration. Thus in this article we propose an original emotions recognition framework - named PhonEM - to be integrated in our previous developed CBST - Logomon. The originality consists in both emotions representation (a fuzzy model) and detection (using only subjects' speech stream). These exceptional restrictions along with the fuzzy representation of emotions lie at the origin of our approach and make our task a difficult and, in the same time, an innovative one. As far as we know, this is the first attempt to combine these techniques in order to improve assisted speech therapy and the obtained results encourage as to further develop our CBST."
Design and Optimization of a Speech Recognition Front-End for Distant-Talking Control of a Music Playback Device,"This paper addresses the challenging scenario for the distant-talking control of a music playback device, a common portable speaker with four small loudspeakers in close proximity to one microphone. The user controls the device through voice, where the speech-to-music ratio can be as low as -30 dB during music playback. We propose a speech enhancement front-end that relies on known robust methods for echo cancellation, double-talk detection, and noise suppression, as well as a novel adaptive quasi-binary mask that is well suited for speech recognition. The optimization of the system is then formulated as a large scale nonlinear programming problem where the recognition rate is maximized and the optimal values for the system parameters are found through a genetic algorithm. We validate our methodology by testing over the TIMIT database for different music playback levels and noise types. Finally, we show that the proposed front-end allows a natural interaction with the device for limited-vocabulary voice commands."
MFCC based Enlargement of the Training Set for Emotion Recognition in Speech,"Emotional state recognition through speech is being a very interesting research topic nowadays. Using subliminal information of speech, denominated as prosody, it is possible to recognize the emotional state of the person. One of the main problems in the design of automatic emotion recognition systems is the small number of available patterns. This fact makes the learning process more difficult, due to the generalization problems that arise under these conditions. In this work we propose a solution to this problem consisting in enlarging the training set through the creation the new virtual patterns. In the case of emotional speech, most of the emotional information is included in speed and pitch variations. So, a change in the average pitch that does not modify neither the speed nor the pitch variations does not affect the expressed emotion. Thus, we use this prior information in order to create new patterns applying a gender dependent pitch shift modification in the feature extraction process of the classification system. For this purpose, we propose a frequency scaling modification of the Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients, used to classify the emotion. For this purpose, we propose a gender dependent frequency scaling modification. This proposed process allows us to synthetically increase the number of available patterns in the training set, thus increasing the generalization capability of the system and reducing the test error. Results carried out with two different classifiers with different degree of generalization capability demonstrate the suitability of the proposal."
Long Short-Term Memory Based Recurrent Neural Network Architectures for Large Vocabulary Speech Recognition,"Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture that has been designed to address the vanishing and exploding gradient problems of conventional RNNs. Unlike feedforward neural networks, RNNs have cyclic connections making them powerful for modeling sequences. They have been successfully used for sequence labeling and sequence prediction tasks, such as handwriting recognition, language modeling, phonetic labeling of acoustic frames. However, in contrast to the deep neural networks, the use of RNNs in speech recognition has been limited to phone recognition in small scale tasks. In this paper, we present novel LSTM based RNN architectures which make more effective use of model parameters to train acoustic models for large vocabulary speech recognition. We train and compare LSTM, RNN and DNN models at various numbers of parameters and configurations. We show that LSTM models converge quickly and give state of the art speech recognition performance for relatively small sized models."
Continuous Speech Recognition Based on Deterministic Finite Automata Machine using Utterance and Pitch Verification,"This paper introduces a set of acoustic modeling techniques for utterance verification (UV) based continuous speech recognition (CSR). Utterance verification in this work implies the ability to determine when portions of a hypothesized word string correspond to incorrectly decoded vocabulary words or out-of-vocabulary words that may appear in an utterance. This capability is implemented here as a likelihood ratio (LR). There are two UV techniques that are presented here. The first is voice verification along with the vocabulary testing, at the same time the parameters for UV models are generated based on the optimization criterion which is directly related to the LR measure. The second technique is a pitch recognition based on weighted finite-state transducers. These transducers provide a common and natural representation for major components of speech recognition systems, including hidden Markov models (HMMs), context-dependency models, pronunciation dictionaries, statistical grammars, and word or phone lattices. The finite state machine processes the acoustic parameters of UV models. The results of an experimental study presented in the paper shows that LR based parameter estimation results in a significant improvement in UV performance for this task. The study also found that the use of the LR based weighted finite-state transducers along with the UV, can provide as much as an 11% improvement in UV performance when compared to existing UV procedures. Finally, it was also found that the performance of the finite state machine was highly dependent on the use of the LR criterion in training acoustic models. Several observations are made in the paper concerning the formation of confidence measures for UV and the interaction of these techniques with statistical language models."
Speech Recognition Front End Without Information Loss,"Speech representation and modelling in high-dimensional spaces of acoustic waveforms, or a linear transformation thereof, is investigated with the aim of improving the robustness of automatic speech recognition to additive noise. The motivation behind this approach is twofold: (i) the information in acoustic waveforms that is usually removed in the process of extracting low-dimensional features might aid robust recognition by virtue of structured redundancy analogous to channel coding, (ii) linear feature domains allow for exact noise adaptation, as opposed to representations that involve non-linear processing which makes noise adaptation challenging. Thus, we develop a generative framework for phoneme modelling in high-dimensional linear feature domains, and use it in phoneme classification and recognition tasks. Results show that classification and recognition in this framework perform better than analogous PLP and MFCC classifiers below 18 dB SNR. A combination of the high-dimensional and MFCC features at the likelihood level performs uniformly better than either of the individual representations across all noise levels."
A Bayesian Network View on Acoustic Model-Based Techniques for Robust Speech Recognition,"This article provides a unifying Bayesian network view on various approaches for acoustic model adaptation, missing feature, and uncertainty decoding that are well-known in the literature of robust automatic speech recognition. The representatives of these classes can often be deduced from a Bayesian network that extends the conventional hidden Markov models used in speech recognition. These extensions, in turn, can in many cases be motivated from an underlying observation model that relates clean and distorted feature vectors. By converting the observation models into a Bayesian network representation, we formulate the corresponding compensation rules leading to a unified view on known derivations as well as to new formulations for certain approaches. The generic Bayesian perspective provided in this contribution thus highlights structural differences and similarities between the analyzed approaches."
Local Feature or Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients - Which One is Better for MLN-Based Bangla Speech Recognition?,"This paper discusses the dominancy of local features (LFs), as input to the multilayer neural network (MLN), extracted from a Bangla input speech over mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs). Here, LF-based method comprises three stages: (i) LF extraction from input speech, (ii) phoneme probabilities extraction using MLN from LF and (iii) the hidden Markov model (HMM) based classifier to obtain more accurate phoneme strings. In the experiments on Bangla speech corpus prepared by us, it is observed that the LFbased automatic speech recognition (ASR) system provides higher phoneme correct rate than the MFCC-based system. Moreover, the proposed system requires fewer mixture components in the HMMs."
Feature Learning with Gaussian Restricted Boltzmann Machine for Robust Speech Recognition,"In this paper, we first present a new variant of Gaussian restricted Boltzmann machine (GRBM) called multivariate Gaussian restricted Boltzmann machine (MGRBM), with its definition and learning algorithm. Then we propose using a learned GRBM or MGRBM to extract better features for robust speech recognition. Our experiments on Aurora2 show that both GRBM-extracted and MGRBM-extracted feature performs much better than Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) with either HMM-GMM or hybrid HMM-deep neural network (DNN) acoustic model, and MGRBM-extracted feature is slightly better."
Implementation Of Back-Propagation Neural Network For Isolated Bangla Speech Recognition,"This paper is concerned with the development of Back-propagation Neural Network for Bangla Speech Recognition. In this paper, ten bangla digits were recorded from ten speakers and have been recognized. The features of these speech digits were extracted by the method of Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) analysis. The mfcc features of five speakers were used to train the network with Back propagation algorithm. The mfcc features of ten bangla digit speeches, from 0 to 9, of another five speakers were used to test the system. All the methods and algorithms used in this research were implemented using the features of Turbo C and C++ languages. From our investigation it is seen that the developed system can successfully encode and analyze the mfcc features of the speech signal to recognition. The developed system achieved recognition rate about 96.332% for known speakers (i.e., speaker dependent) and 92% for unknown speakers (i.e., speaker independent)."
Modified SPLICE and its Extension to Non-Stereo Data for Noise Robust Speech Recognition,"In this paper, a modification to the training process of the popular SPLICE algorithm has been proposed for noise robust speech recognition. The modification is based on feature correlations, and enables this stereo-based algorithm to improve the performance in all noise conditions, especially in unseen cases. Further, the modified framework is extended to work for non-stereo datasets where clean and noisy training utterances, but not stereo counterparts, are required. Finally, an MLLR-based computationally efficient run-time noise adaptation method in SPLICE framework has been proposed. The modified SPLICE shows 8.6% absolute improvement over SPLICE in Test C of Aurora-2 database, and 2.93% overall. Non-stereo method shows 10.37% and 6.93% absolute improvements over Aurora-2 and Aurora-4 baseline models respectively. Run-time adaptation shows 9.89% absolute improvement in modified framework as compared to SPLICE for Test C, and 4.96% overall w.r.t. standard MLLR adaptation on HMMs."
Automatic Speech Recognition Using Template Model for Man-Machine Interface,"Speech is a natural form of communication for human beings, and computers with the ability to understand speech and speak with a human voice are expected to contribute to the development of more natural man-machine interfaces. Computers with this kind of ability are gradually becoming a reality, through the evolution of speech recognition technologies. Speech is being an important mode of interaction with computers. In this paper Feature extraction is implemented using well-known Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC).Pattern matching is done using Dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm."
An Overview of Hindi Speech Recognition,"In this age of information technology, information access in a convenient manner has gained importance. Since speech is a primary mode of communication among human beings, it is natural for people to expect to be able to carry out spoken dialogue with computer. Speech recognition system permits ordinary people to speak to the computer to retrieve information. It is desirable to have a human computer dialogue in local language. Hindi being the most widely spoken Language in India is the natural primary human language candidate for human machine interaction. There are five pairs of vowels in Hindi languages; one member is longer than the other one. This paper describes an overview of speech recognition system that includes how speech is produced and the properties and characteristics of Hindi Phoneme."
Opportunities & Challenges In Automatic Speech Recognition,"Automatic speech recognition enables a wide range of current and emerging applications such as automatic transcription, multimedia content analysis, and natural human-computer interfaces. This paper provides a glimpse of the opportunities and challenges that parallelism provides for automatic speech recognition and related application research from the point of view of speech researchers. The increasing parallelism in computing platforms opens three major possibilities for speech recognition systems: improving recognition accuracy in non-ideal, everyday noisy environments; increasing recognition throughput in batch processing of speech data; and reducing recognition latency in realtime usage scenarios. This paper describes technical challenges, approaches taken, and possible directions for future research to guide the design of efficient parallel software and hardware infrastructures."
Speech Enhancement Modeling Towards Robust Speech Recognition System,"Form about four decades human beings have been dreaming of an intelligent machine which can master the natural speech. In its simplest form, this machine should consist of two subsystems, namely automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech understanding (SU). The goal of ASR is to transcribe natural speech while SU is to understand the meaning of the transcription. Recognizing and understanding a spoken sentence is obviously a knowledge-intensive process, which must take into account all variable information about the speech communication process, from acoustics to semantics and pragmatics. While developing an Automatic Speech Recognition System, it is observed that some adverse conditions degrade the performance of the Speech Recognition System. In this contribution, speech enhancement system is introduced for enhancing speech signals corrupted by additive noise and improving the performance of Automatic Speech Recognizers in noisy conditions. Automatic speech recognition experiments show that replacing noisy speech signals by the corresponding enhanced speech signals leads to an improvement in the recognition accuracies. The amount of improvement varies with the type of the corrupting noise."
Techniques for Feature Extraction In Speech Recognition System : A Comparative Study,"The time domain waveform of a speech signal carries all of the auditory information. From the phonological point of view, it little can be said on the basis of the waveform itself. However, past research in mathematics, acoustics, and speech technology have provided many methods for converting data that can be considered as information if interpreted correctly. In order to find some statistically relevant information from incoming data, it is important to have mechanisms for reducing the information of each segment in the audio signal into a relatively small number of parameters, or features. These features should describe each segment in such a characteristic way that other similar segments can be grouped together by comparing their features. There are enormous interesting and exceptional ways to describe the speech signal in terms of parameters. Though, they all have their strengths and weaknesses, we have presented some of the most used methods with their importance."
Acoustic Echo Cancellation Postfilter Design Issues For Speech Recognition System,"In this paper a generalized postfilter algorithm design issues are presented. This postfilter is used to jointly suppress late reverberation, residual echo, and background noise. When residual echo and noise are suppressed, the best result obtains by suppressing both interferences together after the Acoustic echo cancellation (AEC). The main advantage of this approach is that the residual echo and noise suppression does not suffer from the existence of a strong acoustic echo component. Furthermore, the Acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) does not suffer from the time-varying noise suppression. A disadvantage is that the input signal of the Acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) has a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To overcome this problem, algorithms have been proposed where, apart from the joint suppression, a noise-reduced signal is used to adapt the echo canceller."
Speech Recognition with Deep Recurrent Neural Networks,"Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a powerful model for sequential data. End-to-end training methods such as Connectionist Temporal Classification make it possible to train RNNs for sequence labelling problems where the input-output alignment is unknown. The combination of these methods with the Long Short-term Memory RNN architecture has proved particularly fruitful, delivering state-of-the-art results in cursive handwriting recognition. However RNN performance in speech recognition has so far been disappointing, with better results returned by deep feedforward networks. This paper investigates \emph{deep recurrent neural networks}, which combine the multiple levels of representation that have proved so effective in deep networks with the flexible use of long range context that empowers RNNs. When trained end-to-end with suitable regularisation, we find that deep Long Short-term Memory RNNs achieve a test set error of 17.7% on the TIMIT phoneme recognition benchmark, which to our knowledge is the best recorded score."
Improving Automatic Emotion Recognition from speech using Rhythm and Temporal feature,"This paper is devoted to improve automatic emotion recognition from speech by incorporating rhythm and temporal features. Research on automatic emotion recognition so far has mostly been based on applying features like MFCCs, pitch and energy or intensity. The idea focuses on borrowing rhythm features from linguistic and phonetic analysis and applying them to the speech signal on the basis of acoustic knowledge only. In addition to this we exploit a set of temporal and loudness features. A segmentation unit is employed in starting to separate the voiced/unvoiced and silence parts and features are explored on different segments. Thereafter different classifiers are used for classification. After selecting the top features using an IGR filter we are able to achieve a recognition rate of 80.60 % on the Berlin Emotion Database for the speaker dependent framework."
Lip Localization and Viseme Classification for Visual Speech Recognition,"The need for an automatic lip-reading system is ever increasing. Infact, today, extraction and reliable analysis of facial movements make up an important part in many multimedia systems such as videoconference, low communication systems, lip-reading systems. In addition, visual information is imperative among people with special needs. We can imagine, for example, a dependent person ordering a machine with an easy lip movement or by a simple syllable pronunciation. Moreover, people with hearing problems compensate for their special needs by lip-reading as well as listening to the person with whome they are talking."
Feature Learning in Deep Neural Networks - Studies on Speech Recognition Tasks,"Recent studies have shown that deep neural networks (DNNs) perform significantly better than shallow networks and Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) on large vocabulary speech recognition tasks. In this paper, we argue that the improved accuracy achieved by the DNNs is the result of their ability to extract discriminative internal representations that are robust to the many sources of variability in speech signals. We show that these representations become increasingly insensitive to small perturbations in the input with increasing network depth, which leads to better speech recognition performance with deeper networks. We also show that DNNs cannot extrapolate to test samples that are substantially different from the training examples. If the training data are sufficiently representative, however, internal features learned by the DNN are relatively stable with respect to speaker differences, bandwidth differences, and environment distortion. This enables DNN-based recognizers to perform as well or better than state-of-the-art systems based on GMMs or shallow networks without the need for explicit model adaptation or feature normalization."
Statistical Modeling in Continuous Speech Recognition (CSR)(Invited Talk),"Automatic continuous speech recognition (CSR) is sufficiently mature that a variety of real world applications are now possible including large vocabulary transcription and interactive spoken dialogues. This paper reviews the evolution of the statistical modelling techniques which underlie current-day systems, specifically hidden Markov models (HMMs) and N-grams. Starting from a description of the speech signal and its parameterisation, the various modelling assumptions and their consequences are discussed. It then describes various techniques by which the effects of these assumptions can be mitigated. Despite the progress that has been made, the limitations of current modelling techniques are still evident. The paper therefore concludes with a brief review of some of the more fundamental modelling work now in progress."
Multi-input Multi-output Beta Wavelet Network: Modeling of Acoustic Units for Speech Recognition,"In this paper, we propose a novel architecture of wavelet network called Multi-input Multi-output Wavelet Network MIMOWN as a generalization of the old architecture of wavelet network. This newel prototype was applied to speech recognition application especially to model acoustic unit of speech. The originality of our work is the proposal of MIMOWN to model acoustic unit of speech. This approach was proposed to overcome limitation of old wavelet network model. The use of the multi-input multi-output architecture will allows training wavelet network on various examples of acoustic units."
Large Scale Language Modeling in Automatic Speech Recognition,"Large language models have been proven quite beneficial for a variety of automatic speech recognition tasks in Google. We summarize results on Voice Search and a few YouTube speech transcription tasks to highlight the impact that one can expect from increasing both the amount of training data, and the size of the language model estimated from such data. Depending on the task, availability and amount of training data used, language model size and amount of work and care put into integrating them in the lattice rescoring step we observe reductions in word error rate between 6% and 10% relative, for systems on a wide range of operating points between 17% and 52% word error rate."
Comparison of Speech Activity Detection Techniques for Speaker Recognition,"Speech activity detection (SAD) is an essential component for a variety of speech processing applications. It has been observed that performances of various speech based tasks are very much dependent on the efficiency of the SAD. In this paper, we have systematically reviewed some popular SAD techniques and their applications in speaker recognition. Speaker verification system using different SAD technique are experimentally evaluated on NIST speech corpora using Gaussian mixture model- universal background model (GMM-UBM) based classifier for clean and noisy conditions. It has been found that two Gaussian modeling based SAD is comparatively better than other SAD techniques for different types of noises."
Analysis of speech under stress using Linear techniques and Non-Linear techniques for emotion recognition system,"Analysis of speech for recognition of stress is important for identification of emotional state of person. This can be done using 'Linear Techniques', which has different parameters like pitch, vocal tract spectrum, formant frequencies, Duration, MFCC etc. which are used for extraction of features from speech. TEO-CB-Auto-Env is the method which is non-linear method of features extraction. Analysis is done using TU-Berlin (Technical University of Berlin) German database. Here emotion recognition is done for different emotions like neutral, happy, disgust, sad, boredom and anger. Emotion recognition is used in lie detector, database access systems, and in military for recognition of soldiers' emotion identification during the war."
"Arabic Language Learning Assisted by Computer, based on Automatic Speech Recognition","This work consists of creating a system of the Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL) based on a system of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) for the Arabic language using the tool CMU Sphinx3 [1], based on the approach of HMM. To this work, we have constructed a corpus of six hours of speech recordings with a number of nine speakers. we find in the robustness to noise a grounds for the choice of the HMM approach [2]. the results achieved are encouraging since our corpus is made by only nine speakers, but they are always reasons that open the door for other improvement works."
Speech Recognition: Increasing Efficiency of Support Vector Machines,"With the advancement of communication and security technologies, it has become crucial to have robustness of embedded biometric systems. This paper presents the realization of such technologies which demands reliable and error-free biometric identity verification systems. High dimensional patterns are not permitted due to eigen-decomposition in high dimensional feature space and degeneration of scattering matrices in small size sample. Generalization, dimensionality reduction and maximizing the margins are controlled by minimizing weight vectors. Results show good pattern by multimodal biometric system proposed in this paper. This paper is aimed at investigating a biometric identity system using Support Vector Machines(SVMs) and Lindear Discriminant Analysis(LDA) with MFCCs and implementing such system in real-time using SignalWAVE."
Post-Editing Error Correction Algorithm for Speech Recognition using Bing Spelling Suggestion,"ASR short for Automatic Speech Recognition is the process of converting a spoken speech into text that can be manipulated by a computer. Although ASR has several applications, it is still erroneous and imprecise especially if used in a harsh surrounding wherein the input speech is of low quality. This paper proposes a post-editing ASR error correction method and algorithm based on Bing's online spelling suggestion. In this approach, the ASR recognized output text is spell-checked using Bing's spelling suggestion technology to detect and correct misrecognized words. More specifically, the proposed algorithm breaks down the ASR output text into several word-tokens that are submitted as search queries to Bing search engine. A returned spelling suggestion implies that a query is misspelled; and thus it is replaced by the suggested correction; otherwise, no correction is performed and the algorithm continues with the next token until all tokens get validated. Experiments carried out on various speeches in different languages indicated a successful decrease in the number of ASR errors and an improvement in the overall error correction rate. Future research can improve upon the proposed algorithm so much so that it can be parallelized to take advantage of multiprocessor computers."
Diagonalization Matrix Method of Solving the First Problem of Hidden Markov Model in Speech Recognition System,"This paper proposes a computationally efficient method of solving evaluation problem of Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with a given set of discrete observation symbols, number of states and probability distribution matrices. The observation probability for a given HMM model is evaluated using an approach in which the probability evaluation is reduced to the problem of evaluating the product of matrices with different powers and formed out of state transition probabilities and observation probabilities. Finding powers of a matrix is done by using the computationally efficient diagonalization method thereby reducing the overall computational effort for evaluating the Evaluation problem of HMM.The proposed method is compared with the existing direct method. It is found that evaluating matrix power by diagnolisation method is more suitable than that of the direct, method."
Why has (reasonably accurate) Automatic Speech Recognition been so hard to achieve?,"Hidden Markov models (HMMs) have been successfully applied to automatic speech recognition for more than 35 years in spite of the fact that a key HMM assumption -- the statistical independence of frames -- is obviously violated by speech data. In fact, this data/model mismatch has inspired many attempts to modify or replace HMMs with alternative models that are better able to take into account the statistical dependence of frames. However it is fair to say that in 2010 the HMM is the consensus model of choice for speech recognition and that HMMs are at the heart of both commercially available products and contemporary research systems. In this paper we present a preliminary exploration aimed at understanding how speech data depart from HMMs and what effect this departure has on the accuracy of HMM-based speech recognition. Our analysis uses standard diagnostic tools from the field of statistics -- hypothesis testing, simulation and resampling -- which are rarely used in the field of speech recognition. Our main result, obtained by novel manipulations of real and resampled data, demonstrates that real data have statistical dependency and that this dependency is responsible for significant numbers of recognition errors. We also demonstrate, using simulation and resampling, that if we `remove' the statistical dependency from data, then the resulting recognition error rates become negligible. Taken together, these results suggest that a better understanding of the structure of the statistical dependency in speech data is a crucial first step towards improving HMM-based speech recognition."
Speech Recognition of the letter 'zha' in Tamil Language using HMM,"Speech signals of the letter 'zha' in Tamil language of 3 males and 3 females were coded using an improved version of Linear Predictive Coding (LPC). The sampling frequency was at 16 kHz and the bit rate was at 15450 bits per second, where the original bit rate was at 128000 bits per second with the help of wave surfer audio tool. The output LPC cepstrum is implemented in first order three state Hidden Markov Model(HMM) chain."
"Speech Recognition by Machine, A Review","This paper presents a brief survey on Automatic Speech Recognition and discusses the major themes and advances made in the past 60 years of research, so as to provide a technological perspective and an appreciation of the fundamental progress that has been accomplished in this important area of speech communication. After years of research and development the accuracy of automatic speech recognition remains one of the important research challenges (e.g., variations of the context, speakers, and environment).The design of Speech Recognition system requires careful attentions to the following issues: Definition of various types of speech classes, speech representation, feature extraction techniques, speech classifiers, database and performance evaluation. The problems that are existing in ASR and the various techniques to solve these problems constructed by various research workers have been presented in a chronological order. Hence authors hope that this work shall be a contribution in the area of speech recognition. The objective of this review paper is to summarize and compare some of the well known methods used in various stages of speech recognition system and identify research topic and applications which are at the forefront of this exciting and challenging field."
Speech Recognition Oriented Vowel Classification Using Temporal Radial Basis Functions,"The recent resurgence of interest in spatio-temporal neural network as speech recognition tool motivates the present investigation. In this paper an approach was developed based on temporal radial basis function ""TRBF"" looking to many advantages: few parameters, speed convergence and time invariance. This application aims to identify vowels taken from natural speech samples from the Timit corpus of American speech. We report a recognition accuracy of 98.06 percent in training and 90.13 in test on a subset of 6 vowel phonemes, with the possibility to expend the vowel sets in future."
Probabilistic SVM/GMM Classifier for Speaker-Independent Vowel Recognition in Continues Speech,"In this paper, we discuss the issues in automatic recognition of vowels in Persian language. The present work focuses on new statistical method of recognition of vowels as a basic unit of syllables. First we describe a vowel detection system then briefly discuss how the detected vowels can feed to recognition unit. According to pattern recognition, Support Vector Machines (SVM) as a discriminative classifier and Gaussian mixture model (GMM) as a generative model classifier are two most popular techniques. Current state-ofthe- art systems try to combine them together for achieving more power of classification and improving the performance of the recognition systems. The main idea of the study is to combine probabilistic SVM and traditional GMM pattern classification with some characteristic of speech like band-pass energy to achieve better classification rate. This idea has been analytically formulated and tested on a FarsDat based vowel recognition system. The results show inconceivable increases in recognition accuracy. The tests have been carried out by various proposed vowel recognition algorithms and the results have been compared."
Combined Acoustic and Pronunciation Modelling for Non-Native Speech Recognition,"In this paper, we present several adaptation methods for non-native speech recognition. We have tested pronunciation modelling, MLLR and MAP non-native pronunciation adaptation and HMM models retraining on the HIWIRE foreign accented English speech database. The ``phonetic confusion'' scheme we have developed consists in associating to each spoken phone several sequences of confused phones. In our experiments, we have used different combinations of acoustic models representing the canonical and the foreign pronunciations: spoken and native models, models adapted to the non-native accent with MAP and MLLR. The joint use of pronunciation modelling and acoustic adaptation led to further improvements in recognition accuracy. The best combination of the above mentioned techniques resulted in a relative word error reduction ranging from 46% to 71%."

We propose a novel approach to build an Arabic Automated Speech Recognition System (ASR). This system is based on the open source CMU Sphinx-4, from the Carnegie Mellon University. CMU Sphinx is a large-vocabulary; speaker-independent, continuous speech recognition system based on discrete Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). We build a model using utilities from the OpenSource CMU Sphinx. We will demonstrate the possible adaptability of this system to Arabic voice recognition."

Application of Kullback-Leibler Metric to Speech Recognition,"Article discusses the application of Kullback-Leibler divergence to the recognition of speech signals and suggests three algorithms implementing this divergence criterion: correlation algorithm, spectral algorithm and filter algorithm. Discussion covers an approach to the problem of speech variability and is illustrated with the results of experimental modeling of speech signals. The article gives a number of recommendations on the choice of appropriate model parameters and provides a comparison to some other methods of speech recognition."
Speech-Driven Text Retrieval: Using Target IR Collections for Statistical Language Model Adaptation in Speech Recognition,"Speech recognition has of late become a practical technology for real world applications. Aiming at speech-driven text retrieval, which facilitates retrieving information with spoken queries, we propose a method to integrate speech recognition and retrieval methods. Since users speak contents related to a target collection, we adapt statistical language models used for speech recognition based on the target collection, so as to improve both the recognition and retrieval accuracy. Experiments using existing test collections combined with dictated queries showed the effectiveness of our method."
Finding consensus in speech recognition: word error minimization and other applications of confusion networks,"We describe a new framework for distilling information from word lattices to improve the accuracy of speech recognition and obtain a more perspicuous representation of a set of alternative hypotheses. In the standard MAP decoding approach the recognizer outputs the string of words corresponding to the path with the highest posterior probability given the acoustics and a language model. However, even given optimal models, the MAP decoder does not necessarily minimize the commonly used performance metric, word error rate (WER). We describe a method for explicitly minimizing WER by extracting word hypotheses with the highest posterior probabilities from word lattices. We change the standard problem formulation by replacing global search over a large set of sentence hypotheses with local search over a small set of word candidates. In addition to improving the accuracy of the recognizer, our method produces a new representation of the set of candidate hypotheses that specifies the sequence of word-level confusions in a compact lattice format. We study the properties of confusion networks and examine their use for other tasks, such as lattice compression, word spotting, confidence annotation, and reevaluation of recognition hypotheses using higher-level knowledge sources."
Dialogue Act Modeling for Automatic Tagging and Recognition of Conversational Speech,"We describe a statistical approach for modeling dialogue acts in conversational speech, i.e., speech-act-like units such as Statement, Question, Backchannel, Agreement, Disagreement, and Apology. Our model detects and predicts dialogue acts based on lexical, collocational, and prosodic cues, as well as on the discourse coherence of the dialogue act sequence. The dialogue model is based on treating the discourse structure of a conversation as a hidden Markov model and the individual dialogue acts as observations emanating from the model states. Constraints on the likely sequence of dialogue acts are modeled via a dialogue act n-gram. The statistical dialogue grammar is combined with word n-grams, decision trees, and neural networks modeling the idiosyncratic lexical and prosodic manifestations of each dialogue act. We develop a probabilistic integration of speech recognition with dialogue modeling, to improve both speech recognition and dialogue act classification accuracy. Models are trained and evaluated using a large hand-labeled database of 1,155 conversations from the Switchboard corpus of spontaneous human-to-human telephone speech. We achieved good dialogue act labeling accuracy (65% based on errorful, automatically recognized words and prosody, and 71% based on word transcripts, compared to a chance baseline accuracy of 35% and human accuracy of 84%) and a small reduction in word recognition error."
Structured Language Modeling for Speech Recognition,"A new language model for speech recognition is presented. The model develops hidden hierarchical syntactic-like structure incrementally and uses it to extract meaningful information from the word history, thus complementing the locality of currently used trigram models. The structured language model (SLM) and its performance in a two-pass speech recognizer --- lattice decoding --- are presented. Experiments on the WSJ corpus show an improvement in both perplexity (PPL) and word error rate (WER) over conventional trigram models."
Integrating HMM-Based Speech Recognition With Direct Manipulation In A Multimodal Korean Natural Language Interface,This paper presents a HMM-based speech recognition engine and its integration into direct manipulation interfaces for Korean document editor. Speech recognition can reduce typical tedious and repetitive actions which are inevitable in standard GUIs (graphic user interfaces). Our system consists of general speech recognition engine called ABrain {Auditory Brain} and speech commandable document editor called SHE {Simple Hearing Editor}. ABrain is a phoneme-based speech recognition engine which shows up to 97% of discrete command recognition rate. SHE is a EuroBridge widget-based document editor that supports speech commands as well as direct manipulation interfaces.
Algorithms for Speech Recognition and Language Processing,"Speech processing requires very efficient methods and algorithms. Finite-state transducers have been shown recently both to constitute a very useful abstract model and to lead to highly efficient time and space algorithms in this field. We present these methods and algorithms and illustrate them in the case of speech recognition. In addition to classical techniques, we describe many new algorithms such as minimization, global and local on-the-fly determinization of weighted automata, and efficient composition of transducers. These methods are currently used in large vocabulary speech recognition systems. We then show how the same formalism and algorithms can be used in text-to-speech applications and related areas of language processing such as morphology, syntax, and local grammars, in a very efficient way. The tutorial is self-contained and requires no specific computational or linguistic knowledge other than classical results."
Phonological modeling for continuous speech recognition in Korean,A new scheme to represent phonological changes during continuous speech recognition is suggested. A phonological tag coupled with its morphological tag is designed to represent the conditions of Korean phonological changes. A pairwise language model of these morphological and phonological tags is implemented in Korean speech recognition system. Performance of the model is verified through the TDNN-based speech recognition experiments.
Speech Recognition by Composition of Weighted Finite Automata,"We present a general framework based on weighted finite automata and weighted finite-state transducers for describing and implementing speech recognizers. The framework allows us to represent uniformly the information sources and data structures used in recognition, including context-dependent units, pronunciation dictionaries, language models and lattices. Furthermore, general but efficient algorithms can used for combining information sources in actual recognizers and for optimizing their application. In particular, a single composition algorithm is used both to combine in advance information sources such as language models and dictionaries, and to combine acoustic observations and information sources dynamically during recognition."
On Using Selectional Restriction in Language Models for Speech Recognition,"In this paper, we investigate the use of selectional restriction -- the constraints a predicate imposes on its arguments -- in a language model for speech recognition. We use an un-tagged corpus, followed by a public domain tagger and a very simple finite state machine to obtain verb-object pairs from unrestricted English text. We then measure the impact the knowledge of the verb has on the prediction of the direct object in terms of the perplexity of a cluster-based language model. The results show that even though a clustered bigram is more useful than a verb-object model, the combination of the two leads to an improvement over the clustered bigram model."
Analyzing and Improving Statistical Language Models for Speech Recognition,"In many current speech recognizers, a statistical language model is used to indicate how likely it is that a certain word will be spoken next, given the words recognized so far. How can statistical language models be improved so that more complex speech recognition tasks can be tackled? Since the knowledge of the weaknesses of any theory often makes improving the theory easier, the central idea of this thesis is to analyze the weaknesses of existing statistical language models in order to subsequently improve them. To that end, we formally define a weakness of a statistical language model in terms of the logarithm of the total probability, LTP, a term closely related to the standard perplexity measure used to evaluate statistical language models. We apply our definition of a weakness to a frequently used statistical language model, called a bi-pos model. This results, for example, in a new modeling of unknown words which improves the performance of the model by 14% to 21%. Moreover, one of the identified weaknesses has prompted the development of our generalized N-pos language model, which is also outlined in this thesis. It can incorporate linguistic knowledge even if it extends over many words and this is not feasible in a traditional N-pos model. This leads to a discussion of whatknowledge should be added to statistical language models in general and we give criteria for selecting potentially useful knowledge. These results show the usefulness of both our definition of a weakness and of performing an analysis of weaknesses of statistical language models in general."
