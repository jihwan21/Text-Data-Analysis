PEARL: Preprocessing Enhanced Adversarial Robust Learning of Image Deraining for Semantic Segmentation,"In light of the significant progress made in the development and application of semantic segmentation tasks, there has been increasing attention towards improving the robustness of segmentation models against natural degradation factors (e.g., rain streaks) or artificially attack factors (e.g., adversarial attack). Whereas, most existing methods are designed to address a single degradation factor and are tailored to specific application scenarios. In this work, we present the first attempt to improve the robustness of semantic segmentation tasks by simultaneously handling different types of degradation factors. Specifically, we introduce the Preprocessing Enhanced Adversarial Robust Learning (PEARL) framework based on the analysis of our proposed Naive Adversarial Training (NAT) framework. Our approach effectively handles both rain streaks and adversarial perturbation by transferring the robustness of the segmentation model to the image derain model. Furthermore, as opposed to the commonly used Negative Adversarial Attack (NAA), we design the Auxiliary Mirror Attack (AMA) to introduce positive information prior to the training of the PEARL framework, which improves defense capability and segmentation performance. Our extensive experiments and ablation studies based on different derain methods and segmentation models have demonstrated the significant performance improvement of PEARL with AMA in defense against various adversarial attacks and rain streaks while maintaining high generalization performance across different datasets."
Semantic Segmentation by Semantic Proportions,"Semantic segmentation is a critical task in computer vision that aims to identify and classify individual pixels in an image, with numerous applications for example autonomous driving and medical image analysis. However, semantic segmentation can be super challenging particularly due to the need for large amounts of annotated data. Annotating images is a time-consuming and costly process, often requiring expert knowledge and significant effort. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for semantic segmentation by eliminating the need of ground-truth segmentation maps. Instead, our approach requires only the rough information of individual semantic class proportions, shortened as semantic proportions. It greatly simplifies the data annotation process and thus will significantly reduce the annotation time and cost, making it more feasible for large-scale applications. Moreover, it opens up new possibilities for semantic segmentation tasks where obtaining the full ground-truth segmentation maps may not be feasible or practical. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach can achieve comparable and sometimes even better performance against the benchmark method that relies on the ground-truth segmentation maps. Utilising semantic proportions suggested in this work offers a promising direction for future research in the field of semantic segmentation."
GTNet: Graph Transformer Network for 3D Point Cloud Classification and Semantic Segmentation,"Recently, graph-based and Transformer-based deep learning networks have demonstrated excellent performances on various point cloud tasks. Most of the existing graph methods are based on static graph, which take a fixed input to establish graph relations. Moreover, many graph methods apply maximization and averaging to aggregate neighboring features, so that only a single neighboring point affects the feature of centroid or different neighboring points have the same influence on the centroid's feature, which ignoring the correlation and difference between points. Most Transformer-based methods extract point cloud features based on global attention and lack the feature learning on local neighbors. To solve the problems of these two types of models, we propose a new feature extraction block named Graph Transformer and construct a 3D point point cloud learning network called GTNet to learn features of point clouds on local and global patterns. Graph Transformer integrates the advantages of graph-based and Transformer-based methods, and consists of Local Transformer and Global Transformer modules. Local Transformer uses a dynamic graph to calculate all neighboring point weights by intra-domain cross-attention with dynamically updated graph relations, so that every neighboring point could affect the features of centroid with different weights; Global Transformer enlarges the receptive field of Local Transformer by a global self-attention. In addition, to avoid the disappearance of the gradient caused by the increasing depth of network, we conduct residual connection for centroid features in GTNet; we also adopt the features of centroid and neighbors to generate the local geometric descriptors in Local Transformer to strengthen the local information learning capability of the model. Finally, we use GTNet for shape classification, part segmentation and semantic segmentation tasks in this paper."
GAMUS: A Geometry-aware Multi-modal Semantic Segmentation Benchmark for Remote Sensing Data,"Geometric information in the normalized digital surface models (nDSM) is highly correlated with the semantic class of the land cover. Exploiting two modalities (RGB and nDSM (height)) jointly has great potential to improve the segmentation performance. However, it is still an under-explored field in remote sensing due to the following challenges. First, the scales of existing datasets are relatively small and the diversity of existing datasets is limited, which restricts the ability of validation. Second, there is a lack of unified benchmarks for performance assessment, which leads to difficulties in comparing the effectiveness of different models. Last, sophisticated multi-modal semantic segmentation methods have not been deeply explored for remote sensing data. To cope with these challenges, in this paper, we introduce a new remote-sensing benchmark dataset for multi-modal semantic segmentation based on RGB-Height (RGB-H) data. Towards a fair and comprehensive analysis of existing methods, the proposed benchmark consists of 1) a large-scale dataset including co-registered RGB and nDSM pairs and pixel-wise semantic labels; 2) a comprehensive evaluation and analysis of existing multi-modal fusion strategies for both convolutional and Transformer-based networks on remote sensing data. Furthermore, we propose a novel and effective Transformer-based intermediary multi-modal fusion (TIMF) module to improve the semantic segmentation performance through adaptive token-level multi-modal fusion.The designed benchmark can foster future research on developing new methods for multi-modal learning on remote sensing data. Extensive analyses of those methods are conducted and valuable insights are provided through the experimental results. Code for the benchmark and baselines can be accessed at \url{https://github.com/EarthNets/RSI-MMSegmentation}."
FLAIR #2: textural and temporal information for semantic segmentation from multi-source optical imagery,"The FLAIR #2 dataset hereby presented includes two very distinct types of data, which are exploited for a semantic segmentation task aimed at mapping land cover. The data fusion workflow proposes the exploitation of the fine spatial and textural information of very high spatial resolution (VHR) mono-temporal aerial imagery and the temporal and spectral richness of high spatial resolution (HR) time series of Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite images. The French National Institute of Geographical and Forest Information (IGN), in response to the growing availability of high-quality Earth Observation (EO) data, is actively exploring innovative strategies to integrate these data with heterogeneous characteristics. IGN is therefore offering this dataset to promote innovation and improve our knowledge of our territories."
Prototype Adaption and Projection for Few- and Zero-shot 3D Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation,"In this work, we address the challenging task of few-shot and zero-shot 3D point cloud semantic segmentation. The success of few-shot semantic segmentation in 2D computer vision is mainly driven by the pre-training on large-scale datasets like imagenet. The feature extractor pre-trained on large-scale 2D datasets greatly helps the 2D few-shot learning. However, the development of 3D deep learning is hindered by the limited volume and instance modality of datasets due to the significant cost of 3D data collection and annotation. This results in less representative features and large intra-class feature variation for few-shot 3D point cloud segmentation. As a consequence, directly extending existing popular prototypical methods of 2D few-shot classification/segmentation into 3D point cloud segmentation won't work as well as in 2D domain. To address this issue, we propose a Query-Guided Prototype Adaption (QGPA) module to adapt the prototype from support point clouds feature space to query point clouds feature space. With such prototype adaption, we greatly alleviate the issue of large feature intra-class variation in point cloud and significantly improve the performance of few-shot 3D segmentation. Besides, to enhance the representation of prototypes, we introduce a Self-Reconstruction (SR) module that enables prototype to reconstruct the support mask as well as possible. Moreover, we further consider zero-shot 3D point cloud semantic segmentation where there is no support sample. To this end, we introduce category words as semantic information and propose a semantic-visual projection model to bridge the semantic and visual spaces. Our proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art algorithms by a considerable 7.90% and 14.82% under the 2-way 1-shot setting on S3DIS and ScanNet benchmarks, respectively. Code is available at https://github.com/heshuting555/PAP-FZS3D."
Source-Free Domain Adaptation for RGB-D Semantic Segmentation with Vision Transformers,"With the increasing availability of depth sensors, multimodal frameworks that combine color information with depth data are attracting increasing interest. In the challenging task of semantic segmentation, depth maps allow to distinguish between similarly colored objects at different depths and provide useful geometric cues. On the other side, ground truth data for semantic segmentation is burdensome to be provided and thus domain adaptation is another significant research area. Specifically, we address the challenging source-free domain adaptation setting where the adaptation is performed without reusing source data. We propose MISFIT: MultImodal Source-Free Information fusion Transformer, a depth-aware framework which injects depth information into a segmentation module based on vision transformers at multiple stages, namely at the input, feature and output levels. Color and depth style transfer helps early-stage domain alignment while re-wiring self-attention between modalities creates mixed features allowing the extraction of better semantic content. Furthermore, a depth-based entropy minimization strategy is also proposed to adaptively weight regions at different distances. Our framework, which is also the first approach using vision transformers for source-free semantic segmentation, shows noticeable performance improvements with respect to standard strategies."
MIANet: Aggregating Unbiased Instance and General Information for Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation,"Existing few-shot segmentation methods are based on the meta-learning strategy and extract instance knowledge from a support set and then apply the knowledge to segment target objects in a query set. However, the extracted knowledge is insufficient to cope with the variable intra-class differences since the knowledge is obtained from a few samples in the support set. To address the problem, we propose a multi-information aggregation network (MIANet) that effectively leverages the general knowledge, i.e., semantic word embeddings, and instance information for accurate segmentation. Specifically, in MIANet, a general information module (GIM) is proposed to extract a general class prototype from word embeddings as a supplement to instance information. To this end, we design a triplet loss that treats the general class prototype as an anchor and samples positive-negative pairs from local features in the support set. The calculated triplet loss can transfer semantic similarities among language identities from a word embedding space to a visual representation space. To alleviate the model biasing towards the seen training classes and to obtain multi-scale information, we then introduce a non-parametric hierarchical prior module (HPM) to generate unbiased instance-level information via calculating the pixel-level similarity between the support and query image features. Finally, an information fusion module (IFM) combines the general and instance information to make predictions for the query image. Extensive experiments on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i show that MIANet yields superior performance and set a new state-of-the-art. Code is available at https://github.com/Aldrich2y/MIANet."
Pulling Target to Source: A New Perspective on Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation,"Domain adaptive semantic segmentation aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. However, existing methods primarily focus on directly learning qualified target features, making it challenging to guarantee their discrimination in the absence of target labels. This work provides a new perspective. We observe that the features learned with source data manage to keep categorically discriminative during training, thereby enabling us to implicitly learn adequate target representations by simply \textbf{pulling target features close to source features for each category}. To this end, we propose T2S-DA, which we interpret as a form of pulling Target to Source for Domain Adaptation, encouraging the model in learning similar cross-domain features. Also, considering the pixel categories are heavily imbalanced for segmentation datasets, we come up with a dynamic re-weighting strategy to help the model concentrate on those underperforming classes. Extensive experiments confirm that T2S-DA learns a more discriminative and generalizable representation, significantly surpassing the state-of-the-art. We further show that our method is quite qualified for the domain generalization task, verifying its domain-invariant property."
VDD: Varied Drone Dataset for Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation of drone images is critical to many aerial vision tasks as it provides essential semantic details that can compensate for the lack of depth information from monocular cameras. However, maintaining high accuracy of semantic segmentation models for drones requires diverse, large-scale, and high-resolution datasets, which are rare in the field of aerial image processing. Existing datasets are typically small and focus primarily on urban scenes, neglecting rural and industrial areas. Models trained on such datasets are not sufficiently equipped to handle the variety of inputs seen in drone imagery. In the VDD-Varied Drone Dataset, we offer a large-scale and densely labeled dataset comprising 400 high-resolution images that feature carefully chosen scenes, camera angles, and varied light and weather conditions. Furthermore, we have adapted existing drone datasets to conform to our annotation standards and integrated them with VDD to create a dataset 1.5 times the size of fine annotation of Cityscapes. We have developed a novel DeepLabT model, which combines CNN and Transformer backbones, to provide a reliable baseline for semantic segmentation in drone imagery. Our experiments indicate that DeepLabT performs admirably on VDD and other drone datasets. We expect that our dataset will generate considerable interest in drone image segmentation and serve as a foundation for other drone vision tasks. VDD is freely available on our website at https://vddvdd.com ."
Semantic-Promoted Debiasing and Background Disambiguation for Zero-Shot Instance Segmentation,"Zero-shot instance segmentation aims to detect and precisely segment objects of unseen categories without any training samples. Since the model is trained on seen categories, there is a strong bias that the model tends to classify all the objects into seen categories. Besides, there is a natural confusion between background and novel objects that have never shown up in training. These two challenges make novel objects hard to be raised in the final instance segmentation results. It is desired to rescue novel objects from background and dominated seen categories. To this end, we propose D^2Zero with Semantic-Promoted Debiasing and Background Disambiguation to enhance the performance of Zero-shot instance segmentation. Semantic-promoted debiasing utilizes inter-class semantic relationships to involve unseen categories in visual feature training and learns an input-conditional classifier to conduct dynamical classification based on the input image. Background disambiguation produces image-adaptive background representation to avoid mistaking novel objects for background. Extensive experiments show that we significantly outperform previous state-of-the-art methods by a large margin, e.g., 16.86% improvement on COCO.

HGFormer: Hierarchical Grouping Transformer for Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation,"Current semantic segmentation models have achieved great success under the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) condition. However, in real-world applications, test data might come from a different domain than training data. Therefore, it is important to improve model robustness against domain differences. This work studies semantic segmentation under the domain generalization setting, where a model is trained only on the source domain and tested on the unseen target domain. Existing works show that Vision Transformers are more robust than CNNs and show that this is related to the visual grouping property of self-attention. In this work, we propose a novel hierarchical grouping transformer (HGFormer) to explicitly group pixels to form part-level masks and then whole-level masks. The masks at different scales aim to segment out both parts and a whole of classes. HGFormer combines mask classification results at both scales for class label prediction. We assemble multiple interesting cross-domain settings by using seven public semantic segmentation datasets. Experiments show that HGFormer yields more robust semantic segmentation results than per-pixel classification methods and flat grouping transformers, and outperforms previous methods significantly. Code will be available at https://github.com/dingjiansw101/HGFormer."
Uncertainty-based Detection of Adversarial Attacks in Semantic Segmentation,"State-of-the-art deep neural networks have proven to be highly powerful in a broad range of tasks, including semantic image segmentation. However, these networks are vulnerable against adversarial attacks, i.e., non-perceptible perturbations added to the input image causing incorrect predictions, which is hazardous in safety-critical applications like automated driving. Adversarial examples and defense strategies are well studied for the image classification task, while there has been limited research in the context of semantic segmentation. First works however show that the segmentation outcome can be severely distorted by adversarial attacks. In this work, we introduce an uncertainty-based method for the detection of adversarial attacks in semantic segmentation. We observe that uncertainty as for example captured by the entropy of the output distribution behaves differently on clean and perturbed images using this property to distinguish between the two cases. Our method works in a light-weight and post-processing manner, i.e., we do not modify the model or need knowledge of the process used for generating adversarial examples. In a thorough empirical analysis, we demonstrate the ability of our approach to detect perturbed images across multiple types of adversarial attacks."
Semantic Segmentation of Radar Detections using Convolutions on Point Clouds,"For autonomous driving, radar sensors provide superior reliability regardless of weather conditions as well as a significantly high detection range. State-of-the-art algorithms for environment perception based on radar scans build up on deep neural network architectures that can be costly in terms of memory and computation. By processing radar scans as point clouds, however, an increase in efficiency can be achieved in this respect. While Convolutional Neural Networks show superior performance on pattern recognition of regular data formats like images, the concept of convolutions is not yet fully established in the domain of radar detections represented as point clouds. The main challenge in convolving point clouds lies in their irregular and unordered data format and the associated permutation variance. Therefore, we apply a deep-learning based method introduced by PointCNN that weights and permutes grouped radar detections allowing the resulting permutation invariant cluster to be convolved. In addition, we further adapt this algorithm to radar-specific properties through distance-dependent clustering and pre-processing of input point clouds. Finally, we show that our network outperforms state-of-the-art approaches that are based on PointNet++ on the task of semantic segmentation of radar point clouds."
Hi-ResNet: A High-Resolution Remote Sensing Network for Semantic Segmentation,"High-resolution remote sensing (HRS) semantic segmentation extracts key objects from high-resolution coverage areas. However, objects of the same category within HRS images generally show significant differences in scale and shape across diverse geographical environments, making it difficult to fit the data distribution. Additionally, a complex background environment causes similar appearances of objects of different categories, which precipitates a substantial number of objects into misclassification as background. These issues make existing learning algorithms sub-optimal. In this work, we solve the above-mentioned problems by proposing a High-resolution remote sensing network (Hi-ResNet) with efficient network structure designs, which consists of a funnel module, a multi-branch module with stacks of information aggregation (IA) blocks, and a feature refinement module, sequentially, and Class-agnostic Edge Aware (CEA) loss. Specifically, we propose a funnel module to downsample, which reduces the computational cost, and extract high-resolution semantic information from the initial input image. Secondly, we downsample the processed feature images into multi-resolution branches incrementally to capture image features at different scales and apply IA blocks, which capture key latent information by leveraging attention mechanisms, for effective feature aggregation, distinguishing image features of the same class with variant scales and shapes. Finally, our feature refinement module integrate the CEA loss function, which disambiguates inter-class objects with similar shapes and increases the data distribution distance for correct predictions. With effective pre-training strategies, we demonstrated the superiority of Hi-ResNet over state-of-the-art methods on three HRS segmentation benchmarks."
P-NOC: Adversarial CAM Generation for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"To mitigate the necessity for large amounts of supervised segmentation annotation sets, multiple Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) strategies have been devised. These will often rely on advanced data and model regularization strategies to instigate the development of useful properties (e.g., prediction completeness and fidelity to semantic boundaries) in segmentation priors, notwithstanding the lack of annotated information. In this work, we first create a strong baseline by analyzing complementary WSSS techniques and regularizing strategies, considering their strengths and limitations. We then propose a new Class-specific Adversarial Erasing strategy, comprising two adversarial CAM generating networks being gradually refined to produce robust semantic segmentation proposals. Empirical results suggest that our approach induces substantial improvement in the effectiveness of the baseline, resulting in a noticeable improvement over both Pascal VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 datasets."
JetSeg: Efficient Real-Time Semantic Segmentation Model for Low-Power GPU-Embedded Systems,"Real-time semantic segmentation is a challenging task that requires high-accuracy models with low-inference times. Implementing these models on embedded systems is limited by hardware capability and memory usage, which produces bottlenecks. We propose an efficient model for real-time semantic segmentation called JetSeg, consisting of an encoder called JetNet, and an improved RegSeg decoder. The JetNet is designed for GPU-Embedded Systems and includes two main components: a new light-weight efficient block called JetBlock, that reduces the number of parameters minimizing memory usage and inference time without sacrificing accuracy; a new strategy that involves the combination of asymmetric and non-asymmetric convolutions with depthwise-dilated convolutions called JetConv, a channel shuffle operation, light-weight activation functions, and a convenient number of group convolutions for embedded systems, and an innovative loss function named JetLoss, which integrates the Precision, Recall, and IoUB losses to improve semantic segmentation and reduce computational complexity. Experiments demonstrate that JetSeg is much faster on workstation devices and more suitable for Low-Power GPU-Embedded Systems than existing state-of-the-art models for real-time semantic segmentation. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art real-time encoder-decoder models by reducing 46.70M parameters and 5.14% GFLOPs, which makes JetSeg up to 2x faster on the NVIDIA Titan RTX GPU and the Jetson Xavier than other models. The JetSeg code is available at https://github.com/mmontielpz/jetseg."
Advancing Incremental Few-shot Semantic Segmentation via Semantic-guided Relation Alignment and Adaptation,"Incremental few-shot semantic segmentation (IFSS) aims to incrementally extend a semantic segmentation model to novel classes according to only a few pixel-level annotated data, while preserving its segmentation capability on previously learned base categories. This task faces a severe semantic-aliasing issue between base and novel classes due to data imbalance, which makes segmentation results unsatisfactory. To alleviate this issue, we propose the Semantic-guided Relation Alignment and Adaptation (SRAA) method that fully considers the guidance of prior semantic information. Specifically, we first conduct Semantic Relation Alignment (SRA) in the base step, so as to semantically align base class representations to their semantics. As a result, the embeddings of base classes are constrained to have relatively low semantic correlations to categories that are different from them. Afterwards, based on the semantically aligned base categories, Semantic-Guided Adaptation (SGA) is employed during the incremental learning stage. It aims to ensure affinities between visual and semantic embeddings of encountered novel categories, thereby making the feature representations be consistent with their semantic information. In this way, the semantic-aliasing issue can be suppressed. We evaluate our model on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and the COCO dataset. The experimental results on both these two datasets exhibit its competitive performance, which demonstrates the superiority of our method."
Object Segmentation by Mining Cross-Modal Semantics,"Multi-sensor clues have shown promise for object segmentation, but inherent noise in each sensor, as well as the calibration error in practice, may bias the segmentation accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel approach by mining the Cross-Modal Semantics to guide the fusion and decoding of multimodal features, with the aim of controlling the modal contribution based on relative entropy. We explore semantics among the multimodal inputs in two aspects: the modality-shared consistency and the modality-specific variation. Specifically, we propose a novel network, termed XMSNet, consisting of (1) all-round attentive fusion (AF), (2) coarse-to-fine decoder (CFD), and (3) cross-layer self-supervision. On the one hand, the AF block explicitly dissociates the shared and specific representation and learns to weight the modal contribution by adjusting the proportion, region, and pattern, depending upon the quality. On the other hand, our CFD initially decodes the shared feature and then refines the output through specificity-aware querying. Further, we enforce semantic consistency across the decoding layers to enable interaction across network hierarchies, improving feature discriminability. Exhaustive comparison on eleven datasets with depth or thermal clues, and on two challenging tasks, namely salient and camouflage object segmentation, validate our effectiveness in terms of both performance and robustness."
Concurrent Misclassification and Out-of-Distribution Detection for Semantic Segmentation via Energy-Based Normalizing Flow,"Recent semantic segmentation models accurately classify test-time examples that are similar to a training dataset distribution. However, their discriminative closed-set approach is not robust in practical data setups with distributional shifts and out-of-distribution (OOD) classes. As a result, the predicted probabilities can be very imprecise when used as confidence scores at test time. To address this, we propose a generative model for concurrent in-distribution misclassification (IDM) and OOD detection that relies on a normalizing flow framework. The proposed flow-based detector with an energy-based inputs (FlowEneDet) can extend previously deployed segmentation models without their time-consuming retraining. Our FlowEneDet results in a low-complexity architecture with marginal increase in the memory footprint. FlowEneDet achieves promising results on Cityscapes, Cityscapes-C, FishyScapes and SegmentMeIfYouCan benchmarks in IDM/OOD detection when applied to pretrained DeepLabV3+ and SegFormer semantic segmentation models."
Masked Collaborative Contrast for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"This study introduces an efficacious approach, Masked Collaborative Contrast (MCC), to emphasize semantic regions in weakly supervised semantic segmentation. MCC adroitly incorporates concepts from masked image modeling and contrastive learning to devise Transformer blocks that induce keys to contract towards semantically pertinent regions. Unlike prevalent techniques that directly eradicate patch regions in the input image when generating masks, we scrutinize the neighborhood relations of patch tokens by exploring masks considering keys on the affinity matrix. Moreover, we generate positive and negative samples in contrastive learning by utilizing the masked local output and contrasting it with the global output. Elaborate experiments on commonly employed datasets evidences that the proposed MCC mechanism effectively aligns global and local perspectives within the image, attaining impressive performance. The source code is available at \url{https://github.com/fwu11/MCC}."
Not All Pixels Are Equal: Learning Pixel Hardness for Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation has recently witnessed great progress. Despite the impressive overall results, the segmentation performance in some hard areas (e.g., small objects or thin parts) is still not promising. A straightforward solution is hard sample mining, which is widely used in object detection. Yet, most existing hard pixel mining strategies for semantic segmentation often rely on pixel's loss value, which tends to decrease during training. Intuitively, the pixel hardness for segmentation mainly depends on image structure and is expected to be stable. In this paper, we propose to learn pixel hardness for semantic segmentation, leveraging hardness information contained in global and historical loss values. More precisely, we add a gradient-independent branch for learning a hardness level (HL) map by maximizing hardness-weighted segmentation loss, which is minimized for the segmentation head. This encourages large hardness values in difficult areas, leading to appropriate and stable HL map. Despite its simplicity, the proposed method can be applied to most segmentation methods with no and marginal extra cost during inference and training, respectively. Without bells and whistles, the proposed method achieves consistent/significant improvement (1.37% mIoU on average) over most popular semantic segmentation methods on Cityscapes dataset, and demonstrates good generalization ability across domains. The source codes are available at https://github.com/Menoly-xin/Hardness-Level-Learning ."
Quaternion-valued Correlation Learning for Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation,"Few-shot segmentation (FSS) aims to segment unseen classes given only a few annotated samples. Encouraging progress has been made for FSS by leveraging semantic features learned from base classes with sufficient training samples to represent novel classes. The correlation-based methods lack the ability to consider interaction of the two subspace matching scores due to the inherent nature of the real-valued 2D convolutions. In this paper, we introduce a quaternion perspective on correlation learning and propose a novel Quaternion-valued Correlation Learning Network (QCLNet), with the aim to alleviate the computational burden of high-dimensional correlation tensor and explore internal latent interaction between query and support images by leveraging operations defined by the established quaternion algebra. Specifically, our QCLNet is formulated as a hyper-complex valued network and represents correlation tensors in the quaternion domain, which uses quaternion-valued convolution to explore the external relations of query subspace when considering the hidden relationship of the support sub-dimension in the quaternion space. Extensive experiments on the PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods effectively. Our code is available at https://github.com/zwzheng98/QCLNet"
Hear to Segment: Unmixing the Audio to Guide the Semantic Segmentation,"In this paper, we focus on a recently proposed novel task called Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS), where the fine-grained correspondence between audio stream and image pixels is required to be established. However, learning such correspondence faces two key challenges: (1) audio signals inherently exhibit a high degree of information density, as sounds produced by multiple objects are entangled within the same audio stream; (2) the frequency of audio signals from objects with the same category tends to be similar, which hampers the distinction of target object and consequently leads to ambiguous segmentation results. Toward this end, we propose an Audio Unmixing and Semantic Segmentation Network (AUSS), which encourages unmixing complicated audio signals and distinguishing similar sounds. Technically, our AUSS unmixs the audio signals into a set of audio queries, and interacts them with visual features by masked attention mechanisms. To encourage these audio queries to capture distinctive features embedded within the audio, two self-supervised losses are also introduced as additional supervision at both class and mask levels. Extensive experimental results on the AVSBench benchmark show that our AUSS sets a new state-of-the-art in both single-source and multi-source subsets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our AUSS in bridging the gap between audio and vision modalities."
Convolutional Neural Networks Rarely Learn Shape for Semantic Segmentation,"Shape learning, or the ability to leverage shape information, could be a desirable property of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) when target objects have specific shapes. While some research on the topic is emerging, there is no systematic study to conclusively determine whether and under what circumstances CNNs learn shape. Here, we present such a study in the context of segmentation networks where shapes are particularly important. We define shape and propose a new behavioral metric to measure the extent to which a CNN utilizes shape information. We then execute a set of experiments with synthetic and real-world data to progressively uncover under which circumstances CNNs learn shape and what can be done to encourage such behavior. We conclude that (i) CNNs do not learn shape in typical settings but rather rely on other features available to identify the objects of interest, (ii) CNNs can learn shape, but only if the shape is the only feature available to identify the object, (iii) sufficiently large receptive field size relative to the size of target objects is necessary for shape learning; (iv) a limited set of augmentations can encourage shape learning; (v) learning shape is indeed useful in the presence of out-of-distribution data."
Radious: Unveiling the Enigma of Dental Radiology with BEIT Adaptor and Mask2Former in Semantic Segmentation,"X-ray images are the first steps for diagnosing and further treating dental problems. So, early diagnosis prevents the development and increase of oral and dental diseases. In this paper, we developed a semantic segmentation algorithm based on BEIT adaptor and Mask2Former to detect and identify teeth, roots, and multiple dental diseases and abnormalities such as pulp chamber, restoration, endodontics, crown, decay, pin, composite, bridge, pulpitis, orthodontics, radicular cyst, periapical cyst, cyst, implant, and bone graft material in panoramic, periapical, and bitewing X-ray images. We compared the result of our algorithm to two state-of-the-art algorithms in image segmentation named: Deeplabv3 and Segformer on our own data set. We discovered that Radious outperformed those algorithms by increasing the mIoU scores by 9% and 33% in Deeplabv3+ and Segformer, respectively."
A Self-Training Framework Based on Multi-Scale Attention Fusion for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) based on image-level labels is challenging since it is hard to obtain complete semantic regions. To address this issue, we propose a self-training method that utilizes fused multi-scale class-aware attention maps. Our observation is that attention maps of different scales contain rich complementary information, especially for large and small objects. Therefore, we collect information from attention maps of different scales and obtain multi-scale attention maps. We then apply denoising and reactivation strategies to enhance the potential regions and reduce noisy areas. Finally, we use the refined attention maps to retrain the network. Experiments showthat our method enables the model to extract rich semantic information from multi-scale images and achieves 72.4% mIou scores on both the PASCAL VOC 2012 validation and test sets. The code is available at https://bupt-ai-cz.github.io/SMAF."
Segment Anything Model (SAM) Enhanced Pseudo Labels for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) with only image-level supervision has garnered increasing attention due to its low annotation cost compared to pixel-level annotation. Most existing methods rely on Class Activation Maps (CAM) to generate pixel-level pseudo labels for supervised training. However, it is well known that CAM often suffers from partial activation -- activating the most discriminative part instead of the entire object area, and false activation -- unnecessarily activating the background around the object. In this study, we introduce a simple yet effective approach to address these limitations by harnessing the recently released Segment Anything Model (SAM) to generate higher-quality pseudo labels with CAM. SAM is a segmentation foundation model that demonstrates strong zero-shot ability in partitioning images into segments but lacks semantic labels for these regions. To circumvent this, we employ pseudo labels for a specific class as the signal to select the most relevant masks and label them to generate the refined pseudo labels for this class. The segments generated by SAM are highly precise, leading to substantial improvements in partial and false activation. Moreover, existing post-processing modules for producing pseudo labels, such as AffinityNet, are often computationally heavy, with a significantly long training time. Surprisingly, we discovered that using the initial CAM with SAM can achieve on-par performance as the post-processed pseudo label generated from these modules with much less computational cost. Our approach is highly versatile and capable of seamless integration into existing WSSS models without modification to base networks or pipelines. Despite its simplicity, our approach improves the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of pseudo labels from five state-of-the-art WSSS methods by 6.2\% on average on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset."
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation via Feature-space Density Matching,"Semantic segmentation is a critical step in automated image interpretation and analysis where pixels are classified into one or more predefined semantically meaningful classes. Deep learning approaches for semantic segmentation rely on harnessing the power of annotated images to learn features indicative of these semantic classes. Nonetheless, they often fail to generalize when there is a significant domain (i.e., distributional) shift between the training (i.e., source) data and the dataset(s) encountered when deployed (i.e., target), necessitating manual annotations for the target data to achieve acceptable performance. This is especially important in medical imaging because different image modalities have significant intra- and inter-site variations due to protocol and vendor variability. Current techniques are sensitive to hyperparameter tuning and target dataset size. This paper presents an unsupervised domain adaptation approach for semantic segmentation that alleviates the need for annotating target data. Using kernel density estimation, we match the target data distribution to the source data in the feature space. We demonstrate that our results are comparable or superior on multiple-site prostate MRI and histopathology images, which mitigates the need for annotating target data."
Multi-Granularity Denoising and Bidirectional Alignment for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) models relying on class activation maps (CAMs) have achieved desirable performance comparing to the non-CAMs-based counterparts. However, to guarantee WSSS task feasible, we need to generate pseudo labels by expanding the seeds from CAMs which is complex and time-consuming, thus hindering the design of efficient end-to-end (single-stage) WSSS approaches. To tackle the above dilemma, we resort to the off-the-shelf and readily accessible saliency maps for directly obtaining pseudo labels given the image-level class labels. Nevertheless, the salient regions may contain noisy labels and cannot seamlessly fit the target objects, and saliency maps can only be approximated as pseudo labels for simple images containing single-class objects. As such, the achieved segmentation model with these simple images cannot generalize well to the complex images containing multi-class objects. To this end, we propose an end-to-end multi-granularity denoising and bidirectional alignment (MDBA) model, to alleviate the noisy label and multi-class generalization issues. Specifically, we propose the online noise filtering and progressive noise detection modules to tackle image-level and pixel-level noise, respectively. Moreover, a bidirectional alignment mechanism is proposed to reduce the data distribution gap at both input and output space with simple-to-complex image synthesis and complex-to-simple adversarial learning. MDBA can reach the mIoU of 69.5\% and 70.2\% on validation and test sets for the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset. The source codes and models have been made available at \url{https://github.com/NUST-Machine-Intelligence-Laboratory/MDBA}."
OSTA: One-shot Task-adaptive Channel Selection for Semantic Segmentation of Multichannel Images,"Semantic segmentation of multichannel images is a fundamental task for many applications. Selecting an appropriate channel combination from the original multichannel image can improve the accuracy of semantic segmentation and reduce the cost of data storage, processing and future acquisition. Existing channel selection methods typically use a reasonable selection procedure to determine a desirable channel combination, and then train a semantic segmentation network using that combination. In this study, the concept of pruning from a supernet is used for the first time to integrate the selection of channel combination and the training of a semantic segmentation network. Based on this concept, a One-Shot Task-Adaptive (OSTA) channel selection method is proposed for the semantic segmentation of multichannel images. OSTA has three stages, namely the supernet training stage, the pruning stage and the fine-tuning stage. The outcomes of six groups of experiments (L7Irish3C, L7Irish2C, L8Biome3C, L8Biome2C, RIT-18 and Semantic3D) demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of OSTA. OSTA achieved the highest segmentation accuracies in all tests (62.49% (mIoU), 75.40% (mIoU), 68.38% (mIoU), 87.63% (mIoU), 66.53% (mA) and 70.86% (mIoU), respectively). It even exceeded the highest accuracies of exhaustive tests (61.54% (mIoU), 74.91% (mIoU), 67.94% (mIoU), 87.32% (mIoU), 65.32% (mA) and 70.27% (mIoU), respectively), where all possible channel combinations were tested. All of this can be accomplished within a predictable and relatively efficient timeframe, ranging from 101.71% to 298.1% times the time required to train the segmentation network alone. In addition, there were interesting findings that were deemed valuable for several fields."
Living in a Material World: Learning Material Properties from Full-Waveform Flash Lidar Data for Semantic Segmentation,"Advances in lidar technology have made the collection of 3D point clouds fast and easy. While most lidar sensors return per-point intensity (or reflectance) values along with range measurements, flash lidar sensors are able to provide information about the shape of the return pulse. The shape of the return waveform is affected by many factors, including the distance that the light pulse travels and the angle of incidence with a surface. Importantly, the shape of the return waveform also depends on the material properties of the reflecting surface. In this paper, we investigate whether the material type or class can be determined from the full-waveform response. First, as a proof of concept, we demonstrate that the extra information about material class, if known accurately, can improve performance on scene understanding tasks such as semantic segmentation. Next, we learn two different full-waveform material classifiers: a random forest classifier and a temporal convolutional neural network (TCN) classifier. We find that, in some cases, material types can be distinguished, and that the TCN generally performs better across a wider range of materials. However, factors such as angle of incidence, material colour, and material similarity may hinder overall performance."
Structural and Statistical Texture Knowledge Distillation for Semantic Segmentation,"Existing knowledge distillation works for semantic segmentation mainly focus on transferring high-level contextual knowledge from teacher to student. However, low-level texture knowledge is also of vital importance for characterizing the local structural pattern and global statistical property, such as boundary, smoothness, regularity and color contrast, which may not be well addressed by high-level deep features. In this paper, we are intended to take full advantage of both structural and statistical texture knowledge and propose a novel Structural and Statistical Texture Knowledge Distillation (SSTKD) framework for semantic segmentation. Specifically, for structural texture knowledge, we introduce a Contourlet Decomposition Module (CDM) that decomposes low-level features with iterative Laplacian pyramid and directional filter bank to mine the structural texture knowledge. For statistical knowledge, we propose a Denoised Texture Intensity Equalization Module (DTIEM) to adaptively extract and enhance statistical texture knowledge through heuristics iterative quantization and denoised operation. Finally, each knowledge learning is supervised by an individual loss function, forcing the student network to mimic the teacher better from a broader perspective. Experiments show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on Cityscapes, Pascal VOC 2012 and ADE20K datasets."
Semantic Segmentation using Vision Transformers: A survey,"Semantic segmentation has a broad range of applications in a variety of domains including land coverage analysis, autonomous driving, and medical image analysis. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) provide the architecture models for semantic segmentation. Even though ViTs have proven success in image classification, they cannot be directly applied to dense prediction tasks such as image segmentation and object detection since ViT is not a general purpose backbone due to its patch partitioning scheme. In this survey, we discuss some of the different ViT architectures that can be used for semantic segmentation and how their evolution managed the above-stated challenge. The rise of ViT and its performance with a high success rate motivated the community to slowly replace the traditional convolutional neural networks in various computer vision tasks. This survey aims to review and compare the performances of ViT architectures designed for semantic segmentation using benchmarking datasets. This will be worthwhile for the community to yield knowledge regarding the implementations carried out in semantic segmentation and to discover more efficient methodologies using ViTs."
Clothes Grasping and Unfolding Based on RGB-D Semantic Segmentation,"Clothes grasping and unfolding is a core step in robotic-assisted dressing. Most existing works leverage depth images of clothes to train a deep learning-based model to recognize suitable grasping points. These methods often utilize physics engines to synthesize depth images to reduce the cost of real labeled data collection. However, the natural domain gap between synthetic and real images often leads to poor performance of these methods on real data. Furthermore, these approaches often struggle in scenarios where grasping points are occluded by the clothing item itself. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel Bi-directional Fractal Cross Fusion Network (BiFCNet) for semantic segmentation, enabling recognition of graspable regions in order to provide more possibilities for grasping. Instead of using depth images only, we also utilize RGB images with rich color features as input to our network in which the Fractal Cross Fusion (FCF) module fuses RGB and depth data by considering global complex features based on fractal geometry. To reduce the cost of real data collection, we further propose a data augmentation method based on an adversarial strategy, in which the color and geometric transformations simultaneously process RGB and depth data while maintaining the label correspondence. Finally, we present a pipeline for clothes grasping and unfolding from the perspective of semantic segmentation, through the addition of a strategy for grasp point selection from segmentation regions based on clothing flatness measures, while taking into account the grasping direction. We evaluate our BiFCNet on the public dataset NYUDv2 and obtained comparable performance to current state-of-the-art models. We also deploy our model on a Baxter robot, running extensive grasping and unfolding experiments as part of our ablation studies, achieving an 84% success rate."
Smaller3d: Smaller Models for 3D Semantic Segmentation Using Minkowski Engine and Knowledge Distillation Methods,"There are various optimization techniques in the realm of 3D, including point cloud-based approaches that use mesh, texture, and voxels which optimize how you store, and how do calculate in 3D. These techniques employ methods such as feed-forward networks, 3D convolutions, graph neural networks, transformers, and sparse tensors. However, the field of 3D is one of the most computationally expensive fields, and these methods have yet to achieve their full potential due to their large capacity, complexity, and computation limits. This paper proposes the application of knowledge distillation techniques, especially for sparse tensors in 3D deep learning, to reduce model sizes while maintaining performance. We analyze and purpose different loss functions, including standard methods and combinations of various losses, to simulate the performance of state-of-the-art models of different Sparse Convolutional NNs. Our experiments are done on the standard ScanNet V2 dataset, and we achieved around 2.6\% mIoU difference with a 4 times smaller model and around 8\% with a 16 times smaller model on the latest state-of-the-art spacio-temporal convents based models."
Mitigating Undisciplined Over-Smoothing in Transformer for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"A surge of interest has emerged in weakly supervised semantic segmentation due to its remarkable efficiency in recent years. Existing approaches based on transformers mainly focus on exploring the affinity matrix to boost CAMs with global relationships. While in this work, we first perform a scrupulous examination towards the impact of successive affinity matrices and discover that they possess an inclination toward sparsification as the network approaches convergence, hence disclosing a manifestation of over-smoothing. Besides, it has been observed that enhanced attention maps tend to evince a substantial amount of extraneous background noise in deeper layers. Drawing upon this, we posit a daring conjecture that the undisciplined over-smoothing phenomenon introduces a noteworthy quantity of semantically irrelevant background noise, causing performance degradation. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel perspective that highlights the objects of interest by investigating the regions of the trait, thereby fostering an extensive comprehension of the successive affinity matrix. Consequently, we suggest an adaptive re-activation mechanism (AReAM) that alleviates the issue of incomplete attention within the object and the unbounded background noise. AReAM accomplishes this by supervising high-level attention with shallow affinity matrices, yielding promising results. Exhaustive experiments conducted on the commonly used dataset manifest that segmentation results can be greatly improved through our proposed AReAM, which imposes restrictions on each affinity matrix in deep layers to make it attentive to semantic regions."
MTLSegFormer: Multi-task Learning with Transformers for Semantic Segmentation in Precision Agriculture,"Multi-task learning has proven to be effective in improving the performance of correlated tasks. Most of the existing methods use a backbone to extract initial features with independent branches for each task, and the exchange of information between the branches usually occurs through the concatenation or sum of the feature maps of the branches. However, this type of information exchange does not directly consider the local characteristics of the image nor the level of importance or correlation between the tasks. In this paper, we propose a semantic segmentation method, MTLSegFormer, which combines multi-task learning and attention mechanisms. After the backbone feature extraction, two feature maps are learned for each task. The first map is proposed to learn features related to its task, while the second map is obtained by applying learned visual attention to locally re-weigh the feature maps of the other tasks. In this way, weights are assigned to local regions of the image of other tasks that have greater importance for the specific task. Finally, the two maps are combined and used to solve a task. We tested the performance in two challenging problems with correlated tasks and observed a significant improvement in accuracy, mainly in tasks with high dependence on the others."
Point2Tree(P2T) -- framework for parameter tuning of semantic and instance segmentation used with mobile laser scanning data in coniferous forest,"This article introduces Point2Tree, a novel framework that incorporates a three-stage process involving semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, optimization analysis of hyperparemeters importance. It introduces a comprehensive and modular approach to processing laser points clouds in Forestry. We tested it on two independent datasets. The first area was located in an actively managed boreal coniferous dominated forest in Våler, Norway, 16 circular plots of 400 square meters were selected to cover a range of forest conditions in terms of species composition and stand density. We trained a model based on Pointnet++ architecture which achieves 0.92 F1-score in semantic segmentation. As a second step in our pipeline we used graph-based approach for instance segmentation which reached F1-score approx. 0.6. The optimization allowed to further boost the performance of the pipeline by approx. 4 \% points."
DeepAqua: Self-Supervised Semantic Segmentation of Wetlands from SAR Images using Knowledge Distillation,"Remote sensing has significantly advanced water detection by applying semantic segmentation techniques to satellite imagery. However, semantic segmentation remains challenging due to the substantial amount of annotated data required. This is particularly problematic in wetland detection, where water extent varies over time and space, necessitating multiple annotations for the same area. In this paper, we present DeepAqua, a self-supervised deep learning model that leverages knowledge distillation to eliminate the need for manual annotations during the training phase. DeepAqua utilizes the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) as a teacher model to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for segmenting water from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. To train the student model, we exploit cases where optical- and radar-based water masks coincide, enabling the detection of both open and vegetated water surfaces. Our model represents a significant advancement in computer vision techniques by effectively training semantic segmentation models without any manually annotated data. This approach offers a practical solution for monitoring wetland water extent changes without needing ground truth data, making it highly adaptable and scalable for wetland conservation efforts."
An Alternative to WSSS? An Empirical Study of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) on Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation Problems,"The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated exceptional performance and versatility, making it a promising tool for various related tasks. In this report, we explore the application of SAM in Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS). Particularly, we adapt SAM as the pseudo-label generation pipeline given only the image-level class labels. While we observed impressive results in most cases, we also identify certain limitations. Our study includes performance evaluations on PASCAL VOC and MS-COCO, where we achieved remarkable improvements over the latest state-of-the-art methods on both datasets. We anticipate that this report encourages further explorations of adopting SAM in WSSS, as well as wider real-world applications."
Exploring vision transformer layer choosing for semantic segmentation,"Extensive work has demonstrated the effectiveness of Vision Transformers. The plain Vision Transformer tends to obtain multi-scale features by selecting fixed layers, or the last layer of features aiming to achieve higher performance in dense prediction tasks. However, this selection is often based on manual operation. And different samples often exhibit different features at different layers (e.g., edge, structure, texture, detail, etc.). This requires us to seek a dynamic adaptive fusion method to filter different layer features. In this paper, unlike previous encoder and decoder work, we design a neck network for adaptive fusion and feature selection, called ViTController. We validate the effectiveness of our method on different datasets and models and surpass previous state-of-the-art methods. Finally, our method can also be used as a plug-in module and inserted into different networks."
Segment Anything is A Good Pseudo-label Generator for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Weakly supervised semantic segmentation with weak labels is a long-lived ill-posed problem. Mainstream methods mainly focus on improving the quality of pseudo labels. In this report, we attempt to explore the potential of 'prompt to masks' from the powerful class-agnostic large segmentation model, segment-anything. Specifically, different weak labels are used as prompts to the segment-anything model, generating precise class masks. The class masks are utilized to generate pseudo labels to train the segmentation networks. We have conducted extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset. Experiments demonstrate that segment-anything can serve as a good pseudo-label generator. The code will be made publicly available."
CLIP-S^4: Language-Guided Self-Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Existing semantic segmentation approaches are often limited by costly pixel-wise annotations and predefined classes. In this work, we present CLIP-S^4 that leverages self-supervised pixel representation learning and vision-language models to enable various semantic segmentation tasks (e.g., unsupervised, transfer learning, language-driven segmentation) without any human annotations and unknown class information. We first learn pixel embeddings with pixel-segment contrastive learning from different augmented views of images. To further improve the pixel embeddings and enable language-driven semantic segmentation, we design two types of consistency guided by vision-language models: 1) embedding consistency, aligning our pixel embeddings to the joint feature space of a pre-trained vision-language model, CLIP; and 2) semantic consistency, forcing our model to make the same predictions as CLIP over a set of carefully designed target classes with both known and unknown prototypes. Thus, CLIP-S^4 enables a new task of class-free semantic segmentation where no unknown class information is needed during training. As a result, our approach shows consistent and substantial performance improvement over four popular benchmarks compared with the state-of-the-art unsupervised and language-driven semantic segmentation methods. More importantly, our method outperforms these methods on unknown class recognition by a large margin."
Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation is an important and well-known task in the field of computer vision, in which we attempt to assign a corresponding semantic class to each input element. When it comes to semantic segmentation of 2D images, the input elements are pixels. On the other hand, the input can also be a point cloud, where one input element represents one point in the input point cloud. By the term point cloud, we refer to a set of points defined by spatial coordinates with respect to some reference coordinate system. In addition to the position of points in space, other features can also be defined for each point, such as RGB components. In this paper, we conduct semantic segmentation on the S3DIS dataset, where each point cloud represents one room. We train models on the S3DIS dataset, namely PointCNN, PointNet++, Cylinder3D, Point Transformer, and RepSurf. We compare the obtained results with respect to standard evaluation metrics for semantic segmentation and present a comparison of the models based on inference speed."
PRSeg: A Lightweight Patch Rotate MLP Decoder for Semantic Segmentation,"The lightweight MLP-based decoder has become increasingly promising for semantic segmentation. However, the channel-wise MLP cannot expand the receptive fields, lacking the context modeling capacity, which is critical to semantic segmentation. In this paper, we propose a parametric-free patch rotate operation to reorganize the pixels spatially. It first divides the feature map into multiple groups and then rotates the patches within each group. Based on the proposed patch rotate operation, we design a novel segmentation network, named PRSeg, which includes an off-the-shelf backbone and a lightweight Patch Rotate MLP decoder containing multiple Dynamic Patch Rotate Blocks (DPR-Blocks). In each DPR-Block, the fully connected layer is performed following a Patch Rotate Module (PRM) to exchange spatial information between pixels. Specifically, in PRM, the feature map is first split into the reserved part and rotated part along the channel dimension according to the predicted probability of the Dynamic Channel Selection Module (DCSM), and our proposed patch rotate operation is only performed on the rotated part. Extensive experiments on ADE20K, Cityscapes and COCO-Stuff 10K datasets prove the effectiveness of our approach. We expect that our PRSeg can promote the development of MLP-based decoder in semantic segmentation."
Multi-to-Single Knowledge Distillation for Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation,"3D point cloud semantic segmentation is one of the fundamental tasks for environmental understanding. Although significant progress has been made in recent years, the performance of classes with few examples or few points is still far from satisfactory. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-to-single knowledge distillation framework for the 3D point cloud semantic segmentation task to boost the performance of those hard classes. Instead of fusing all the points of multi-scans directly, only the instances that belong to the previously defined hard classes are fused. To effectively and sufficiently distill valuable knowledge from multi-scans, we leverage a multilevel distillation framework, i.e., feature representation distillation, logit distillation, and affinity distillation. We further develop a novel instance-aware affinity distillation algorithm for capturing high-level structural knowledge to enhance the distillation efficacy for hard classes. Finally, we conduct experiments on the SemanticKITTI dataset, and the results on both the validation and test sets demonstrate that our method yields substantial improvements compared with the baseline method. The code is available at \Url{https://github.com/skyshoumeng/M2SKD}."
Pre-processing training data improves accuracy and generalisability of convolutional neural network based landscape semantic segmentation,"In this paper, we trialled different methods of data preparation for Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) training and semantic segmentation of land use land cover (LULC) features within aerial photography over the Wet Tropics and Atherton Tablelands, Queensland, Australia. This was conducted through trialling and ranking various training patch selection sampling strategies, patch and batch sizes and data augmentations and scaling. We also compared model accuracy through producing the LULC classification using a single pass of a grid of patches and averaging multiple grid passes and three rotated version of each patch. Our results showed: a stratified random sampling approach for producing training patches improved the accuracy of classes with a smaller area while having minimal effect on larger classes; a smaller number of larger patches compared to a larger number of smaller patches improves model accuracy; applying data augmentations and scaling are imperative in creating a generalised model able to accurately classify LULC features in imagery from a different date and sensor; and producing the output classification by averaging multiple grids of patches and three rotated versions of each patch produced and more accurate and aesthetic result. Combining the findings from the trials, we fully trained five models on the 2018 training image and applied the model to the 2015 test image with the output LULC classifications achieving an average kappa of 0.84 user accuracy of 0.81 and producer accuracy of 0.87. This study has demonstrated the importance of data pre-processing for developing a generalised deep-learning model for LULC classification which can be applied to a different date and sensor. Future research using CNN and earth observation data should implement the findings of this study to increase LULC model accuracy and transferability."
Neural Field Conditioning Strategies for 2D Semantic Segmentation,"Neural fields are neural networks which map coordinates to a desired signal. When a neural field should jointly model multiple signals, and not memorize only one, it needs to be conditioned on a latent code which describes the signal at hand. Despite being an important aspect, there has been little research on conditioning strategies for neural fields. In this work, we explore the use of neural fields as decoders for 2D semantic segmentation. For this task, we compare three conditioning methods, simple concatenation of the latent code, Feature Wise Linear Modulation (FiLM), and Cross-Attention, in conjunction with latent codes which either describe the full image or only a local region of the image. Our results show a considerable difference in performance between the examined conditioning strategies. Furthermore, we show that conditioning via Cross-Attention achieves the best results and is competitive with a CNN-based decoder for semantic segmentation."
Human Semantic Segmentation using Millimeter-Wave Radar Sparse Point Clouds,"This paper presents a framework for semantic segmentation on sparse sequential point clouds of millimeter-wave radar. Compared with cameras and lidars, millimeter-wave radars have the advantage of not revealing privacy, having a strong anti-interference ability, and having long detection distance. The sparsity and capturing temporal-topological features of mmWave data is still a problem. However, the issue of capturing the temporal-topological coupling features under the human semantic segmentation task prevents previous advanced segmentation methods (e.g PointNet, PointCNN, Point Transformer) from being well utilized in practical scenarios. To address the challenge caused by the sparsity and temporal-topological feature of the data, we (i) introduce graph structure and topological features to the point cloud, (ii) propose a semantic segmentation framework including a global feature-extracting module and a sequential feature-extracting module. In addition, we design an efficient and more fitting loss function for a better training process and segmentation results based on graph clustering. Experimentally, we deploy representative semantic segmentation algorithms (Transformer, GCNN, etc.) on a custom dataset. Experimental results indicate that our model achieves mean accuracy on the custom dataset by \mathbf{82.31}\% and outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms. Moreover, to validate the model's robustness, we deploy our model on the well-known S3DIS dataset. On the S3DIS dataset, our model achieves mean accuracy by \mathbf{92.6}\%, outperforming baseline algorithms."
Domain Adaptive and Generalizable Network Architectures and Training Strategies for Semantic Image Segmentation,"Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) and domain generalization (DG) enable machine learning models trained on a source domain to perform well on unlabeled or even unseen target domains. As previous UDA&DG semantic segmentation methods are mostly based on outdated networks, we benchmark more recent architectures, reveal the potential of Transformers, and design the DAFormer network tailored for UDA&DG. It is enabled by three training strategies to avoid overfitting to the source domain: While (1) Rare Class Sampling mitigates the bias toward common source domain classes, (2) a Thing-Class ImageNet Feature Distance and (3) a learning rate warmup promote feature transfer from ImageNet pretraining. As UDA&DG are usually GPU memory intensive, most previous methods downscale or crop images. However, low-resolution predictions often fail to preserve fine details while models trained with cropped images fall short in capturing long-range, domain-robust context information. Therefore, we propose HRDA, a multi-resolution framework for UDA&DG, that combines the strengths of small high-resolution crops to preserve fine segmentation details and large low-resolution crops to capture long-range context dependencies with a learned scale attention. DAFormer and HRDA significantly improve the state-of-the-art UDA&DG by more than 10 mIoU on 5 different benchmarks. The implementation is available at https://github.com/lhoyer/HRDA."
Compensation Learning in Semantic Segmentation,"Label noise and ambiguities between similar classes are challenging problems in developing new models and annotating new data for semantic segmentation. In this paper, we propose Compensation Learning in Semantic Segmentation, a framework to identify and compensate ambiguities as well as label noise. More specifically, we add a ground truth depending and globally learned bias to the classification logits and introduce a novel uncertainty branch for neural networks to induce the compensation bias only to relevant regions. Our method is employed into state-of-the-art segmentation frameworks and several experiments demonstrate that our proposed compensation learns inter-class relations that allow global identification of challenging ambiguities as well as the exact localization of subsequent label noise. Additionally, it enlarges robustness against label noise during training and allows target-oriented manipulation during inference. We evaluate the proposed method on %the widely used datasets Cityscapes, KITTI-STEP, ADE20k, and COCO-stuff10k."
Exploiting CNNs for Semantic Segmentation with Pascal VOC,"In this paper, we present a comprehensive study on semantic segmentation with the Pascal VOC dataset. Here, we have to label each pixel with a class which in turn segments the entire image based on the objects/entities present. To tackle this, we firstly use a Fully Convolution Network (FCN) baseline which gave 71.31% pixel accuracy and 0.0527 mean IoU. We analyze its performance and working and subsequently address the issues in the baseline with three improvements: a) cosine annealing learning rate scheduler(pixel accuracy: 72.86%, IoU: 0.0529), b) data augmentation(pixel accuracy: 69.88%, IoU: 0.0585) c) class imbalance weights(pixel accuracy: 68.98%, IoU: 0.0596). Apart from these changes in training pipeline, we also explore three different architectures: a) Our proposed model -- Advanced FCN (pixel accuracy: 67.20%, IoU: 0.0602) b) Transfer Learning with ResNet (Best performance) (pixel accuracy: 71.33%, IoU: 0.0926 ) c) U-Net(pixel accuracy: 72.15%, IoU: 0.0649). We observe that the improvements help in greatly improving the performance, as reflected both, in metrics and segmentation maps. Interestingly, we observe that among the improvements, dataset augmentation has the greatest contribution. Also, note that transfer learning model performs the best on the pascal dataset. We analyse the performance of these using loss, accuracy and IoU plots along with segmentation maps, which help us draw valuable insights about the working of the models."
Augmentation-based Domain Generalization for Semantic Segmentation,"Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) and domain generalization (DG) are two research areas that aim to tackle the lack of generalization of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) towards unseen domains. While UDA methods have access to unlabeled target images, domain generalization does not involve any target data and only learns generalized features from a source domain. Image-style randomization or augmentation is a popular approach to improve network generalization without access to the target domain. Complex methods are often proposed that disregard the potential of simple image augmentations for out-of-domain generalization. For this reason, we systematically study the in- and out-of-domain generalization capabilities of simple, rule-based image augmentations like blur, noise, color jitter and many more. Based on a full factorial design of experiment design we provide a systematic statistical evaluation of augmentations and their interactions. Our analysis provides both, expected and unexpected, outcomes. Expected, because our experiments confirm the common scientific standard that combination of multiple different augmentations out-performs single augmentations. Unexpected, because combined augmentations perform competitive to state-of-the-art domain generalization approaches, while being significantly simpler and without training overhead. On the challenging synthetic-to-real domain shift between Synthia and Cityscapes we reach 39.5% mIoU compared to 40.9% mIoU of the best previous work. When additionally employing the recent vision transformer architecture DAFormer we outperform these benchmarks with a performance of 44.2% mIoU"
Survey on Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation for Visual Perception in Automated Driving,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) have proven their capabilities in many areas in the past years, such as robotics, or automated driving, enabling technological breakthroughs. DNNs play a significant role in environment perception for the challenging application of automated driving and are employed for tasks such as detection, semantic segmentation, and sensor fusion. Despite this progress and tremendous research efforts, several issues still need to be addressed that limit the applicability of DNNs in automated driving. The bad generalization of DNNs to new, unseen domains is a major problem on the way to a safe, large-scale application, because manual annotation of new domains is costly, particularly for semantic segmentation. For this reason, methods are required to adapt DNNs to new domains without labeling effort. The task, which these methods aim to solve is termed unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). While several different domain shifts can challenge DNNs, the shift between synthetic and real data is of particular importance for automated driving, as it allows the use of simulation environments for DNN training. In this work, we present an overview of the current state of the art in this field of research. We categorize and explain the different approaches for UDA. The number of considered publications is larger than any other survey on this topic. The scope of this survey goes far beyond the description of the UDA state-of-the-art. Based on our large data and knowledge base, we present a quantitative comparison of the approaches and use the observations to point out the latest trends in this field. In the following, we conduct a critical analysis of the state-of-the-art and highlight promising future research directions. With this survey, we aim to facilitate UDA research further and encourage scientists to exploit novel research directions to generalize DNNs better."
Accurate and Efficient Event-based Semantic Segmentation Using Adaptive Spiking Encoder-Decoder Network,"Low-power event-driven computation and inherent temporal dynamics render spiking neural networks (SNNs) ideal candidates for processing highly dynamic and asynchronous signals from event-based sensors. However, due to the challenges in training and architectural design constraints, there is a scarcity of competitive demonstrations of SNNs in event-based dense prediction compared to artificial neural networks (ANNs). In this work, we construct an efficient spiking encoder-decoder network for large-scale event-based semantic segmentation tasks, optimizing the encoder with hierarchical search. To improve learning from highly dynamic event streams, we exploit the intrinsic adaptive threshold of spiking neurons to modulate network activation. Additionally, we develop a dual-path spiking spatially-adaptive modulation (SSAM) block to enhance the representation of sparse events, significantly improving network performance. Our network achieves 72.57% mean intersection over union (MIoU) on the DDD17 dataset and 57.22% MIoU on the newly proposed larger DSEC-Semantic dataset, surpassing current record ANNs by 4% while utilizing much lower computation costs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance of SNNs outperforming ANNs in challenging event-based semantic segmentation tasks, demonstrating their immense potential in event-based vision.

You Never Get a Second Chance To Make a Good First Impression: Seeding Active Learning for 3D Semantic Segmentation,"We propose SeedAL, a method to seed active learning for efficient annotation of 3D point clouds for semantic segmentation. Active Learning (AL) iteratively selects relevant data fractions to annotate within a given budget, but requires a first fraction of the dataset (a 'seed') to be already annotated to estimate the benefit of annotating other data fractions. We first show that the choice of the seed can significantly affect the performance of many AL methods. We then propose a method for automatically constructing a seed that will ensure good performance for AL. Assuming that images of the point clouds are available, which is common, our method relies on powerful unsupervised image features to measure the diversity of the point clouds. It selects the point clouds for the seed by optimizing the diversity under an annotation budget, which can be done by solving a linear optimization problem. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared to random seeding and existing methods on both the S3DIS and SemanticKitti datasets. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/nerminsamet/seedal}."
Walking Your LiDOG: A Journey Through Multiple Domains for LiDAR Semantic Segmentation,"The ability to deploy robots that can operate safely in diverse environments is crucial for developing embodied intelligent agents. As a community, we have made tremendous progress in within-domain LiDAR semantic segmentation. However, do these methods generalize across domains? To answer this question, we design the first experimental setup for studying domain generalization (DG) for LiDAR semantic segmentation (DG-LSS). Our results confirm a significant gap between methods, evaluated in a cross-domain setting: for example, a model trained on the source dataset (SemanticKITTI) obtains 26.53 mIoU on the target data, compared to 48.49 mIoU obtained by the model trained on the target domain (nuScenes). To tackle this gap, we propose the first method specifically designed for DG-LSS, which obtains 34.88 mIoU on the target domain, outperforming all baselines. Our method augments a sparse-convolutional encoder-decoder 3D segmentation network with an additional, dense 2D convolutional decoder that learns to classify a birds-eye view of the point cloud. This simple auxiliary task encourages the 3D network to learn features that are robust to sensor placement shifts and resolution, and are transferable across domains. With this work, we aim to inspire the community to develop and evaluate future models in such cross-domain conditions."
Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation With Region Relevance,"Semi-supervised semantic segmentation aims to learn from a small amount of labeled data and plenty of unlabeled ones for the segmentation task. The most common approach is to generate pseudo-labels for unlabeled images to augment the training data. However, the noisy pseudo-labels will lead to cumulative classification errors and aggravate the local inconsistency in prediction. This paper proposes a Region Relevance Network (RRN) to alleviate the problem mentioned above. Specifically, we first introduce a local pseudo-label filtering module that leverages discriminator networks to assess the accuracy of the pseudo-label at the region level. A local selection loss is proposed to mitigate the negative impact of wrong pseudo-labels in consistency regularization training. In addition, we propose a dynamic region-loss correction module, which takes the merit of network diversity to further rate the reliability of pseudo-labels and correct the convergence direction of the segmentation network with a dynamic region loss. Extensive experiments are conducted on PASCAL VOC 2012 and Cityscapes datasets with varying amounts of labeled data, demonstrating that our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to current counterparts."
SACANet: scene-aware class attention network for semantic segmentation of remote sensing images,"Spatial attention mechanism has been widely used in semantic segmentation of remote sensing images given its capability to model long-range dependencies. Many methods adopting spatial attention mechanism aggregate contextual information using direct relationships between pixels within an image, while ignoring the scene awareness of pixels (i.e., being aware of the global context of the scene where the pixels are located and perceiving their relative positions). Given the observation that scene awareness benefits context modeling with spatial correlations of ground objects, we design a scene-aware attention module based on a refined spatial attention mechanism embedding scene awareness. Besides, we present a local-global class attention mechanism to address the problem that general attention mechanism introduces excessive background noises while hardly considering the large intra-class variance in remote sensing images. In this paper, we integrate both scene-aware and class attentions to propose a scene-aware class attention network (SACANet) for semantic segmentation of remote sensing images. Experimental results on three datasets show that SACANet outperforms other state-of-the-art methods and validate its effectiveness. Code is available at https://github.com/xwmaxwma/rssegmentation."
Knowledge Distillation from 3D to Bird's-Eye-View for LiDAR Semantic Segmentation,"LiDAR point cloud segmentation is one of the most fundamental tasks for autonomous driving scene understanding. However, it is difficult for existing models to achieve both high inference speed and accuracy simultaneously. For example, voxel-based methods perform well in accuracy, while Bird's-Eye-View (BEV)-based methods can achieve real-time inference. To overcome this issue, we develop an effective 3D-to-BEV knowledge distillation method that transfers rich knowledge from 3D voxel-based models to BEV-based models. Our framework mainly consists of two modules: the voxel-to-pillar distillation module and the label-weight distillation module. Voxel-to-pillar distillation distills sparse 3D features to BEV features for middle layers to make the BEV-based model aware of more structural and geometric information. Label-weight distillation helps the model pay more attention to regions with more height information. Finally, we conduct experiments on the SemanticKITTI dataset and Paris-Lille-3D. The results on SemanticKITTI show more than 5% improvement on the test set, especially for classes such as motorcycle and person, with more than 15% improvement. The code can be accessed at https://github.com/fengjiang5/Knowledge-Distillation-from-Cylinder3D-to-PolarNet."
SSS3D: Fast Neural Architecture Search For Efficient Three-Dimensional Semantic Segmentation,"We present SSS3D, a fast multi-objective NAS framework designed to find computationally efficient 3D semantic scene segmentation networks. It uses RandLA-Net, an off-the-shelf point-based network, as a super-network to enable weight sharing and reduce search time by 99.67% for single-stage searches. SSS3D has a complex search space composed of sampling and architectural parameters that can form 2.88 * 10^17 possible networks. To further reduce search time, SSS3D splits the complete search space and introduces a two-stage search that finds optimal subnetworks in 54% of the time required by single-stage searches."
Missing Modality Robustness in Semi-Supervised Multi-Modal Semantic Segmentation,"Using multiple spatial modalities has been proven helpful in improving semantic segmentation performance. However, there are several real-world challenges that have yet to be addressed: (a) improving label efficiency and (b) enhancing robustness in realistic scenarios where modalities are missing at the test time. To address these challenges, we first propose a simple yet efficient multi-modal fusion mechanism Linear Fusion, that performs better than the state-of-the-art multi-modal models even with limited supervision. Second, we propose M3L: Multi-modal Teacher for Masked Modality Learning, a semi-supervised framework that not only improves the multi-modal performance but also makes the model robust to the realistic missing modality scenario using unlabeled data. We create the first benchmark for semi-supervised multi-modal semantic segmentation and also report the robustness to missing modalities. Our proposal shows an absolute improvement of up to 10% on robust mIoU above the most competitive baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/harshm121/M3L"
Text2Seg: Remote Sensing Image Semantic Segmentation via Text-Guided Visual Foundation Models,"Recent advancements in foundation models (FMs), such as GPT-4 and LLaMA, have attracted significant attention due to their exceptional performance in zero-shot learning scenarios. Similarly, in the field of visual learning, models like Grounding DINO and the Segment Anything Model (SAM) have exhibited remarkable progress in open-set detection and instance segmentation tasks. It is undeniable that these FMs will profoundly impact a wide range of real-world visual learning tasks, ushering in a new paradigm shift for developing such models. In this study, we concentrate on the remote sensing domain, where the images are notably dissimilar from those in conventional scenarios. We developed a pipeline that leverages multiple FMs to facilitate remote sensing image semantic segmentation tasks guided by text prompt, which we denote as Text2Seg. The pipeline is benchmarked on several widely-used remote sensing datasets, and we present preliminary results to demonstrate its effectiveness. Through this work, we aim to provide insights into maximizing the applicability of visual FMs in specific contexts with minimal model tuning. The code is available at https://github.com/Douglas2Code/Text2Seg."
Radar-Camera Fusion for Object Detection and Semantic Segmentation in Autonomous Driving: A Comprehensive Review,"Driven by deep learning techniques, perception technology in autonomous driving has developed rapidly in recent years. To achieve accurate and robust perception capabilities, autonomous vehicles are often equipped with multiple sensors, making sensor fusion a crucial part of the perception system. Among these fused sensors, radars and cameras enable a complementary and cost-effective perception of the surrounding environment regardless of lighting and weather conditions. This review aims to provide a comprehensive guideline for radar-camera fusion, particularly concentrating on perception tasks related to object detection and semantic segmentation. Based on the principles of the radar and camera sensors, we delve into the data processing process and representations, followed by an in-depth analysis and summary of radar-camera fusion datasets. In the review of methodologies in radar-camera fusion, we address interrogative questions, including ""why to fuse"", ""what to fuse"", ""where to fuse"", ""when to fuse"", and ""how to fuse"", subsequently discussing various challenges and potential research directions within this domain. To ease the retrieval and comparison of datasets and fusion methods, we also provide an interactive website: https://XJTLU-VEC.github.io/Radar-Camera-Fusion."
Ensembling Instance and Semantic Segmentation for Panoptic Segmentation,"We demonstrate our solution for the 2019 COCO panoptic segmentation task. Our method first performs instance segmentation and semantic segmentation separately, then combines the two to generate panoptic segmentation results. To enhance the performance, we add several expert models of Mask R-CNN in instance segmentation to tackle the data imbalance problem in the training data; also HTC model is adopted yielding our best instance segmentation results. In semantic segmentation, we trained several models with various backbones and use an ensemble strategy which further boosts the segmentation results. In the end, we analyze various combinations of instance and semantic segmentation, and report on their performance for the final panoptic segmentation results. Our best model achieves PQ 47.1 on 2019 COCO panoptic test-dev data."
MARS: Model-agnostic Biased Object Removal without Additional Supervision for Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Weakly-supervised semantic segmentation aims to reduce labeling costs by training semantic segmentation models using weak supervision, such as image-level class labels. However, most approaches struggle to produce accurate localization maps and suffer from false predictions in class-related backgrounds (i.e., biased objects), such as detecting a railroad with the train class. Recent methods that remove biased objects require additional supervision for manually identifying biased objects for each problematic class and collecting their datasets by reviewing predictions, limiting their applicability to the real-world dataset with multiple labels and complex relationships for biasing. Following the first observation that biased features can be separated and eliminated by matching biased objects with backgrounds in the same dataset, we propose a fully-automatic/model-agnostic biased removal framework called MARS (Model-Agnostic biased object Removal without additional Supervision), which utilizes semantically consistent features of an unsupervised technique to eliminate biased objects in pseudo labels. Surprisingly, we show that MARS achieves new state-of-the-art results on two popular benchmarks, PASCAL VOC 2012 (val: 77.7%, test: 77.2%) and MS COCO 2014 (val: 49.4%), by consistently improving the performance of various WSSS models by at least 30% without additional supervision."
Boosting Semantic Segmentation with Semantic Boundaries,"In this paper, we present the Semantic Boundary Conditioned Backbone (SBCB) framework, a simple yet effective training framework that is model-agnostic and boosts segmentation performance, especially around the boundaries. Motivated by the recent development in improving semantic segmentation by incorporating boundaries as auxiliary tasks, we propose a multi-task framework that uses semantic boundary detection (SBD) as an auxiliary task. The SBCB framework utilizes the nature of the SBD task, which is complementary to semantic segmentation, to improve the backbone of the segmentation head. We apply an SBD head that exploits the multi-scale features from the backbone, where the model learns low-level features in the earlier stages, and high-level semantic understanding in the later stages. This head perfectly complements the common semantic segmentation architectures where the features from the later stages are used for classification. We can improve semantic segmentation models without additional parameters during inference by only conditioning the backbone. Through extensive evaluations, we show the effectiveness of the SBCB framework by improving various popular segmentation heads and backbones by 0.5% ~ 3.0% IoU on the Cityscapes dataset and gains 1.6% ~ 4.1% in boundary Fscores. We also apply this framework on customized backbones and the emerging vision transformer models and show the effectiveness of the SBCB framework."
Adaptive Stylization Modulation for Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation,"Obtaining sufficient labelled data for model training is impractical for most real-life applications. Therefore, we address the problem of domain generalization for semantic segmentation tasks to reduce the need to acquire and label additional data. Recent work on domain generalization increase data diversity by varying domain-variant features such as colour, style and texture in images. However, excessive stylization or even uniform stylization may reduce performance. Performance reduction is especially pronounced for pixels from minority classes, which are already more challenging to classify compared to pixels from majority classes. Therefore, we introduce a module, ASH_{+}, that modulates stylization strength for each pixel depending on the pixel's semantic content. In this work, we also introduce a parameter that balances the element-wise and channel-wise proportion of stylized features with the original source domain features in the stylized source domain images. This learned parameter replaces an empirically determined global hyperparameter, allowing for more fine-grained control over the output stylized image. We conduct multiple experiments to validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Finally, we evaluate our model on the publicly available benchmark semantic segmentation datasets (Cityscapes and SYNTHIA). Quantitative and qualitative comparisons indicate that our approach is competitive with state-of-the-art. Code is made available at \url{https://github.com/placeholder}"
Coupling Global Context and Local Contents for Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Thanks to the advantages of the friendly annotations and the satisfactory performance, Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) approaches have been extensively studied. Recently, the single-stage WSSS was awakened to alleviate problems of the expensive computational costs and the complicated training procedures in multi-stage WSSS. However, results of such an immature model suffer from problems of background incompleteness and object incompleteness. We empirically find that they are caused by the insufficiency of the global object context and the lack of the local regional contents, respectively. Under these observations, we propose a single-stage WSSS model with only the image-level class label supervisions, termed as Weakly Supervised Feature Coupling Network (WS-FCN), which can capture the multi-scale context formed from the adjacent feature grids, and encode the fine-grained spatial information from the low-level features into the high-level ones. Specifically, a flexible context aggregation module is proposed to capture the global object context in different granular spaces. Besides, a semantically consistent feature fusion module is proposed in a bottom-up parameter-learnable fashion to aggregate the fine-grained local contents. Based on these two modules, WS-FCN lies in a self-supervised end-to-end training fashion. Extensive experimental results on the challenging PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of WS-FCN, which can achieve state-of-the-art results by 65.02\% and 64.22\% mIoU on PASCAL VOC 2012 val set and test set, 34.12\% mIoU on MS COCO 2014 val set, respectively. The code and weight have been released at:https://github.com/ChunyanWang1/ws-fcn."
Autonomous Navigation in Rows of Trees and High Crops with Deep Semantic Segmentation,"Segmentation-based autonomous navigation has recently been proposed as a promising methodology to guide robotic platforms through crop rows without requiring precise GPS localization. However, existing methods are limited to scenarios where the centre of the row can be identified thanks to the sharp distinction between the plants and the sky. However, GPS signal obstruction mainly occurs in the case of tall, dense vegetation, such as high tree rows and orchards. In this work, we extend the segmentation-based robotic guidance to those scenarios where canopies and branches occlude the sky and hinder the usage of GPS and previous methods, increasing the overall robustness and adaptability of the control algorithm. Extensive experimentation on several realistic simulated tree fields and vineyards demonstrates the competitive advantages of the proposed solution."
Unsupervised Semantic Segmentation of 3D Point Clouds via Cross-modal Distillation and Super-Voxel Clustering,"Semantic segmentation of point clouds usually requires exhausting efforts of human annotations, hence it attracts wide attention to the challenging topic of learning from unlabeled or weaker forms of annotations. In this paper, we take the first attempt for fully unsupervised semantic segmentation of point clouds, which aims to delineate semantically meaningful objects without any form of annotations. Previous works of unsupervised pipeline on 2D images fails in this task of point clouds, due to: 1) Clustering Ambiguity caused by limited magnitude of data and imbalanced class distribution; 2) Irregularity Ambiguity caused by the irregular sparsity of point cloud. Therefore, we propose a novel framework, PointDC, which is comprised of two steps that handle the aforementioned problems respectively: Cross-Modal Distillation (CMD) and Super-Voxel Clustering (SVC). In the first stage of CMD, multi-view visual features are back-projected to the 3D space and aggregated to a unified point feature to distill the training of the point representation. In the second stage of SVC, the point features are aggregated to super-voxels and then fed to the iterative clustering process for excavating semantic classes. PointDC yields a significant improvement over the prior state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, on both the ScanNet-v2 (+18.4 mIoU) and S3DIS (+11.5 mIoU) semantic segmentation benchmarks."
Motion-state Alignment for Video Semantic Segmentation,"In recent years, video semantic segmentation has made great progress with advanced deep neural networks. However, there still exist two main challenges \ie, information inconsistency and computation cost. To deal with the two difficulties, we propose a novel motion-state alignment framework for video semantic segmentation to keep both motion and state consistency. In the framework, we first construct a motion alignment branch armed with an efficient decoupled transformer to capture dynamic semantics, guaranteeing region-level temporal consistency. Then, a state alignment branch composed of a stage transformer is designed to enrich feature spaces for the current frame to extract static semantics and achieve pixel-level state consistency. Next, by a semantic assignment mechanism, the region descriptor of each semantic category is gained from dynamic semantics and linked with pixel descriptors from static semantics. Benefiting from the alignment of these two kinds of effective information, the proposed method picks up dynamic and static semantics in a targeted way, so that video semantic regions are consistently segmented to obtain precise locations with low computational complexity. Extensive experiments on Cityscapes and CamVid datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods and validates the effectiveness of the motion-state alignment framework."
Delving into Shape-aware Zero-shot Semantic Segmentation,"Thanks to the impressive progress of large-scale vision-language pretraining, recent recognition models can classify arbitrary objects in a zero-shot and open-set manner, with a surprisingly high accuracy. However, translating this success to semantic segmentation is not trivial, because this dense prediction task requires not only accurate semantic understanding but also fine shape delineation and existing vision-language models are trained with image-level language descriptions. To bridge this gap, we pursue \textbf{shape-aware} zero-shot semantic segmentation in this study. Inspired by classical spectral methods in the image segmentation literature, we propose to leverage the eigen vectors of Laplacian matrices constructed with self-supervised pixel-wise features to promote shape-awareness. Despite that this simple and effective technique does not make use of the masks of seen classes at all, we demonstrate that it out-performs a state-of-the-art shape-aware formulation that aligns ground truth and predicted edges during training. We also delve into the performance gains achieved on different datasets using different backbones and draw several interesting and conclusive observations: the benefits of promoting shape-awareness highly relates to mask compactness and language embedding locality. Finally, our method sets new state-of-the-art performance for zero-shot semantic segmentation on both Pascal and COCO, with significant margins. Code and models will be accessed at https://github.com/Liuxinyv/SAZS."
TagCLIP: Improving Discrimination Ability of Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation,"Recent success of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training~(CLIP) has shown great promise in pixel-level open-vocabulary learning tasks. A general paradigm utilizes CLIP's text and patch embeddings to generate semantic masks. However, existing models easily misidentify input pixels from unseen classes, thus confusing novel classes with semantically-similar ones. In our work, we disentangle the ill-posed optimization problem into two parallel processes: one performs semantic matching individually, and the other judges reliability for improving discrimination ability. Motivated by special tokens in language modeling that represents sentence-level embeddings, we design a trusty token that decouples the known and novel category prediction tendency. With almost no extra overhead, we upgrade the pixel-level generalization capacity of existing models effectively. Our TagCLIP (CLIP adapting with Trusty-guidance) boosts the IoU of unseen classes by 7.4% and 1.7% on PASCAL VOC 2012 and COCO-Stuff 164K."
Region-Enhanced Feature Learning for Scene Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation in complex scenes not only relies on local object appearance but also on object locations and the surrounding environment. Nonetheless, it is difficult to model long-range context in the format of pairwise point correlations due to its huge computational cost for large-scale point clouds. In this paper, we propose to use regions as the intermediate representation of point clouds instead of fine-grained points or voxels to reduce the computational burden. We introduce a novel Region-Enhanced Feature Learning network (REFL-Net) that leverages region correlations to enhance the features of ambiguous points. We design a Region-based Feature Enhancement module (RFE) which consists of a Semantic-Spatial Region Extraction (SSRE) stage and a Region Dependency Modeling (RDM) stage. In the SSRE stage, we group the input points into a set of regions according to the point distances in both semantic and spatial space. In the RDM part, we explore region-wise semantic and spatial relationships via a self-attention block on region features and fuse point features with the region features to obtain more discriminative representations. Our proposed RFE module is a plug-and-play module that can be integrated with common semantic segmentation backbones. We conduct extensive experiments on ScanNetv2 and S3DIS datasets, and evaluate our RFE module with different segmentation backbones. Our REFL-Net achieves 1.8% mIoU gain on ScanNetv2 and 1.0% mIoU gain on S3DIS respectively with negligible computational cost compared to the backbone networks. Both quantitative and qualitative results show the powerful long-range context modeling ability and strong generalization ability of our REFL-Net."
CoMaL: Conditional Maximum Likelihood Approach to Self-supervised Domain Adaptation in Long-tail Semantic Segmentation,"The research in self-supervised domain adaptation in semantic segmentation has recently received considerable attention. Although GAN-based methods have become one of the most popular approaches to domain adaptation, they have suffered from some limitations. They are insufficient to model both global and local structures of a given image, especially in small regions of tail classes. Moreover, they perform bad on the tail classes containing limited number of pixels or less training samples. In order to address these issues, we present a new self-supervised domain adaptation approach to tackle long-tail semantic segmentation in this paper. Firstly, a new metric is introduced to formulate long-tail domain adaptation in the segmentation problem. Secondly, a new Conditional Maximum Likelihood (CoMaL) approach in an autoregressive framework is presented to solve the problem of long-tail domain adaptation. Although other segmentation methods work under the pixel independence assumption, the long-tailed pixel distributions in CoMaL are generally solved in the context of structural dependency, as that is more realistic. Finally, the proposed method is evaluated on popular large-scale semantic segmentation benchmarks, i.e., ""SYNTHIA to Cityscapes"" and ""GTA to Cityscapes"", and outperforms the prior methods by a large margin in both the standard and the proposed evaluation protocols."
Uncovering the Inner Workings of STEGO for Safe Unsupervised Semantic Segmentation,"Self-supervised pre-training strategies have recently shown impressive results for training general-purpose feature extraction backbones in computer vision. In combination with the Vision Transformer architecture, the DINO self-distillation technique has interesting emerging properties, such as unsupervised clustering in the latent space and semantic correspondences of the produced features without using explicit human-annotated labels. The STEGO method for unsupervised semantic segmentation contrastively distills feature correspondences of a DINO-pre-trained Vision Transformer and recently set a new state of the art. However, the detailed workings of STEGO have yet to be disentangled, preventing its usage in safety-critical applications. This paper provides a deeper understanding of the STEGO architecture and training strategy by conducting studies that uncover the working mechanisms behind STEGO, reproduce and extend its experimental validation, and investigate the ability of STEGO to transfer to different datasets. Results demonstrate that the STEGO architecture can be interpreted as a semantics-preserving dimensionality reduction technique."
MVP-SEG: Multi-View Prompt Learning for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation,"CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) is well-developed for open-vocabulary zero-shot image-level recognition, while its applications in pixel-level tasks are less investigated, where most efforts directly adopt CLIP features without deliberative adaptations. In this work, we first demonstrate the necessity of image-pixel CLIP feature adaption, then provide Multi-View Prompt learning (MVP-SEG) as an effective solution to achieve image-pixel adaptation and to solve open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. Concretely, MVP-SEG deliberately learns multiple prompts trained by our Orthogonal Constraint Loss (OCLoss), by which each prompt is supervised to exploit CLIP feature on different object parts, and collaborative segmentation masks generated by all prompts promote better segmentation. Moreover, MVP-SEG introduces Global Prompt Refining (GPR) to further eliminate class-wise segmentation noise. Experiments show that the multi-view prompts learned from seen categories have strong generalization to unseen categories, and MVP-SEG+ which combines the knowledge transfer stage significantly outperforms previous methods on several benchmarks. Moreover, qualitative results justify that MVP-SEG does lead to better focus on different local parts."
[CLS] Token is All You Need for Zero-Shot Semantic Segmentation,"In this paper, we propose an embarrassingly simple yet highly effective zero-shot semantic segmentation (ZS3) method, based on the pre-trained vision-language model CLIP. First, our study provides a couple of key discoveries: (i) the global tokens (a.k.a [CLS] tokens in Transformer) of the text branch in CLIP provide a powerful representation of semantic information and (ii) these text-side [CLS] tokens can be regarded as category priors to guide CLIP visual encoder pay more attention on the corresponding region of interest. Based on that, we build upon the CLIP model as a backbone which we extend with a One-Way [CLS] token navigation from text to the visual branch that enables zero-shot dense prediction, dubbed \textbf{ClsCLIP}. Specifically, we use the [CLS] token output from the text branch, as an auxiliary semantic prompt, to replace the [CLS] token in shallow layers of the ViT-based visual encoder. This one-way navigation embeds such global category prior earlier and thus promotes semantic segmentation. Furthermore, to better segment tiny objects in ZS3, we further enhance ClsCLIP with a local zoom-in strategy, which employs a region proposal pre-processing and we get ClsCLIP+. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed ZS3 method achieves a SOTA performance, and it is even comparable with those few-shot semantic segmentation methods."
Few Shot Semantic Segmentation: a review of methodologies and open challenges,"Semantic segmentation assigns category labels to each pixel in an image, enabling breakthroughs in fields such as autonomous driving and robotics. Deep Neural Networks have achieved high accuracies in semantic segmentation but require large training datasets. Some domains have difficulties building such datasets due to rarity, privacy concerns, and the need for skilled annotators. Few-Shot Learning (FSL) has emerged as a new research stream that allows models to learn new tasks from a few samples. This contribution provides an overview of FSL in semantic segmentation (FSS), proposes a new taxonomy, and describes current limitations and outlooks."
PP-MobileSeg: Explore the Fast and Accurate Semantic Segmentation Model on Mobile Devices,"The success of transformers in computer vision has led to several attempts to adapt them for mobile devices, but their performance remains unsatisfactory in some real-world applications. To address this issue, we propose PP-MobileSeg, a semantic segmentation model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on mobile devices. PP-MobileSeg comprises three novel parts: the StrideFormer backbone, the Aggregated Attention Module (AAM), and the Valid Interpolate Module (VIM). The four-stage StrideFormer backbone is built with MV3 blocks and strided SEA attention, and it is able to extract rich semantic and detailed features with minimal parameter overhead. The AAM first filters the detailed features through semantic feature ensemble voting and then combines them with semantic features to enhance the semantic information. Furthermore, we proposed VIM to upsample the downsampled feature to the resolution of the input image. It significantly reduces model latency by only interpolating classes present in the final prediction, which is the most significant contributor to overall model latency. Extensive experiments show that PP-MobileSeg achieves a superior tradeoff between accuracy, model size, and latency compared to other methods. On the ADE20K dataset, PP-MobileSeg achieves 1.57% higher accuracy in mIoU than SeaFormer-Base with 32.9% fewer parameters and 42.3% faster acceleration on Qualcomm Snapdragon 855. Source codes are available at https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleSeg/tree/release/2.8."
Continual Semantic Segmentation with Automatic Memory Sample Selection,"Continual Semantic Segmentation (CSS) extends static semantic segmentation by incrementally introducing new classes for training. To alleviate the catastrophic forgetting issue in CSS, a memory buffer that stores a small number of samples from the previous classes is constructed for replay. However, existing methods select the memory samples either randomly or based on a single-factor-driven handcrafted strategy, which has no guarantee to be optimal. In this work, we propose a novel memory sample selection mechanism that selects informative samples for effective replay in a fully automatic way by considering comprehensive factors including sample diversity and class performance. Our mechanism regards the selection operation as a decision-making process and learns an optimal selection policy that directly maximizes the validation performance on a reward set. To facilitate the selection decision, we design a novel state representation and a dual-stage action space. Our extensive experiments on Pascal-VOC 2012 and ADE 20K datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance achieved, outperforming the second-place one by 12.54% for the 6stage setting on Pascal-VOC 2012."
SATR: Zero-Shot Semantic Segmentation of 3D Shapes,"We explore the task of zero-shot semantic segmentation of 3D shapes by using large-scale off-the-shelf 2D image recognition models. Surprisingly, we find that modern zero-shot 2D object detectors are better suited for this task than contemporary text/image similarity predictors or even zero-shot 2D segmentation networks. Our key finding is that it is possible to extract accurate 3D segmentation maps from multi-view bounding box predictions by using the topological properties of the underlying surface. For this, we develop the Segmentation Assignment with Topological Reweighting (SATR) algorithm and evaluate it on two challenging benchmarks: FAUST and ShapeNetPart. On these datasets, SATR achieves state-of-the-art performance and outperforms prior work by at least 22\% on average in terms of mIoU. Our source code and data will be publicly released. Project webpage: https://samir55.github.io/SATR/"
Federated Incremental Semantic Segmentation,"Federated learning-based semantic segmentation (FSS) has drawn widespread attention via decentralized training on local clients. However, most FSS models assume categories are fixed in advance, thus heavily undergoing forgetting on old categories in practical applications where local clients receive new categories incrementally while have no memory storage to access old classes. Moreover, new clients collecting novel classes may join in the global training of FSS, which further exacerbates catastrophic forgetting. To surmount the above challenges, we propose a Forgetting-Balanced Learning (FBL) model to address heterogeneous forgetting on old classes from both intra-client and inter-client aspects. Specifically, under the guidance of pseudo labels generated via adaptive class-balanced pseudo labeling, we develop a forgetting-balanced semantic compensation loss and a forgetting-balanced relation consistency loss to rectify intra-client heterogeneous forgetting of old categories with background shift. It performs balanced gradient propagation and relation consistency distillation within local clients. Moreover, to tackle heterogeneous forgetting from inter-client aspect, we propose a task transition monitor. It can identify new classes under privacy protection and store the latest old global model for relation distillation. Qualitative experiments reveal large improvement of our model against comparison methods. The code is available at https://github.com/JiahuaDong/FISS."
Agronav: Autonomous Navigation Framework for Agricultural Robots and Vehicles using Semantic Segmentation and Semantic Line Detection,"The successful implementation of vision-based navigation in agricultural fields hinges upon two critical components: 1) the accurate identification of key components within the scene, and 2) the identification of lanes through the detection of boundary lines that separate the crops from the traversable ground. We propose Agronav, an end-to-end vision-based autonomous navigation framework, which outputs the centerline from the input image by sequentially processing it through semantic segmentation and semantic line detection models. We also present Agroscapes, a pixel-level annotated dataset collected across six different crops, captured from varying heights and angles. This ensures that the framework trained on Agroscapes is generalizable across both ground and aerial robotic platforms. Codes, models and dataset will be released at \href{https://github.com/shivamkumarpanda/agronav}{github.com/shivamkumarpanda/agronav}."
Continual Learning for LiDAR Semantic Segmentation: Class-Incremental and Coarse-to-Fine strategies on Sparse Data,"During the last few years, continual learning (CL) strategies for image classification and segmentation have been widely investigated designing innovative solutions to tackle catastrophic forgetting, like knowledge distillation and self-inpainting. However, the application of continual learning paradigms to point clouds is still unexplored and investigation is required, especially using architectures that capture the sparsity and uneven distribution of LiDAR data. The current paper analyzes the problem of class incremental learning applied to point cloud semantic segmentation, comparing approaches and state-of-the-art architectures. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of class-incremental continual learning for LiDAR point cloud semantic segmentation. Different CL strategies were adapted to LiDAR point clouds and tested, tackling both classic fine-tuning scenarios and the Coarse-to-Fine learning paradigm. The framework has been evaluated through two different architectures on SemanticKITTI, obtaining results in line with state-of-the-art CL strategies and standard offline learning."
A Cross-Scale Hierarchical Transformer with Correspondence-Augmented Attention for inferring Bird's-Eye-View Semantic Segmentation,"As bird's-eye-view (BEV) semantic segmentation is simple-to-visualize and easy-to-handle, it has been applied in autonomous driving to provide the surrounding information to downstream tasks. Inferring BEV semantic segmentation conditioned on multi-camera-view images is a popular scheme in the community as cheap devices and real-time processing. The recent work implemented this task by learning the content and position relationship via the vision Transformer (ViT). However, the quadratic complexity of ViT confines the relationship learning only in the latent layer, leaving the scale gap to impede the representation of fine-grained objects. And their plain fusion method of multi-view features does not conform to the information absorption intention in representing BEV features. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel cross-scale hierarchical Transformer with correspondence-augmented attention for semantic segmentation inferring. Specifically, we devise a hierarchical framework to refine the BEV feature representation, where the last size is only half of the final segmentation. To save the computation increase caused by this hierarchical framework, we exploit the cross-scale Transformer to learn feature relationships in a reversed-aligning way, and leverage the residual connection of BEV features to facilitate information transmission between scales. We propose correspondence-augmented attention to distinguish conducive and inconducive correspondences. It is implemented in a simple yet effective way, amplifying attention scores before the Softmax operation, so that the position-view-related and the position-view-disrelated attention scores are highlighted and suppressed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method has state-of-the-art performance in inferring BEV semantic segmentation conditioned on multi-camera-view images."
Exploiting the Complementarity of 2D and 3D Networks to Address Domain-Shift in 3D Semantic Segmentation,"3D semantic segmentation is a critical task in many real-world applications, such as autonomous driving, robotics, and mixed reality. However, the task is extremely challenging due to ambiguities coming from the unstructured, sparse, and uncolored nature of the 3D point clouds. A possible solution is to combine the 3D information with others coming from sensors featuring a different modality, such as RGB cameras. Recent multi-modal 3D semantic segmentation networks exploit these modalities relying on two branches that process the 2D and 3D information independently, striving to maintain the strength of each modality. In this work, we first explain why this design choice is effective and then show how it can be improved to make the multi-modal semantic segmentation more robust to domain shift. Our surprisingly simple contribution achieves state-of-the-art performances on four popular multi-modal unsupervised domain adaptation benchmarks, as well as better results in a domain generalization scenario."
A Closer Look at Audio-Visual Semantic Segmentation,"Audio-visual segmentation (AVS) is a complex task that involves accurately segmenting the corresponding sounding object based on audio-visual queries. Successful audio-visual learning requires two essential components: 1) an unbiased dataset with high-quality pixel-level multi-class labels, and 2) a model capable of effectively linking audio information with its corresponding visual object. However, these two requirements are only partially addressed by current methods, with training sets containing biased audio-visual data, and models that generalise poorly beyond this biased training set. In this work, we propose a new strategy to build cost-effective and relatively unbiased audio-visual semantic segmentation benchmarks. Our strategy, called Visual Post-production (VPO), explores the observation that it is not necessary to have explicit audio-visual pairs extracted from single video sources to build such benchmarks. We also refine the previously proposed AVSBench to transform it into the audio-visual semantic segmentation benchmark AVSBench-Single+. Furthermore, this paper introduces a new pixel-wise audio-visual contrastive learning method to enable a better generalisation of the model beyond the training set. We verify the validity of the VPO strategy by showing that state-of-the-art (SOTA) models trained with datasets built by matching audio and visual data from different sources or with datasets containing audio and visual data from the same video source produce almost the same accuracy. Then, using the proposed VPO benchmarks and AVSBench-Single+, we show that our method produces more accurate audio-visual semantic segmentation than SOTA models. Code and dataset will be available."
Learning Neural Eigenfunctions for Unsupervised Semantic Segmentation,"Unsupervised semantic segmentation is a long-standing challenge in computer vision with great significance. Spectral clustering is a theoretically grounded solution to it where the spectral embeddings for pixels are computed to construct distinct clusters. Despite recent progress in enhancing spectral clustering with powerful pre-trained models, current approaches still suffer from inefficiencies in spectral decomposition and inflexibility in applying them to the test data. This work addresses these issues by casting spectral clustering as a parametric approach that employs neural network-based eigenfunctions to produce spectral embeddings. The outputs of the neural eigenfunctions are further restricted to discrete vectors that indicate clustering assignments directly. As a result, an end-to-end NN-based paradigm of spectral clustering emerges. In practice, the neural eigenfunctions are lightweight and take the features from pre-trained models as inputs, improving training efficiency and unleashing the potential of pre-trained models for dense prediction. We conduct extensive empirical studies to validate the effectiveness of our approach and observe significant performance gains over competitive baselines on Pascal Context, Cityscapes, and ADE20K benchmarks."
DiGA: Distil to Generalize and then Adapt for Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation,"Domain adaptive semantic segmentation methods commonly utilize stage-wise training, consisting of a warm-up and a self-training stage. However, this popular approach still faces several challenges in each stage: for warm-up, the widely adopted adversarial training often results in limited performance gain, due to blind feature alignment; for self-training, finding proper categorical thresholds is very tricky. To alleviate these issues, we first propose to replace the adversarial training in the warm-up stage by a novel symmetric knowledge distillation module that only accesses the source domain data and makes the model domain generalizable. Surprisingly, this domain generalizable warm-up model brings substantial performance improvement, which can be further amplified via our proposed cross-domain mixture data augmentation technique. Then, for the self-training stage, we propose a threshold-free dynamic pseudo-label selection mechanism to ease the aforementioned threshold problem and make the model better adapted to the target domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves remarkable and consistent improvements compared to the prior arts on popular benchmarks. Codes and models are available at https://github.com/fy-vision/DiGA"
Zero-Shot Semantic Segmentation with Decoupled One-Pass Network,"Recently, the zero-shot semantic segmentation problem has attracted increasing attention, and the best performing methods are based on two-stream networks: one stream for proposal mask generation and the other for segment classification using a pre-trained visual-language model. However, existing two-stream methods require passing a great number of (up to a hundred) image crops into the visuallanguage model, which is highly inefficient. To address the problem, we propose a network that only needs a single pass through the visual-language model for each input image. Specifically, we first propose a novel network adaptation approach, termed patch severance, to restrict the harmful interference between the patch embeddings in the pre-trained visual encoder. We then propose classification anchor learning to encourage the network to spatially focus on more discriminative features for classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves outstanding performance, surpassing state-of-theart methods while being 4 to 7 times faster at inference. We release our code at https://github.com/CongHan0808/DeOP.git."
WeakTr: Exploring Plain Vision Transformer for Weakly-supervised Semantic Segmentation,"This paper explores the properties of the plain Vision Transformer (ViT) for Weakly-supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS). The class activation map (CAM) is of critical importance for understanding a classification network and launching WSSS. We observe that different attention heads of ViT focus on different image areas. Thus a novel weight-based method is proposed to end-to-end estimate the importance of attention heads, while the self-attention maps are adaptively fused for high-quality CAM results that tend to have more complete objects. Besides, we propose a ViT-based gradient clipping decoder for online retraining with the CAM results to complete the WSSS task. We name this plain Transformer-based Weakly-supervised learning framework WeakTr. It achieves the state-of-the-art WSSS performance on standard benchmarks, i.e., 78.4% mIoU on the val set of PASCAL VOC 2012 and 50.3% mIoU on the val set of COCO 2014. Code is available at https://github.com/hustvl/WeakTr."
Associating Spatially-Consistent Grouping with Text-supervised Semantic Segmentation,"In this work, we investigate performing semantic segmentation solely through the training on image-sentence pairs. Due to the lack of dense annotations, existing text-supervised methods can only learn to group an image into semantic regions via pixel-insensitive feedback. As a result, their grouped results are coarse and often contain small spurious regions, limiting the upper-bound performance of segmentation. On the other hand, we observe that grouped results from self-supervised models are more semantically consistent and break the bottleneck of existing methods. Motivated by this, we introduce associate self-supervised spatially-consistent grouping with text-supervised semantic segmentation. Considering the part-like grouped results, we further adapt a text-supervised model from image-level to region-level recognition with two core designs. First, we encourage fine-grained alignment with a one-way noun-to-region contrastive loss, which reduces the mismatched noun-region pairs. Second, we adopt a contextually aware masking strategy to enable simultaneous recognition of all grouped regions. Coupled with spatially-consistent grouping and region-adapted recognition, our method achieves 59.2% mIoU and 32.4% mIoU on Pascal VOC and Pascal Context benchmarks, significantly surpassing the state-of-the-art methods."
Small but Mighty: Enhancing 3D Point Clouds Semantic Segmentation with U-Next Framework,"We study the problem of semantic segmentation of large-scale 3D point clouds. In recent years, significant research efforts have been directed toward local feature aggregation, improved loss functions and sampling strategies. While the fundamental framework of point cloud semantic segmentation has been largely overlooked, with most existing approaches rely on the U-Net architecture by default. In this paper, we propose U-Next, a small but mighty framework designed for point cloud semantic segmentation. The key to this framework is to learn multi-scale hierarchical representations from semantically similar feature maps. Specifically, we build our U-Next by stacking multiple U-Net L^1 codecs in a nested and densely arranged manner to minimize the semantic gap, while simultaneously fusing the feature maps across scales to effectively recover the fine-grained details. We also devised a multi-level deep supervision mechanism to further smooth gradient propagation and facilitate network optimization. Extensive experiments conducted on three large-scale benchmarks including S3DIS, Toronto3D, and SensatUrban demonstrate the superiority and the effectiveness of the proposed U-Next architecture. Our U-Next architecture shows consistent and visible performance improvements across different tasks and baseline models, indicating its great potential to serve as a general framework for future research."
3D Semantic Segmentation in the Wild: Learning Generalized Models for Adverse-Condition Point Clouds,"Robust point cloud parsing under all-weather conditions is crucial to level-5 autonomy in autonomous driving. However, how to learn a universal 3D semantic segmentation (3DSS) model is largely neglected as most existing benchmarks are dominated by point clouds captured under normal weather. We introduce SemanticSTF, an adverse-weather point cloud dataset that provides dense point-level annotations and allows to study 3DSS under various adverse weather conditions. We study all-weather 3DSS modeling under two setups: 1) domain adaptive 3DSS that adapts from normal-weather data to adverse-weather data; 2) domain generalizable 3DSS that learns all-weather 3DSS models from normal-weather data. Our studies reveal the challenge while existing 3DSS methods encounter adverse-weather data, showing the great value of SemanticSTF in steering the future endeavor along this very meaningful research direction. In addition, we design a domain randomization technique that alternatively randomizes the geometry styles of point clouds and aggregates their embeddings, ultimately leading to a generalizable model that can improve 3DSS under various adverse weather effectively. The SemanticSTF and related codes are available at \url{https://github.com/xiaoaoran/SemanticSTF}."
Removing supervision in semantic segmentation with local-global matching and area balancing,"Removing supervision in semantic segmentation is still tricky. Current approaches can deal with common categorical patterns yet resort to multi-stage architectures. We design a novel end-to-end model leveraging local-global patch matching to predict categories, good localization, area and shape of objects for semantic segmentation. The local-global matching is, in turn, compelled by optimal transport plans fulfilling area constraints nearing a solution for exact shape prediction. Our model attains state-of-the-art in Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation, only image-level labels, with 75% mIoU on PascalVOC2012 val set and 46% on MS-COCO2014 val set. Dropping the image-level labels and clustering self-supervised learned features to yield pseudo-multi-level labels, we obtain an unsupervised model for semantic segmentation. We also attain state-of-the-art on Unsupervised Semantic Segmentation with 43.6% mIoU on PascalVOC2012 val set and 19.4% on MS-COCO2014 val set. The code is available at https://github.com/deepplants/PC2M."
Complementary Random Masking for RGB-Thermal Semantic Segmentation,"RGB-thermal semantic segmentation is one potential solution to achieve reliable semantic scene understanding in adverse weather and lighting conditions. However, the previous studies mostly focus on designing a multi-modal fusion module without consideration of the nature of multi-modality inputs. Therefore, the networks easily become over-reliant on a single modality, making it difficult to learn complementary and meaningful representations for each modality. This paper proposes 1) a complementary random masking strategy of RGB-T images and 2) self-distillation loss between clean and masked input modalities. The proposed masking strategy prevents over-reliance on a single modality. It also improves the accuracy and robustness of the neural network by forcing the network to segment and classify objects even when one modality is partially available. Also, the proposed self-distillation loss encourages the network to extract complementary and meaningful representations from a single modality or complementary masked modalities. Based on the proposed method, we achieve state-of-the-art performance over three RGB-T semantic segmentation benchmarks. Our source code is available at https://github.com/UkcheolShin/CRM_RGBTSeg."
Adaptive Superpixel for Active Learning in Semantic Segmentation,"Learning semantic segmentation requires pixel-wise annotations, which can be time-consuming and expensive. To reduce the annotation cost, we propose a superpixel-based active learning (AL) framework, which collects a dominant label per superpixel instead. To be specific, it consists of adaptive superpixel and sieving mechanisms, fully dedicated to AL. At each round of AL, we adaptively merge neighboring pixels of similar learned features into superpixels. We then query a selected subset of these superpixels using an acquisition function assuming no uniform superpixel size. This approach is more efficient than existing methods, which rely only on innate features such as RGB color and assume uniform superpixel sizes. Obtaining a dominant label per superpixel drastically reduces annotators' burden as it requires fewer clicks. However, it inevitably introduces noisy annotations due to mismatches between superpixel and ground truth segmentation. To address this issue, we further devise a sieving mechanism that identifies and excludes potentially noisy annotations from learning. Our experiments on both Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC datasets demonstrate the efficacy of adaptive superpixel and sieving mechanisms."
Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation by Optimal Transport,"Scene segmentation is widely used in the field of autonomous driving for environment perception, and semantic scene segmentation (3S) has received a great deal of attention due to the richness of the semantic information it contains. It aims to assign labels to pixels in an image, thus enabling automatic image labeling. Current approaches are mainly based on convolutional neural networks (CNN), but they rely on a large number of labels. Therefore, how to use a small size of labeled data to achieve semantic segmentation becomes more and more important. In this paper, we propose a domain adaptation (DA) framework based on optimal transport (OT) and attention mechanism to address this issue. Concretely, first we generate the output space via CNN due to its superiority of feature representation. Second, we utilize OT to achieve a more robust alignment of source and target domains in output space, where the OT plan defines a well attention mechanism to improve the adaptation of the model. In particular, with OT, the number of network parameters has been reduced and the network has been better interpretable. Third, to better describe the multi-scale property of features, we construct a multi-scale segmentation network to perform domain adaptation. Finally, in order to verify the performance of our proposed method, we conduct experimental comparison with three benchmark and four SOTA methods on three scene datasets, and the mean intersection-over-union (mIOU) has been significant improved, and visualization results under multiple domain adaptation scenarios also show that our proposed method has better performance than compared semantic segmentation methods."
FMAS: Fast Multi-Objective SuperNet Architecture Search for Semantic Segmentation,"We present FMAS, a fast multi-objective neural architecture search framework for semantic segmentation. FMAS subsamples the structure and pre-trained parameters of DeepLabV3+, without fine-tuning, dramatically reducing training time during search. To further reduce candidate evaluation time, we use a subset of the validation dataset during the search. Only the final, Pareto non-dominated, candidates are ultimately fine-tuned using the complete training set. We evaluate FMAS by searching for models that effectively trade accuracy and computational cost on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset. FMAS finds competitive designs quickly, e.g., taking just 0.5 GPU days to discover a DeepLabV3+ variant that reduces FLOPs and parameters by 10\% and 20\% respectively, for less than 3\% increased error. We also search on an edge device called GAP8 and use its latency as the metric. FMAS is capable of finding 2.2\times faster network with 7.61\% MIoU loss."
Few-Shot 3D Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation via Stratified Class-Specific Attention Based Transformer Network,"3D point cloud semantic segmentation aims to group all points into different semantic categories, which benefits important applications such as point cloud scene reconstruction and understanding. Existing supervised point cloud semantic segmentation methods usually require large-scale annotated point clouds for training and cannot handle new categories. While a few-shot learning method was proposed recently to address these two problems, it suffers from high computational complexity caused by graph construction and inability to learn fine-grained relationships among points due to the use of pooling operations. In this paper, we further address these problems by developing a new multi-layer transformer network for few-shot point cloud semantic segmentation. In the proposed network, the query point cloud features are aggregated based on the class-specific support features in different scales. Without using pooling operations, our method makes full use of all pixel-level features from the support samples. By better leveraging the support features for few-shot learning, the proposed method achieves the new state-of-the-art performance, with 15\% less inference time, over existing few-shot 3D point cloud segmentation models on the S3DIS dataset and the ScanNet dataset."
Real-Time Semantic Segmentation using Hyperspectral Images for Mapping Unstructured and Unknown Environments,"Autonomous navigation in unstructured off-road environments is greatly improved by semantic scene understanding. Conventional image processing algorithms are difficult to implement and lack robustness due to a lack of structure and high variability across off-road environments. The use of neural networks and machine learning can overcome the previous challenges but they require large labeled data sets for training. In our work we propose the use of hyperspectral images for real-time pixel-wise semantic classification and segmentation, without the need of any prior training data. The resulting segmented image is processed to extract, filter, and approximate objects as polygons, using a polygon approximation algorithm. The resulting polygons are then used to generate a semantic map of the environment. Using our framework. we show the capability to add new semantic classes in run-time for classification. The proposed methodology is also shown to operate in real-time and produce outputs at a frequency of 1Hz, using high resolution hyperspectral images."
Leveraging Hidden Positives for Unsupervised Semantic Segmentation,"Dramatic demand for manpower to label pixel-level annotations triggered the advent of unsupervised semantic segmentation. Although the recent work employing the vision transformer (ViT) backbone shows exceptional performance, there is still a lack of consideration for task-specific training guidance and local semantic consistency. To tackle these issues, we leverage contrastive learning by excavating hidden positives to learn rich semantic relationships and ensure semantic consistency in local regions. Specifically, we first discover two types of global hidden positives, task-agnostic and task-specific ones for each anchor based on the feature similarities defined by a fixed pre-trained backbone and a segmentation head-in-training, respectively. A gradual increase in the contribution of the latter induces the model to capture task-specific semantic features. In addition, we introduce a gradient propagation strategy to learn semantic consistency between adjacent patches, under the inherent premise that nearby patches are highly likely to possess the same semantics. Specifically, we add the loss propagating to local hidden positives, semantically similar nearby patches, in proportion to the predefined similarity scores. With these training schemes, our proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in COCO-stuff, Cityscapes, and Potsdam-3 datasets. Our code is available at: https://github.com/hynnsk/HP."
OVeNet: Offset Vector Network for Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation is a fundamental task in visual scene understanding. We focus on the supervised setting, where ground-truth semantic annotations are available. Based on knowledge about the high regularity of real-world scenes, we propose a method for improving class predictions by learning to selectively exploit information from neighboring pixels. In particular, our method is based on the prior that for each pixel, there is a seed pixel in its close neighborhood sharing the same prediction with the former. Motivated by this prior, we design a novel two-head network, named Offset Vector Network (OVeNet), which generates both standard semantic predictions and a dense 2D offset vector field indicating the offset from each pixel to the respective seed pixel, which is used to compute an alternative, seed-based semantic prediction. The two predictions are adaptively fused at each pixel using a learnt dense confidence map for the predicted offset vector field. We supervise offset vectors indirectly via optimizing the seed-based prediction and via a novel loss on the confidence map. Compared to the baseline state-of-the-art architectures HRNet and HRNet+OCR on which OVeNet is built, the latter achieves significant performance gains on two prominent benchmarks for semantic segmentation of driving scenes, namely Cityscapes and ACDC. Code is available at https://github.com/stamatisalex/OVeNet"
IFSeg: Image-free Semantic Segmentation via Vision-Language Model,"Vision-language (VL) pre-training has recently gained much attention for its transferability and flexibility in novel concepts (e.g., cross-modality transfer) across various visual tasks. However, VL-driven segmentation has been under-explored, and the existing approaches still have the burden of acquiring additional training images or even segmentation annotations to adapt a VL model to downstream segmentation tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel image-free segmentation task where the goal is to perform semantic segmentation given only a set of the target semantic categories, but without any task-specific images and annotations. To tackle this challenging task, our proposed method, coined IFSeg, generates VL-driven artificial image-segmentation pairs and updates a pre-trained VL model to a segmentation task. We construct this artificial training data by creating a 2D map of random semantic categories and another map of their corresponding word tokens. Given that a pre-trained VL model projects visual and text tokens into a common space where tokens that share the semantics are located closely, this artificially generated word map can replace the real image inputs for such a VL model. Through an extensive set of experiments, our model not only establishes an effective baseline for this novel task but also demonstrates strong performances compared to existing methods that rely on stronger supervision, such as task-specific images and segmentation masks. Code is available at https://github.com/alinlab/ifseg."
Instant Domain Augmentation for LiDAR Semantic Segmentation,"Despite the increasing popularity of LiDAR sensors, perception algorithms using 3D LiDAR data struggle with the 'sensor-bias problem'. Specifically, the performance of perception algorithms significantly drops when an unseen specification of LiDAR sensor is applied at test time due to the domain discrepancy. This paper presents a fast and flexible LiDAR augmentation method for the semantic segmentation task, called 'LiDomAug'. It aggregates raw LiDAR scans and creates a LiDAR scan of any configurations with the consideration of dynamic distortion and occlusion, resulting in instant domain augmentation. Our on-demand augmentation module runs at 330 FPS, so it can be seamlessly integrated into the data loader in the learning framework. In our experiments, learning-based approaches aided with the proposed LiDomAug are less affected by the sensor-bias issue and achieve new state-of-the-art domain adaptation performances on SemanticKITTI and nuScenes dataset without the use of the target domain data. We also present a sensor-agnostic model that faithfully works on the various LiDAR configurations."
Spatio-Temporal Pixel-Level Contrastive Learning-based Source-Free Domain Adaptation for Video Semantic Segmentation,"Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) of semantic segmentation transfers labeled source knowledge to an unlabeled target domain by relying on accessing both the source and target data. However, the access to source data is often restricted or infeasible in real-world scenarios. Under the source data restrictive circumstances, UDA is less practical. To address this, recent works have explored solutions under the Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) setup, which aims to adapt a source-trained model to the target domain without accessing source data. Still, existing SFDA approaches use only image-level information for adaptation, making them sub-optimal in video applications. This paper studies SFDA for Video Semantic Segmentation (VSS), where temporal information is leveraged to address video adaptation. Specifically, we propose Spatio-Temporal Pixel-Level (STPL) contrastive learning, a novel method that takes full advantage of spatio-temporal information to tackle the absence of source data better. STPL explicitly learns semantic correlations among pixels in the spatio-temporal space, providing strong self-supervision for adaptation to the unlabeled target domain. Extensive experiments show that STPL achieves state-of-the-art performance on VSS benchmarks compared to current UDA and SFDA approaches. Code is available at: https://github.com/shaoyuanlo/STPL"
Both Style and Distortion Matter: Dual-Path Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Panoramic Semantic Segmentation,"The ability of scene understanding has sparked active research for panoramic image semantic segmentation. However, the performance is hampered by distortion of the equirectangular projection (ERP) and a lack of pixel-wise annotations. For this reason, some works treat the ERP and pinhole images equally and transfer knowledge from the pinhole to ERP images via unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). However, they fail to handle the domain gaps caused by: 1) the inherent differences between camera sensors and captured scenes; 2) the distinct image formats (e.g., ERP and pinhole images). In this paper, we propose a novel yet flexible dual-path UDA framework, DPPASS, taking ERP and tangent projection (TP) images as inputs. To reduce the domain gaps, we propose cross-projection and intra-projection training. The cross-projection training includes tangent-wise feature contrastive training and prediction consistency training. That is, the former formulates the features with the same projection locations as positive examples and vice versa, for the models' awareness of distortion, while the latter ensures the consistency of cross-model predictions between the ERP and TP. Moreover, adversarial intra-projection training is proposed to reduce the inherent gap, between the features of the pinhole images and those of the ERP and TP images, respectively. Importantly, the TP path can be freely removed after training, leading to no additional inference cost. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks show that our DPPASS achieves +1.06\% mIoU increment than the state-of-the-art approaches."
Principles of Forgetting in Domain-Incremental Semantic Segmentation in Adverse Weather Conditions,"Deep neural networks for scene perception in automated vehicles achieve excellent results for the domains they were trained on. However, in real-world conditions, the domain of operation and its underlying data distribution are subject to change. Adverse weather conditions, in particular, can significantly decrease model performance when such data are not available during training.Additionally, when a model is incrementally adapted to a new domain, it suffers from catastrophic forgetting, causing a significant drop in performance on previously observed domains. Despite recent progress in reducing catastrophic forgetting, its causes and effects remain obscure. Therefore, we study how the representations of semantic segmentation models are affected during domain-incremental learning in adverse weather conditions. Our experiments and representational analyses indicate that catastrophic forgetting is primarily caused by changes to low-level features in domain-incremental learning and that learning more general features on the source domain using pre-training and image augmentations leads to efficient feature reuse in subsequent tasks, which drastically reduces catastrophic forgetting. These findings highlight the importance of methods that facilitate generalized features for effective continual learning algorithms."
FishDreamer: Towards Fisheye Semantic Completion via Unified Image Outpainting and Segmentation,"This paper raises the new task of Fisheye Semantic Completion (FSC), where dense texture, structure, and semantics of a fisheye image are inferred even beyond the sensor field-of-view (FoV). Fisheye cameras have larger FoV than ordinary pinhole cameras, yet its unique special imaging model naturally leads to a blind area at the edge of the image plane. This is suboptimal for safety-critical applications since important perception tasks, such as semantic segmentation, become very challenging within the blind zone. Previous works considered the out-FoV outpainting and in-FoV segmentation separately. However, we observe that these two tasks are actually closely coupled. To jointly estimate the tightly intertwined complete fisheye image and scene semantics, we introduce the new FishDreamer which relies on successful ViTs enhanced with a novel Polar-aware Cross Attention module (PCA) to leverage dense context and guide semantically-consistent content generation while considering different polar distributions. In addition to the contribution of the novel task and architecture, we also derive Cityscapes-BF and KITTI360-BF datasets to facilitate training and evaluation of this new track. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed FishDreamer outperforms methods solving each task in isolation and surpasses alternative approaches on the Fisheye Semantic Completion. Code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/MasterHow/FishDreamer."
Influencer Backdoor Attack on Semantic Segmentation,"When a small number of poisoned samples are injected into the training dataset of a deep neural network, the network can be induced to exhibit malicious behavior during inferences, which poses potential threats to real-world applications. While they have been intensively studied in classification, backdoor attacks on semantic segmentation have been largely overlooked. Unlike classification, semantic segmentation aims to classify every pixel within a given image. In this work, we explore backdoor attacks on segmentation models to misclassify all pixels of a victim class by injecting a specific trigger on non-victim pixels during inferences, which is dubbed Influencer Backdoor Attack (IBA). IBA is expected to maintain the classification accuracy of non-victim pixels and misleads classifications of all victim pixels in every single inference. Specifically, we consider two types of IBA scenarios, i.e., 1) Free-position IBA: the trigger can be positioned freely except for pixels of the victim class, and 2) Long-distance IBA: the trigger can only be positioned somewhere far from victim pixels, given the possible practical constraint. Based on the context aggregation ability of segmentation models, we propose techniques to improve IBA for the scenarios. Concretely, for free-position IBA, we propose a simple, yet effective Nearest Neighbor trigger injection strategy for poisoned sample creation. For long-distance IBA, we propose a novel Pixel Random Labeling strategy. Our extensive experiments reveal that current segmentation models do suffer from backdoor attacks, and verify that our proposed techniques can further increase attack performance."
CAT-Seg: Cost Aggregation for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation,"Existing works on open-vocabulary semantic segmentation have utilized large-scale vision-language models, such as CLIP, to leverage their exceptional open-vocabulary recognition capabilities. However, the problem of transferring these capabilities learned from image-level supervision to the pixel-level task of segmentation and addressing arbitrary unseen categories at inference makes this task challenging. To address these issues, we aim to attentively relate objects within an image to given categories by leveraging relational information among class categories and visual semantics through aggregation, while also adapting the CLIP representations to the pixel-level task. However, we observe that direct optimization of the CLIP embeddings can harm its open-vocabulary capabilities. In this regard, we propose an alternative approach to optimize the image-text similarity map, i.e. the cost map, using a novel cost aggregation-based method. Our framework, namely CAT-Seg, achieves state-of-the-art performance across all benchmarks. We provide extensive ablation studies to validate our choices. Project page: https://ku-cvlab.github.io/CAT-Seg/."
DiffuMask: Synthesizing Images with Pixel-level Annotations for Semantic Segmentation Using Diffusion Models,"Collecting and annotating images with pixel-wise labels is time-consuming and laborious. In contrast, synthetic data can be freely available using a generative model (e.g., DALL-E, Stable Diffusion). In this paper, we show that it is possible to automatically obtain accurate semantic masks of synthetic images generated by the Off-the-shelf Stable Diffusion model, which uses only text-image pairs during training. Our approach, called DiffuMask, exploits the potential of the cross-attention map between text and image, which is natural and seamless to extend the text-driven image synthesis to semantic mask generation. DiffuMask uses text-guided cross-attention information to localize class/word-specific regions, which are combined with practical techniques to create a novel high-resolution and class-discriminative pixel-wise mask. The methods help to reduce data collection and annotation costs obviously. Experiments demonstrate that the existing segmentation methods trained on synthetic data of DiffuMask can achieve a competitive performance over the counterpart of real data (VOC 2012, Cityscapes). For some classes (e.g., bird), DiffuMask presents promising performance, close to the stateof-the-art result of real data (within 3% mIoU gap). Moreover, in the open-vocabulary segmentation (zero-shot) setting, DiffuMask achieves a new SOTA result on Unseen class of VOC 2012.

Learning Context-aware Classifier for Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation is still a challenging task for parsing diverse contexts in different scenes, thus the fixed classifier might not be able to well address varying feature distributions during testing. Different from the mainstream literature where the efficacy of strong backbones and effective decoder heads has been well studied, in this paper, additional contextual hints are instead exploited via learning a context-aware classifier whose content is data-conditioned, decently adapting to different latent distributions. Since only the classifier is dynamically altered, our method is model-agnostic and can be easily applied to generic segmentation models. Notably, with only negligible additional parameters and +2\% inference time, decent performance gain has been achieved on both small and large models with challenging benchmarks, manifesting substantial practical merits brought by our simple yet effective method. The implementation is available at \url{https://github.com/tianzhuotao/CAC}."
Novel Class Discovery for 3D Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation,"Novel class discovery (NCD) for semantic segmentation is the task of learning a model that can segment unlabelled (novel) classes using only the supervision from labelled (base) classes. This problem has recently been pioneered for 2D image data, but no work exists for 3D point cloud data. In fact, the assumptions made for 2D are loosely applicable to 3D in this case. This paper is presented to advance the state of the art on point cloud data analysis in four directions. Firstly, we address the new problem of NCD for point cloud semantic segmentation. Secondly, we show that the transposition of the only existing NCD method for 2D semantic segmentation to 3D data is suboptimal. Thirdly, we present a new method for NCD based on online clustering that exploits uncertainty quantification to produce prototypes for pseudo-labelling the points of the novel classes. Lastly, we introduce a new evaluation protocol to assess the performance of NCD for point cloud semantic segmentation. We thoroughly evaluate our method on SemanticKITTI and SemanticPOSS datasets, showing that it can significantly outperform the baseline. Project page at this link: https://github.com/LuigiRiz/NOPS."
CAFS: Class Adaptive Framework for Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Semi-supervised semantic segmentation learns a model for classifying pixels into specific classes using a few labeled samples and numerous unlabeled images. The recent leading approach is consistency regularization by selftraining with pseudo-labeling pixels having high confidences for unlabeled images. However, using only highconfidence pixels for self-training may result in losing much of the information in the unlabeled datasets due to poor confidence calibration of modern deep learning networks. In this paper, we propose a class-adaptive semisupervision framework for semi-supervised semantic segmentation (CAFS) to cope with the loss of most information that occurs in existing high-confidence-based pseudolabeling methods. Unlike existing semi-supervised semantic segmentation frameworks, CAFS constructs a validation set on a labeled dataset, to leverage the calibration performance for each class. On this basis, we propose a calibration aware class-wise adaptive thresholding and classwise adaptive oversampling using the analysis results from the validation set. Our proposed CAFS achieves state-ofthe-art performance on the full data partition of the base PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset and on the 1/4 data partition of the Cityscapes dataset with significant margins of 83.0% and 80.4%, respectively. The code is available at https://github.com/cjf8899/CAFS."
Generative Semantic Segmentation,"We present Generative Semantic Segmentation (GSS), a generative learning approach for semantic segmentation. Uniquely, we cast semantic segmentation as an image-conditioned mask generation problem. This is achieved by replacing the conventional per-pixel discriminative learning with a latent prior learning process. Specifically, we model the variational posterior distribution of latent variables given the segmentation mask. To that end, the segmentation mask is expressed with a special type of image (dubbed as maskige). This posterior distribution allows to generate segmentation masks unconditionally. To achieve semantic segmentation on a given image, we further introduce a conditioning network. It is optimized by minimizing the divergence between the posterior distribution of maskige (i.e., segmentation masks) and the latent prior distribution of input training images. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show that our GSS can perform competitively to prior art alternatives in the standard semantic segmentation setting, whilst achieving a new state of the art in the more challenging cross-domain setting."
Reliability in Semantic Segmentation: Are We on the Right Track?,"Motivated by the increasing popularity of transformers in computer vision, in recent times there has been a rapid development of novel architectures. While in-domain performance follows a constant, upward trend, properties like robustness or uncertainty estimation are less explored -leaving doubts about advances in model reliability. Studies along these axes exist, but they are mainly limited to classification models. In contrast, we carry out a study on semantic segmentation, a relevant task for many real-world applications where model reliability is paramount. We analyze a broad variety of models, spanning from older ResNet-based architectures to novel transformers and assess their reliability based on four metrics: robustness, calibration, misclassification detection and out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. We find that while recent models are significantly more robust, they are not overall more reliable in terms of uncertainty estimation. We further explore methods that can come to the rescue and show that improving calibration can also help with other uncertainty metrics such as misclassification or OOD detection. This is the first study on modern segmentation models focused on both robustness and uncertainty estimation and we hope it will help practitioners and researchers interested in this fundamental vision task.

Less is More: Reducing Task and Model Complexity for 3D Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation,"Whilst the availability of 3D LiDAR point cloud data has significantly grown in recent years, annotation remains expensive and time-consuming, leading to a demand for semi-supervised semantic segmentation methods with application domains such as autonomous driving. Existing work very often employs relatively large segmentation backbone networks to improve segmentation accuracy, at the expense of computational costs. In addition, many use uniform sampling to reduce ground truth data requirements for learning needed, often resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address these issues, we propose a new pipeline that employs a smaller architecture, requiring fewer ground-truth annotations to achieve superior segmentation accuracy compared to contemporary approaches. This is facilitated via a novel Sparse Depthwise Separable Convolution module that significantly reduces the network parameter count while retaining overall task performance. To effectively sub-sample our training data, we propose a new Spatio-Temporal Redundant Frame Downsampling (ST-RFD) method that leverages knowledge of sensor motion within the environment to extract a more diverse subset of training data frame samples. To leverage the use of limited annotated data samples, we further propose a soft pseudo-label method informed by LiDAR reflectivity. Our method outperforms contemporary semi-supervised work in terms of mIoU, using less labeled data, on the SemanticKITTI (59.5@5%) and ScribbleKITTI (58.1@5%) benchmark datasets, based on a 2.3x reduction in model parameters and 641x fewer multiply-add operations whilst also demonstrating significant performance improvement on limited training data (i.e., Less is More)."
Semantic segmentation of surgical hyperspectral images under geometric domain shifts,"Robust semantic segmentation of intraoperative image data could pave the way for automatic surgical scene understanding and autonomous robotic surgery. Geometric domain shifts, however, although common in real-world open surgeries due to variations in surgical procedures or situs occlusions, remain a topic largely unaddressed in the field. To address this gap in the literature, we (1) present the first analysis of state-of-the-art (SOA) semantic segmentation networks in the presence of geometric out-of-distribution (OOD) data, and (2) address generalizability with a dedicated augmentation technique termed ""Organ Transplantation"" that we adapted from the general computer vision community. According to a comprehensive validation on six different OOD data sets comprising 600 RGB and hyperspectral imaging (HSI) cubes from 33 pigs semantically annotated with 19 classes, we demonstrate a large performance drop of SOA organ segmentation networks applied to geometric OOD data. Surprisingly, this holds true not only for conventional RGB data (drop of Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) by 46 %) but also for HSI data (drop by 45 %), despite the latter's rich information content per pixel. Using our augmentation scheme improves on the SOA DSC by up to 67 % (RGB) and 90 % (HSI) and renders performance on par with in-distribution performance on real OOD test data. The simplicity and effectiveness of our augmentation scheme makes it a valuable network-independent tool for addressing geometric domain shifts in semantic scene segmentation of intraoperative data. Our code and pre-trained models will be made publicly available."
Semantic 3D scene segmentation for robotic assembly process execution,"Adapting robot programmes to changes in the environment is a well-known industry problem, and it is the reason why many tedious tasks are not automated in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). A semantic world model of a robot's previously unknown environment created from point clouds is one way for these companies to automate assembly tasks that are typically performed by humans. The semantic segmentation of point clouds for robot manipulators or cobots in industrial environments has received little attention due to a lack of suitable datasets. This paper describes a pipeline for creating synthetic point clouds for specific use cases in order to train a model for point cloud semantic segmentation. We show that models trained with our data achieve high per-class accuracy (> 90%) for semantic point cloud segmentation on unseen real-world data. Our approach is applicable not only to the 3D camera used in training data generation but also to other depth cameras based on different technologies. The application tested in this work is a industry-related peg-in-the-hole process. With our approach the necessity of user assistance during a robot's commissioning can be reduced to a minimum."
MECPformer: Multi-estimations Complementary Patch with CNN-Transformers for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"The initial seed based on the convolutional neural network (CNN) for weakly supervised semantic segmentation always highlights the most discriminative regions but fails to identify the global target information. Methods based on transformers have been proposed successively benefiting from the advantage of capturing long-range feature representations. However, we observe a flaw regardless of the gifts based on the transformer. Given a class, the initial seeds generated based on the transformer may invade regions belonging to other classes. Inspired by the mentioned issues, we devise a simple yet effective method with Multi-estimations Complementary Patch (MECP) strategy and Adaptive Conflict Module (ACM), dubbed MECPformer. Given an image, we manipulate it with the MECP strategy at different epochs, and the network mines and deeply fuses the semantic information at different levels. In addition, ACM adaptively removes conflicting pixels and exploits the network self-training capability to mine potential target information. Without bells and whistles, our MECPformer has reached new state-of-the-art 72.0% mIoU on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and 42.4% on MS COCO 2014 dataset. The code is available at https://github.com/ChunmengLiu1/MECPformer."
Multi-Modal Continual Test-Time Adaptation for 3D Semantic Segmentation,"Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) generalizes conventional Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) by assuming that the target domain is dynamic over time rather than stationary. In this paper, we explore Multi-Modal Continual Test-Time Adaptation (MM-CTTA) as a new extension of CTTA for 3D semantic segmentation. The key to MM-CTTA is to adaptively attend to the reliable modality while avoiding catastrophic forgetting during continual domain shifts, which is out of the capability of previous TTA or CTTA methods. To fulfill this gap, we propose an MM-CTTA method called Continual Cross-Modal Adaptive Clustering (CoMAC) that addresses this task from two perspectives. On one hand, we propose an adaptive dual-stage mechanism to generate reliable cross-modal predictions by attending to the reliable modality based on the class-wise feature-centroid distance in the latent space. On the other hand, to perform test-time adaptation without catastrophic forgetting, we design class-wise momentum queues that capture confident target features for adaptation while stochastically restoring pseudo-source features to revisit source knowledge. We further introduce two new benchmarks to facilitate the exploration of MM-CTTA in the future. Our experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both benchmarks."
Edge-aware Plug-and-play Scheme for Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation is a classic and fundamental computer vision problem dedicated to assigning each pixel with its corresponding class. Some recent methods introduce edge-based information for improving the segmentation performance. However these methods are specific and limited to certain network architectures, and they can not be transferred to other models or tasks. Therefore, we propose an abstract and universal edge supervision method called Edge-aware Plug-and-play Scheme (EPS), which can be easily and quickly applied to any semantic segmentation models. The core is edge-width/thickness preserving guided for semantic segmentation. The EPS first extracts the Edge Ground Truth (Edge GT) with a predefined edge thickness from the training data; and then for any network architecture, it directly copies the decoder head for the auxiliary task with the Edge GT supervision. To ensure the edge thickness preserving consistantly, we design a new boundarybased loss, called Polar Hausdorff (PH) Loss, for the auxiliary supervision. We verify the effectiveness of our EPS on the Cityscapes dataset using 22 models. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can be seamlessly integrated into any state-of-the-art (SOTA) models with zero modification, resulting in promising enhancement of the segmentation performance."
DUDES: Deep Uncertainty Distillation using Ensembles for Semantic Segmentation,"Deep neural networks lack interpretability and tend to be overconfident, which poses a serious problem in safety-critical applications like autonomous driving, medical imaging, or machine vision tasks with high demands on reliability. Quantifying the predictive uncertainty is a promising endeavour to open up the use of deep neural networks for such applications. Unfortunately, current available methods are computationally expensive. In this work, we present a novel approach for efficient and reliable uncertainty estimation which we call Deep Uncertainty Distillation using Ensembles for Segmentation (DUDES). DUDES applies student-teacher distillation with a Deep Ensemble to accurately approximate predictive uncertainties with a single forward pass while maintaining simplicity and adaptability. Experimentally, DUDES accurately captures predictive uncertainties without sacrificing performance on the segmentation task and indicates impressive capabilities of identifying wrongly classified pixels and out-of-domain samples on the Cityscapes dataset. With DUDES, we manage to simultaneously simplify and outperform previous work on Deep Ensemble-based Uncertainty Distillation."
Revisiting Image Reconstruction for Semi-supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Autoencoding, which aims to reconstruct the input images through a bottleneck latent representation, is one of the classic feature representation learning strategies. It has been shown effective as an auxiliary task for semi-supervised learning but has become less popular as more sophisticated methods have been proposed in recent years. In this paper, we revisit the idea of using image reconstruction as the auxiliary task and incorporate it with a modern semi-supervised semantic segmentation framework. Surprisingly, we discover that such an old idea in semi-supervised learning can produce results competitive with state-of-the-art semantic segmentation algorithms. By visualizing the intermediate layer activations of the image reconstruction module, we show that the feature map channel could correlate well with the semantic concept, which explains why joint training with the reconstruction task is helpful for the segmentation task. Motivated by our observation, we further proposed a modification to the image reconstruction task, aiming to further disentangle the object clue from the background patterns. From experiment evaluation on various datasets, we show that using reconstruction as auxiliary loss can lead to consistent improvements in various datasets and methods. The proposed method can further lead to significant improvement in object-centric segmentation tasks."
Exploring Sparse Visual Prompt for Cross-domain Semantic Segmentation,"Visual Domain Prompts (VDP) have shown promising potential in addressing visual cross-domain problems. Existing methods adopt VDP in classification domain adaptation (DA), such as tuning image-level or feature-level prompts for target domains. Since the previous dense prompts are opaque and mask out continuous spatial details in the prompt regions, it will suffer from inaccurate contextual information extraction and insufficient domain-specific feature transferring when dealing with the dense prediction (i.e. semantic segmentation) DA problems. Therefore, we propose a novel Sparse Visual Domain Prompts (SVDP) approach tailored for addressing domain shift problems in semantic segmentation, which holds minimal discrete trainable parameters (e.g. 10\%) of the prompt and reserves more spatial information. To better apply SVDP, we propose Domain Prompt Placement (DPP) method to adaptively distribute several SVDP on regions with large data distribution distance based on uncertainty guidance. It aims to extract more local domain-specific knowledge and realizes efficient cross-domain learning. Furthermore, we design a Domain Prompt Updating (DPU) method to optimize prompt parameters differently for each target domain sample with different degrees of domain shift, which helps SVDP to better fit target domain knowledge. Experiments, which are conducted on the widely-used benchmarks (Cityscapes, Foggy-Cityscapes, and ACDC), show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performances on the source-free adaptations, including six Test Time Adaptation and one Continual Test-Time Adaptation in semantic segmentation."
Bidirectional Domain Mixup for Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation,"Mixup provides interpolated training samples and allows the model to obtain smoother decision boundaries for better generalization. The idea can be naturally applied to the domain adaptation task, where we can mix the source and target samples to obtain domain-mixed samples for better adaptation. However, the extension of the idea from classification to segmentation (i.e., structured output) is nontrivial. This paper systematically studies the impact of mixup under the domain adaptaive semantic segmentation task and presents a simple yet effective mixup strategy called Bidirectional Domain Mixup (BDM). In specific, we achieve domain mixup in two-step: cut and paste. Given the warm-up model trained from any adaptation techniques, we forward the source and target samples and perform a simple threshold-based cut out of the unconfident regions (cut). After then, we fill-in the dropped regions with the other domain region patches (paste). In doing so, we jointly consider class distribution, spatial structure, and pseudo label confidence. Based on our analysis, we found that BDM leaves domain transferable regions by cutting, balances the dataset-level class distribution while preserving natural scene context by pasting. We coupled our proposal with various state-of-the-art adaptation models and observe significant improvement consistently. We also provide extensive ablation experiments to empirically verify our main components of the framework.

Stock Trend Prediction: A Semantic Segmentation Approach,"Market financial forecasting is a trending area in deep learning. Deep learning models are capable of tackling the classic challenges in stock market data, such as its extremely complicated dynamics as well as long-term temporal correlation. To capture the temporal relationship among these time series, recurrent neural networks are employed. However, it is difficult for recurrent models to learn to keep track of long-term information. Convolutional Neural Networks have been utilized to better capture the dynamics and extract features for both short- and long-term forecasting. However, semantic segmentation and its well-designed fully convolutional networks have never been studied for time-series dense classification. We present a novel approach to predict long-term daily stock price change trends with fully 2D-convolutional encoder-decoders. We generate input frames with daily prices for a time-frame of T days. The aim is to predict future trends by pixel-wise classification of the current price frame. We propose a hierarchical CNN structure to encode multiple price frames to multiscale latent representation in parallel using Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling blocks and take that temporal coarse feature stacks into account in the decoding stages. Our hierarchical structure of CNNs makes it capable of capturing both long and short-term temporal relationships effectively. The effect of increasing the input time horizon via incrementing parallel encoders has been studied with interesting and substantial changes in the output segmentation masks. We achieve overall accuracy and AUC of %78.18 and 0.88 for joint trend prediction over the next 20 days, surpassing other semantic segmentation approaches. We compared our proposed model with several deep models specifically designed for technical analysis and found that for different output horizons, our proposed models outperformed other models."
Focus on Your Target: A Dual Teacher-Student Framework for Domain-adaptive Semantic Segmentation,"We study unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for semantic segmentation. Currently, a popular UDA framework lies in self-training which endows the model with two-fold abilities: (i) learning reliable semantics from the labeled images in the source domain, and (ii) adapting to the target domain via generating pseudo labels on the unlabeled images. We find that, by decreasing/increasing the proportion of training samples from the target domain, the 'learning ability' is strengthened/weakened while the 'adapting ability' goes in the opposite direction, implying a conflict between these two abilities, especially for a single model. To alleviate the issue, we propose a novel dual teacher-student (DTS) framework and equip it with a bidirectional learning strategy. By increasing the proportion of target-domain data, the second teacher-student model learns to 'Focus on Your Target' while the first model is not affected. DTS is easily plugged into existing self-training approaches. In a standard UDA scenario (training on synthetic, labeled data and real, unlabeled data), DTS shows consistent gains over the baselines and sets new state-of-the-art results of 76.5\% and 75.1\% mIoUs on GTAv\rightarrowCityscapes and SYNTHIA\rightarrowCityscapes, respectively."
SpiderMesh: Spatial-aware Demand-guided Recursive Meshing for RGB-T Semantic Segmentation,"For semantic segmentation in urban scene understanding, RGB cameras alone often fail to capture a clear holistic topology, especially in challenging lighting conditions. Thermal signal is an informative additional channel that can bring to light the contour and fine-grained texture of blurred regions in low-quality RGB image. Aiming at RGB-T (thermal) segmentation, existing methods either use simple passive channel/spatial-wise fusion for cross-modal interaction, or rely on heavy labeling of ambiguous boundaries for fine-grained supervision. We propose a Spatial-aware Demand-guided Recursive Meshing (SpiderMesh) framework that: 1) proactively compensates inadequate contextual semantics in optically-impaired regions via a demand-guided target masking algorithm; 2) refines multimodal semantic features with recursive meshing to improve pixel-level semantic analysis performance. We further introduce an asymmetric data augmentation technique M-CutOut, and enable semi-supervised learning to fully utilize RGB-T labels only sparsely available in practical use. Extensive experiments on MFNet and PST900 datasets demonstrate that SpiderMesh achieves new state-of-the-art performance on standard RGB-T segmentation benchmarks."
HFGD: High-level Feature Guided Decoder for Semantic Segmentation,"Commonly used backbones for semantic segmentation, such as ResNet and Swin-Transformer, have multiple stages for feature encoding. Simply using high-resolution low-level feature maps from the early stages of the backbone to directly refine the low-resolution high-level feature map is a common practice of low-resolution feature map upsampling. However, the representation power of the low-level features is generally worse than high-level features, thus introducing ``noise"" to the upsampling refinement. To address this issue, we proposed High-level Feature Guided Decoder (HFGD), which uses isolated high-level features to guide low-level features and upsampling process. Specifically, the guidance is realized through carefully designed stop gradient operations and class kernels. Now the class kernels co-evolve only with the high-level features and are reused in the upsampling head to guide the training process of the upsampling head. HFGD is very efficient and effective that can also upsample the feature maps to a previously unseen output stride (OS) of 2 and still obtain accuracy gain. HFGD demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets (e.g. Pascal Context, COCOStuff164k and Cityscapes) with small FLOPs. The full code will be available at https://github.com/edwardyehuang/HFGD.git."
MSeg3D: Multi-modal 3D Semantic Segmentation for Autonomous Driving,"LiDAR and camera are two modalities available for 3D semantic segmentation in autonomous driving. The popular LiDAR-only methods severely suffer from inferior segmentation on small and distant objects due to insufficient laser points, while the robust multi-modal solution is under-explored, where we investigate three crucial inherent difficulties: modality heterogeneity, limited sensor field of view intersection, and multi-modal data augmentation. We propose a multi-modal 3D semantic segmentation model (MSeg3D) with joint intra-modal feature extraction and inter-modal feature fusion to mitigate the modality heterogeneity. The multi-modal fusion in MSeg3D consists of geometry-based feature fusion GF-Phase, cross-modal feature completion, and semantic-based feature fusion SF-Phase on all visible points. The multi-modal data augmentation is reinvigorated by applying asymmetric transformations on LiDAR point cloud and multi-camera images individually, which benefits the model training with diversified augmentation transformations. MSeg3D achieves state-of-the-art results on nuScenes, Waymo, and SemanticKITTI datasets. Under the malfunctioning multi-camera input and the multi-frame point clouds input, MSeg3D still shows robustness and improves the LiDAR-only baseline. Our code is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/jialeli1/lidarseg3d}."
SIM: Semantic-aware Instance Mask Generation for Box-Supervised Instance Segmentation,"Weakly supervised instance segmentation using only bounding box annotations has recently attracted much research attention. Most of the current efforts leverage low-level image features as extra supervision without explicitly exploiting the high-level semantic information of the objects, which will become ineffective when the foreground objects have similar appearances to the background or other objects nearby. We propose a new box-supervised instance segmentation approach by developing a Semantic-aware Instance Mask (SIM) generation paradigm. Instead of heavily relying on local pair-wise affinities among neighboring pixels, we construct a group of category-wise feature centroids as prototypes to identify foreground objects and assign them semantic-level pseudo labels. Considering that the semantic-aware prototypes cannot distinguish different instances of the same semantics, we propose a self-correction mechanism to rectify the falsely activated regions while enhancing the correct ones. Furthermore, to handle the occlusions between objects, we tailor the Copy-Paste operation for the weakly-supervised instance segmentation task to augment challenging training data. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed SIM approach over other state-of-the-art methods. The source code: https://github.com/lslrh/SIM."
Class-level Multiple Distributions Representation are Necessary for Semantic Segmentation,"Existing approaches focus on using class-level features to improve semantic segmentation performance. How to characterize the relationships of intra-class pixels and inter-class pixels is the key to extract the discriminative representative class-level features. In this paper, we introduce for the first time to describe intra-class variations by multiple distributions. Then, multiple distributions representation learning(\textbf{MDRL}) is proposed to augment the pixel representations for semantic segmentation. Meanwhile, we design a class multiple distributions consistency strategy to construct discriminative multiple distribution representations of embedded pixels. Moreover, we put forward a multiple distribution semantic aggregation module to aggregate multiple distributions of the corresponding class to enhance pixel semantic information. Our approach can be seamlessly integrated into popular segmentation frameworks FCN/PSPNet/CCNet and achieve 5.61\%/1.75\%/0.75\% mIoU improvements on ADE20K. Extensive experiments on the Cityscapes, ADE20K datasets have proved that our method can bring significant performance improvement."
AutoEnsemble: Automated Ensemble Search Framework for Semantic Segmentation Using Image Labels,"A key bottleneck of employing state-of-the-art semantic segmentation networks in the real world is the availability of training labels. Standard semantic segmentation networks require massive pixel-wise annotated labels to reach state-of-the-art prediction quality. Hence, several works focus on semantic segmentation networks trained with only image-level annotations. However, when scrutinizing the state-of-the-art results in more detail, we notice that although they are very close to each other on average prediction quality, different approaches perform better in different classes while providing low quality in others. To address this problem, we propose a novel framework, AutoEnsemble, which employs an ensemble of the ""pseudo-labels"" for a given set of different segmentation techniques on a class-wise level. Pseudo-labels are the pixel-wise predictions of the image-level semantic segmentation frameworks used to train the final segmentation model. Our pseudo-labels seamlessly combine the strong points of multiple segmentation techniques approaches to reach superior prediction quality. We reach up to 2.4% improvement over AutoEnsemble's components. An exhaustive analysis was performed to demonstrate AutoEnsemble's effectiveness over state-of-the-art frameworks for image-level semantic segmentation."
Exploring Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation Ensembles for Medical Imaging Systems,"Reliable classification and detection of certain medical conditions, in images, with state-of-the-art semantic segmentation networks, require vast amounts of pixel-wise annotation. However, the public availability of such datasets is minimal. Therefore, semantic segmentation with image-level labels presents a promising alternative to this problem. Nevertheless, very few works have focused on evaluating this technique and its applicability to the medical sector. Due to their complexity and the small number of training examples in medical datasets, classifier-based weakly supervised networks like class activation maps (CAMs) struggle to extract useful information from them. However, most state-of-the-art approaches rely on them to achieve their improvements. Therefore, we propose a framework that can still utilize the low-quality CAM predictions of complicated datasets to improve the accuracy of our results. Our framework achieves that by first utilizing lower threshold CAMs to cover the target object with high certainty; second, by combining multiple low-threshold CAMs that even out their errors while highlighting the target object. We performed exhaustive experiments on the popular multi-modal BRATS and prostate DECATHLON segmentation challenge datasets. Using the proposed framework, we have demonstrated an improved dice score of up to 8% on BRATS and 6% on DECATHLON datasets compared to the previous state-of-the-art."
SILOP: An Automated Framework for Semantic Segmentation Using Image Labels Based on Object Perimeters,"Achieving high-quality semantic segmentation predictions using only image-level labels enables a new level of real-world applicability. Although state-of-the-art networks deliver reliable predictions, the amount of handcrafted pixel-wise annotations to enable these results are not feasible in many real-world applications. Hence, several works have already targeted this bottleneck, using classifier-based networks like Class Activation Maps~\cite{CAM} (CAMs) as a base. Addressing CAM's weaknesses of fuzzy borders and incomplete predictions, state-of-the-art approaches rely only on adding regulations to the classifier loss or using pixel-similarity-based refinement after the fact. We propose a framework that introduces an additional module using object perimeters for improved saliency. We define object perimeter information as the line separating the object and background. Our new PerimeterFit module will be applied to pre-refine the CAM predictions before using the pixel-similarity-based network. In this way, our PerimeterFit increases the quality of the CAM prediction while simultaneously improving the false negative rate. We investigated a wide range of state-of-the-art unsupervised semantic segmentation networks and edge detection techniques to create useful perimeter maps, which enable our framework to predict object locations with sharper perimeters. We achieved up to 1.5% improvement over frameworks without our PerimeterFit module. We conduct an exhaustive analysis to illustrate that SILOP enhances existing state-of-the-art frameworks for image-level-based semantic segmentation. The framework is open-source and accessible online at https://github.com/ErikOstrowski/SILOP."
BoundaryCAM: A Boundary-based Refinement Framework for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation of Medical Images,"Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) with only image-level supervision is a promising approach to deal with the need for Segmentation networks, especially for generating a large number of pixel-wise masks in a given dataset. However, most state-of-the-art image-level WSSS techniques lack an understanding of the geometric features embedded in the images since the network cannot derive any object boundary information from just image-level labels. We define a boundary here as the line separating an object and its background, or two different objects. To address this drawback, we propose our novel BoundaryCAM framework, which deploys state-of-the-art class activation maps combined with various post-processing techniques in order to achieve fine-grained higher-accuracy segmentation masks. To achieve this, we investigate a state-of-the-art unsupervised semantic segmentation network that can be used to construct a boundary map, which enables BoundaryCAM to predict object locations with sharper boundaries. By applying our method to WSSS predictions, we were able to achieve up to 10% improvements even to the benefit of the current state-of-the-art WSSS methods for medical imaging. The framework is open-source and accessible online at https://github.com/bharathprabakaran/BoundaryCAM."
USAGE: A Unified Seed Area Generation Paradigm for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Seed area generation is usually the starting point of weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS). Computing the Class Activation Map (CAM) from a multi-label classification network is the de facto paradigm for seed area generation, but CAMs generated from Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers are prone to be under- and over-activated, respectively, which makes the strategies to refine CAMs for CNNs usually inappropriate for Transformers, and vice versa. In this paper, we propose a Unified optimization paradigm for Seed Area GEneration (USAGE) for both types of networks, in which the objective function to be optimized consists of two terms: One is a generation loss, which controls the shape of seed areas by a temperature parameter following a deterministic principle for different types of networks; The other is a regularization loss, which ensures the consistency between the seed areas that are generated by self-adaptive network adjustment from different views, to overturn false activation in seed areas. Experimental results show that USAGE consistently improves seed area generation for both CNNs and Transformers by large margins, e.g., outperforming state-of-the-art methods by a mIoU of 4.1% on PASCAL VOC. Moreover, based on the USAGE-generated seed areas on Transformers, we achieve state-of-the-art WSSS results on both PASCAL VOC and MS COCO."
LoG-CAN: local-global Class-aware Network for semantic segmentation of remote sensing images,"Remote sensing images are known of having complex backgrounds, high intra-class variance and large variation of scales, which bring challenge to semantic segmentation. We present LoG-CAN, a multi-scale semantic segmentation network with a global class-aware (GCA) module and local class-aware (LCA) modules to remote sensing images. Specifically, the GCA module captures the global representations of class-wise context modeling to circumvent background interference; the LCA modules generate local class representations as intermediate aware elements, indirectly associating pixels with global class representations to reduce variance within a class; and a multi-scale architecture with GCA and LCA modules yields effective segmentation of objects at different scales via cascaded refinement and fusion of features. Through the evaluation on the ISPRS Vaihingen dataset and the ISPRS Potsdam dataset, experimental results indicate that LoG-CAN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for general semantic segmentation, while significantly reducing network parameters and computation.

Efficient Semantic Segmentation by Altering Resolutions for Compressed Videos,"Video semantic segmentation (VSS) is a computationally expensive task due to the per-frame prediction for videos of high frame rates. In recent work, compact models or adaptive network strategies have been proposed for efficient VSS. However, they did not consider a crucial factor that affects the computational cost from the input side: the input resolution. In this paper, we propose an altering resolution framework called AR-Seg for compressed videos to achieve efficient VSS. AR-Seg aims to reduce the computational cost by using low resolution for non-keyframes. To prevent the performance degradation caused by downsampling, we design a Cross Resolution Feature Fusion (CReFF) module, and supervise it with a novel Feature Similarity Training (FST) strategy. Specifically, CReFF first makes use of motion vectors stored in a compressed video to warp features from high-resolution keyframes to low-resolution non-keyframes for better spatial alignment, and then selectively aggregates the warped features with local attention mechanism. Furthermore, the proposed FST supervises the aggregated features with high-resolution features through an explicit similarity loss and an implicit constraint from the shared decoding layer. Extensive experiments on CamVid and Cityscapes show that AR-Seg achieves state-of-the-art performance and is compatible with different segmentation backbones. On CamVid, AR-Seg saves 67% computational cost (measured in GFLOPs) with the PSPNet18 backbone while maintaining high segmentation accuracy. Code: https://github.com/THU-LYJ-Lab/AR-Seg."
Mirror U-Net: Marrying Multimodal Fission with Multi-task Learning for Semantic Segmentation in Medical Imaging,"Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Computer Tomography (CT) are routinely used together to detect tumors. PET/CT segmentation models can automate tumor delineation, however, current multimodal models do not fully exploit the complementary information in each modality, as they either concatenate PET and CT data or fuse them at the decision level. To combat this, we propose Mirror U-Net, which replaces traditional fusion methods with multimodal fission by factorizing the multimodal representation into modality-specific branches and an auxiliary multimodal decoder. At these branches, Mirror U-Net assigns a task tailored to each modality to reinforce unimodal features while preserving multimodal features in the shared representation. In contrast to previous methods that use either fission or multi-task learning, Mirror U-Net combines both paradigms in a unified framework. We explore various task combinations and examine which parameters to share in the model. We evaluate Mirror U-Net on the AutoPET PET/CT and on the multimodal MSD BrainTumor datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in multimodal segmentation and achieving state-of-the-art performance on both datasets. Our code will be made publicly available."
Semantics-Aware Dynamic Localization and Refinement for Referring Image Segmentation,"Referring image segmentation segments an image from a language expression. With the aim of producing high-quality masks, existing methods often adopt iterative learning approaches that rely on RNNs or stacked attention layers to refine vision-language features. Despite their complexity, RNN-based methods are subject to specific encoder choices, while attention-based methods offer limited gains. In this work, we introduce a simple yet effective alternative for progressively learning discriminative multi-modal features. The core idea of our approach is to leverage a continuously updated query as the representation of the target object and at each iteration, strengthen multi-modal features strongly correlated to the query while weakening less related ones. As the query is initialized by language features and successively updated by object features, our algorithm gradually shifts from being localization-centric to segmentation-centric. This strategy enables the incremental recovery of missing object parts and/or removal of extraneous parts through iteration. Compared to its counterparts, our method is more versatile\unicode{x2014}it can be plugged into prior arts straightforwardly and consistently bring improvements. Experimental results on the challenging datasets of RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and G-Ref demonstrate its advantage with respect to the state-of-the-art methods."
Explainable Semantic Medical Image Segmentation with Style,"Semantic medical image segmentation using deep learning has recently achieved high accuracy, making it appealing to clinical problems such as radiation therapy. However, the lack of high-quality semantically labelled data remains a challenge leading to model brittleness to small shifts to input data. Most works require extra data for semi-supervised learning and lack the interpretability of the boundaries of the training data distribution during training, which is essential for model deployment in clinical practice. We propose a fully supervised generative framework that can achieve generalisable segmentation with only limited labelled data by simultaneously constructing an explorable manifold during training. The proposed approach creates medical image style paired with a segmentation task driven discriminator incorporating end-to-end adversarial training. The discriminator is generalised to small domain shifts as much as permissible by the training data, and the generator automatically diversifies the training samples using a manifold of input features learnt during segmentation. All the while, the discriminator guides the manifold learning by supervising the semantic content and fine-grained features separately during the image diversification. After training, visualisation of the learnt manifold from the generator is available to interpret the model limits. Experiments on a fully semantic, publicly available pelvis dataset demonstrated that our method is more generalisable to shifts than other state-of-the-art methods while being more explainable using an explorable manifold."
Iterative Few-shot Semantic Segmentation from Image Label Text,"Few-shot semantic segmentation aims to learn to segment unseen class objects with the guidance of only a few support images. Most previous methods rely on the pixel-level label of support images. In this paper, we focus on a more challenging setting, in which only the image-level labels are available. We propose a general framework to firstly generate coarse masks with the help of the powerful vision-language model CLIP, and then iteratively and mutually refine the mask predictions of support and query images. Extensive experiments on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i datasets demonstrate that our method not only outperforms the state-of-the-art weakly supervised approaches by a significant margin, but also achieves comparable or better results to recent supervised methods. Moreover, our method owns an excellent generalization ability for the images in the wild and uncommon classes. Code will be available at https://github.com/Whileherham/IMR-HSNet."
Contrastive Model Adaptation for Cross-Condition Robustness in Semantic Segmentation,"Standard unsupervised domain adaptation methods adapt models from a source to a target domain using labeled source data and unlabeled target data jointly. In model adaptation, on the other hand, access to the labeled source data is prohibited, i.e., only the source-trained model and unlabeled target data are available. We investigate normal-to-adverse condition model adaptation for semantic segmentation, whereby image-level correspondences are available in the target domain. The target set consists of unlabeled pairs of adverse- and normal-condition street images taken at GPS-matched locations. Our method -- CMA -- leverages such image pairs to learn condition-invariant features via contrastive learning. In particular, CMA encourages features in the embedding space to be grouped according to their condition-invariant semantic content and not according to the condition under which respective inputs are captured. To obtain accurate cross-domain semantic correspondences, we warp the normal image to the viewpoint of the adverse image and leverage warp-confidence scores to create robust, aggregated features. With this approach, we achieve state-of-the-art semantic segmentation performance for model adaptation on several normal-to-adverse adaptation benchmarks, such as ACDC and Dark Zurich. We also evaluate CMA on a newly procured adverse-condition generalization benchmark and report favorable results compared to standard unsupervised domain adaptation methods, despite the comparative handicap of CMA due to source data inaccessibility. Code is available at https://github.com/brdav/cma."
"A Threefold Review on Deep Semantic Segmentation: Efficiency-oriented, Temporal and Depth-aware design","Semantic image and video segmentation stand among the most important tasks in computer vision nowadays, since they provide a complete and meaningful representation of the environment by means of a dense classification of the pixels in a given scene. Recently, Deep Learning, and more precisely Convolutional Neural Networks, have boosted semantic segmentation to a new level in terms of performance and generalization capabilities. However, designing Deep Semantic Segmentation models is a complex task, as it may involve application-dependent aspects. Particularly, when considering autonomous driving applications, the robustness-efficiency trade-off, as well as intrinsic limitations - computational/memory bounds and data-scarcity - and constraints - real-time inference - should be taken into consideration. In this respect, the use of additional data modalities, such as depth perception for reasoning on the geometry of a scene, and temporal cues from videos to explore redundancy and consistency, are promising directions yet not explored to their full potential in the literature. In this paper, we conduct a survey on the most relevant and recent advances in Deep Semantic Segmentation in the context of vision for autonomous vehicles, from three different perspectives: efficiency-oriented model development for real-time operation, RGB-Depth data integration (RGB-D semantic segmentation), and the use of temporal information from videos in temporally-aware models. Our main objective is to provide a comprehensive discussion on the main methods, advantages, limitations, results and challenges faced from each perspective, so that the reader can not only get started, but also be up to date in respect to recent advances in this exciting and challenging research field."
IDA: Informed Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation,"Mixup-based data augmentation has been validated to be a critical stage in the self-training framework for unsupervised domain adaptive semantic segmentation (UDA-SS), which aims to transfer knowledge from a well-annotated (source) domain to an unlabeled (target) domain. Existing self-training methods usually adopt the popular region-based mixup techniques with a random sampling strategy, which unfortunately ignores the dynamic evolution of different semantics across various domains as training proceeds. To improve the UDA-SS performance, we propose an Informed Domain Adaptation (IDA) model, a self-training framework that mixes the data based on class-level segmentation performance, which aims to emphasize small-region semantics during mixup. In our IDA model, the class-level performance is tracked by an expected confidence score (ECS). We then use a dynamic schedule to determine the mixing ratio for data in different domains. Extensive experimental results reveal that our proposed method is able to outperform the state-of-the-art UDA-SS method by a margin of 1.1 mIoU in the adaptation of GTA-V to Cityscapes and of 0.9 mIoU in the adaptation of SYNTHIA to Cityscapes."
Exploit CAM by itself: Complementary Learning System for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) with image-level labels has long been suffering from fragmentary object regions led by Class Activation Map (CAM), which is incapable of generating fine-grained masks for semantic segmentation. To guide CAM to find more non-discriminating object patterns, this paper turns to an interesting working mechanism in agent learning named Complementary Learning System (CLS). CLS holds that the neocortex builds a sensation of general knowledge, while the hippocampus specially learns specific details, completing the learned patterns. Motivated by this simple but effective learning pattern, we propose a General-Specific Learning Mechanism (GSLM) to explicitly drive a coarse-grained CAM to a fine-grained pseudo mask. Specifically, GSLM develops a General Learning Module (GLM) and a Specific Learning Module (SLM). The GLM is trained with image-level supervision to extract coarse and general localization representations from CAM. Based on the general knowledge in the GLM, the SLM progressively exploits the specific spatial knowledge from the localization representations, expanding the CAM in an explicit way. To this end, we propose the Seed Reactivation to help SLM reactivate non-discriminating regions by setting a boundary for activation values, which successively identifies more regions of CAM. Without extra refinement processes, our method is able to achieve breakthrough improvements for CAM of over 20.0% mIoU on PASCAL VOC 2012 and 10.0% mIoU on MS COCO 2014 datasets, representing a new state-of-the-art among existing WSSS methods."
Generalized Semantic Segmentation by Self-Supervised Source Domain Projection and Multi-Level Contrastive Learning,"Deep networks trained on the source domain show degraded performance when tested on unseen target domain data. To enhance the model's generalization ability, most existing domain generalization methods learn domain invariant features by suppressing domain sensitive features. Different from them, we propose a Domain Projection and Contrastive Learning (DPCL) approach for generalized semantic segmentation, which includes two modules: Self-supervised Source Domain Projection (SSDP) and Multi-level Contrastive Learning (MLCL). SSDP aims to reduce domain gap by projecting data to the source domain, while MLCL is a learning scheme to learn discriminative and generalizable features on the projected data. During test time, we first project the target data by SSDP to mitigate domain shift, then generate the segmentation results by the learned segmentation network based on MLCL. At test time, we can update the projected data by minimizing our proposed pixel-to-pixel contrastive loss to obtain better results. Extensive experiments for semantic segmentation demonstrate the favorable generalization capability of our method on benchmark datasets."
Delivering Arbitrary-Modal Semantic Segmentation,"Multimodal fusion can make semantic segmentation more robust. However, fusing an arbitrary number of modalities remains underexplored. To delve into this problem, we create the DeLiVER arbitrary-modal segmentation benchmark, covering Depth, LiDAR, multiple Views, Events, and RGB. Aside from this, we provide this dataset in four severe weather conditions as well as five sensor failure cases to exploit modal complementarity and resolve partial outages. To make this possible, we present the arbitrary cross-modal segmentation model CMNeXt. It encompasses a Self-Query Hub (SQ-Hub) designed to extract effective information from any modality for subsequent fusion with the RGB representation and adds only negligible amounts of parameters (~0.01M) per additional modality. On top, to efficiently and flexibly harvest discriminative cues from the auxiliary modalities, we introduce the simple Parallel Pooling Mixer (PPX). With extensive experiments on a total of six benchmarks, our CMNeXt achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DeLiVER, KITTI-360, MFNet, NYU Depth V2, UrbanLF, and MCubeS datasets, allowing to scale from 1 to 81 modalities. On the freshly collected DeLiVER, the quad-modal CMNeXt reaches up to 66.30% in mIoU with a +9.10% gain as compared to the mono-modal baseline. The DeLiVER dataset and our code are at: https://jamycheung.github.io/DELIVER.html."
Conflict-Based Cross-View Consistency for Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSS) has recently gained increasing research interest as it can reduce the requirement for large-scale fully-annotated training data. The current methods often suffer from the confirmation bias from the pseudo-labelling process, which can be alleviated by the co-training framework. The current co-training-based SSS methods rely on hand-crafted perturbations to prevent the different sub-nets from collapsing into each other, but these artificial perturbations cannot lead to the optimal solution. In this work, we propose a new conflict-based cross-view consistency (CCVC) method based on a two-branch co-training framework which aims at enforcing the two sub-nets to learn informative features from irrelevant views. In particular, we first propose a new cross-view consistency (CVC) strategy that encourages the two sub-nets to learn distinct features from the same input by introducing a feature discrepancy loss, while these distinct features are expected to generate consistent prediction scores of the input. The CVC strategy helps to prevent the two sub-nets from stepping into the collapse. In addition, we further propose a conflict-based pseudo-labelling (CPL) method to guarantee the model will learn more useful information from conflicting predictions, which will lead to a stable training process. We validate our new CCVC approach on the SSS benchmark datasets where our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/xiaoyao3302/CCVC."
Token Contrast for Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) using image-level labels typically utilizes Class Activation Map (CAM) to generate the pseudo labels. Limited by the local structure perception of CNN, CAM usually cannot identify the integral object regions. Though the recent Vision Transformer (ViT) can remedy this flaw, we observe it also brings the over-smoothing issue, \ie, the final patch tokens incline to be uniform. In this work, we propose Token Contrast (ToCo) to address this issue and further explore the virtue of ViT for WSSS. Firstly, motivated by the observation that intermediate layers in ViT can still retain semantic diversity, we designed a Patch Token Contrast module (PTC). PTC supervises the final patch tokens with the pseudo token relations derived from intermediate layers, allowing them to align the semantic regions and thus yield more accurate CAM. Secondly, to further differentiate the low-confidence regions in CAM, we devised a Class Token Contrast module (CTC) inspired by the fact that class tokens in ViT can capture high-level semantics. CTC facilitates the representation consistency between uncertain local regions and global objects by contrasting their class tokens. Experiments on the PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets show the proposed ToCo can remarkably surpass other single-stage competitors and achieve comparable performance with state-of-the-art multi-stage methods. Code is available at https://github.com/rulixiang/ToCo."
Multi-Source Soft Pseudo-Label Learning with Domain Similarity-based Weighting for Semantic Segmentation,"This paper describes a method of domain adaptive training for semantic segmentation using multiple source datasets that are not necessarily relevant to the target dataset. We propose a soft pseudo-label generation method by integrating predicted object probabilities from multiple source models. The prediction of each source model is weighted based on the estimated domain similarity between the source and the target datasets to emphasize contribution of a model trained on a source that is more similar to the target and generate reasonable pseudo-labels. We also propose a training method using the soft pseudo-labels considering their entropy to fully exploit information from the source datasets while suppressing the influence of possibly misclassified pixels. The experiments show comparative or better performance than our previous work and another existing multi-source domain adaptation method, and applicability to a variety of target environments."
Spatial Layout Consistency for 3D Semantic Segmentation,"Due to the aged nature of much of the utility network infrastructure, developing a robust and trustworthy computer vision system capable of inspecting it with minimal human intervention has attracted considerable research attention. The airborne laser terrain mapping (ALTM) system quickly becomes the central data collection system among the numerous available sensors. Its ability to penetrate foliage with high-powered energy provides wide coverage and achieves survey-grade ranging accuracy. However, the post-data acquisition process for classifying the ALTM's dense and irregular point clouds is a critical bottleneck that must be addressed to improve efficiency and accuracy. We introduce a novel deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) technique for achieving voxel-based semantic segmentation of the ALTM's point clouds. The suggested deep learning method, Semantic Utility Network (SUNet) is a multi-dimensional and multi-resolution network. SUNet combines two networks: one classifies point clouds at multi-resolution with object categories in three dimensions and another predicts two-dimensional regional labels distinguishing corridor regions from non-corridors. A significant innovation of the SUNet is that it imposes spatial layout consistency on the outcomes of voxel-based and regional segmentation results. The proposed multi-dimensional DCNN combines hierarchical context for spatial layout embedding with a coarse-to-fine strategy. We conducted a comprehensive ablation study to test SUNet's performance using 67 km x 67 km of utility corridor data at a density of 5pp/m2. Our experiments demonstrated that SUNet's spatial layout consistency and a multi-resolution feature aggregation could significantly improve performance, outperforming the SOTA baseline network and achieving a good F1 score for pylon 89%, ground 99%, vegetation 99% and powerline 98% classes."
DMSA: Dynamic Multi-scale Unsupervised Semantic Segmentation Based on Adaptive Affinity,"The proposed method in this paper proposes an end-to-end unsupervised semantic segmentation architecture DMSA based on four loss functions. The framework uses Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) module to enhance feature extraction. At the same time, a dynamic dilation strategy is designed to better capture multi-scale context information. Secondly, a Pixel-Adaptive Refinement (PAR) module is introduced, which can adaptively refine the initial pseudo labels after feature fusion to obtain high quality pseudo labels. Experiments show that the proposed DSMA framework is superior to the existing methods on the saliency dataset. On the COCO 80 dataset, the MIoU is improved by 2.0, and the accuracy is improved by 5.39. On the Pascal VOC 2012 Augmented dataset, the MIoU is improved by 4.9, and the accuracy is improved by 3.4. In addition, the convergence speed of the model is also greatly improved after the introduction of the PAR module."
TransAdapt: A Transformative Framework for Online Test Time Adaptive Semantic Segmentation,"Test-time adaptive (TTA) semantic segmentation adapts a source pre-trained image semantic segmentation model to unlabeled batches of target domain test images, different from real-world, where samples arrive one-by-one in an online fashion. To tackle online settings, we propose TransAdapt, a framework that uses transformer and input transformations to improve segmentation performance. Specifically, we pre-train a transformer-based module on a segmentation network that transforms unsupervised segmentation output to a more reliable supervised output, without requiring test-time online training. To also facilitate test-time adaptation, we propose an unsupervised loss based on the transformed input that enforces the model to be invariant and equivariant to photometric and geometric perturbations, respectively. Overall, our framework produces higher quality segmentation masks with up to 17.6% and 2.8% mIOU improvement over no-adaptation and competitive baselines, respectively."
Foundation Model Drives Weakly Incremental Learning for Semantic Segmentation,"Modern incremental learning for semantic segmentation methods usually learn new categories based on dense annotations. Although achieve promising results, pixel-by-pixel labeling is costly and time-consuming. Weakly incremental learning for semantic segmentation (WILSS) is a novel and attractive task, which aims at learning to segment new classes from cheap and widely available image-level labels. Despite the comparable results, the image-level labels can not provide details to locate each segment, which limits the performance of WILSS. This inspires us to think how to improve and effectively utilize the supervision of new classes given image-level labels while avoiding forgetting old ones. In this work, we propose a novel and data-efficient framework for WILSS, named FMWISS. Specifically, we propose pre-training based co-segmentation to distill the knowledge of complementary foundation models for generating dense pseudo labels. We further optimize the noisy pseudo masks with a teacher-student architecture, where a plug-in teacher is optimized with a proposed dense contrastive loss. Moreover, we introduce memory-based copy-paste augmentation to improve the catastrophic forgetting problem of old classes. Extensive experiments on Pascal VOC and COCO datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our framework, e.g., FMWISS achieves 70.7% and 73.3% in the 15-5 VOC setting, outperforming the state-of-the-art method by 3.4% and 6.1%, respectively."
A Language-Guided Benchmark for Weakly Supervised Open Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation,"Increasing attention is being diverted to data-efficient problem settings like Open Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS) which deals with segmenting an arbitrary object that may or may not be seen during training. The closest standard problems related to OVSS are Zero-Shot and Few-Shot Segmentation (ZSS, FSS) and their Cross-dataset variants where zero to few annotations are needed to segment novel classes. The existing FSS and ZSS methods utilize fully supervised pixel-labelled seen classes to segment unseen classes. Pixel-level labels are hard to obtain, and using weak supervision in the form of inexpensive image-level labels is often more practical. To this end, we propose a novel unified weakly supervised OVSS pipeline that can perform ZSS, FSS and Cross-dataset segmentation on novel classes without using pixel-level labels for either the base (seen) or the novel (unseen) classes in an inductive setting. We propose Weakly-Supervised Language-Guided Segmentation Network (WLSegNet), a novel language-guided segmentation pipeline that i) learns generalizable context vectors with batch aggregates (mean) to map class prompts to image features using frozen CLIP (a vision-language model) and ii) decouples weak ZSS/FSS into weak semantic segmentation and Zero-Shot segmentation. The learned context vectors avoid overfitting on seen classes during training and transfer better to novel classes during testing. WLSegNet avoids fine-tuning and the use of external datasets during training. The proposed pipeline beats existing methods for weak generalized Zero-Shot and weak Few-Shot semantic segmentation by 39 and 3 mIOU points respectively on PASCAL VOC and weak Few-Shot semantic segmentation by 5 mIOU points on MS COCO. On a harder setting of 2-way 1-shot weak FSS, WLSegNet beats the baselines by 13 and 22 mIOU points on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO, respectively."
Soft labelling for semantic segmentation: Bringing coherence to label down-sampling,"In semantic segmentation, training data down-sampling is commonly performed due to limited resources, the need to adapt image size to the model input, or improve data augmentation. This down-sampling typically employs different strategies for the image data and the annotated labels. Such discrepancy leads to mismatches between the down-sampled color and label images. Hence, the training performance significantly decreases as the down-sampling factor increases. In this paper, we bring together the down-sampling strategies for the image data and the training labels. To that aim, we propose a novel framework for label down-sampling via soft-labeling that better conserves label information after down-sampling. Therefore, fully aligning soft-labels with image data to keep the distribution of the sampled pixels. This proposal also produces reliable annotations for under-represented semantic classes. Altogether, it allows training competitive models at lower resolutions. Experiments show that the proposal outperforms other down-sampling strategies. Moreover, state-of-the-art performance is achieved for reference benchmarks, but employing significantly less computational resources than foremost approaches. This proposal enables competitive research for semantic segmentation under resource constraints."
Self Correspondence Distillation for End-to-End Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Efficiently training accurate deep models for weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) with image-level labels is challenging and important. Recently, end-to-end WSSS methods have become the focus of research due to their high training efficiency. However, current methods suffer from insufficient extraction of comprehensive semantic information, resulting in low-quality pseudo-labels and sub-optimal solutions for end-to-end WSSS. To this end, we propose a simple and novel Self Correspondence Distillation (SCD) method to refine pseudo-labels without introducing external supervision. Our SCD enables the network to utilize feature correspondence derived from itself as a distillation target, which can enhance the network's feature learning process by complementing semantic information. In addition, to further improve the segmentation accuracy, we design a Variation-aware Refine Module to enhance the local consistency of pseudo-labels by computing pixel-level variation. Finally, we present an efficient end-to-end Transformer-based framework (TSCD) via SCD and Variation-aware Refine Module for the accurate WSSS task. Extensive experiments on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.  Our code is available at {https://github.com/Rongtao-Xu/RepresentationLearning/tree/main/SCD-AAAI2023}."
"COVERED, CollabOratiVE Robot Environment Dataset for 3D Semantic segmentation","Safe human-robot collaboration (HRC) has recently gained a lot of interest with the emerging Industry 5.0 paradigm. Conventional robots are being replaced with more intelligent and flexible collaborative robots (cobots). Safe and efficient collaboration between cobots and humans largely relies on the cobot's comprehensive semantic understanding of the dynamic surrounding of industrial environments. Despite the importance of semantic understanding for such applications, 3D semantic segmentation of collaborative robot workspaces lacks sufficient research and dedicated datasets. The performance limitation caused by insufficient datasets is called 'data hunger' problem. To overcome this current limitation, this work develops a new dataset specifically designed for this use case, named ""COVERED"", which includes point-wise annotated point clouds of a robotic cell. Lastly, we also provide a benchmark of current state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithm performance on the dataset and demonstrate a real-time semantic segmentation of a collaborative robot workspace using a multi-LiDAR system. The promising results from using the trained Deep Networks on a real-time dynamically changing situation shows that we are on the right track. Our perception pipeline achieves 20Hz throughput with a prediction point accuracy of >96\% and >92\% mean intersection over union (mIOU) while maintaining an 8Hz throughput."
An Iterative Classification and Semantic Segmentation Network for Old Landslide Detection Using High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images,"Huge challenges exist for old landslide detection because their morphology features have been partially or strongly transformed over a long time and have little difference from their surrounding. Besides, small-sample problem also restrict in-depth learning.  In this paper, an iterative classification and semantic segmentation network (ICSSN) is developed, which can greatly enhance both object-level and pixel-level classification performance by iteratively upgrading the feature extractor shared by two network. An object-level contrastive learning (OCL) strategy is employed in the object classification sub-network featuring a siamese network to realize the global features extraction, and a sub-object-level contrastive learning (SOCL) paradigm is designed in the semantic segmentation sub-network to efficiently extract salient features from boundaries of landslides. Moreover, an iterative training strategy is elaborated to fuse features in semantic space such that both object-level and pixel-level classification performance are improved.  The proposed ICSSN is evaluated on the real landslide data set, and the experimental results show that ICSSN can greatly improve the classification and segmentation accuracy of old landslide detection. For the semantic segmentation task, compared to the baseline, the F1 score increases from 0.5054 to 0.5448, the mIoU improves from 0.6405 to 0.6610, the landslide IoU improved from 0.3381 to 0.3743, and the object-level detection accuracy of old landslides is enhanced from 0.55 to 0.9. For the object classification task, the F1 score increases from 0.8846 to 0.9230, and the accuracy score is up from 0.8375 to 0.8875."
A Convolutional Vision Transformer for Semantic Segmentation of Side-Scan Sonar Data,"Distinguishing among different marine benthic habitat characteristics is of key importance in a wide set of seabed operations ranging from installations of oil rigs to laying networks of cables and monitoring the impact of humans on marine ecosystems. The Side-Scan Sonar (SSS) is a widely used imaging sensor in this regard. It produces high-resolution seafloor maps by logging the intensities of sound waves reflected back from the seafloor. In this work, we leverage these acoustic intensity maps to produce pixel-wise categorization of different seafloor types. We propose a novel architecture adapted from the Vision Transformer (ViT) in an encoder-decoder framework. Further, in doing so, the applicability of ViTs is evaluated on smaller datasets. To overcome the lack of CNN-like inductive biases, thereby making ViTs more conducive to applications in low data regimes, we propose a novel feature extraction module to replace the Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) block within transformer layers and a novel module to extract multiscale patch embeddings. A lightweight decoder is also proposed to complement this design in order to further boost multiscale feature extraction. With the modified architecture, we achieve state-of-the-art results and also meet real-time computational requirements. We make our code available at ~\url{https://github.com/hayatrajani/s3seg-vit"
Side Adapter Network for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation,"This paper presents a new framework for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation with the pre-trained vision-language model, named Side Adapter Network (SAN). Our approach models the semantic segmentation task as a region recognition problem. A side network is attached to a frozen CLIP model with two branches: one for predicting mask proposals, and the other for predicting attention bias which is applied in the CLIP model to recognize the class of masks. This decoupled design has the benefit CLIP in recognizing the class of mask proposals. Since the attached side network can reuse CLIP features, it can be very light. In addition, the entire network can be trained end-to-end, allowing the side network to be adapted to the frozen CLIP model, which makes the predicted mask proposals CLIP-aware. Our approach is fast, accurate, and only adds a few additional trainable parameters. We evaluate our approach on multiple semantic segmentation benchmarks. Our method significantly outperforms other counterparts, with up to 18 times fewer trainable parameters and 19 times faster inference speed. We hope our approach will serve as a solid baseline and help ease future research in open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. The code will be available at https://github.com/MendelXu/SAN."
Pixel Difference Convolutional Network for RGB-D Semantic Segmentation,"RGB-D semantic segmentation can be advanced with convolutional neural networks due to the availability of Depth data. Although objects cannot be easily discriminated by just the 2D appearance, with the local pixel difference and geometric patterns in Depth, they can be well separated in some cases. Considering the fixed grid kernel structure, CNNs are limited to lack the ability to capture detailed, fine-grained information and thus cannot achieve accurate pixel-level semantic segmentation. To solve this problem, we propose a Pixel Difference Convolutional Network (PDCNet) to capture detailed intrinsic patterns by aggregating both intensity and gradient information in the local range for Depth data and global range for RGB data, respectively. Precisely, PDCNet consists of a Depth branch and an RGB branch. For the Depth branch, we propose a Pixel Difference Convolution (PDC) to consider local and detailed geometric information in Depth data via aggregating both intensity and gradient information. For the RGB branch, we contribute a lightweight Cascade Large Kernel (CLK) to extend PDC, namely CPDC, to enjoy global contexts for RGB data and further boost performance. Consequently, both modal data's local and global pixel differences are seamlessly incorporated into PDCNet during the information propagation process. Experiments on two challenging benchmark datasets, i.e., NYUDv2 and SUN RGB-D reveal that our PDCNet achieves state-of-the-art performance for the semantic segmentation task."
Efficient Context Integration through Factorized Pyramidal Learning for Ultra-Lightweight Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation is a pixel-level prediction task to classify each pixel of the input image. Deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have been extremely successful in achieving excellent performances in this domain. However, mobile application, such as autonomous driving, demand real-time processing of incoming stream of images. Hence, achieving efficient architectures along with enhanced accuracy is of paramount importance. Since, accuracy and model size of CNNs are intrinsically contentious in nature, the challenge is to achieve a decent trade-off between accuracy and model size. To address this, we propose a novel Factorized Pyramidal Learning (FPL) module to aggregate rich contextual information in an efficient manner. On one hand, it uses a bank of convolutional filters with multiple dilation rates which leads to multi-scale context aggregation; crucial in achieving better accuracy. On the other hand, parameters are reduced by a careful factorization of the employed filters; crucial in achieving lightweight models. Moreover, we decompose the spatial pyramid into two stages which enables a simple and efficient feature fusion within the module to solve the notorious checkerboard effect. We also design a dedicated Feature-Image Reinforcement (FIR) unit to carry out the fusion operation of shallow and deep features with the downsampled versions of the input image. This gives an accuracy enhancement without increasing model parameters. Based on the FPL module and FIR unit, we propose an ultra-lightweight real-time network, called FPLNet, which achieves state-of-the-art accuracy-efficiency trade-off. More specifically, with only less than 0.5 million parameters, the proposed network achieves 66.93\% and 66.28\% mIoU on Cityscapes validation and test set, respectively. Moreover, FPLNet has a processing speed of 95.5 frames per second (FPS)."
Effects of Architectures on Continual Semantic Segmentation,"Research in the field of Continual Semantic Segmentation is mainly investigating novel learning algorithms to overcome catastrophic forgetting of neural networks. Most recent publications have focused on improving learning algorithms without distinguishing effects caused by the choice of neural architecture.Therefore, we study how the choice of neural network architecture affects catastrophic forgetting in class- and domain-incremental semantic segmentation. Specifically, we compare the well-researched CNNs to recently proposed Transformers and Hybrid architectures, as well as the impact of the choice of novel normalization layers and different decoder heads. We find that traditional CNNs like ResNet have high plasticity but low stability, while transformer architectures are much more stable. When the inductive biases of CNN architectures are combined with transformers in hybrid architectures, it leads to higher plasticity and stability. The stability of these models can be explained by their ability to learn general features that are robust against distribution shifts. Experiments with different normalization layers show that Continual Normalization achieves the best trade-off in terms of adaptability and stability of the model. In the class-incremental setting, the choice of the normalization layer has much less impact. Our experiments suggest that the right choice of architecture can significantly reduce forgetting even with naive fine-tuning and confirm that for real-world applications, the architecture is an important factor in designing a continual learning model."
Semantic Segmentation of Urban Textured Meshes Through Point Sampling,"Textured meshes are becoming an increasingly popular representation combining the 3D geometry and radiometry of real scenes. However, semantic segmentation algorithms for urban mesh have been little investigated and do not exploit all radiometric information. To address this problem, we adopt an approach consisting in sampling a point cloud from the textured mesh, then using a point cloud semantic segmentation algorithm on this cloud, and finally using the obtained semantic to segment the initial mesh. In this paper, we study the influence of different parameters such as the sampling method, the density of the extracted cloud, the features selected (color, normal, elevation) as well as the number of points used at each training period. Our result outperforms the state-of-the-art on the SUM dataset, earning about 4 points in OA and 18 points in mIoU."
Few-Shot Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation via Contrastive Self-Supervision and Multi-Resolution Attention,"This paper presents an effective few-shot point cloud semantic segmentation approach for real-world applications. Existing few-shot segmentation methods on point cloud heavily rely on the fully-supervised pretrain with large annotated datasets, which causes the learned feature extraction bias to those pretrained classes. However, as the purpose of few-shot learning is to handle unknown/unseen classes, such class-specific feature extraction in pretrain is not ideal to generalize into new classes for few-shot learning. Moreover, point cloud datasets hardly have a large number of classes due to the annotation difficulty. To address these issues, we propose a contrastive self-supervision framework for few-shot learning pretrain, which aims to eliminate the feature extraction bias through class-agnostic contrastive supervision. Specifically, we implement a novel contrastive learning approach with a learnable augmentor for a 3D point cloud to achieve point-wise differentiation, so that to enhance the pretrain with managed overfitting through the self-supervision. Furthermore, we develop a multi-resolution attention module using both the nearest and farthest points to extract the local and global point information more effectively, and a center-concentrated multi-prototype is adopted to mitigate the intra-class sparsity. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed approach, which shows our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, a case study on practical CAM/CAD segmentation is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for real-world applications."
Lightweight Real-time Semantic Segmentation Network with Efficient Transformer and CNN,"In the past decade, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown prominence for semantic segmentation. Although CNN models have very impressive performance, the ability to capture global representation is still insufficient, which results in suboptimal results. Recently, Transformer achieved huge success in NLP tasks, demonstrating its advantages in modeling long-range dependency. Recently, Transformer has also attracted tremendous attention from computer vision researchers who reformulate the image processing tasks as a sequence-to-sequence prediction but resulted in deteriorating local feature details. In this work, we propose a lightweight real-time semantic segmentation network called LETNet. LETNet combines a U-shaped CNN with Transformer effectively in a capsule embedding style to compensate for respective deficiencies. Meanwhile, the elaborately designed Lightweight Dilated Bottleneck (LDB) module and Feature Enhancement (FE) module cultivate a positive impact on training from scratch simultaneously. Extensive experiments performed on challenging datasets demonstrate that LETNet achieves superior performances in accuracy and efficiency balance. Specifically, It only contains 0.95M parameters and 13.6G FLOPs but yields 72.8\% mIoU at 120 FPS on the Cityscapes test set and 70.5\% mIoU at 250 FPS on the CamVid test dataset using a single RTX 3090 GPU. The source code will be available at https://github.com/IVIPLab/LETNet."
Hadamard Layer to Improve Semantic Segmentation,"The Hadamard Layer, a simple and computationally efficient way to improve results in semantic segmentation tasks, is presented. This layer has no free parameters that require to be trained. Therefore it does not increase the number of model parameters, and the extra computational cost is marginal. Experimental results show that the new Hadamard layer substantially improves the performance of the investigated models (variants of the Pix2Pix model). The performance's improvement can be explained by the Hadamard layer forcing the network to produce an internal encoding of the classes so that all bins are active. Therefore, the network computation is more distributed. In a sort that the Hadamard layer requires that to change the predicted class, it is necessary to modify 2^{k-1} bins, assuming k bins in the encoding. A specific loss function allows a stable and fast training convergence."
ViewCo: Discovering Text-Supervised Segmentation Masks via Multi-View Semantic Consistency,"Recently, great success has been made in learning visual representations from text supervision, facilitating the emergence of text-supervised semantic segmentation. However, existing works focus on pixel grouping and cross-modal semantic alignment, while ignoring the correspondence among multiple augmented views of the same image. To overcome such limitation, we propose multi-\textbf{View} \textbf{Co}nsistent learning (ViewCo) for text-supervised semantic segmentation. Specifically, we first propose text-to-views consistency modeling to learn correspondence for multiple views of the same input image. Additionally, we propose cross-view segmentation consistency modeling to address the ambiguity issue of text supervision by contrasting the segment features of Siamese visual encoders. The text-to-views consistency benefits the dense assignment of the visual features by encouraging different crops to align with the same text, while the cross-view segmentation consistency modeling provides additional self-supervision, overcoming the limitation of ambiguous text supervision for segmentation masks. Trained with large-scale image-text data, our model can directly segment objects of arbitrary categories in a zero-shot manner. Extensive experiments show that ViewCo outperforms state-of-the-art methods on average by up to 2.9\%, 1.6\%, and 2.4\% mIoU on PASCAL VOC2012, PASCAL Context, and COCO, respectively."
A Survey on Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation is one of the most challenging tasks in computer vision. However, in many applications, a frequent obstacle is the lack of labeled images, due to the high cost of pixel-level labeling. In this scenario, it makes sense to approach the problem from a semi-supervised point of view, where both labeled and unlabeled images are exploited. In recent years this line of research has gained much interest and many approaches have been published in this direction. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to provide an overview of the current state of the art in semi-supervised semantic segmentation, offering an updated taxonomy of all existing methods to date. This is complemented by an experimentation with a variety of models representing all the categories of the taxonomy on the most widely used becnhmark datasets in the literature, and a final discussion on the results obtained, the challenges and the most promising lines of future research."
TAX: Tendency-and-Assignment Explainer for Semantic Segmentation with Multi-Annotators,"To understand how deep neural networks perform classification predictions, recent research attention has been focusing on developing techniques to offer desirable explanations. However, most existing methods cannot be easily applied for semantic segmentation; moreover, they are not designed to offer interpretability under the multi-annotator setting. Instead of viewing ground-truth pixel-level labels annotated by a single annotator with consistent labeling tendency, we aim at providing interpretable semantic segmentation and answer two critical yet practical questions: ""who"" contributes to the resulting segmentation, and ""why"" such an assignment is determined. In this paper, we present a learning framework of Tendency-and-Assignment Explainer (TAX), designed to offer interpretability at the annotator and assignment levels. More specifically, we learn convolution kernel subsets for modeling labeling tendencies of each type of annotation, while a prototype bank is jointly observed to offer visual guidance for learning the above kernels. For evaluation, we consider both synthetic and real-world datasets with multi-annotators. We show that our TAX can be applied to state-of-the-art network architectures with comparable performances, while segmentation interpretability at both levels can be offered accordingly."
Few-shot 3D LiDAR Semantic Segmentation for Autonomous Driving,"In autonomous driving, the novel objects and lack of annotations challenge the traditional 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation based on deep learning. Few-shot learning is a feasible way to solve these issues. However, currently few-shot semantic segmentation methods focus on camera data, and most of them only predict the novel classes without considering the base classes. This setting cannot be directly applied to autonomous driving due to safety concerns. Thus, we propose a few-shot 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation method that predicts both novel classes and base classes simultaneously. Our method tries to solve the background ambiguity problem in generalized few-shot semantic segmentation. We first review the original cross-entropy and knowledge distillation losses, then propose a new loss function that incorporates the background information to achieve 3D LiDAR few-shot semantic segmentation. Extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."
TransUPR: A Transformer-based Uncertain Point Refiner for LiDAR Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation,"In this work, we target the problem of uncertain points refinement for image-based LiDAR point cloud semantic segmentation (LiDAR PCSS). This problem mainly results from the boundary-blurring problem of convolution neural networks (CNNs) and quantitation loss of spherical projection, which are often hard to avoid for common image-based LiDAR PCSS approaches. We propose a plug-and-play transformer-based uncertain point refiner (TransUPR) to address the problem. Through local feature aggregation, uncertain point localization, and self-attention-based transformer design, TransUPR, integrated into an existing range image-based LiDAR PCSS approach (e.g., CENet), achieves the state-of-the-art performance (68.2% mIoU) on Semantic-KITTI benchmark, which provides a performance improvement of 0.6% on the mIoU."
Local-to-Global Information Communication for Real-Time Semantic Segmentation Network Search,"Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has shown great potentials in automatically designing neural network architectures for real-time semantic segmentation. Unlike previous works that utilize a simplified search space with cell-sharing way, we introduce a new search space where a lightweight model can be more effectively searched by replacing the cell-sharing manner with cell-independent one. Based on this, the communication of local to global information is achieved through two well-designed modules. For local information exchange, a graph convolutional network (GCN) guided module is seamlessly integrated as a communication deliver between cells. For global information aggregation, we propose a novel dense-connected fusion module (cell) which aggregates long-range multi-level features in the network automatically. In addition, a latency-oriented constraint is endowed into the search process to balance the accuracy and latency. We name the proposed framework as Local-to-Global Information Communication Network Search (LGCNet). Extensive experiments on Cityscapes and CamVid datasets demonstrate that LGCNet achieves the new state-of-the-art trade-off between accuracy and speed. In particular, on Cityscapes dataset, LGCNet achieves the new best performance of 74.0\% mIoU with the speed of 115.2 FPS on Titan Xp."
Navya3DSeg -- Navya 3D Semantic Segmentation Dataset & split generation for autonomous vehicles,"Autonomous driving (AD) perception today relies heavily on deep learning based architectures requiring large scale annotated datasets with their associated costs for curation and annotation. The 3D semantic data are useful for core perception tasks such as obstacle detection and ego-vehicle localization. We propose a new dataset, Navya 3D Segmentation (Navya3DSeg), with a diverse label space corresponding to a large scale production grade operational domain, including rural, urban, industrial sites and universities from 13 countries. It contains 23 labeled sequences and 25 supplementary sequences without labels, designed to explore self-supervised and semi-supervised semantic segmentation benchmarks on point clouds. We also propose a novel method for sequential dataset split generation based on iterative multi-label stratification, and demonstrated to achieve a +1.2% mIoU improvement over the original split proposed by SemanticKITTI dataset. A complete benchmark for semantic segmentation task was performed, with state of the art methods. Finally, we demonstrate an Active Learning (AL) based dataset distillation framework. We introduce a novel heuristic-free sampling method called ego-pose distance based sampling in the context of AL. A detailed presentation on the dataset is available here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m6ALIs-s20."
Hard-aware Instance Adaptive Self-training for Unsupervised Cross-domain Semantic Segmentation,"The divergence between labeled training data and unlabeled testing data is a significant challenge for recent deep learning models. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) attempts to solve such problem. Recent works show that self-training is a powerful approach to UDA. However, existing methods have difficulty in balancing the scalability and performance. In this paper, we propose a hard-aware instance adaptive self-training framework for UDA on the task of semantic segmentation. To effectively improve the quality and diversity of pseudo-labels, we develop a novel pseudo-label generation strategy with an instance adaptive selector. We further enrich the hard class pseudo-labels with inter-image information through a skillfully designed hard-aware pseudo-label augmentation. Besides, we propose the region-adaptive regularization to smooth the pseudo-label region and sharpen the non-pseudo-label region. For the non-pseudo-label region, consistency constraint is also constructed to introduce stronger supervision signals during model optimization. Our method is so concise and efficient that it is easy to be generalized to other UDA methods. Experiments on GTA5 to Cityscapes, SYNTHIA to Cityscapes, and Cityscapes to Oxford RobotCar demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared with the state-of-the-art methods."
A Deep Learning-based Global and Segmentation-based Semantic Feature Fusion Approach for Indoor Scene Classification,"Indoor scene classification has become an important task in perception modules and has been widely used in various applications. However, problems such as intra-category variability and inter-category similarity have been holding back the models' performance, which leads to the need for new types of features to obtain a more meaningful scene representation. A semantic segmentation mask provides pixel-level information about the objects available in the scene, which makes it a promising source of information to obtain a more meaningful local representation of the scene. Therefore, in this work, a novel approach that uses a semantic segmentation mask to obtain a 2D spatial layout of the object categories across the scene, designated by segmentation-based semantic features (SSFs), is proposed. These features represent, per object category, the pixel count, as well as the 2D average position and respective standard deviation values. Moreover, a two-branch network, GS2F2App, that exploits CNN-based global features extracted from RGB images and the segmentation-based features extracted from the proposed SSFs, is also proposed. GS2F2App was evaluated in two indoor scene benchmark datasets: the SUN RGB-D and the NYU Depth V2, achieving state-of-the-art results on both datasets."
Semantic Image Segmentation: Two Decades of Research,"Semantic image segmentation (SiS) plays a fundamental role in a broad variety of computer vision applications, providing key information for the global understanding of an image. This survey is an effort to summarize two decades of research in the field of SiS, where we propose a literature review of solutions starting from early historical methods followed by an overview of more recent deep learning methods including the latest trend of using transformers. We complement the review by discussing particular cases of the weak supervision and side machine learning techniques that can be used to improve the semantic segmentation such as curriculum, incremental or self-supervised learning.  State-of-the-art SiS models rely on a large amount of annotated samples, which are more expensive to obtain than labels for tasks such as image classification. Since unlabeled data is instead significantly cheaper to obtain, it is not surprising that Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) reached a broad success within the semantic segmentation community. Therefore, a second core contribution of this book is to summarize five years of a rapidly growing field, Domain Adaptation for Semantic Image Segmentation (DASiS) which embraces the importance of semantic segmentation itself and a critical need of adapting segmentation models to new environments. In addition to providing a comprehensive survey on DASiS techniques, we unveil also newer trends such as multi-domain learning, domain generalization, domain incremental learning, test-time adaptation and source-free domain adaptation. Finally, we conclude this survey by describing datasets and benchmarks most widely used in SiS and DASiS and briefly discuss related tasks such as instance and panoptic image segmentation, as well as applications such as medical image segmentation."
Anatomical Invariance Modeling and Semantic Alignment for Self-supervised Learning in 3D Medical Image Segmentation,"Self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently achieved promising performance for 3D medical image segmentation tasks. Most current methods follow existing SSL paradigm originally designed for photographic or natural images, which cannot explicitly and thoroughly exploit the intrinsic similar anatomical structures across varying medical images. This may in fact degrade the quality of learned deep representations by maximizing the similarity among features containing spatial misalignment information and different anatomical semantics. In this work, we propose a new self-supervised learning framework, namely Alice, that explicitly fulfills Anatomical invariance modeling and semantic alignment via elaborately combining discriminative and generative objectives. Alice introduces a new contrastive learning strategy which encourages the similarity between views that are diversely mined but with consistent high-level semantics, in order to learn invariant anatomical features. Moreover, we design a conditional anatomical feature alignment module to complement corrupted embeddings with globally matched semantics and inter-patch topology information, conditioned by the distribution of local image content, which permits to create better contrastive pairs. Our extensive quantitative experiments on two public 3D medical image segmentation benchmarks of FLARE 2022 and BTCV demonstrate and validate the performance superiority of Alice, surpassing the previous best SSL counterpart methods by 2.11% and 1.77% in Dice coefficients, respectively."
Evaluation of Data Augmentation and Loss Functions in Semantic Image Segmentation for Drilling Tool Wear Detection,"Tool wear monitoring is crucial for quality control and cost reduction in manufacturing processes, of which drilling applications are one example. In this paper, we present a U-Net based semantic image segmentation pipeline, deployed on microscopy images of cutting inserts, for the purpose of wear detection. The wear area is differentiated in two different types, resulting in a multiclass classification problem. Joining the two wear types in one general wear class, on the other hand, allows the problem to be formulated as a binary classification task. Apart from the comparison of the binary and multiclass problem, also different loss functions, i. e., Cross Entropy, Focal Cross Entropy, and a loss based on the Intersection over Union (IoU), are investigated. Furthermore, models are trained on image tiles of different sizes, and augmentation techniques of varying intensities are deployed. We find, that the best performing models are binary models, trained on data with moderate augmentation and an IoU-based loss function."
Best Practices in Active Learning for Semantic Segmentation,"Active learning is particularly of interest for semantic segmentation, where annotations are costly. Previous academic studies focused on datasets that are already very diverse and where the model is trained in a supervised manner with a large annotation budget. In contrast, data collected in many driving scenarios is highly redundant, and most medical applications are subject to very constrained annotation budgets. This work investigates the various types of existing active learning methods for semantic segmentation under diverse conditions across three dimensions - data distribution w.r.t. different redundancy levels, integration of semi-supervised learning, and different labeling budgets. We find that these three underlying factors are decisive for the selection of the best active learning approach. As an outcome of our study, we provide a comprehensive usage guide to obtain the best performance for each case. We also propose an exemplary evaluation task for driving scenarios, where data has high redundancy, to showcase the practical implications of our research findings."
SimCon Loss with Multiple Views for Text Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Learning to segment images purely by relying on the image-text alignment from web data can lead to sub-optimal performance due to noise in the data. The noise comes from the samples where the associated text does not correlate with the image's visual content. Instead of purely relying on the alignment from the noisy data, this paper proposes a novel loss function termed SimCon, which accounts for intra-modal similarities to determine the appropriate set of positive samples to align. Further, using multiple views of the image (created synthetically) for training and combining the SimCon loss with it makes the training more robust. This version of the loss is termed MV-SimCon. The empirical results demonstrate that using the proposed loss function leads to consistent improvements on zero-shot, text supervised semantic segmentation and outperforms state-of-the-art by +3.0\%, +3.3\% and +6.9\% on PASCAL VOC, PASCAL Context and MSCOCO, respectively. With test time augmentations, we set a new record by improving these results further to 58.7\%, 26.6\%, and 33.3\% on PASCAL VOC, PASCAL Context, and MSCOCO, respectively. In addition, using the proposed loss function leads to robust training and faster convergence."
From CAD models to soft point cloud labels: An automatic annotation pipeline for cheaply supervised 3D semantic segmentation,"We propose a fully automatic annotation scheme which takes a raw 3D point cloud with a set of fitted CAD models as input, and outputs convincing point-wise labels which can be used as cheap training data for point cloud segmentation. Compared to manual annotations, we show that our automatic labels are accurate while drastically reducing the annotation time, and eliminating the need for manual intervention or dataset-specific parameters. Our labeling pipeline outputs semantic classes and soft point-wise object scores which can either be binarized into standard one-hot-encoded labels, thresholded into weak labels with ambiguous points left unlabeled, or used directly as soft labels during training. We evaluate the label quality and segmentation performance of PointNet++ on a dataset of real industrial point clouds and Scan2CAD, a public dataset of indoor scenes. Our results indicate that reducing supervision in areas which are more difficult to label automatically is beneficial, compared to the conventional approach of naively assigning a hard ""best guess"" label to every point."
Semantic Diffusion Network for Semantic Segmentation,"Precise and accurate predictions over boundary areas are essential for semantic segmentation. However, the commonly-used convolutional operators tend to smooth and blur local detail cues, making it difficult for deep models to generate accurate boundary predictions. In this paper, we introduce an operator-level approach to enhance semantic boundary awareness, so as to improve the prediction of the deep semantic segmentation model. Specifically, we first formulate the boundary feature enhancement as an anisotropic diffusion process. We then propose a novel learnable approach called semantic diffusion network (SDN) to approximate the diffusion process, which contains a parameterized semantic difference convolution operator followed by a feature fusion module. Our SDN aims to construct a differentiable mapping from the original feature to the inter-class boundary-enhanced feature. The proposed SDN is an efficient and flexible module that can be easily plugged into existing encoder-decoder segmentation models. Extensive experiments show that our approach can achieve consistent improvements over several typical and state-of-the-art segmentation baseline models on challenging public benchmarks. The code will be released soon."
Leveraging weak complementary labels to improve semantic segmentation of hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma in H&E-stained slides,"In this paper, we present a deep learning segmentation approach to classify and quantify the two most prevalent primary liver cancers - hepatocellular carcinoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma - from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained whole slide images. While semantic segmentation of medical images typically requires costly pixel-level annotations by domain experts, there often exists additional information which is routinely obtained in clinical diagnostics but rarely utilized for model training. We propose to leverage such weak information from patient diagnoses by deriving complementary labels that indicate to which class a sample cannot belong to. To integrate these labels, we formulate a complementary loss for segmentation. Motivated by the medical application, we demonstrate for general segmentation tasks that including additional patches with solely weak complementary labels during model training can significantly improve the predictive performance and robustness of a model. On the task of diagnostic differentiation between hepatocellular carcinoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, we achieve a balanced accuracy of 0.91 (CI 95%: 0.86 - 0.95) at case level for 165 hold-out patients. Furthermore, we also show that leveraging complementary labels improves the robustness of segmentation and increases performance at case level."
Iterative Loop Method Combining Active and Semi-Supervised Learning for Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation is an important technique for environment perception in intelligent transportation systems. With the rapid development of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), road scene analysis can usually achieve satisfactory results in the source domain. However, guaranteeing good generalization to different target domain scenarios remains a significant challenge. Recently, semi-supervised learning and active learning have been proposed to alleviate this problem. Semisupervised learning can improve model accuracy with massive unlabeled data, but some pseudo labels containing noise would be generated with limited or imbalanced training data. And there will be suboptimal models if human guidance is absent. Active learning can select more effective data to intervene, while the model accuracy can not be improved because the massive unlabeled data are not used. And the probability of querying sub-optimal samples will increase when the domain difference is too large, increasing annotation cost. This paper proposes an iterative loop method combining active and semisupervised learning for domain adaptive semantic segmentation. The method first uses semi-supervised to learn massive unlabeled data to improve model accuracy and provide more accurate selection models for active learning. Secondly, combined with the predictive uncertainty sample selection strategy of active learning, manual intervention is used to correct the pseudo-labels. Finally, flexible iterative loops achieve the best performance with minimal labeling cost. Extensive experiments show that our method establishes state-of-the-art performance on tasks of GTAV to Cityscapes, SYNTHIA to Cityscapes, improving by 4.9% mIoU and 5.2% mIoU, compared to the previous best method, respectively."
Audio-Visual Segmentation with Semantics,"We propose a new problem called audio-visual segmentation (AVS), in which the goal is to output a pixel-level map of the object(s) that produce sound at the time of the image frame. To facilitate this research, we construct the first audio-visual segmentation benchmark, i.e., AVSBench, providing pixel-wise annotations for sounding objects in audible videos. It contains three subsets: AVSBench-object (Single-source subset, Multi-sources subset) and AVSBench-semantic (Semantic-labels subset). Accordingly, three settings are studied: 1) semi-supervised audio-visual segmentation with a single sound source; 2) fully-supervised audio-visual segmentation with multiple sound sources, and 3) fully-supervised audio-visual semantic segmentation. The first two settings need to generate binary masks of sounding objects indicating pixels corresponding to the audio, while the third setting further requires generating semantic maps indicating the object category. To deal with these problems, we propose a new baseline method that uses a temporal pixel-wise audio-visual interaction module to inject audio semantics as guidance for the visual segmentation process. We also design a regularization loss to encourage audio-visual mapping during training. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on AVSBench compare our approach to several existing methods for related tasks, demonstrating that the proposed method is promising for building a bridge between the audio and pixel-wise visual semantics. Code is available at https://github.com/OpenNLPLab/AVSBench. Online benchmark is available at http://www.avlbench.opennlplab.cn."
SeaFormer: Squeeze-enhanced Axial Transformer for Mobile Semantic Segmentation,"Since the introduction of Vision Transformers, the landscape of many computer vision tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation), which has been overwhelmingly dominated by CNNs, recently has significantly revolutionized. However, the computational cost and memory requirement render these methods unsuitable on the mobile device, especially for the high-resolution per-pixel semantic segmentation task. In this paper, we introduce a new method squeeze-enhanced Axial TransFormer (SeaFormer) for mobile semantic segmentation. Specifically, we design a generic attention block characterized by the formulation of squeeze Axial and detail enhancement. It can be further used to create a family of backbone architectures with superior cost-effectiveness. Coupled with a light segmentation head, we achieve the best trade-off between segmentation accuracy and latency on the ARM-based mobile devices on the ADE20K and Cityscapes datasets. Critically, we beat both the mobile-friendly rivals and Transformer-based counterparts with better performance and lower latency without bells and whistles. Beyond semantic segmentation, we further apply the proposed SeaFormer architecture to image classification problem, demonstrating the potentials of serving as a versatile mobile-friendly backbone."
Consistency Regularisation in Varying Contexts and Feature Perturbations for Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation of Histology Images,"Semantic segmentation of various tissue and nuclei types in histology images is fundamental to many downstream tasks in the area of computational pathology (CPath). In recent years, Deep Learning (DL) methods have been shown to perform well on segmentation tasks but DL methods generally require a large amount of pixel-wise annotated data. Pixel-wise annotation sometimes requires expert's knowledge and time which is laborious and costly to obtain. In this paper, we present a consistency based semi-supervised learning (SSL) approach that can help mitigate this challenge by exploiting a large amount of unlabelled data for model training thus alleviating the need for a large annotated dataset. However, SSL models might also be susceptible to changing context and features perturbations exhibiting poor generalisation due to the limited training data. We propose an SSL method that learns robust features from both labelled and unlabelled images by enforcing consistency against varying contexts and feature perturbations. The proposed method incorporates context-aware consistency by contrasting pairs of overlapping images in a pixel-wise manner from changing contexts resulting in robust and context invariant features. We show that cross-consistency training makes the encoder features invariant to different perturbations and improves the prediction confidence. Finally, entropy minimisation is employed to further boost the confidence of the final prediction maps from unlabelled data. We conduct an extensive set of experiments on two publicly available large datasets (BCSS and MoNuSeg) and show superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods."
Human Vision Based 3D Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation of Large-Scale Outdoor Scene,"This paper proposes EyeNet, a novel semantic segmentation network for point clouds that addresses the critical yet often overlooked parameter of coverage area size. Inspired by human peripheral vision, EyeNet overcomes the limitations of conventional networks by introducing a simple but efficient multi-contour input and a parallel processing network with connection blocks between parallel streams. The proposed approach effectively addresses the challenges of dense point clouds, as demonstrated by our ablation studies and state-of-the-art performance on Large-Scale Outdoor datasets."
ProtoSeg: Interpretable Semantic Segmentation with Prototypical Parts,"We introduce ProtoSeg, a novel model for interpretable semantic image segmentation, which constructs its predictions using similar patches from the training set. To achieve accuracy comparable to baseline methods, we adapt the mechanism of prototypical parts and introduce a diversity loss function that increases the variety of prototypes within each class. We show that ProtoSeg discovers semantic concepts, in contrast to standard segmentation models. Experiments conducted on Pascal VOC and Cityscapes datasets confirm the precision and transparency of the presented method."
Learning from Mistakes: Self-Regularizing Hierarchical Semantic Representations in Point Cloud Segmentation,"Recent advances in autonomous robotic technologies have highlighted the growing need for precise environmental analysis. LiDAR semantic segmentation has gained attention to accomplish fine-grained scene understanding by acting directly on raw content provided by sensors. Recent solutions showed how different learning techniques can be used to improve the performance of the model, without any architectural or dataset change. Following this trend, we present a coarse-to-fine setup that LEArns from classification mistaKes (LEAK) derived from a standard model. First, classes are clustered into macro groups according to mutual prediction errors; then, the learning process is regularized by: (1) aligning class-conditional prototypical feature representation for both fine and coarse classes, (2) weighting instances with a per-class fairness index. Our LEAK approach is very general and can be seamlessly applied on top of any segmentation architecture; indeed, experimental results showed that it enables state-of-the-art performances on different architectures, datasets and tasks, while ensuring more balanced class-wise results and faster convergence."
Semantic Segmentation Enhanced Transformer Model for Human Attention Prediction,"Saliency Prediction aims to predict the attention distribution of human eyes given an RGB image. Most of the recent state-of-the-art methods are based on deep image feature representations from traditional CNNs. However, the traditional convolution could not capture the global features of the image well due to its small kernel size. Besides, the high-level factors which closely correlate to human visual perception, e.g., objects, color, light, etc., are not considered. Inspired by these, we propose a Transformer-based method with semantic segmentation as another learning objective. More global cues of the image could be captured by Transformer. In addition, simultaneously learning the object segmentation simulates the human visual perception, which we would verify in our investigation of human gaze control in cognitive science. We build an extra decoder for the subtask and the multiple tasks share the same Transformer encoder, forcing it to learn from multiple feature spaces. We find in practice simply adding the subtask might confuse the main task learning, hence Multi-task Attention Module is proposed to deal with the feature interaction between the multiple learning targets. Our method achieves competitive performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods."
RangeViT: Towards Vision Transformers for 3D Semantic Segmentation in Autonomous Driving,"Casting semantic segmentation of outdoor LiDAR point clouds as a 2D problem, e.g., via range projection, is an effective and popular approach. These projection-based methods usually benefit from fast computations and, when combined with techniques which use other point cloud representations, achieve state-of-the-art results. Today, projection-based methods leverage 2D CNNs but recent advances in computer vision show that vision transformers (ViTs) have achieved state-of-the-art results in many image-based benchmarks. In this work, we question if projection-based methods for 3D semantic segmentation can benefit from these latest improvements on ViTs. We answer positively but only after combining them with three key ingredients: (a) ViTs are notoriously hard to train and require a lot of training data to learn powerful representations. By preserving the same backbone architecture as for RGB images, we can exploit the knowledge from long training on large image collections that are much cheaper to acquire and annotate than point clouds. We reach our best results with pre-trained ViTs on large image datasets. (b) We compensate ViTs' lack of inductive bias by substituting a tailored convolutional stem for the classical linear embedding layer. (c) We refine pixel-wise predictions with a convolutional decoder and a skip connection from the convolutional stem to combine low-level but fine-grained features of the the convolutional stem with the high-level but coarse predictions of the ViT encoder. With these ingredients, we show that our method, called RangeViT, outperforms existing projection-based methods on nuScenes and SemanticKITTI. The code is available at https://github.com/valeoai/rangevit."
Using a Waffle Iron for Automotive Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation of point clouds in autonomous driving datasets requires techniques that can process large numbers of points over large field of views. Today, most deep networks designed for this task exploit 3D sparse convolutions to reduce memory and computational loads. The best methods then further exploit specificities of rotating lidar sampling patterns to further improve the performance, e.g., cylindrical voxels, or range images (for feature fusion from multiple point cloud representations). In contrast, we show that one can build a well-performing point-based backbone free of these specialized tools. This backbone, WaffleIron, relies heavily on generic MLPs and dense 2D convolutions, making it easy to implement, and contains just a few parameters easy to tune. Despite its simplicity, our experiments on SemanticKITTI and nuScenes show that WaffleIron competes with the best methods designed specifically for these autonomous driving datasets. Hence, WaffleIron is a strong, easy-to-implement, baseline for semantic segmentation of sparse outdoor point clouds."
Learning Open-vocabulary Semantic Segmentation Models From Natural Language Supervision,"In this paper, we consider the problem of open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVS), which aims to segment objects of arbitrary classes instead of pre-defined, closed-set categories. The main contributions are as follows: First, we propose a transformer-based model for OVS, termed as OVSegmentor, which only exploits web-crawled image-text pairs for pre-training without using any mask annotations. OVSegmentor assembles the image pixels into a set of learnable group tokens via a slot-attention based binding module, and aligns the group tokens to the corresponding caption embedding. Second, we propose two proxy tasks for training, namely masked entity completion and cross-image mask consistency. The former aims to infer all masked entities in the caption given the group tokens, that enables the model to learn fine-grained alignment between visual groups and text entities. The latter enforces consistent mask predictions between images that contain shared entities, which encourages the model to learn visual invariance. Third, we construct CC4M dataset for pre-training by filtering CC12M with frequently appeared entities, which significantly improves training efficiency. Fourth, we perform zero-shot transfer on three benchmark datasets, PASCAL VOC 2012, PASCAL Context, and COCO Object. Our model achieves superior segmentation results over the state-of-the-art method by using only 3\% data (4M vs 134M) for pre-training. Code and pre-trained models will be released for future research."
FECANet: Boosting Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation with Feature-Enhanced Context-Aware Network,"Few-shot semantic segmentation is the task of learning to locate each pixel of the novel class in the query image with only a few annotated support images. The current correlation-based methods construct pair-wise feature correlations to establish the many-to-many matching because the typical prototype-based approaches cannot learn fine-grained correspondence relations. However, the existing methods still suffer from the noise contained in naive correlations and the lack of context semantic information in correlations. To alleviate these problems mentioned above, we propose a Feature-Enhanced Context-Aware Network (FECANet). Specifically, a feature enhancement module is proposed to suppress the matching noise caused by inter-class local similarity and enhance the intra-class relevance in the naive correlation. In addition, we propose a novel correlation reconstruction module that encodes extra correspondence relations between foreground and background and multi-scale context semantic features, significantly boosting the encoder to capture a reliable matching pattern. Experiments on PASCAL-5^i and COCO-20^i datasets demonstrate that our proposed FECANet leads to remarkable improvement compared to previous state-of-the-arts, demonstrating its effectiveness."
Training Semantic Segmentation on Heterogeneous Datasets,"We explore semantic segmentation beyond the conventional, single-dataset homogeneous training and bring forward the problem of Heterogeneous Training of Semantic Segmentation (HTSS). HTSS involves simultaneous training on multiple heterogeneous datasets, i.e. datasets with conflicting label spaces and different (weak) annotation types from the perspective of semantic segmentation. The HTSS formulation exposes deep networks to a larger and previously unexplored aggregation of information that can potentially enhance semantic segmentation in three directions: i) performance: increased segmentation metrics on seen datasets, ii) generalization: improved segmentation metrics on unseen datasets, and iii) knowledgeability: increased number of recognizable semantic concepts. To research these benefits of HTSS, we propose a unified framework, that incorporates heterogeneous datasets in a single-network training pipeline following the established FCN standard. Our framework first curates heterogeneous datasets to bring them into a common format and then trains a single-backbone FCN on all of them simultaneously. To achieve this, it transforms weak annotations, which are incompatible with semantic segmentation, to per-pixel labels, and hierarchizes their label spaces into a universal taxonomy. The trained HTSS models demonstrate performance and generalization gains over a wide range of datasets and extend the inference label space entailing hundreds of semantic classes."
Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation via Gentle Teaching Assistant,"Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation aims at training the segmentation model with limited labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data. To effectively leverage the unlabeled data, pseudo labeling, along with the teacher-student framework, is widely adopted in semi-supervised semantic segmentation. Though proved to be effective, this paradigm suffers from incorrect pseudo labels which inevitably exist and are taken as auxiliary training data. To alleviate the negative impact of incorrect pseudo labels, we delve into the current Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation frameworks. We argue that the unlabeled data with pseudo labels can facilitate the learning of representative features in the feature extractor, but it is unreliable to supervise the mask predictor. Motivated by this consideration, we propose a novel framework, Gentle Teaching Assistant (GTA-Seg) to disentangle the effects of pseudo labels on feature extractor and mask predictor of the student model. Specifically, in addition to the original teacher-student framework, our method introduces a teaching assistant network which directly learns from pseudo labels generated by the teacher network. The gentle teaching assistant (GTA) is coined gentle since it only transfers the beneficial feature representation knowledge in the feature extractor to the student model in an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) manner, protecting the student model from the negative influences caused by unreliable pseudo labels in the mask predictor. The student model is also supervised by reliable labeled data to train an accurate mask predictor, further facilitating feature representation. Extensive experiment results on benchmark datasets validate that our method shows competitive performance against previous methods. Code is available at https://github.com/Jin-Ying/GTA-Seg."
Class Enhancement Losses with Pseudo Labels for Zero-shot Semantic Segmentation,"Recent mask proposal models have significantly improved the performance of zero-shot semantic segmentation. However, the use of a `background' embedding during training in these methods is problematic as the resulting model tends to over-learn and assign all unseen classes as the background class instead of their correct labels. Furthermore, they ignore the semantic relationship of text embeddings, which arguably can be highly informative for zero-shot prediction as seen classes may have close relationship with unseen classes. To this end, this paper proposes novel class enhancement losses to bypass the use of the background embbedding during training, and simultaneously exploit the semantic relationship between text embeddings and mask proposals by ranking the similarity scores. To further capture the relationship between seen and unseen classes, we propose an effective pseudo label generation pipeline using pretrained vision-language model. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets show that our method achieves overall the best performance for zero-shot semantic segmentation. Our method is flexible, and can also be applied to the challenging open-vocabulary semantic segmentation problem."
SAT: Size-Aware Transformer for 3D Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation,"Transformer models have achieved promising performances in point cloud segmentation. However, most existing attention schemes provide the same feature learning paradigm for all points equally and overlook the enormous difference in size among scene objects. In this paper, we propose the Size-Aware Transformer (SAT) that can tailor effective receptive fields for objects of different sizes. Our SAT achieves size-aware learning via two steps: introduce multi-scale features to each attention layer and allow each point to choose its attentive fields adaptively. It contains two key designs: the Multi-Granularity Attention (MGA) scheme and the Re-Attention module. The MGA addresses two challenges: efficiently aggregating tokens from distant areas and preserving multi-scale features within one attention layer. Specifically, point-voxel cross attention is proposed to address the first challenge, and the shunted strategy based on the standard multi-head self attention is applied to solve the second. The Re-Attention module dynamically adjusts the attention scores to the fine- and coarse-grained features output by MGA for each point. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that SAT achieves state-of-the-art performances on S3DIS and ScanNetV2 datasets. Our SAT also achieves the most balanced performance on categories among all referred methods, which illustrates the superiority of modelling categories of different sizes. Our code and model will be released after the acceptance of this paper."
Self-Training Guided Disentangled Adaptation for Cross-Domain Remote Sensing Image Semantic Segmentation,"Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) based remote sensing (RS) image semantic segmentation technology has achieved great success used in many real-world applications such as geographic element analysis. However, strong dependency on annotated data of specific scene makes it hard for DCNNs to fit different RS scenes. To solve this problem, recent works gradually focus on cross-domain RS image semantic segmentation task. In this task, different ground sampling distance, remote sensing sensor variation and different geographical landscapes are three main factors causing dramatic domain shift between source and target images. To decrease the negative influence of domain shift, we propose a self-training guided disentangled adaptation network (ST-DASegNet). We first propose source student backbone and target student backbone to respectively extract the source-style and target-style feature for both source and target images. Towards the intermediate output feature maps of each backbone, we adopt adversarial learning for alignment. Then, we propose a domain disentangled module to extract the universal feature and purify the distinct feature of source-style and target-style features. Finally, these two features are fused and served as input of source student decoder and target student decoder to generate final predictions. Based on our proposed domain disentangled module, we further propose exponential moving average (EMA) based cross-domain separated self-training mechanism to ease the instability and disadvantageous effect during adversarial optimization. Extensive experiments and analysis on benchmark RS datasets show that ST-DASegNet outperforms previous methods on cross-domain RS image semantic segmentation task and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results. Our code is available at https://github.com/cv516Buaa/ST-DASegNet."
Semantic Segmentation via Pixel-to-Center Similarity Calculation,"Since the fully convolutional network has achieved great success in semantic segmentation, lots of works have been proposed focusing on extracting discriminative pixel feature representations. However, we observe that existing methods still suffer from two typical challenges, i.e. (i) large intra-class feature variation in different scenes, (ii) small inter-class feature distinction in the same scene. In this paper, we first rethink semantic segmentation from a perspective of similarity between pixels and class centers. Each weight vector of the segmentation head represents its corresponding semantic class in the whole dataset, which can be regarded as the embedding of the class center. Thus, the pixel-wise classification amounts to computing similarity in the final feature space between pixels and the class centers. Under this novel view, we propose a Class Center Similarity layer (CCS layer) to address the above-mentioned challenges by generating adaptive class centers conditioned on different scenes and supervising the similarities between class centers. It utilizes a Adaptive Class Center Module (ACCM) to generate class centers conditioned on each scene, which adapt the large intra-class variation between different scenes. Specially designed loss functions are introduced to control both inter-class and intra-class distances based on predicted center-to-center and pixel-to-center similarity, respectively. Finally, the CCS layer outputs the processed pixel-to-center similarity as the segmentation prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model performs favourably against the state-of-the-art CNN-based methods."
Head-Free Lightweight Semantic Segmentation with Linear Transformer,"Existing semantic segmentation works have been mainly focused on designing effective decoders; however, the computational load introduced by the overall structure has long been ignored, which hinders their applications on resource-constrained hardwares. In this paper, we propose a head-free lightweight architecture specifically for semantic segmentation, named Adaptive Frequency Transformer. It adopts a parallel architecture to leverage prototype representations as specific learnable local descriptions which replaces the decoder and preserves the rich image semantics on high-resolution features. Although removing the decoder compresses most of the computation, the accuracy of the parallel structure is still limited by low computational resources. Therefore, we employ heterogeneous operators (CNN and Vision Transformer) for pixel embedding and prototype representations to further save computational costs. Moreover, it is very difficult to linearize the complexity of the vision Transformer from the perspective of spatial domain. Due to the fact that semantic segmentation is very sensitive to frequency information, we construct a lightweight prototype learning block with adaptive frequency filter of complexity O(n) to replace standard self attention with O(n^{2}). Extensive experiments on widely adopted datasets demonstrate that our model achieves superior accuracy while retaining only 3M parameters. On the ADE20K dataset, our model achieves 41.8 mIoU and 4.6 GFLOPs, which is 4.4 mIoU higher than Segformer, with 45% less GFLOPs. On the Cityscapes dataset, our model achieves 78.7 mIoU and 34.4 GFLOPs, which is 2.5 mIoU higher than Segformer with 72.5% less GFLOPs. Code is available at https://github.com/dongbo811/AFFormer."
LENet: Lightweight And Efficient LiDAR Semantic Segmentation Using Multi-Scale Convolution Attention,"LiDAR semantic segmentation can provide vehicles with a rich understanding of scene, which is essential to the perception system in robotics and autonomous driving. In this paper, we propose LENet, a lightweight and efficient projection-based LiDAR semantic segmentation network, which has an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder consists of a set of MSCA module, which is a simple convolutional attention module to capture multi-scale feature maps. The decoder consists of IAC module, which uses bilinear interpolation to upsample the multi-resolution feature maps and a single convolution layer to integrate the previous and current dimensional features. IAC is very lightweight and dramatically reduces the complexity and storage cost. Moreover, we introduce multiple auxiliary segmentation heads to further refine the network accuracy. We have conducted detailed quantitative experiments, which shows how each component contributes to the final performance. We evaluate our approach on well known public benchmarks (SemanticKITTI), which demonstrates our proposed LENet is more lightweight and effective than state-of-the-art semantic segmentation approaches."
CARD: Semantic Segmentation with Efficient Class-Aware Regularized Decoder,"Semantic segmentation has recently achieved notable advances by exploiting ""class-level"" contextual information during learning. However, these approaches simply concatenate class-level information to pixel features to boost the pixel representation learning, which cannot fully utilize intra-class and inter-class contextual information. Moreover, these approaches learn soft class centers based on coarse mask prediction, which is prone to error accumulation. To better exploit class level information, we propose a universal Class-Aware Regularization (CAR) approach to optimize the intra-class variance and inter-class distance during feature learning, motivated by the fact that humans can recognize an object by itself no matter which other objects it appears with. Moreover, we design a dedicated decoder for CAR (CARD), which consists of a novel spatial token mixer and an upsampling module, to maximize its gain for existing baselines while being highly efficient in terms of computational cost. Specifically, CAR consists of three novel loss functions. The first loss function encourages more compact class representations within each class, the second directly maximizes the distance between different class centers, and the third further pushes the distance between inter-class centers and pixels. Furthermore, the class center in our approach is directly generated from ground truth instead of from the error-prone coarse prediction. CAR can be directly applied to most existing segmentation models during training, and can largely improve their accuracy at no additional inference overhead. Extensive experiments and ablation studies conducted on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed CAR can boost the accuracy of all baseline models by up to 2.23% mIOU with superior generalization ability. CARD outperforms SOTA approaches on multiple benchmarks with a highly efficient architecture."
Towards High-Definition Maps: a Framework Leveraging Semantic Segmentation to Improve NDT Map Compression and Descriptivity,"High-Definition (HD) maps are needed for robust navigation of autonomous vehicles, limited by the on-board storage capacity. To solve this, we propose a novel framework, Environment-Aware Normal Distributions Transform (EA-NDT), that significantly improves compression of standard NDT map representation. The compressed representation of EA-NDT is based on semantic-aided clustering of point clouds resulting in more optimal cells compared to grid cells of standard NDT. To evaluate EA-NDT, we present an open-source implementation that extracts planar and cylindrical primitive features from a point cloud and further divides them into smaller cells to represent the data as an EA-NDT HD map. We collected an open suburban environment dataset and evaluated EA-NDT HD map representation against the standard NDT representation. Compared to the standard NDT, EA-NDT achieved consistently at least 1.5x higher map compression while maintaining the same descriptive capability. Moreover, we showed that EA-NDT is capable of producing maps with significantly higher descriptivity score when using the same number of cells than the standard NDT."
Video Semantic Segmentation with Inter-Frame Feature Fusion and Inner-Frame Feature Refinement,"Video semantic segmentation aims to generate accurate semantic maps for each video frame. To this end, many works dedicate to integrate diverse information from consecutive frames to enhance the features for prediction, where a feature alignment procedure via estimated optical flow is usually required. However, the optical flow would inevitably suffer from inaccuracy, and then introduce noises in feature fusion and further result in unsatisfactory segmentation results. In this paper, to tackle the misalignment issue, we propose a spatial-temporal fusion (STF) module to model dense pairwise relationships among multi-frame features. Different from previous methods, STF uniformly and adaptively fuses features at different spatial and temporal positions, and avoids error-prone optical flow estimation. Besides, we further exploit feature refinement within a single frame and propose a novel memory-augmented refinement (MAR) module to tackle difficult predictions among semantic boundaries. Specifically, MAR can store the boundary features and prototypes extracted from the training samples, which together form the task-specific memory, and then use them to refine the features during inference. Essentially, MAR can move the hard features closer to the most likely category and thus make them more discriminative. We conduct extensive experiments on Cityscapes and CamVid, and the results show that our proposed methods significantly outperform previous methods and achieves the state-of-the-art performance. Code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/jfzhuang/ST_Memory."
Few-shot Semantic Segmentation with Support-induced Graph Convolutional Network,"Few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) aims to achieve novel objects segmentation with only a few annotated samples and has made great progress recently. Most of the existing FSS models focus on the feature matching between support and query to tackle FSS. However, the appearance variations between objects from the same category could be extremely large, leading to unreliable feature matching and query mask prediction. To this end, we propose a Support-induced Graph Convolutional Network (SiGCN) to explicitly excavate latent context structure in query images. Specifically, we propose a Support-induced Graph Reasoning (SiGR) module to capture salient query object parts at different semantic levels with a Support-induced GCN. Furthermore, an instance association (IA) module is designed to capture high-order instance context from both support and query instances. By integrating the proposed two modules, SiGCN can learn rich query context representation, and thus being more robust to appearance variations. Extensive experiments on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i demonstrate that our SiGCN achieves state-of-the-art performance."
Multiclass Semantic Segmentation to Identify Anatomical Sub-Regions of Brain and Measure Neuronal Health in Parkinson's Disease,"Automated segmentation of anatomical sub-regions with high precision has become a necessity to enable the quantification and characterization of cells/ tissues in histology images. Currently, a machine learning model to analyze sub-anatomical regions of the brain to analyze 2D histological images is not available. The scientists rely on manually segmenting anatomical sub-regions of the brain which is extremely time-consuming and prone to labeler-dependent bias. One of the major challenges in accomplishing such a task is the lack of high-quality annotated images that can be used to train a generic artificial intelligence model. In this study, we employed a UNet-based architecture, compared model performance with various combinations of encoders, image sizes, and sample selection techniques. Additionally, to increase the sample set we resorted to data augmentation which provided data diversity and robust learning. In this study, we trained our best fit model on approximately one thousand annotated 2D brain images stained with Nissl/ Haematoxylin and Tyrosine Hydroxylase enzyme (TH, indicator of dopaminergic neuron viability). The dataset comprises of different animal studies enabling the model to be trained on different datasets. The model effectively is able to detect two sub-regions compacta (SNCD) and reticulata (SNr) in all the images. In spite of limited training data, our best model achieves a mean intersection over union (IOU) of 79% and a mean dice coefficient of 87%. In conclusion, the UNet-based model with EffiecientNet as an encoder outperforms all other encoders, resulting in a first of its kind robust model for multiclass segmentation of sub-brain regions in 2D images."
MSCDA: Multi-level Semantic-guided Contrast Improves Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Breast MRI Segmentation in Small Datasets,"Deep learning (DL) applied to breast tissue segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has received increased attention in the last decade, however, the domain shift which arises from different vendors, acquisition protocols, and biological heterogeneity, remains an important but challenging obstacle on the path towards clinical implementation. Recently, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods have attempted to mitigate this problem by incorporating self-training with contrastive learning. To better exploit the underlying semantic information of the image at different levels, we propose a Multi-level Semantic-guided Contrastive Domain Adaptation (MSCDA) framework to align the feature representation between domains. In particular, we extend the contrastive loss by incorporating pixel-to-pixel, pixel-to-centroid, and centroid-to-centroid contrasts to integrate semantic information of images. We utilize a category-wise cross-domain sampling strategy to sample anchors from target images and build a hybrid memory bank to store samples from source images. Two breast MRI datasets were retrospectively collected: The source dataset contains non-contrast MRI examinations from 11 healthy volunteers and the target dataset contains contrast-enhanced MRI examinations of 134 invasive breast cancer patients. We set up experiments from source T2W image to target dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-T1W image (T2W-to-T1W) and from source T1W image to target T2W image (T1W-to-T2W). The proposed method achieved Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 89.2\% and 84.0\% in T2W-to-T1W and T1W-to-T2W, respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Notably, good performance is still achieved with a smaller source dataset, proving that our framework is label-efficient."
Uncertainty in Real-Time Semantic Segmentation on Embedded Systems,"Application for semantic segmentation models in areas such as autonomous vehicles and human computer interaction require real-time predictive capabilities. The challenges of addressing real-time application is amplified by the need to operate on resource constrained hardware. Whilst development of real-time methods for these platforms has increased, these models are unable to sufficiently reason about uncertainty present. This paper addresses this by combining deep feature extraction from pre-trained models with Bayesian regression and moment propagation for uncertainty aware predictions. We demonstrate how the proposed method can yield meaningful uncertainty on embedded hardware in real-time whilst maintaining predictive performance."
I2F: A Unified Image-to-Feature Approach for Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation,"Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for semantic segmentation is a promising task freeing people from heavy annotation work. However, domain discrepancies in low-level image statistics and high-level contexts compromise the segmentation performance over the target domain. A key idea to tackle this problem is to perform both image-level and feature-level adaptation jointly. Unfortunately, there is a lack of such unified approaches for UDA tasks in the existing literature. This paper proposes a novel UDA pipeline for semantic segmentation that unifies image-level and feature-level adaptation. Concretely, for image-level domain shifts, we propose a global photometric alignment module and a global texture alignment module that align images in the source and target domains in terms of image-level properties. For feature-level domain shifts, we perform global manifold alignment by projecting pixel features from both domains onto the feature manifold of the source domain; and we further regularize category centers in the source domain through a category-oriented triplet loss and perform target domain consistency regularization over augmented target domain images. Experimental results demonstrate that our pipeline significantly outperforms previous methods. In the commonly tested GTA5\rightarrowCityscapes task, our proposed method using Deeplab V3+ as the backbone surpasses previous SOTA by 8%, achieving 58.2% in mIoU."
Understanding Imbalanced Semantic Segmentation Through Neural Collapse,"A recent study has shown a phenomenon called neural collapse in that the within-class means of features and the classifier weight vectors converge to the vertices of a simplex equiangular tight frame at the terminal phase of training for classification. In this paper, we explore the corresponding structures of the last-layer feature centers and classifiers in semantic segmentation. Based on our empirical and theoretical analysis, we point out that semantic segmentation naturally brings contextual correlation and imbalanced distribution among classes, which breaks the equiangular and maximally separated structure of neural collapse for both feature centers and classifiers. However, such a symmetric structure is beneficial to discrimination for the minor classes. To preserve these advantages, we introduce a regularizer on feature centers to encourage the network to learn features closer to the appealing structure in imbalanced semantic segmentation. Experimental results show that our method can bring significant improvements on both 2D and 3D semantic segmentation benchmarks. Moreover, our method ranks 1st and sets a new record (+6.8% mIoU) on the ScanNet200 test leaderboard. Code will be available at https://github.com/dvlab-research/Imbalanced-Learning."
Benchmarking the Robustness of LiDAR Semantic Segmentation Models,"When using LiDAR semantic segmentation models for safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving, it is essential to understand and improve their robustness with respect to a large range of LiDAR corruptions. In this paper, we aim to comprehensively analyze the robustness of LiDAR semantic segmentation models under various corruptions. To rigorously evaluate the robustness and generalizability of current approaches, we propose a new benchmark called SemanticKITTI-C, which features 16 out-of-domain LiDAR corruptions in three groups, namely adverse weather, measurement noise and cross-device discrepancy. Then, we systematically investigate 11 LiDAR semantic segmentation models, especially spanning different input representations (e.g., point clouds, voxels, projected images, and etc.), network architectures and training schemes. Through this study, we obtain two insights: 1) We find out that the input representation plays a crucial role in robustness. Specifically, under specific corruptions, different representations perform variously. 2) Although state-of-the-art methods on LiDAR semantic segmentation achieve promising results on clean data, they are less robust when dealing with noisy data. Finally, based on the above observations, we design a robust LiDAR segmentation model (RLSeg) which greatly boosts the robustness with simple but effective modifications. It is promising that our benchmark, comprehensive analysis, and observations can boost future research in robust LiDAR semantic segmentation for safety-critical applications."
AttEntropy: Segmenting Unknown Objects in Complex Scenes using the Spatial Attention Entropy of Semantic Segmentation Transformers,"Vision transformers have emerged as powerful tools for many computer vision tasks. It has been shown that their features and class tokens can be used for salient object segmentation. However, the properties of segmentation transformers remain largely unstudied. In this work we conduct an in-depth study of the spatial attentions of different backbone layers of semantic segmentation transformers and uncover interesting properties.  The spatial attentions of a patch intersecting with an object tend to concentrate within the object, whereas the attentions of larger, more uniform image areas rather follow a diffusive behavior. In other words, vision transformers trained to segment a fixed set of object classes generalize to objects well beyond this set. We exploit this by extracting heatmaps that can be used to segment unknown objects within diverse backgrounds, such as obstacles in traffic scenes.  Our method is training-free and its computational overhead negligible. We use off-the-shelf transformers trained for street-scene segmentation to process other scene types."
A Class-wise Non-salient Region Generalized Framework for Video Semantic Segmentation,"Video semantic segmentation (VSS) is beneficial for dealing with dynamic scenes due to the continuous property of the real-world environment. On the one hand, some methods alleviate the predicted inconsistent problem between continuous frames. On the other hand, other methods employ the previous frame as the prior information to assist in segmenting the current frame. Although the previous methods achieve superior performances on the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) data, they can not generalize well on other unseen domains. Thus, we explore a new task, the video generalizable semantic segmentation (VGSS) task that considers both continuous frames and domain generalization. In this paper, we propose a class-wise non-salient region generalized (CNSG) framework for the VGSS task. Concretely, we first define the class-wise non-salient feature, which describes features of the class-wise non-salient region that carry more generalizable information. Then, we propose a class-wise non-salient feature reasoning strategy to select and enhance the most generalized channels adaptively. Finally, we propose an inter-frame non-salient centroid alignment loss to alleviate the predicted inconsistent problem in the VGSS task. We also extend our video-based framework to the image-based generalizable semantic segmentation (IGSS) task. Experiments demonstrate that our CNSG framework yields significant improvement in the VGSS and IGSS tasks."
Representation Separation for Semantic Segmentation with Vision Transformers,"Vision transformers (ViTs) encoding an image as a sequence of patches bring new paradigms for semantic segmentation.We present an efficient framework of representation separation in local-patch level and global-region level for semantic segmentation with ViTs. It is targeted for the peculiar over-smoothness of ViTs in semantic segmentation, and therefore differs from current popular paradigms of context modeling and most existing related methods reinforcing the advantage of attention. We first deliver the decoupled two-pathway network in which another pathway enhances and passes down local-patch discrepancy complementary to global representations of transformers. We then propose the spatially adaptive separation module to obtain more separate deep representations and the discriminative cross-attention which yields more discriminative region representations through novel auxiliary supervisions. The proposed methods achieve some impressive results: 1) incorporated with large-scale plain ViTs, our methods achieve new state-of-the-art performances on five widely used benchmarks; 2) using masked pre-trained plain ViTs, we achieve 68.9% mIoU on Pascal Context, setting a new record; 3) pyramid ViTs integrated with the decoupled two-pathway network even surpass the well-designed high-resolution ViTs on Cityscapes; 4) the improved representations by our framework have favorable transferability in images with natural corruptions. The codes will be released publicly."
Efficient Semantic Segmentation on Edge Devices,"Semantic segmentation works on the computer vision algorithm for assigning each pixel of an image into a class. The task of semantic segmentation should be performed with both accuracy and efficiency. Most of the existing deep FCNs yield to heavy computations and these networks are very power hungry, unsuitable for real-time applications on portable devices. This project analyzes current semantic segmentation models to explore the feasibility of applying these models for emergency response during catastrophic events. We compare the performance of real-time semantic segmentation models with non-real-time counterparts constrained by aerial images under oppositional settings. Furthermore, we train several models on the Flood-Net dataset, containing UAV images captured after Hurricane Harvey, and benchmark their execution on special classes such as flooded buildings vs. non-flooded buildings or flooded roads vs. non-flooded roads. In this project, we developed a real-time UNet based model and deployed that network on Jetson AGX Xavier module."
Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation Methods for UW-OCTA Diabetic Retinopathy Grade Assessment,"People with diabetes are more likely to develop diabetic retinopathy (DR) than healthy people. However, DR is the leading cause of blindness. At present, the diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy mainly relies on the experienced clinician to recognize the fine features in color fundus images. This is a time-consuming task. Therefore, in this paper, to promote the development of UW-OCTA DR automatic detection, we propose a novel semi-supervised semantic segmentation method for UW-OCTA DR image grade assessment. This method, first, uses the MAE algorithm to perform semi-supervised pre-training on the UW-OCTA DR grade assessment dataset to mine the supervised information in the UW-OCTA images, thereby alleviating the need for labeled data. Secondly, to more fully mine the lesion features of each region in the UW-OCTA image, this paper constructs a cross-algorithm ensemble DR tissue segmentation algorithm by deploying three algorithms with different visual feature processing strategies. The algorithm contains three sub-algorithms, namely pre-trained MAE, ConvNeXt, and SegFormer. Based on the initials of these three sub-algorithms, the algorithm can be named MCS-DRNet. Finally, we use the MCS-DRNet algorithm as an inspector to check and revise the results of the preliminary evaluation of the DR grade evaluation algorithm. The experimental results show that the mean dice similarity coefficient of MCS-DRNet v1 and v2 are 0.5161 and 0.5544, respectively. The quadratic weighted kappa of the DR grading evaluation is 0.7559. Our code will be released soon."
Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation of Ships Using Thermal Imagery,"The United States coastline spans 95,471 miles; a distance that cannot be effectively patrolled or secured by manual human effort alone. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) equipped with infrared cameras and deep-learning based algorithms represent a more efficient alternative for identifying and segmenting objects of interest - namely, ships. However, standard approaches to training these algorithms require large-scale datasets of densely labeled infrared maritime images. Such datasets are not publicly available and manually annotating every pixel in a large-scale dataset would have an extreme labor cost. In this work we demonstrate that, in the context of segmenting ships in infrared imagery, weakly-supervising an algorithm with sparsely labeled data can drastically reduce data labeling costs with minimal impact on system performance. We apply weakly-supervised learning to an unlabeled dataset of 7055 infrared images sourced from the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD). We find that by sparsely labeling only 32 points per image, weakly-supervised segmentation models can still effectively detect and segment ships, with a Jaccard score of up to 0.756."
Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation of Roads from Satellite Images,"This paper presents the preliminary findings of a semi-supervised segmentation method for extracting roads from sattelite images. Artificial Neural Networks and image segmentation methods are among the most successful methods for extracting road data from satellite images. However, these models require large amounts of training data from different regions to achieve high accuracy rates. In cases where this data needs to be of more quantity or quality, it is a standard method to train deep neural networks by transferring knowledge from annotated data obtained from different sources. This study proposes a method that performs path segmentation with semi-supervised learning methods. A semi-supervised field adaptation method based on pseudo-labeling and Minimum Class Confusion method has been proposed, and it has been observed to increase performance in targeted datasets."
Artificial Pupil Dilation for Data Augmentation in Iris Semantic Segmentation,"Biometrics is the science of identifying an individual based on their intrinsic anatomical or behavioural characteristics, such as fingerprints, face, iris, gait, and voice. Iris recognition is one of the most successful methods because it exploits the rich texture of the human iris, which is unique even for twins and does not degrade with age. Modern approaches to iris recognition utilize deep learning to segment the valid portion of the iris from the rest of the eye, so it can then be encoded, stored and compared. This paper aims to improve the accuracy of iris semantic segmentation systems by introducing a novel data augmentation technique. Our method can transform an iris image with a certain dilation level into any desired dilation level, thus augmenting the variability and number of training examples from a small dataset. The proposed method is fast and does not require training. The results indicate that our data augmentation method can improve segmentation accuracy up to 15% for images with high pupil dilation, which creates a more reliable iris recognition pipeline, even under extreme dilation."
Push-the-Boundary: Boundary-aware Feature Propagation for Semantic Segmentation of 3D Point Clouds,"Feedforward fully convolutional neural networks currently dominate in semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds. Despite their great success, they suffer from the loss of local information at low-level layers, posing significant challenges to accurate scene segmentation and precise object boundary delineation. Prior works either address this issue by post-processing or jointly learn object boundaries to implicitly improve feature encoding of the networks. These approaches often require additional modules which are difficult to integrate into the original architecture.  To improve the segmentation near object boundaries, we propose a boundary-aware feature propagation mechanism. This mechanism is achieved by exploiting a multi-task learning framework that aims to explicitly guide the boundaries to their original locations. With one shared encoder, our network outputs (i) boundary localization, (ii) prediction of directions pointing to the object's interior, and (iii) semantic segmentation, in three parallel streams. The predicted boundaries and directions are fused to propagate the learned features to refine the segmentation. We conduct extensive experiments on the S3DIS and SensatUrban datasets against various baseline methods, demonstrating that our proposed approach yields consistent improvements by reducing boundary errors. Our code is available at https://github.com/shenglandu/PushBoundary."
On Calibrating Semantic Segmentation Models: Analyses and An Algorithm,"We study the problem of semantic segmentation calibration. Lots of solutions have been proposed to approach model miscalibration of confidence in image classification. However, to date, confidence calibration research on semantic segmentation is still limited. We provide a systematic study on the calibration of semantic segmentation models and propose a simple yet effective approach. First, we find that model capacity, crop size, multi-scale testing, and prediction correctness have impact on calibration. Among them, prediction correctness, especially misprediction, is more important to miscalibration due to over-confidence. Next, we propose a simple, unifying, and effective approach, namely selective scaling, by separating correct/incorrect prediction for scaling and more focusing on misprediction logit smoothing. Then, we study popular existing calibration methods and compare them with selective scaling on semantic segmentation calibration. We conduct extensive experiments with a variety of benchmarks on both in-domain and domain-shift calibration and show that selective scaling consistently outperforms other methods."
UniDA3D: Unified Domain Adaptive 3D Semantic Segmentation Pipeline,"State-of-the-art 3D semantic segmentation models are trained on off-the-shelf public benchmarks, but they will inevitably face the challenge of recognition accuracy drop when these well-trained models are deployed to a new domain. In this paper, we introduce a Unified Domain Adaptive 3D semantic segmentation pipeline (UniDA3D) to enhance the weak generalization ability, and bridge the point distribution gap between domains. Different from previous studies that only focus on a single adaptation task, UniDA3D can tackle several adaptation tasks in 3D segmentation field, by designing a unified source-and-target active sampling strategy, which selects a maximally-informative subset from both source and target domains for effective model adaptation. Besides, benefiting from the rise of multi-modal 2D-3D datasets, UniDA3D investigates the possibility of achieving a multi-modal sampling strategy, by developing a cross-modality feature interaction module that can extract a representative pair of image and point features to achieve a bi-directional image-point feature interaction for safe model adaptation. Experimentally, UniDA3D is verified to be effective in many adaptation tasks including: 1) unsupervised domain adaptation, 2) unsupervised few-shot domain adaptation; 3) active domain adaptation. Their results demonstrate that, by easily coupling UniDA3D with off-the-shelf 3D segmentation baselines, domain generalization ability of these baselines can be enhanced."
Weakly supervised training of universal visual concepts for multi-domain semantic segmentation,"Deep supervised models have an unprecedented capacity to absorb large quantities of training data. Hence, training on multiple datasets becomes a method of choice towards strong generalization in usual scenes and graceful performance degradation in edge cases. Unfortunately, different datasets often have incompatible labels. For instance, the Cityscapes road class subsumes all driving surfaces, while Vistas defines separate classes for road markings, manholes etc. Furthermore, many datasets have overlapping labels. For instance, pickups are labeled as trucks in VIPER, cars in Vistas, and vans in ADE20k. We address this challenge by considering labels as unions of universal visual concepts. This allows seamless and principled learning on multi-domain dataset collections without requiring any relabeling effort. Our method achieves competitive within-dataset and cross-dataset generalization, as well as ability to learn visual concepts which are not separately labeled in any of the training datasets. Experiments reveal competitive or state-of-the-art performance on two multi-domain dataset collections and on the WildDash 2 benchmark."
CLIP is Also an Efficient Segmenter: A Text-Driven Approach for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) with image-level labels is a challenging task. Mainstream approaches follow a multi-stage framework and suffer from high training costs. In this paper, we explore the potential of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training models (CLIP) to localize different categories with only image-level labels and without further training. To efficiently generate high-quality segmentation masks from CLIP, we propose a novel WSSS framework called CLIP-ES. Our framework improves all three stages of WSSS with special designs for CLIP: 1) We introduce the softmax function into GradCAM and exploit the zero-shot ability of CLIP to suppress the confusion caused by non-target classes and backgrounds. Meanwhile, to take full advantage of CLIP, we re-explore text inputs under the WSSS setting and customize two text-driven strategies: sharpness-based prompt selection and synonym fusion. 2) To simplify the stage of CAM refinement, we propose a real-time class-aware attention-based affinity (CAA) module based on the inherent multi-head self-attention (MHSA) in CLIP-ViTs. 3) When training the final segmentation model with the masks generated by CLIP, we introduced a confidence-guided loss (CGL) focus on confident regions. Our CLIP-ES achieves SOTA performance on Pascal VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 while only taking 10% time of previous methods for the pseudo mask generation. Code is available at https://github.com/linyq2117/CLIP-ES."
Leveraging Road Area Semantic Segmentation with Auxiliary Steering Task,"Robustness of different pattern recognition methods is one of the key challenges in autonomous driving, especially when driving in the high variety of road environments and weather conditions, such as gravel roads and snowfall. Although one can collect data from these adverse conditions using cars equipped with sensors, it is quite tedious to annotate the data for training. In this work, we address this limitation and propose a CNN-based method that can leverage the steering wheel angle information to improve the road area semantic segmentation. As the steering wheel angle data can be easily acquired with the associated images, one could improve the accuracy of road area semantic segmentation by collecting data in new road environments without manual data annotation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on two challenging data sets for autonomous driving and show that when the steering task is used in our segmentation model training, it leads to a 0.1-2.9% gain in the road area mIoU (mean Intersection over Union) compared to the corresponding reference transfer learning model."
TAS-NIR: A VIS+NIR Dataset for Fine-grained Semantic Segmentation in Unstructured Outdoor Environments,"Vegetation Indices based on paired images of the visible color spectrum (VIS) and near infrared spectrum (NIR) have been widely used in remote sensing applications. These vegetation indices are extended for their application in autonomous driving in unstructured outdoor environments. In this domain we can combine traditional vegetation indices like the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) pre-trained on available VIS datasets. By laying a focus on learning calibrated CNN outputs, we can provide an approach to fuse known hand-crafted image features with CNN predictions for different domains as well. The method is evaluated on a VIS+NIR dataset of semantically annotated images in unstructured outdoor environments. The dataset is available at mucar3.de/iros2022-ppniv-tas-nir."
Annotation by Clicks: A Point-Supervised Contrastive Variance Method for Medical Semantic Segmentation,"Medical image segmentation methods typically rely on numerous dense annotated images for model training, which are notoriously expensive and time-consuming to collect. To alleviate this burden, weakly supervised techniques have been exploited to train segmentation models with less expensive annotations. In this paper, we propose a novel point-supervised contrastive variance method (PSCV) for medical image semantic segmentation, which only requires one pixel-point from each organ category to be annotated. The proposed method trains the base segmentation network by using a novel contrastive variance (CV) loss to exploit the unlabeled pixels and a partial cross-entropy loss on the labeled pixels. The CV loss function is designed to exploit the statistical spatial distribution properties of organs in medical images and their variance distribution map representations to enforce discriminative predictions over the unlabeled pixels. Experimental results on two standard medical image datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods on point-supervised medical image semantic segmentation tasks."
Context Label Learning: Improving Background Class Representations in Semantic Segmentation,"Background samples provide key contextual information for segmenting regions of interest (ROIs). However, they always cover a diverse set of structures, causing difficulties for the segmentation model to learn good decision boundaries with high sensitivity and precision. The issue concerns the highly heterogeneous nature of the background class, resulting in multi-modal distributions. Empirically, we find that neural networks trained with heterogeneous background struggle to map the corresponding contextual samples to compact clusters in feature space. As a result, the distribution over background logit activations may shift across the decision boundary, leading to systematic over-segmentation across different datasets and tasks. In this study, we propose context label learning (CoLab) to improve the context representations by decomposing the background class into several subclasses. Specifically, we train an auxiliary network as a task generator, along with the primary segmentation model, to automatically generate context labels that positively affect the ROI segmentation accuracy. Extensive experiments are conducted on several challenging segmentation tasks and datasets. The results demonstrate that CoLab can guide the segmentation model to map the logits of background samples away from the decision boundary, resulting in significantly improved segmentation accuracy. Code is available."
Urban Scene Semantic Segmentation with Low-Cost Coarse Annotation,"For best performance, today's semantic segmentation methods use large and carefully labeled datasets, requiring expensive annotation budgets. In this work, we show that coarse annotation is a low-cost but highly effective alternative for training semantic segmentation models. Considering the urban scene segmentation scenario, we leverage cheap coarse annotations for real-world captured data, as well as synthetic data to train our model and show competitive performance compared with finely annotated real-world data. Specifically, we propose a coarse-to-fine self-training framework that generates pseudo labels for unlabeled regions of the coarsely annotated data, using synthetic data to improve predictions around the boundaries between semantic classes, and using cross-domain data augmentation to increase diversity. Our extensive experimental results on Cityscapes and BDD100k datasets demonstrate that our method achieves a significantly better performance vs annotation cost tradeoff, yielding a comparable performance to fully annotated data with only a small fraction of the annotation budget. Also, when used as pretraining, our framework performs better compared to the standard fully supervised setting."
Full Contextual Attention for Multi-resolution Transformers in Semantic Segmentation,"Transformers have proved to be very effective for visual recognition tasks. In particular, vision transformers construct compressed global representations through self-attention and learnable class tokens. Multi-resolution transformers have shown recent successes in semantic segmentation but can only capture local interactions in high-resolution feature maps. This paper extends the notion of global tokens to build GLobal Attention Multi-resolution (GLAM) transformers. GLAM is a generic module that can be integrated into most existing transformer backbones. GLAM includes learnable global tokens, which unlike previous methods can model interactions between all image regions, and extracts powerful representations during training. Extensive experiments show that GLAM-Swin or GLAM-Swin-UNet exhibit substantially better performances than their vanilla counterparts on ADE20K and Cityscapes. Moreover, GLAM can be used to segment large 3D medical images, and GLAM-nnFormer achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the BCV dataset."
SBSS: Stacking-Based Semantic Segmentation Framework for Very High Resolution Remote Sensing Image,"Semantic segmentation of Very High Resolution (VHR) remote sensing images is a fundamental task for many applications. However, large variations in the scales of objects in those VHR images pose a challenge for performing accurate semantic segmentation. Existing semantic segmentation networks are able to analyse an input image at up to four resizing scales, but this may be insufficient given the diversity of object scales. Therefore, Multi Scale (MS) test-time data augmentation is often used in practice to obtain more accurate segmentation results, which makes equal use of the segmentation results obtained at the different resizing scales. However, it was found in this study that different classes of objects had their preferred resizing scale for more accurate semantic segmentation. Based on this behaviour, a Stacking-Based Semantic Segmentation (SBSS) framework is proposed to improve the segmentation results by learning this behaviour, which contains a learnable Error Correction Module (ECM) for segmentation result fusion and an Error Correction Scheme (ECS) for computational complexity control. Two ECS, i.e., ECS-MS and ECS-SS, are proposed and investigated in this study. The Floating-point operations (Flops) required for ECS-MS and ECS-SS are similar to the commonly used MS test and the Single-Scale (SS) test, respectively. Extensive experiments on four datasets (i.e., Cityscapes, UAVid, LoveDA and Potsdam) show that SBSS is an effective and flexible framework. It achieved higher accuracy than MS when using ECS-MS, and similar accuracy as SS with a quarter of the memory footprint when using ECS-SS."
One-Shot Domain Adaptive and Generalizable Semantic Segmentation with Class-Aware Cross-Domain Transformers,"Unsupervised sim-to-real domain adaptation (UDA) for semantic segmentation aims to improve the real-world test performance of a model trained on simulated data. It can save the cost of manually labeling data in real-world applications such as robot vision and autonomous driving. Traditional UDA often assumes that there are abundant unlabeled real-world data samples available during training for the adaptation. However, such an assumption does not always hold in practice owing to the collection difficulty and the scarcity of the data. Thus, we aim to relieve this need on a large number of real data, and explore the one-shot unsupervised sim-to-real domain adaptation (OSUDA) and generalization (OSDG) problem, where only one real-world data sample is available. To remedy the limited real data knowledge, we first construct the pseudo-target domain by stylizing the simulated data with the one-shot real data. To mitigate the sim-to-real domain gap on both the style and spatial structure level and facilitate the sim-to-real adaptation, we further propose to use class-aware cross-domain transformers with an intermediate domain randomization strategy to extract the domain-invariant knowledge, from both the simulated and pseudo-target data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for OSUDA and OSDG on different benchmarks, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin, 10.87, 9.59, 13.05 and 15.91 mIoU on GTA, SYNTHIA\rightarrowCityscapes, Foggy Cityscapes, respectively."
Towards Deeper and Better Multi-view Feature Fusion for 3D Semantic Segmentation,"3D point clouds are rich in geometric structure information, while 2D images contain important and continuous texture information. Combining 2D information to achieve better 3D semantic segmentation has become mainstream in 3D scene understanding. Albeit the success, it still remains elusive how to fuse and process the cross-dimensional features from these two distinct spaces. Existing state-of-the-art usually exploit bidirectional projection methods to align the cross-dimensional features and realize both 2D & 3D semantic segmentation tasks. However, to enable bidirectional mapping, this framework often requires a symmetrical 2D-3D network structure, thus limiting the network's flexibility. Meanwhile, such dual-task settings may distract the network easily and lead to over-fitting in the 3D segmentation task. As limited by the network's inflexibility, fused features can only pass through a decoder network, which affects model performance due to insufficient depth. To alleviate these drawbacks, in this paper, we argue that despite its simplicity, projecting unidirectionally multi-view 2D deep semantic features into the 3D space aligned with 3D deep semantic features could lead to better feature fusion. On the one hand, the unidirectional projection enforces our model focused more on the core task, i.e., 3D segmentation; on the other hand, unlocking the bidirectional to unidirectional projection enables a deeper cross-domain semantic alignment and enjoys the flexibility to fuse better and complicated features from very different spaces. In joint 2D-3D approaches, our proposed method achieves superior performance on the ScanNetv2 benchmark for 3D semantic segmentation."
Open Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation with Patch Aligned Contrastive Learning,"We introduce Patch Aligned Contrastive Learning (PACL), a modified compatibility function for CLIP's contrastive loss, intending to train an alignment between the patch tokens of the vision encoder and the CLS token of the text encoder. With such an alignment, a model can identify regions of an image corresponding to a given text input, and therefore transfer seamlessly to the task of open vocabulary semantic segmentation without requiring any segmentation annotations during training. Using pre-trained CLIP encoders with PACL, we are able to set the state-of-the-art on the task of open vocabulary zero-shot segmentation on 4 different segmentation benchmarks: Pascal VOC, Pascal Context, COCO Stuff and ADE20K. Furthermore, we show that PACL is also applicable to image-level predictions and when used with a CLIP backbone, provides a general improvement in zero-shot classification accuracy compared to CLIP, across a suite of 12 image classification datasets."
Augmentation Matters: A Simple-yet-Effective Approach to Semi-supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Recent studies on semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSS) have seen fast progress. Despite their promising performance, current state-of-the-art methods tend to increasingly complex designs at the cost of introducing more network components and additional training procedures. Differently, in this work, we follow a standard teacher-student framework and propose AugSeg, a simple and clean approach that focuses mainly on data perturbations to boost the SSS performance. We argue that various data augmentations should be adjusted to better adapt to the semi-supervised scenarios instead of directly applying these techniques from supervised learning. Specifically, we adopt a simplified intensity-based augmentation that selects a random number of data transformations with uniformly sampling distortion strengths from a continuous space. Based on the estimated confidence of the model on different unlabeled samples, we also randomly inject labelled information to augment the unlabeled samples in an adaptive manner. Without bells and whistles, our simple AugSeg can readily achieve new state-of-the-art performance on SSS benchmarks under different partition protocols."
Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation for Large-Scale Point Cloud,"Existing methods for large-scale point cloud semantic segmentation require expensive, tedious and error-prone manual point-wise annotations. Intuitively, weakly supervised training is a direct solution to reduce the cost of labeling. However, for weakly supervised large-scale point cloud semantic segmentation, too few annotations will inevitably lead to ineffective learning of network. We propose an effective weakly supervised method containing two components to solve the above problem. Firstly, we construct a pretext task, \textit{i.e.,} point cloud colorization, with a self-supervised learning to transfer the learned prior knowledge from a large amount of unlabeled point cloud to a weakly supervised network. In this way, the representation capability of the weakly supervised network can be improved by the guidance from a heterogeneous task. Besides, to generate pseudo label for unlabeled data, a sparse label propagation mechanism is proposed with the help of generated class prototypes, which is used to measure the classification confidence of unlabeled point. Our method is evaluated on large-scale point cloud datasets with different scenarios including indoor and outdoor. The experimental results show the large gain against existing weakly supervised and comparable results to fully supervised methods\footnote{Code based on mindspore: https://github.com/dmcv-ecnu/MindSpore\_ModelZoo/tree/main/WS3\_MindSpore}."
Synthetic-to-Real Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation for 3D Indoor Point Clouds,"Semantic segmentation in 3D indoor scenes has achieved remarkable performance under the supervision of large-scale annotated data. However, previous works rely on the assumption that the training and testing data are of the same distribution, which may suffer from performance degradation when evaluated on the out-of-distribution scenes. To alleviate the annotation cost and the performance degradation, this paper introduces the synthetic-to-real domain generalization setting to this task. Specifically, the domain gap between synthetic and real-world point cloud data mainly lies in the different layouts and point patterns. To address these problems, we first propose a clustering instance mix (CINMix) augmentation technique to diversify the layouts of the source data. In addition, we augment the point patterns of the source data and introduce non-parametric multi-prototypes to ameliorate the intra-class variance enlarged by the augmented point patterns. The multi-prototypes can model the intra-class variance and rectify the global classifier in both training and inference stages. Experiments on the synthetic-to-real benchmark demonstrate that both CINMix and multi-prototypes can narrow the distribution gap and thus improve the generalization ability on real-world datasets."
Domain generalization of 3D semantic segmentation in autonomous driving,"Using deep learning, 3D autonomous driving semantic segmentation has become a well-studied subject, with methods that can reach very high performance. Nonetheless, because of the limited size of the training datasets, these models cannot see every type of object and scene found in real-world applications. The ability to be reliable in these various unknown environments is called domain generalization.  Despite its importance, domain generalization is relatively unexplored in the case of 3D autonomous driving semantic segmentation. To fill this gap, this paper presents the first benchmark for this application by testing state-of-the-art methods and discussing the difficulty of tackling Laser Imaging Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) domain shifts.  We also propose the first method designed to address this domain generalization, which we call 3DLabelProp. This method relies on leveraging the geometry and sequentiality of the LiDAR data to enhance its generalization performances by working on partially accumulated point clouds. It reaches a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 50.4% on SemanticPOSS and of 55.2% on PandaSet solid-state LiDAR while being trained only on SemanticKITTI, making it the state-of-the-art method for generalization (+5% and +33% better, respectively, than the second best method).  The code for this method will be available on GitHub."
Self-training via Metric Learning for Source-Free Domain Adaptation of Semantic Segmentation,"Unsupervised source-free domain adaptation methods aim to train a model to be used in the target domain utilizing the pretrained source-domain model and unlabeled target-domain data, where the source data may not be accessible due to intellectual property or privacy issues. These methods frequently utilize self-training with pseudo-labeling thresholded by prediction confidence. In a source-free scenario, only supervision comes from target data, and thresholding limits the contribution of the self-training. In this study, we utilize self-training with a mean-teacher approach. The student network is trained with all predictions of the teacher network. Instead of thresholding the predictions, the gradients calculated from the pseudo-labels are weighted based on the reliability of the teacher's predictions. We propose a novel method that uses proxy-based metric learning to estimate reliability. We train a metric network on the encoder features of the teacher network. Since the teacher is updated with the moving average, the encoder feature space is slowly changing. Therefore, the metric network can be updated in training time, which enables end-to-end training. We also propose a metric-based online ClassMix method to augment the input of the student network where the patches to be mixed are decided based on the metric reliability. We evaluated our method in synthetic-to-real and cross-city scenarios. The benchmarks show that our method significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods."
An Empirical Study on Multi-Domain Robust Semantic Segmentation,"How to effectively leverage the plentiful existing datasets to train a robust and high-performance model is of great significance for many practical applications. However, a model trained on a naive merge of different datasets tends to obtain poor performance due to annotation conflicts and domain divergence.In this paper, we attempt to train a unified model that is expected to perform well across domains on several popularity segmentation datasets.We conduct a detailed analysis of the impact on model generalization from three aspects of data augmentation, training strategies, and model capacity.Based on the analysis, we propose a robust solution that is able to improve model generalization across domains.Our solution ranks 2nd on RVC 2022 semantic segmentation task, with a dataset only 1/3 size of the 1st model used."
Combining Photogrammetric Computer Vision and Semantic Segmentation for Fine-grained Understanding of Coral Reef Growth under Climate Change,"Corals are the primary habitat-building life-form on reefs that support a quarter of the species in the ocean. A coral reef ecosystem usually consists of reefs, each of which is like a tall building in any city. These reef-building corals secrete hard calcareous exoskeletons that give them structural rigidity, and are also a prerequisite for our accurate 3D modeling and semantic mapping using advanced photogrammetric computer vision and machine learning. Underwater videography as a modern underwater remote sensing tool is a high-resolution coral habitat survey and mapping technique. In this paper, detailed 3D mesh models, digital surface models and orthophotos of the coral habitat are generated from the collected coral images and underwater control points. Meanwhile, a novel pixel-wise semantic segmentation approach of orthophotos is performed by advanced deep learning. Finally, the semantic map is mapped into 3D space. For the first time, 3D fine-grained semantic modeling and rugosity evaluation of coral reefs have been completed at millimeter (mm) accuracy. This provides a new and powerful method for understanding the processes and characteristics of coral reef change at high spatial and temporal resolution under climate change."
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation using One-shot Image-to-Image Translation via Latent Representation Mixing,"Domain adaptation is one of the prominent strategies for handling both domain shift, that is widely encountered in large-scale land use/land cover map calculation, and the scarcity of pixel-level ground truth that is crucial for supervised semantic segmentation. Studies focusing on adversarial domain adaptation via re-styling source domain samples, commonly through generative adversarial networks, have reported varying levels of success, yet they suffer from semantic inconsistencies, visual corruptions, and often require a large number of target domain samples. In this letter, we propose a new unsupervised domain adaptation method for the semantic segmentation of very high resolution images, that i) leads to semantically consistent and noise-free images, ii) operates with a single target domain sample (i.e. one-shot) and iii) at a fraction of the number of parameters required from state-of-the-art methods. More specifically an image-to-image translation paradigm is proposed, based on an encoder-decoder principle where latent content representations are mixed across domains, and a perceptual network module and loss function is further introduced to enforce semantic consistency. Cross-city comparative experiments have shown that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods. Our source code will be available at \url{https://github.com/Sarmadfismael/LRM_I2I}."
Gaussian Radar Transformer for Semantic Segmentation in Noisy Radar Data,"Scene understanding is crucial for autonomous robots in dynamic environments for making future state predictions, avoiding collisions, and path planning. Camera and LiDAR perception made tremendous progress in recent years, but face limitations under adverse weather conditions. To leverage the full potential of multi-modal sensor suites, radar sensors are essential for safety critical tasks and are already installed in most new vehicles today. In this paper, we address the problem of semantic segmentation of moving objects in radar point clouds to enhance the perception of the environment with another sensor modality. Instead of aggregating multiple scans to densify the point clouds, we propose a novel approach based on the self-attention mechanism to accurately perform sparse, single-scan segmentation. Our approach, called Gaussian Radar Transformer, includes the newly introduced Gaussian transformer layer, which replaces the softmax normalization by a Gaussian function to decouple the contribution of individual points. To tackle the challenge of the transformer to capture long-range dependencies, we propose our attentive up- and downsampling modules to enlarge the receptive field and capture strong spatial relations. We compare our approach to other state-of-the-art methods on the RadarScenes data set and show superior segmentation quality in diverse environments, even without exploiting temporal information."
ZegCLIP: Towards Adapting CLIP for Zero-shot Semantic Segmentation,"Recently, CLIP has been applied to pixel-level zero-shot learning tasks via a two-stage scheme. The general idea is to first generate class-agnostic region proposals and then feed the cropped proposal regions to CLIP to utilize its image-level zero-shot classification capability. While effective, such a scheme requires two image encoders, one for proposal generation and one for CLIP, leading to a complicated pipeline and high computational cost. In this work, we pursue a simpler-and-efficient one-stage solution that directly extends CLIP's zero-shot prediction capability from image to pixel level. Our investigation starts with a straightforward extension as our baseline that generates semantic masks by comparing the similarity between text and patch embeddings extracted from CLIP. However, such a paradigm could heavily overfit the seen classes and fail to generalize to unseen classes. To handle this issue, we propose three simple-but-effective designs and figure out that they can significantly retain the inherent zero-shot capacity of CLIP and improve pixel-level generalization ability. Incorporating those modifications leads to an efficient zero-shot semantic segmentation system called ZegCLIP. Through extensive experiments on three public benchmarks, ZegCLIP demonstrates superior performance, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin under both ""inductive"" and ""transductive"" zero-shot settings. In addition, compared with the two-stage method, our one-stage ZegCLIP achieves a speedup of about 5 times faster during inference. We release the code at https://github.com/ZiqinZhou66/ZegCLIP.git."
Semantically Enhanced Global Reasoning for Semantic Segmentation,"Recent advances in pixel-level tasks (e.g., segmentation) illustrate the benefit of long-range interactions between aggregated region-based representations that can enhance local features. However, such pixel-to-region associations and the resulting representation, which often take the form of attention, cannot model the underlying semantic structure of the scene (e.g., individual objects and, by extension, their interactions). In this work, we take a step toward addressing this limitation. Specifically, we propose an architecture where we learn to project image features into latent region representations and perform global reasoning across them, using a transformer, to produce contextualized and scene-consistent representations that are then fused with original pixel-level features. Our design enables the latent regions to represent semantically meaningful concepts, by ensuring that activated regions are spatially disjoint and unions of such regions correspond to connected object segments. The resulting semantic global reasoning (SGR) is end-to-end trainable and can be combined with any semantic segmentation framework and backbone. Combining SGR with DeepLabV3 results in a semantic segmentation performance that is competitive to the state-of-the-art, while resulting in more semantically interpretable and diverse region representations, which we show can effectively transfer to detection and instance segmentation. Further, we propose a new metric that allows us to measure the semantics of representations at both the object class and instance level."
IncepFormer: Efficient Inception Transformer with Pyramid Pooling for Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation usually benefits from global contexts, fine localisation information, multi-scale features, etc. To advance Transformer-based segmenters with these aspects, we present a simple yet powerful semantic segmentation architecture, termed as IncepFormer. IncepFormer has two critical contributions as following. First, it introduces a novel pyramid structured Transformer encoder which harvests global context and fine localisation features simultaneously. These features are concatenated and fed into a convolution layer for final per-pixel prediction. Second, IncepFormer integrates an Inception-like architecture with depth-wise convolutions, and a light-weight feed-forward module in each self-attention layer, efficiently obtaining rich local multi-scale object features. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks show that our IncepFormer is superior to state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and speed, e.g., 1) our IncepFormer-S achieves 47.7% mIoU on ADE20K which outperforms the existing best method by 1% while only costs half parameters and fewer FLOPs. 2) Our IncepFormer-B finally achieves 82.0% mIoU on Cityscapes dataset with 39.6M parameters.

Evidential Deep Learning for Class-Incremental Semantic Segmentation,"Class-Incremental Learning is a challenging problem in machine learning that aims to extend previously trained neural networks with new classes. This is especially useful if the system is able to classify new objects despite the original training data being unavailable. While the semantic segmentation problem has received less attention than classification, it poses distinct problems and challenges since previous and future target classes can be unlabeled in the images of a single increment. In this case, the background, past and future classes are correlated and there exist a background-shift. In this paper, we address the problem of how to model unlabeled classes while avoiding spurious feature clustering of future uncorrelated classes. We propose to use Evidential Deep Learning to model the evidence of the classes as a Dirichlet distribution. Our method factorizes the problem into a separate foreground class probability, calculated by the expected value of the Dirichlet distribution, and an unknown class (background) probability corresponding to the uncertainty of the estimate. In our novel formulation, the background probability is implicitly modeled, avoiding the feature space clustering that comes from forcing the model to output a high background score for pixels that are not labeled as objects. Experiments on the incremental Pascal VOC, and ADE20k benchmarks show that our method is superior to state-of-the-art, especially when repeatedly learning new classes with increasing number of increments."
Union-set Multi-source Model Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation,"This paper solves a generalized version of the problem of multi-source model adaptation for semantic segmentation. Model adaptation is proposed as a new domain adaptation problem which requires access to a pre-trained model instead of data for the source domain. A general multi-source setting of model adaptation assumes strictly that each source domain shares a common label space with the target domain. As a relaxation, we allow the label space of each source domain to be a subset of that of the target domain and require the union of the source-domain label spaces to be equal to the target-domain label space. For the new setting named union-set multi-source model adaptation, we propose a method with a novel learning strategy named model-invariant feature learning, which takes full advantage of the diverse characteristics of the source-domain models, thereby improving the generalization in the target domain. We conduct extensive experiments in various adaptation settings to show the superiority of our method. The code is available at https://github.com/lzy7976/union-set-model-adaptation."
Location-Aware Self-Supervised Transformers for Semantic Segmentation,"Pixel-level labels are particularly expensive to acquire. Hence, pretraining is a critical step to improve models on a task like semantic segmentation. However, prominent algorithms for pretraining neural networks use image-level objectives, e.g. image classification, image-text alignment a la CLIP, or self-supervised contrastive learning. These objectives do not model spatial information, which might be sub-optimal when finetuning on downstream tasks with spatial reasoning. In this work, we pretrain network with a location-aware (LOCA) self-supervised method which fosters the emergence of strong dense features. Specifically, we use both a patch-level clustering scheme to mine dense pseudo-labels and a relative location prediction task to encourage learning about object parts and their spatial arrangements. Our experiments show that LOCA pretraining leads to representations that transfer competitively to challenging and diverse semantic segmentation datasets."
SASFormer: Transformers for Sparsely Annotated Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation based on sparse annotation has advanced in recent years. It labels only part of each object in the image, leaving the remainder unlabeled. Most of the existing approaches are time-consuming and often necessitate a multi-stage training strategy. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective sparse annotated semantic segmentation framework based on segformer, dubbed SASFormer, that achieves remarkable performance. Specifically, the framework first generates hierarchical patch attention maps, which are then multiplied by the network predictions to produce correlated regions separated by valid labels. Besides, we also introduce the affinity loss to ensure consistency between the features of correlation results and network predictions. Extensive experiments showcase that our proposed approach is superior to existing methods and achieves cutting-edge performance. The source code is available at \url{https://github.com/su-hui-zz/SASFormer}."
DWRSeg: Dilation-wise Residual Network for Real-time Semantic Segmentation,"Real-time semantic segmentation has played an important role in intelligent vehicle scenarios. Recently, numerous networks have incorporated information from multi-size receptive fields to facilitate feature extraction in real-time semantic segmentation tasks. However, these methods preferentially adopt massive receptive fields to elicit more contextual information, which may result in inefficient feature extraction. We believe that the elaborated receptive fields are crucial, considering the demand for efficient feature extraction in real-time tasks. Therefore, we propose an effective and efficient architecture termed Dilation-wise Residual segmentation (DWRSeg), which possesses different sets of receptive field sizes within different stages. The architecture involves (i) a Dilation-wise Residual (DWR) module for extracting features based on different scales of receptive fields in the high level of the network; (ii) a Simple Inverted Residual (SIR) module that uses an inverted bottleneck structure to extract features from the low stage; and (iii) a simple fully convolutional network (FCN)-like decoder for aggregating multiscale feature maps to generate the prediction. Extensive experiments on the Cityscapes and CamVid datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by achieving a state-of-the-art trade-off between accuracy and inference speed, in addition to being lighter weight. Without using pretraining or resorting to any training trick, we achieve 72.7% mIoU on the Cityscapes test set at a speed of 319.5 FPS on one NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti card, which is significantly faster than existing methods. The code and trained models are publicly available."
Membership Inference Attacks Against Semantic Segmentation Models,"Membership inference attacks aim to infer whether a data record has been used to train a target model by observing its predictions. In sensitive domains such as healthcare, this can constitute a severe privacy violation. In this work we attempt to address the existing knowledge gap by conducting an exhaustive study of membership inference attacks and defences in the domain of semantic image segmentation. Our findings indicate that for certain threat models, these learning settings can be considerably more vulnerable than the previously considered classification settings. We additionally investigate a threat model where a dishonest adversary can perform model poisoning to aid their inference and evaluate the effects that these adaptations have on the success of membership inference attacks. We quantitatively evaluate the attacks on a number of popular model architectures across a variety of semantic segmentation tasks, demonstrating that membership inference attacks in this domain can achieve a high success rate and defending against them may result in unfavourable privacy-utility trade-offs or increased computational costs."
Geometry-Aware Network for Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation,"Measuring and alleviating the discrepancies between the synthetic (source) and real scene (target) data is the core issue for domain adaptive semantic segmentation. Though recent works have introduced depth information in the source domain to reinforce the geometric and semantic knowledge transfer, they cannot extract the intrinsic 3D information of objects, including positions and shapes, merely based on 2D estimated depth. In this work, we propose a novel Geometry-Aware Network for Domain Adaptation (GANDA), leveraging more compact 3D geometric point cloud representations to shrink the domain gaps. In particular, we first utilize the auxiliary depth supervision from the source domain to obtain the depth prediction in the target domain to accomplish structure-texture disentanglement. Beyond depth estimation, we explicitly exploit 3D topology on the point clouds generated from RGB-D images for further coordinate-color disentanglement and pseudo-labels refinement in the target domain. Moreover, to improve the 2D classifier in the target domain, we perform domain-invariant geometric adaptation from source to target and unify the 2D semantic and 3D geometric segmentation results in two domains. Note that our GANDA is plug-and-play in any existing UDA framework. Qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-arts on GTA5->Cityscapes and SYNTHIA->Cityscapes."
Learning to Generate Text-grounded Mask for Open-world Semantic Segmentation from Only Image-Text Pairs,"We tackle open-world semantic segmentation, which aims at learning to segment arbitrary visual concepts in images, by using only image-text pairs without dense annotations. Existing open-world segmentation methods have shown impressive advances by employing contrastive learning (CL) to learn diverse visual concepts and transferring the learned image-level understanding to the segmentation task. However, these CL-based methods suffer from a train-test discrepancy, since it only considers image-text alignment during training, whereas segmentation requires region-text alignment during testing. In this paper, we proposed a novel Text-grounded Contrastive Learning (TCL) framework that enables a model to directly learn region-text alignment. Our method generates a segmentation mask for a given text, extracts text-grounded image embedding from the masked region, and aligns it with text embedding via TCL. By learning region-text alignment directly, our framework encourages a model to directly improve the quality of generated segmentation masks. In addition, for a rigorous and fair comparison, we present a unified evaluation protocol with widely used 8 semantic segmentation datasets. TCL achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot segmentation performances with large margins in all datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/kakaobrain/tcl."
P2Net: A Post-Processing Network for Refining Semantic Segmentation of LiDAR Point Cloud based on Consistency of Consecutive Frames,"We present a lightweight post-processing method to refine the semantic segmentation results of point cloud sequences. Most existing methods usually segment frame by frame and encounter the inherent ambiguity of the problem: based on a measurement in a single frame, labels are sometimes difficult to predict even for humans. To remedy this problem, we propose to explicitly train a network to refine these results predicted by an existing segmentation method. The network, which we call the P2Net, learns the consistency constraints between coincident points from consecutive frames after registration. We evaluate the proposed post-processing method both qualitatively and quantitatively on the SemanticKITTI dataset that consists of real outdoor scenes. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by comparing the results predicted by two representative networks with and without the refinement by the post-processing network. Specifically, qualitative visualization validates the key idea that labels of the points that are difficult to predict can be corrected with P2Net. Quantitatively, overall mIoU is improved from 10.5% to 11.7% for PointNet [1] and from 10.8% to 15.9% for PointNet++ [2]."
Modeling Complex Dialogue Mappings via Sentence Semantic Segmentation Guided Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder,"Complex dialogue mappings (CDM), including one-to-many and many-to-one mappings, tend to make dialogue models generate incoherent or dull responses, and modeling these mappings remains a huge challenge for neural dialogue systems. To alleviate these problems, methods like introducing external information, reconstructing the optimization function, and manipulating data samples are proposed, while they primarily focus on avoiding training with CDM, inevitably weakening the model's ability of understanding CDM in human conversations and limiting further improvements in model performance. This paper proposes a Sentence Semantic \textbf{Seg}mentation guided \textbf{C}onditional \textbf{V}ariational \textbf{A}uto-\textbf{E}ncoder (SegCVAE) method which can model and take advantages of the CDM data. Specifically, to tackle the incoherent problem caused by one-to-many, SegCVAE uses response-related prominent semantics to constrained the latent variable. To mitigate the non-diverse problem brought by many-to-one, SegCVAE segments multiple prominent semantics to enrich the latent variables. Three novel components, Internal Separation, External Guidance, and Semantic Norms, are proposed to achieve SegCVAE. On dialogue generation tasks, both the automatic and human evaluation results show that SegCVAE achieves new state-of-the-art performance."
Conservative-Progressive Collaborative Learning for Semi-supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Pseudo supervision is regarded as the core idea in semi-supervised learning for semantic segmentation, and there is always a tradeoff between utilizing only the high-quality pseudo labels and leveraging all the pseudo labels. Addressing that, we propose a novel learning approach, called Conservative-Progressive Collaborative Learning (CPCL), among which two predictive networks are trained in parallel, and the pseudo supervision is implemented based on both the agreement and disagreement of the two predictions. One network seeks common ground via intersection supervision and is supervised by the high-quality labels to ensure a more reliable supervision, while the other network reserves differences via union supervision and is supervised by all the pseudo labels to keep exploring with curiosity. Thus, the collaboration of conservative evolution and progressive exploration can be achieved. To reduce the influences of the suspicious pseudo labels, the loss is dynamic re-weighted according to the prediction confidence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPCL achieves state-of-the-art performance for semi-supervised semantic segmentation."
FsaNet: Frequency Self-attention for Semantic Segmentation,"Considering the spectral properties of images, we propose a new self-attention mechanism with highly reduced computational complexity, up to a linear rate. To better preserve edges while promoting similarity within objects, we propose individualized processes over different frequency bands. In particular, we study a case where the process is merely over low-frequency components. By ablation study, we show that low frequency self-attention can achieve very close or better performance relative to full frequency even without retraining the network. Accordingly, we design and embed novel plug-and-play modules to the head of a CNN network that we refer to as FsaNet. The frequency self-attention 1) takes low frequency coefficients as input, 2) can be mathematically equivalent to spatial domain self-attention with linear structures, 3) simplifies token mapping (1\times1 convolution) stage and token mixing stage simultaneously. We show that the frequency self-attention requires 87.29\% \sim 90.04\% less memory, 96.13\% \sim 98.07\% less FLOPs, and 97.56\% \sim 98.18\% in run time than the regular self-attention. Compared to other ResNet101-based self-attention networks, FsaNet achieves a new state-of-the-art result (83.0\% mIoU) on Cityscape test dataset and competitive results on ADE20k and VOCaug."
Progressively Dual Prior Guided Few-shot Semantic Segmentation,"Few-shot semantic segmentation task aims at performing segmentation in query images with a few annotated support samples. Currently, few-shot segmentation methods mainly focus on leveraging foreground information without fully utilizing the rich background information, which could result in wrong activation of foreground-like background regions with the inadaptability to dramatic scene changes of support-query image pairs. Meanwhile, the lack of detail mining mechanism could cause coarse parsing results without some semantic components or edge areas since prototypes have limited ability to cope with large object appearance variance. To tackle these problems, we propose a progressively dual prior guided few-shot semantic segmentation network. Specifically, a dual prior mask generation (DPMG) module is firstly designed to suppress the wrong activation in foreground-background comparison manner by regarding background as assisted refinement information. With dual prior masks refining the location of foreground area, we further propose a progressive semantic detail enrichment (PSDE) module which forces the parsing model to capture the hidden semantic details by iteratively erasing the high-confidence foreground region and activating details in the rest region with a hierarchical structure. The collaboration of DPMG and PSDE formulates a novel few-shot segmentation network that can be learned in an end-to-end manner. Comprehensive experiments on PASCAL-5i and MS COCO powerfully demonstrate that our proposed algorithm achieves the great performance."
Semi-Supervised Confidence-Level-based Contrastive Discrimination for Class-Imbalanced Semantic Segmentation,"To overcome the data-hungry challenge, we have proposed a semi-supervised contrastive learning framework for the task of class-imbalanced semantic segmentation. First and foremost, to make the model operate in a semi-supervised manner, we proposed the confidence-level-based contrastive learning to achieve instance discrimination in an explicit manner, and make the low-confidence low-quality features align with the high-confidence counterparts. Moreover, to tackle the problem of class imbalance in crack segmentation and road components extraction, we proposed the data imbalance loss to replace the traditional cross entropy loss in pixel-level semantic segmentation. Finally, we have also proposed an effective multi-stage fusion network architecture to improve semantic segmentation performance. Extensive experiments on the real industrial crack segmentation and the road segmentation demonstrate the superior effectiveness of the proposed framework. Our proposed method can provide satisfactory segmentation results with even merely 3.5% labeled data."
SegCLIP: Patch Aggregation with Learnable Centers for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation,"Recently, the contrastive language-image pre-training, e.g., CLIP, has demonstrated promising results on various downstream tasks. The pre-trained model can capture enriched visual concepts for images by learning from a large scale of text-image data. However, transferring the learned visual knowledge to open-vocabulary semantic segmentation is still under-explored. In this paper, we propose a CLIP-based model named SegCLIP for the topic of open-vocabulary segmentation in an annotation-free manner. The SegCLIP achieves segmentation based on ViT and the main idea is to gather patches with learnable centers to semantic regions through training on text-image pairs. The gathering operation can dynamically capture the semantic groups, which can be used to generate the final segmentation results. We further propose a reconstruction loss on masked patches and a superpixel-based KL loss with pseudo-labels to enhance the visual representation. Experimental results show that our model achieves comparable or superior segmentation accuracy on the PASCAL VOC 2012 (+1.4% mIoU), PASCAL Context (+2.4% mIoU), and COCO (+5.6% mIoU) compared with baselines. We release the code at https://github.com/ArrowLuo/SegCLIP."
Prototype as Query for Few Shot Semantic Segmentation,"Few-shot Semantic Segmentation (FSS) was proposed to segment unseen classes in a query image, referring to only a few annotated examples named support images. One of the characteristics of FSS is spatial inconsistency between query and support targets, e.g., texture or appearance. This greatly challenges the generalization ability of methods for FSS, which requires to effectively exploit the dependency of the query image and the support examples. Most existing methods abstracted support features into prototype vectors and implemented the interaction with query features using cosine similarity or feature concatenation. However, this simple interaction may not capture spatial details in query features. To alleviate this limitation, a few methods utilized all pixel-wise support information via computing the pixel-wise correlations between paired query and support features implemented with the attention mechanism of Transformer. These approaches suffer from heavy computation on the dot-product attention between all pixels of support and query features. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective framework built upon Transformer termed as ProtoFormer to fully capture spatial details in query features. It views the abstracted prototype of the target class in support features as Query and the query features as Key and Value embeddings, which are input to the Transformer decoder. In this way, the spatial details can be better captured and the semantic features of target class in the query image can be focused. The output of the Transformer-based module can be viewed as semantic-aware dynamic kernels to filter out the segmentation mask from the enriched query features. Extensive experiments on PASCAL-5^{i} and COCO-20^{i} show that our ProtoFormer significantly advances the state-of-the-art methods."
Exploring Consistency in Cross-Domain Transformer for Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation,"While transformers have greatly boosted performance in semantic segmentation, domain adaptive transformers are not yet well explored. We identify that the domain gap can cause discrepancies in self-attention. Due to this gap, the transformer attends to spurious regions or pixels, which deteriorates accuracy on the target domain. We propose to perform adaptation on attention maps with cross-domain attention layers that share features between the source and the target domains. Specifically, we impose consistency between predictions from cross-domain attention and self-attention modules to encourage similar distribution in the attention and output of the model across domains, i.e., attention-level and output-level alignment. We also enforce consistency in attention maps between different augmented views to further strengthen the attention-based alignment. Combining these two components, our method mitigates the discrepancy in attention maps across domains and further boosts the performance of the transformer under unsupervised domain adaptation settings. Our model outperforms the existing state-of-the-art baseline model on three widely used benchmarks, including GTAV-to-Cityscapes by 1.3 percent point (pp), Synthia-to-Cityscapes by 0.6 pp, and Cityscapes-to-ACDC by 1.1 pp, on average. Additionally, we verify the effectiveness and generalizability of our method through extensive experiments. Our code will be publicly available."
Rethinking Alignment and Uniformity in Unsupervised Image Semantic Segmentation,"Unsupervised image semantic segmentation(UISS) aims to match low-level visual features with semantic-level representations without outer supervision. In this paper, we address the critical properties from the view of feature alignments and feature uniformity for UISS models. We also make a comparison between UISS and image-wise representation learning. Based on the analysis, we argue that the existing MI-based methods in UISS suffer from representation collapse. By this, we proposed a robust network called Semantic Attention Network(SAN), in which a new module Semantic Attention(SEAT) is proposed to generate pixel-wise and semantic features dynamically. Experimental results on multiple semantic segmentation benchmarks show that our unsupervised segmentation framework specializes in catching semantic representations, which outperforms all the unpretrained and even several pretrained methods."
Residual Pattern Learning for Pixel-wise Out-of-Distribution Detection in Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation models classify pixels into a set of known (``in-distribution'') visual classes. When deployed in an open world, the reliability of these models depends on their ability not only to classify in-distribution pixels but also to detect out-of-distribution (OoD) pixels. Historically, the poor OoD detection performance of these models has motivated the design of methods based on model re-training using synthetic training images that include OoD visual objects. Although successful, these re-trained methods have two issues: 1) their in-distribution segmentation accuracy may drop during re-training, and 2) their OoD detection accuracy does not generalise well to new contexts (e.g., country surroundings) outside the training set (e.g., city surroundings). In this paper, we mitigate these issues with: (i) a new residual pattern learning (RPL) module that assists the segmentation model to detect OoD pixels without affecting the inlier segmentation performance; and (ii) a novel context-robust contrastive learning (CoroCL) that enforces RPL to robustly detect OoD pixels among various contexts. Our approach improves by around 10\% FPR and 7\% AuPRC the previous state-of-the-art in Fishyscapes, Segment-Me-If-You-Can, and RoadAnomaly datasets. Our code is available at: https://github.com/yyliu01/RPL."
DoubleU-NetPlus: A Novel Attention and Context Guided Dual U-Net with Multi-Scale Residual Feature Fusion Network for Semantic Segmentation of Medical Images,"Accurate segmentation of the region of interest in medical images can provide an essential pathway for devising effective treatment plans for life-threatening diseases. It is still challenging for U-Net, and its state-of-the-art variants, such as CE-Net and DoubleU-Net, to effectively model the higher-level output feature maps of the convolutional units of the network mostly due to the presence of various scales of the region of interest, intricacy of context environments, ambiguous boundaries, and multiformity of textures in medical images. In this paper, we exploit multi-contextual features and several attention strategies to increase networks' ability to model discriminative feature representation for more accurate medical image segmentation, and we present a novel dual U-Net-based architecture named DoubleU-NetPlus. The DoubleU-NetPlus incorporates several architectural modifications. In particular, we integrate EfficientNetB7 as the feature encoder module, a newly designed multi-kernel residual convolution module, and an adaptive feature re-calibrating attention-based atrous spatial pyramid pooling module to progressively and precisely accumulate discriminative multi-scale high-level contextual feature maps and emphasize the salient regions. In addition, we introduce a novel triple attention gate module and a hybrid triple attention module to encourage selective modeling of relevant medical image features. Moreover, to mitigate the gradient vanishing issue and incorporate high-resolution features with deeper spatial details, the standard convolution operation is replaced with the attention-guided residual convolution operations, ..."
A Strong Baseline for Generalized Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation,"This paper introduces a generalized few-shot segmentation framework with a straightforward training process and an easy-to-optimize inference phase. In particular, we propose a simple yet effective model based on the well-known InfoMax principle, where the Mutual Information (MI) between the learned feature representations and their corresponding predictions is maximized. In addition, the terms derived from our MI-based formulation are coupled with a knowledge distillation term to retain the knowledge on base classes. With a simple training process, our inference model can be applied on top of any segmentation network trained on base classes. The proposed inference yields substantial improvements on the popular few-shot segmentation benchmarks, PASCAL-5^i and COCO-20^i. Particularly, for novel classes, the improvement gains range from 7% to 26% (PASCAL-5^i) and from 3% to 12% (COCO-20^i) in the 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios, respectively. Furthermore, we propose a more challenging setting, where performance gaps are further exacerbated. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/sinahmr/DIaM."
CoMFormer: Continual Learning in Semantic and Panoptic Segmentation,"Continual learning for segmentation has recently seen increasing interest. However, all previous works focus on narrow semantic segmentation and disregard panoptic segmentation, an important task with real-world impacts. %a In this paper, we present the first continual learning model capable of operating on both semantic and panoptic segmentation. Inspired by recent transformer approaches that consider segmentation as a mask-classification problem, we design CoMFormer. Our method carefully exploits the properties of transformer architectures to learn new classes over time. Specifically, we propose a novel adaptive distillation loss along with a mask-based pseudo-labeling technique to effectively prevent forgetting. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a novel continual panoptic segmentation benchmark on the challenging ADE20K dataset. Our CoMFormer outperforms all the existing baselines by forgetting less old classes but also learning more effectively new classes. In addition, we also report an extensive evaluation in the large-scale continual semantic segmentation scenario showing that CoMFormer also significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods."
UperFormer: A Multi-scale Transformer-based Decoder for Semantic Segmentation,"While a large number of recent works on semantic segmentation focus on designing and incorporating a transformer-based encoder, much less attention and vigor have been devoted to transformer-based decoders. For such a task whose hallmark quest is pixel-accurate prediction, we argue that the decoder stage is just as crucial as that of the encoder in achieving superior segmentation performance, by disentangling and refining the high-level cues and working out object boundaries with pixel-level precision. In this paper, we propose a novel transformer-based decoder called UperFormer, which is plug-and-play for hierarchical encoders and attains high quality segmentation results regardless of encoder architecture. UperFormer is equipped with carefully designed multi-head skip attention units and novel upsampling operations. Multi-head skip attention is able to fuse multi-scale features from backbones with those in decoders. The upsampling operation, which incorporates feature from encoder, can be more friendly for object localization. It brings a 0.4% to 3.2% increase compared with traditional upsampling methods. By combining UperFormer with Swin Transformer (Swin-T), a fully transformer-based symmetric network is formed for semantic segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments show that our proposed approach is highly effective and computationally efficient. On Cityscapes dataset, we achieve state-of-the-art performance. On the more challenging ADE20K dataset, our best model yields a single-scale mIoU of 50.18, and a multi-scale mIoU of 51.8, which is on-par with the current state-of-art model, while we drastically cut the number of FLOPs by 53.5%. Our source code and models are publicly available at: https://github.com/shiwt03/UperFormer"
Contrastive pretraining for semantic segmentation is robust to noisy positive pairs,"Domain-specific variants of contrastive learning can construct positive pairs from two distinct in-domain images, while traditional methods just augment the same image twice. For example, we can form a positive pair from two satellite images showing the same location at different times. Ideally, this teaches the model to ignore changes caused by seasons, weather conditions or image acquisition artifacts. However, unlike in traditional contrastive methods, this can result in undesired positive pairs, since we form them without human supervision. For example, a positive pair might consist of one image before a disaster and one after. This could teach the model to ignore the differences between intact and damaged buildings, which might be what we want to detect in the downstream task. Similar to false negative pairs, this could impede model performance. Crucially, in this setting only parts of the images differ in relevant ways, while other parts remain similar. Surprisingly, we find that downstream semantic segmentation is either robust to such badly matched pairs or even benefits from them. The experiments are conducted on the remote sensing dataset xBD, and a synthetic segmentation dataset for which we have full control over the pairing conditions. As a result, practitioners can use these domain-specific contrastive methods without having to filter their positive pairs beforehand, or might even be encouraged to purposefully include such pairs in their pretraining dataset."
FLAIR #1: semantic segmentation and domain adaptation dataset,"The French National Institute of Geographical and Forest Information (IGN) has the mission to document and measure land-cover on French territory and provides referential geographical datasets, including high-resolution aerial images and topographic maps. The monitoring of land-cover plays a crucial role in land management and planning initiatives, which can have significant socio-economic and environmental impact. Together with remote sensing technologies, artificial intelligence (IA) promises to become a powerful tool in determining land-cover and its evolution. IGN is currently exploring the potential of IA in the production of high-resolution land cover maps. Notably, deep learning methods are employed to obtain a semantic segmentation of aerial images. However, territories as large as France imply heterogeneous contexts: variations in landscapes and image acquisition make it challenging to provide uniform, reliable and accurate results across all of France. The FLAIR-one dataset presented is part of the dataset currently used at IGN to establish the French national reference land cover map ""Occupation du sol à grande échelle"" (OCS- GE)."
One Class One Click: Quasi Scene-level Weakly Supervised Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation with Active Learning,"Reliance on vast annotations to achieve leading performance severely restricts the practicality of large-scale point cloud semantic segmentation. For the purpose of reducing data annotation costs, effective labeling schemes are developed and contribute to attaining competitive results under weak supervision strategy. Revisiting current weak label forms, we introduce One Class One Click (OCOC), a low cost yet informative quasi scene-level label, which encapsulates point-level and scene-level annotations. An active weakly supervised framework is proposed to leverage scarce labels by involving weak supervision from global and local perspectives. Contextual constraints are imposed by an auxiliary scene classification task, respectively based on global feature embedding and point-wise prediction aggregation, which restricts the model prediction merely to OCOC labels. Furthermore, we design a context-aware pseudo labeling strategy, which effectively supplement point-level supervisory signals. Finally, an active learning scheme with a uncertainty measure - temporal output discrepancy is integrated to examine informative samples and provides guidance on sub-clouds query, which is conducive to quickly attaining desirable OCOC annotations and reduces the labeling cost to an extremely low extent. Extensive experimental analysis using three LiDAR benchmarks collected from airborne, mobile and ground platforms demonstrates that our proposed method achieves very promising results though subject to scarce labels. It considerably outperforms genuine scene-level weakly supervised methods by up to 25\% in terms of average F1 score and achieves competitive results against full supervision schemes. On terrestrial LiDAR dataset - Semantics3D, using approximately 2\textpertenthousand{} of labels, our method achieves an average F1 score of 85.2\%, which increases by 11.58\% compared to the baseline model."
Progressive Learning with Cross-Window Consistency for Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Semi-supervised semantic segmentation focuses on the exploration of a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data, which is more in line with the demands of real-world image understanding applications. However, it is still hindered by the inability to fully and effectively leverage unlabeled images. In this paper, we reveal that cross-window consistency (CWC) is helpful in comprehensively extracting auxiliary supervision from unlabeled data. Additionally, we propose a novel CWC-driven progressive learning framework to optimize the deep network by mining weak-to-strong constraints from massive unlabeled data. More specifically, this paper presents a biased cross-window consistency (BCC) loss with an importance factor, which helps the deep network explicitly constrain confidence maps from overlapping regions in different windows to maintain semantic consistency with larger contexts. In addition, we propose a dynamic pseudo-label memory bank (DPM) to provide high-consistency and high-reliability pseudo-labels to further optimize the network. Extensive experiments on three representative datasets of urban views, medical scenarios, and satellite scenes demonstrate our framework consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with a large margin. Code will be available publicly."
Out-of-Candidate Rectification for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Weakly supervised semantic segmentation is typically inspired by class activation maps, which serve as pseudo masks with class-discriminative regions highlighted. Although tremendous efforts have been made to recall precise and complete locations for each class, existing methods still commonly suffer from the unsolicited Out-of-Candidate (OC) error predictions that not belongs to the label candidates, which could be avoidable since the contradiction with image-level class tags is easy to be detected. In this paper, we develop a group ranking-based Out-of-Candidate Rectification (OCR) mechanism in a plug-and-play fashion. Firstly, we adaptively split the semantic categories into In-Candidate (IC) and OC groups for each OC pixel according to their prior annotation correlation and posterior prediction correlation. Then, we derive a differentiable rectification loss to force OC pixels to shift to the IC group. Incorporating our OCR with seminal baselines (e.g., AffinityNet, SEAM, MCTformer), we can achieve remarkable performance gains on both Pascal VOC (+3.2%, +3.3%, +0.8% mIoU) and MS COCO (+1.0%, +1.3%, +0.5% mIoU) datasets with negligible extra training overhead, which justifies the effectiveness and generality of our OCR."
VBLC: Visibility Boosting and Logit-Constraint Learning for Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation under Adverse Conditions,"Generalizing models trained on normal visual conditions to target domains under adverse conditions is demanding in the practical systems. One prevalent solution is to bridge the domain gap between clear- and adverse-condition images to make satisfactory prediction on the target. However, previous methods often reckon on additional reference images of the same scenes taken from normal conditions, which are quite tough to collect in reality. Furthermore, most of them mainly focus on individual adverse condition such as nighttime or foggy, weakening the model versatility when encountering other adverse weathers. To overcome the above limitations, we propose a novel framework, Visibility Boosting and Logit-Constraint learning (VBLC), tailored for superior normal-to-adverse adaptation. VBLC explores the potential of getting rid of reference images and resolving the mixture of adverse conditions simultaneously. In detail, we first propose the visibility boost module to dynamically improve target images via certain priors in the image level. Then, we figure out the overconfident drawback in the conventional cross-entropy loss for self-training method and devise the logit-constraint learning, which enforces a constraint on logit outputs during training to mitigate this pain point. To the best of our knowledge, this is a new perspective for tackling such a challenging task. Extensive experiments on two normal-to-adverse domain adaptation benchmarks, i.e., Cityscapes -> ACDC and Cityscapes -> FoggyCityscapes + RainCityscapes, verify the effectiveness of VBLC, where it establishes the new state of the art. Code is available at https://github.com/BIT-DA/VBLC."
Synthetic Data for Semantic Image Segmentation of Imagery of Unmanned Spacecraft,"Images of spacecraft photographed from other spacecraft operating in outer space are difficult to come by, especially at a scale typically required for deep learning tasks. Semantic image segmentation, object detection and localization, and pose estimation are well researched areas with powerful results for many applications, and would be very useful in autonomous spacecraft operation and rendezvous. However, recent studies show that these strong results in broad and common domains may generalize poorly even to specific industrial applications on earth. To address this, we propose a method for generating synthetic image data that are labelled for semantic segmentation, generalizable to other tasks, and provide a prototype synthetic image dataset consisting of 2D monocular images of unmanned spacecraft, in order to enable further research in the area of autonomous spacecraft rendezvous. We also present a strong benchmark result (Sørensen-Dice coefficient 0.8723) on these synthetic data, suggesting that it is feasible to train well-performing image segmentation models for this task, especially if the target spacecraft and its configuration are known."
LoopDA: Constructing Self-loops to Adapt Nighttime Semantic Segmentation,"Due to the lack of training labels and the difficulty of annotating, dealing with adverse driving conditions such as nighttime has posed a huge challenge to the perception system of autonomous vehicles. Therefore, adapting knowledge from a labelled daytime domain to an unlabelled nighttime domain has been widely researched. In addition to labelled daytime datasets, existing nighttime datasets usually provide nighttime images with corresponding daytime reference images captured at nearby locations for reference. The key challenge is to minimize the performance gap between the two domains. In this paper, we propose LoopDA for domain adaptive nighttime semantic segmentation. It consists of self-loops that result in reconstructing the input data using predicted semantic maps, by rendering them into the encoded features. In a warm-up training stage, the self-loops comprise of an inner-loop and an outer-loop, which are responsible for intra-domain refinement and inter-domain alignment, respectively. To reduce the impact of day-night pose shifts, in the later self-training stage, we propose a co-teaching pipeline that involves an offline pseudo-supervision signal and an online reference-guided signal `DNA' (Day-Night Agreement), bringing substantial benefits to enhance nighttime segmentation. Our model outperforms prior methods on Dark Zurich and Nighttime Driving datasets for semantic segmentation. Code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/fy-vision/LoopDA."
Semantic Segmentation for Fully Automated Macrofouling Analysis on Coatings after Field Exposure,"Biofouling is a major challenge for sustainable shipping, filter membranes, heat exchangers, and medical devices. The development of fouling-resistant coatings requires the evaluation of their effectiveness. Such an evaluation is usually based on the assessment of fouling progression after different exposure times to the target medium (e.g., salt water). The manual assessment of macrofouling requires expert knowledge about local fouling communities due to high variances in phenotypical appearance, has single-image sampling inaccuracies for certain species, and lacks spatial information. Here we present an approach for automatic image-based macrofouling analysis. We created a dataset with dense labels prepared from field panel images and propose a convolutional network (adapted U-Net) for the semantic segmentation of different macrofouling classes. The establishment of macrofouling localization allows for the generation of a successional model which enables the determination of direct surface attachment and in-depth epibiotic studies."
Instance-specific and Model-adaptive Supervision for Semi-supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Recently, semi-supervised semantic segmentation has achieved promising performance with a small fraction of labeled data. However, most existing studies treat all unlabeled data equally and barely consider the differences and training difficulties among unlabeled instances. Differentiating unlabeled instances can promote instance-specific supervision to adapt to the model's evolution dynamically. In this paper, we emphasize the cruciality of instance differences and propose an instance-specific and model-adaptive supervision for semi-supervised semantic segmentation, named iMAS. Relying on the model's performance, iMAS employs a class-weighted symmetric intersection-over-union to evaluate quantitative hardness of each unlabeled instance and supervises the training on unlabeled data in a model-adaptive manner. Specifically, iMAS learns from unlabeled instances progressively by weighing their corresponding consistency losses based on the evaluated hardness. Besides, iMAS dynamically adjusts the augmentation for each instance such that the distortion degree of augmented instances is adapted to the model's generalization capability across the training course. Not integrating additional losses and training procedures, iMAS can obtain remarkable performance gains against current state-of-the-art approaches on segmentation benchmarks under different semi-supervised partition protocols."
EHSNet: End-to-End Holistic Learning Network for Large-Size Remote Sensing Image Semantic Segmentation,"This paper presents EHSNet, a new end-to-end segmentation network designed for the holistic learning of large-size remote sensing image semantic segmentation (LRISS). Large-size remote sensing images (LRIs) can lead to GPU memory exhaustion due to their extremely large size, which has been handled in previous works through either global-local fusion or multi-stage refinement, both of which are limited in their ability to fully exploit the abundant information available in LRIs. Unlike them, EHSNet features three memory-friendly modules to utilize the characteristics of LRIs: a long-range dependency module to develop long-range spatial context, an efficient cross-correlation module to build holistic contextual relationships, and a boundary-aware enhancement module to preserve complete object boundaries. Moreover, EHSNet manages to process holistic LRISS with the aid of memory offloading. To the best of our knowledge, EHSNet is the first method capable of performing holistic LRISS. To make matters better, EHSNet outperforms previous state-of-the-art competitors by a significant margin of +5.65 mIoU on FBP and +4.28 mIoU on Inria Aerial, demonstrating its effectiveness. We hope that EHSNet will provide a new perspective for LRISS. The code and models will be made publicly available."
Computational Optics Meet Domain Adaptation: Transferring Semantic Segmentation Beyond Aberrations,"Semantic scene understanding with Minimalist Optical Systems (MOS) in mobile and wearable applications remains a challenge due to the corrupted imaging quality induced by optical aberrations. However, previous works only focus on improving the subjective imaging quality through computational optics, i.e. Computational Imaging (CI) technique, ignoring the feasibility in semantic segmentation. In this paper, we pioneer to investigate Semantic Segmentation under Optical Aberrations (SSOA) of MOS. To benchmark SSOA, we construct Virtual Prototype Lens (VPL) groups through optical simulation, generating Cityscapes-ab and KITTI-360-ab datasets under different behaviors and levels of aberrations. We look into SSOA via an unsupervised domain adaptation perspective to address the scarcity of labeled aberration data in real-world scenarios. Further, we propose Computational Imaging Assisted Domain Adaptation (CIADA) to leverage prior knowledge of CI for robust performance in SSOA. Based on our benchmark, we conduct experiments on the robustness of state-of-the-art segmenters against aberrations. In addition, extensive evaluations of possible solutions to SSOA reveal that CIADA achieves superior performance under all aberration distributions, paving the way for the applications of MOS in semantic scene understanding. Code and dataset will be made publicly available at https://github.com/zju-jiangqi/CIADA."
Label Mask AutoEncoder(L-MAE): A Pure Transformer Method to Augment Semantic Segmentation Datasets,"Semantic segmentation models based on the conventional neural network can achieve remarkable performance in such tasks, while the dataset is crucial to the training model process. Significant progress in expanding datasets has been made in semi-supervised semantic segmentation recently. However, completing the pixel-level information remains challenging due to possible missing in a label. Inspired by Mask AutoEncoder, we present a simple yet effective Pixel-Level completion method, Label Mask AutoEncoder(L-MAE), that fully uses the existing information in the label to predict results. The proposed model adopts the fusion strategy that stacks the label and the corresponding image, namely Fuse Map. Moreover, since some of the image information is lost when masking the Fuse Map, direct reconstruction may lead to poor performance. Our proposed Image Patch Supplement algorithm can supplement the missing information, as the experiment shows, an average of 4.1% mIoU can be improved. The Pascal VOC2012 dataset (224 crop size, 20 classes) and the Cityscape dataset (448 crop size, 19 classes) are used in the comparative experiments. With the Mask Ratio setting to 50%, in terms of the prediction region, the proposed model achieves 91.0% and 86.4% of mIoU on Pascal VOC 2012 and Cityscape, respectively, outperforming other current supervised semantic segmentation models. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/jjrccop/Label-Mask-Auto-Encoder."
Doubly Contrastive End-to-End Semantic Segmentation for Autonomous Driving under Adverse Weather,"Road scene understanding tasks have recently become crucial for self-driving vehicles. In particular, real-time semantic segmentation is indispensable for intelligent self-driving agents to recognize roadside objects in the driving area. As prior research works have primarily sought to improve the segmentation performance with computationally heavy operations, they require far significant hardware resources for both training and deployment, and thus are not suitable for real-time applications. As such, we propose a doubly contrastive approach to improve the performance of a more practical lightweight model for self-driving, specifically under adverse weather conditions such as fog, nighttime, rain and snow. Our proposed approach exploits both image- and pixel-level contrasts in an end-to-end supervised learning scheme without requiring a memory bank for global consistency or the pretraining step used in conventional contrastive methods. We validate the effectiveness of our method using SwiftNet on the ACDC dataset, where it achieves up to 1.34%p improvement in mIoU (ResNet-18 backbone) at 66.7 FPS (2048x1024 resolution) on a single RTX 3080 Mobile GPU at inference. Furthermore, we demonstrate that replacing image-level supervision with self-supervision achieves comparable performance when pre-trained with clear weather images."
Attention-based Class Activation Diffusion for Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Extracting class activation maps (CAM) is a key step for weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS). The CAM of convolution neural networks fails to capture long-range feature dependency on the image and result in the coverage on only foreground object parts, i.e., a lot of false negatives. An intuitive solution is ``coupling'' the CAM with the long-range attention matrix of visual transformers (ViT) We find that the direct ``coupling'', e.g., pixel-wise multiplication of attention and activation, achieves a more global coverage (on the foreground), but unfortunately goes with a great increase of false positives, i.e., background pixels are mistakenly included. This paper aims to tackle this issue. It proposes a new method to couple CAM and Attention matrix in a probabilistic Diffusion way, and dub it AD-CAM. Intuitively, it integrates ViT attention and CAM activation in a conservative and convincing way. Conservative is achieved by refining the attention between a pair of pixels based on their respective attentions to common neighbors, where the intuition is two pixels having very different neighborhoods are rarely dependent, i.e., their attention should be reduced. Convincing is achieved by diffusing a pixel's activation to its neighbors (on the CAM) in proportion to the corresponding attentions (on the AM). In experiments, our results on two challenging WSSS benchmarks PASCAL VOC and MS~COCO show that AD-CAM as pseudo labels can yield stronger WSSS models than the state-of-the-art variants of CAM."
Delving into Transformer for Incremental Semantic Segmentation,"Incremental semantic segmentation(ISS) is an emerging task where old model is updated by incrementally adding new classes. At present, methods based on convolutional neural networks are dominant in ISS. However, studies have shown that such methods have difficulty in learning new tasks while maintaining good performance on old ones (catastrophic forgetting). In contrast, a Transformer based method has a natural advantage in curbing catastrophic forgetting due to its ability to model both long-term and short-term tasks. In this work, we explore the reasons why Transformer based architecture are more suitable for ISS, and accordingly propose propose TISS, a Transformer based method for Incremental Semantic Segmentation. In addition, to better alleviate catastrophic forgetting while preserving transferability on ISS, we introduce two patch-wise contrastive losses to imitate similar features and enhance feature diversity respectively, which can further improve the performance of TISS. Under extensive experimental settings with Pascal-VOC 2012 and ADE20K datasets, our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art incremental semantic segmentation methods."
Mixture Domain Adaptation to Improve Semantic Segmentation in Real-World Surveillance,"Various tasks encountered in real-world surveillance can be addressed by determining posteriors (e.g. by Bayesian inference or machine learning), based on which critical decisions must be taken. However, the surveillance domain (acquisition device, operating conditions, etc.) is often unknown, which prevents any possibility of scene-specific optimization. In this paper, we define a probabilistic framework and present a formal proof of an algorithm for the unsupervised many-to-infinity domain adaptation of posteriors. Our proposed algorithm is applicable when the probability measure associated with the target domain is a convex combination of the probability measures of the source domains. It makes use of source models and a domain discriminator model trained off-line to compute posteriors adapted on the fly to the target domain. Finally, we show the effectiveness of our algorithm for the task of semantic segmentation in real-world surveillance. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/rvandeghen/MDA."
ELDA: Using Edges to Have an Edge on Semantic Segmentation Based UDA,"Many unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods have been proposed to bridge the domain gap by utilizing domain invariant information. Most approaches have chosen depth as such information and achieved remarkable success. Despite their effectiveness, using depth as domain invariant information in UDA tasks may lead to multiple issues, such as excessively high extraction costs and difficulties in achieving a reliable prediction quality. As a result, we introduce Edge Learning based Domain Adaptation (ELDA), a framework which incorporates edge information into its training process to serve as a type of domain invariant information. In our experiments, we quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrate that the incorporation of edge information is indeed beneficial and effective and enables ELDA to outperform the contemporary state-of-the-art methods on two commonly adopted benchmarks for semantic segmentation based UDA tasks. In addition, we show that ELDA is able to better separate the feature distributions of different classes. We further provide an ablation analysis to justify our design decisions."
Visual Semantic Segmentation Based on Few/Zero-Shot Learning: An Overview,"Visual semantic segmentation aims at separating a visual sample into diverse blocks with specific semantic attributes and identifying the category for each block, and it plays a crucial role in environmental perception. Conventional learning-based visual semantic segmentation approaches count heavily on large-scale training data with dense annotations and consistently fail to estimate accurate semantic labels for unseen categories. This obstruction spurs a craze for studying visual semantic segmentation with the assistance of few/zero-shot learning. The emergence and rapid progress of few/zero-shot visual semantic segmentation make it possible to learn unseen-category from a few labeled or zero-labeled samples, which advances the extension to practical applications. Therefore, this paper focuses on the recently published few/zero-shot visual semantic segmentation methods varying from 2D to 3D space and explores the commonalities and discrepancies of technical settlements under different segmentation circumstances. Specifically, the preliminaries on few/zero-shot visual semantic segmentation, including the problem definitions, typical datasets, and technical remedies, are briefly reviewed and discussed. Moreover, three typical instantiations are involved to uncover the interactions of few/zero-shot learning with visual semantic segmentation, including image semantic segmentation, video object segmentation, and 3D segmentation. Finally, the future challenges of few/zero-shot visual semantic segmentation are discussed."
False: False Negative Samples Aware Contrastive Learning for Semantic Segmentation of High-Resolution Remote Sensing Image,"The existing SSCL of RSI is built based on constructing positive and negative sample pairs. However, due to the richness of RSI ground objects and the complexity of the RSI contextual semantics, the same RSI patches have the coexistence and imbalance of positive and negative samples, which causing the SSCL pushing negative samples far away while pushing positive samples far away, and vice versa. We call this the sample confounding issue (SCI). To solve this problem, we propose a False negAtive sampLes aware contraStive lEarning model (FALSE) for the semantic segmentation of high-resolution RSIs. Since the SSCL pretraining is unsupervised, the lack of definable criteria for false negative sample (FNS) leads to theoretical undecidability, we designed two steps to implement the FNS approximation determination: coarse determination of FNS and precise calibration of FNS. We achieve coarse determination of FNS by the FNS self-determination (FNSD) strategy and achieve calibration of FNS by the FNS confidence calibration (FNCC) loss function. Experimental results on three RSI semantic segmentation datasets demonstrated that the FALSE effectively improves the accuracy of the downstream RSI semantic segmentation task compared with the current three models, which represent three different types of SSCL models. The mean Intersection-over-Union on ISPRS Potsdam dataset is improved by 0.7\% on average; on CVPR DGLC dataset is improved by 12.28\% on average; and on Xiangtan dataset this is improved by 1.17\% on average. This indicates that the SSCL model has the ability to self-differentiate FNS and that the FALSE effectively mitigates the SCI in self-supervised contrastive learning. The source code is available at https://github.com/GeoX-Lab/FALSE."
PiPa: Pixel- and Patch-wise Self-supervised Learning for Domain Adaptative Semantic Segmentation,"Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) aims to enhance the generalization of the learned model to other domains. The domain-invariant knowledge is transferred from the model trained on labeled source domain, e.g., video game, to unlabeled target domains, e.g., real-world scenarios, saving annotation expenses. Existing UDA methods for semantic segmentation usually focus on minimizing the inter-domain discrepancy of various levels, e.g., pixels, features, and predictions, for extracting domain-invariant knowledge. However, the primary intra-domain knowledge, such as context correlation inside an image, remains underexplored. In an attempt to fill this gap, we propose a unified pixel- and patch-wise self-supervised learning framework, called PiPa, for domain adaptive semantic segmentation that facilitates intra-image pixel-wise correlations and patch-wise semantic consistency against different contexts. The proposed framework exploits the inherent structures of intra-domain images, which: (1) explicitly encourages learning the discriminative pixel-wise features with intra-class compactness and inter-class separability, and (2) motivates the robust feature learning of the identical patch against different contexts or fluctuations. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, which obtains competitive accuracy on the two widely-used UDA benchmarks, i.e., 75.6 mIoU on GTA to Cityscapes and 68.2 mIoU on Synthia to Cityscapes. Moreover, our method is compatible with other UDA approaches to further improve the performance without introducing extra parameters."
A Benchmark for Out of Distribution Detection in Point Cloud 3D Semantic Segmentation,"Safety-critical applications like autonomous driving use Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for object detection and segmentation. The DNNs fail to predict when they observe an Out-of-Distribution (OOD) input leading to catastrophic consequences. Existing OOD detection methods were extensively studied for image inputs but have not been explored much for LiDAR inputs. So in this study, we proposed two datasets for benchmarking OOD detection in 3D semantic segmentation. We used Maximum Softmax Probability and Entropy scores generated using Deep Ensembles and Flipout versions of RandLA-Net as OOD scores. We observed that Deep Ensembles out perform Flipout model in OOD detection with greater AUROC scores for both datasets."
LiDAL: Inter-frame Uncertainty Based Active Learning for 3D LiDAR Semantic Segmentation,"We propose LiDAL, a novel active learning method for 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation by exploiting inter-frame uncertainty among LiDAR frames. Our core idea is that a well-trained model should generate robust results irrespective of viewpoints for scene scanning and thus the inconsistencies in model predictions across frames provide a very reliable measure of uncertainty for active sample selection. To implement this uncertainty measure, we introduce new inter-frame divergence and entropy formulations, which serve as the metrics for active selection. Moreover, we demonstrate additional performance gains by predicting and incorporating pseudo-labels, which are also selected using the proposed inter-frame uncertainty measure. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of LiDAL: we achieve 95% of the performance of fully supervised learning with less than 5% of annotations on the SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art active learning methods. Code release: https://github.com/hzykent/LiDAL."
Harmonizing Output Imbalance for semantic segmentation on extremely-imbalanced input data,"Semantic segmentation is a high level computer vision task that assigns a label for each pixel of an image. It is challenging to deal with extremely-imbalanced data in which the ratio of target pixels to background pixels is lower than 1:1000. Such severe input imbalance leads to output imbalance for poor model training. This paper considers three issues for extremely-imbalanced data: inspired by the region-based Dice loss, an implicit measure for the output imbalance is proposed, and an adaptive algorithm is designed for guiding the output imbalance hyperparameter selection; then it is generalized to distribution-based loss for dealing with output imbalance; and finally a compound loss with our adaptive hyperparameter selection algorithm can keep the consistency of training and inference for harmonizing the output imbalance. With four popular deep architectures on our private dataset from three different input imbalance scales and three public datasets, extensive experiments demonstrate the competitive/promising performance of the proposed method."
BriFiSeg: a deep learning-based method for semantic and instance segmentation of nuclei in brightfield images,"Generally, microscopy image analysis in biology relies on the segmentation of individual nuclei, using a dedicated stained image, to identify individual cells. However stained nuclei have drawbacks like the need for sample preparation, and specific equipment on the microscope but most importantly, and as it is in most cases, the nuclear stain is not relevant to the biological questions of interest but is solely used for the segmentation task. In this study, we used non-stained brightfield images for nuclei segmentation with the advantage that they can be acquired on any microscope from both live or fixed samples and do not necessitate specific sample preparation. Nuclei semantic segmentation from brightfield images was obtained, on four distinct cell lines with U-Net-based architectures. We tested systematically deep pre-trained encoders to identify the best performing in combination with the different neural network architectures used. Additionally, two distinct and effective strategies were employed for instance segmentation, followed by thorough instance evaluation. We obtained effective semantic and instance segmentation of nuclei in brightfield images from standard test sets as well as from very diverse biological contexts triggered upon treatment with various small molecule inhibitor. The code used in this study was made public to allow further use by the community."
Domain Adaptive Video Semantic Segmentation via Cross-Domain Moving Object Mixing,"The network trained for domain adaptation is prone to bias toward the easy-to-transfer classes. Since the ground truth label on the target domain is unavailable during training, the bias problem leads to skewed predictions, forgetting to predict hard-to-transfer classes. To address this problem, we propose Cross-domain Moving Object Mixing (CMOM) that cuts several objects, including hard-to-transfer classes, in the source domain video clip and pastes them into the target domain video clip. Unlike image-level domain adaptation, the temporal context should be maintained to mix moving objects in two different videos. Therefore, we design CMOM to mix with consecutive video frames, so that unrealistic movements are not occurring. We additionally propose Feature Alignment with Temporal Context (FATC) to enhance target domain feature discriminability. FATC exploits the robust source domain features, which are trained with ground truth labels, to learn discriminative target domain features in an unsupervised manner by filtering unreliable predictions with temporal consensus. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches through extensive experiments. In particular, our model reaches mIoU of 53.81% on VIPER to Cityscapes-Seq benchmark and mIoU of 56.31% on SYNTHIA-Seq to Cityscapes-Seq benchmark, surpassing the state-of-the-art methods by large margins. The code is available at: https://github.com/kyusik-cho/CMOM."
Quantifying Model Uncertainty for Semantic Segmentation using Operators in the RKHS,"Deep learning models for semantic segmentation are prone to poor performance in real-world applications due to the highly challenging nature of the task. Model uncertainty quantification (UQ) is one way to address this issue of lack of model trustworthiness by enabling the practitioner to know how much to trust a segmentation output. Current UQ methods in this application domain are mainly restricted to Bayesian based methods which are computationally expensive and are only able to extract central moments of uncertainty thereby limiting the quality of their uncertainty estimates. We present a simple framework for high-resolution predictive uncertainty quantification of semantic segmentation models that leverages a multi-moment functional definition of uncertainty associated with the model's feature space in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). The multiple uncertainty functionals extracted from this framework are defined by the local density dynamics of the model's feature space and hence automatically align themselves at the tail-regions of the intrinsic probability density function of the feature space (where uncertainty is the highest) in such a way that the successively higher order moments quantify the more uncertain regions. This leads to a significantly more accurate view of model uncertainty than conventional Bayesian methods. Moreover, the extraction of such moments is done in a single-shot computation making it much faster than Bayesian and ensemble approaches (that involve a high number of forward stochastic passes of the model to quantify its uncertainty). We demonstrate these advantages through experimental evaluations of our framework implemented over four different state-of-the-art model architectures that are trained and evaluated on two benchmark road-scene segmentation datasets (Camvid and Cityscapes)."
Hypergraph Convolutional Network based Weakly Supervised Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation with Scene-Level Annotations,"Point cloud segmentation with scene-level annotations is a promising but challenging task. Currently, the most popular way is to employ the class activation map (CAM) to locate discriminative regions and then generate point-level pseudo labels from scene-level annotations. However, these methods always suffer from the point imbalance among categories, as well as the sparse and incomplete supervision from CAM. In this paper, we propose a novel weighted hypergraph convolutional network-based method, called WHCN, to confront the challenges of learning point-wise labels from scene-level annotations. Firstly, in order to simultaneously overcome the point imbalance among different categories and reduce the model complexity, superpoints of a training point cloud are generated by exploiting the geometrically homogeneous partition. Then, a hypergraph is constructed based on the high-confidence superpoint-level seeds which are converted from scene-level annotations. Secondly, the WHCN takes the hypergraph as input and learns to predict high-precision point-level pseudo labels by label propagation. Besides the backbone network consisting of spectral hypergraph convolution blocks, a hyperedge attention module is learned to adjust the weights of hyperedges in the WHCN. Finally, a segmentation network is trained by these pseudo point cloud labels. We comprehensively conduct experiments on the ScanNet and S3DIS segmentation datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed WHCN is effective to predict the point labels with scene annotations, and yields state-of-the-art results in the community. The source code is available at http://zhiyongsu.github.io/Project/WHCN.html."
Max Pooling with Vision Transformers reconciles class and shape in weakly supervised semantic segmentation,"Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) research has explored many directions to improve the typical pipeline CNN plus class activation maps (CAM) plus refinements, given the image-class label as the only supervision. Though the gap with the fully supervised methods is reduced, further abating the spread seems unlikely within this framework. On the other hand, WSSS methods based on Vision Transformers (ViT) have not yet explored valid alternatives to CAM. ViT features have been shown to retain a scene layout, and object boundaries in self-supervised learning. To confirm these findings, we prove that the advantages of transformers in self-supervised methods are further strengthened by Global Max Pooling (GMP), which can leverage patch features to negotiate pixel-label probability with class probability. This work proposes a new WSSS method dubbed ViT-PCM (ViT Patch-Class Mapping), not based on CAM. The end-to-end presented network learns with a single optimization process, refined shape and proper localization for segmentation masks. Our model outperforms the state-of-the-art on baseline pseudo-masks (BPM), where we achieve 69.3\% mIoU on PascalVOC 2012 val set. We show that our approach has the least set of parameters, though obtaining higher accuracy than all other approaches. In a sentence, quantitative and qualitative results of our method reveal that ViT-PCM is an excellent alternative to CNN-CAM based architectures."
Self-Regularized Prototypical Network for Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation,"The deep CNNs in image semantic segmentation typically require a large number of densely-annotated images for training and have difficulties in generalizing to unseen object categories. Therefore, few-shot segmentation has been developed to perform segmentation with just a few annotated examples. In this work, we tackle the few-shot segmentation using a self-regularized prototypical network (SRPNet) based on prototype extraction for better utilization of the support information. The proposed SRPNet extracts class-specific prototype representations from support images and generates segmentation masks for query images by a distance metric - the fidelity. A direct yet effective prototype regularization on support set is proposed in SRPNet, in which the generated prototypes are evaluated and regularized on the support set itself. The extent to which the generated prototypes restore the support mask imposes an upper limit on performance. The performance on the query set should never exceed the upper limit no matter how complete the knowledge is generalized from support set to query set. With the specific prototype regularization, SRPNet fully exploits knowledge from the support and offers high-quality prototypes that are representative for each semantic class and meanwhile discriminative for different classes. The query performance is further improved by an iterative query inference (IQI) module that combines a set of regularized prototypes. Our proposed SRPNet achieves new state-of-art performance on 1-shot and 5-shot segmentation benchmarks."
Class Based Thresholding in Early Exit Semantic Segmentation Networks,"We propose Class Based Thresholding (CBT) to reduce the computational cost of early exit semantic segmentation models while preserving the mean intersection over union (mIoU) performance. A key idea of CBT is to exploit the naturally-occurring neural collapse phenomenon. Specifically, by calculating the mean prediction probabilities of each class in the training set, CBT assigns different masking threshold values to each class, so that the computation can be terminated sooner for pixels belonging to easy-to-predict classes. We show the effectiveness of CBT on Cityscapes and ADE20K datasets. CBT can reduce the computational cost by 23\% compared to the previous state-of-the-art early exit models."
Open-vocabulary Semantic Segmentation with Frozen Vision-Language Models,"When trained at a sufficient scale, self-supervised learning has exhibited a notable ability to solve a wide range of visual or language understanding tasks. In this paper, we investigate simple, yet effective approaches for adapting the pre-trained foundation models to the downstream task of interest, namely, open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. To this end, we make the following contributions: (i) we introduce Fusioner, with a lightweight, transformer-based fusion module, that pairs the frozen visual representation with language concept through a handful of image segmentation data. As a consequence, the model gains the capability of zero-shot transfer to segment novel categories; (ii) without loss of generality, we experiment on a broad range of self-supervised models that have been pre-trained with different schemes, e.g. visual-only models (MoCo v3, DINO), language-only models (BERT), visual-language model (CLIP), and show that, the proposed fusion approach is effective to any pair of visual and language models, even those pre-trained on a corpus of uni-modal data; (iii) we conduct thorough ablation studies to analyze the critical components in our proposed Fusioner, while evaluating on standard benchmarks, e.g. PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i , it surpasses existing state-of-the-art models by a large margin, despite only being trained on frozen visual and language features; (iv) to measure the model's robustness on learning visual-language correspondence, we further evaluate on synthetic dataset, named Mosaic-4, where images are constructed by mosaicking the samples from FSS-1000. Fusioner demonstrates superior performance over previous models."
Boosting Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation with Probabilistic Representations,"Recent breakthroughs in semi-supervised semantic segmentation have been developed through contrastive learning. In prevalent pixel-wise contrastive learning solutions, the model maps pixels to deterministic representations and regularizes them in the latent space. However, there exist inaccurate pseudo-labels which map the ambiguous representations of pixels to the wrong classes due to the limited cognitive ability of the model. In this paper, we define pixel-wise representations from a new perspective of probability theory and propose a Probabilistic Representation Contrastive Learning (PRCL) framework that improves representation quality by taking its probability into consideration. Through modelling the mapping from pixels to representations as the probability via multivariate Gaussian distributions, we can tune the contribution of the ambiguous representations to tolerate the risk of inaccurate pseudo-labels. Furthermore, we define prototypes in the form of distributions, which indicates the confidence of a class, while the point prototype cannot. Moreover, we propose to regularize the distribution variance to enhance the reliability of representations. Taking advantage of these benefits, high-quality feature representations can be derived in the latent space, thereby the performance of semantic segmentation can be further improved. We conduct sufficient experiment to evaluate PRCL on Pascal VOC and CityScapes to demonstrate its superiority. The code is available at https://github.com/Haoyu-Xie/PRCL."
SemFormer: Semantic Guided Activation Transformer for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Recent mainstream weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) approaches are mainly based on Class Activation Map (CAM) generated by a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) based image classifier. In this paper, we propose a novel transformer-based framework, named Semantic Guided Activation Transformer (SemFormer), for WSSS. We design a transformer-based Class-Aware AutoEncoder (CAAE) to extract the class embeddings for the input image and learn class semantics for all classes of the dataset. The class embeddings and learned class semantics are then used to guide the generation of activation maps with four losses, i.e., class-foreground, class-background, activation suppression, and activation complementation loss. Experimental results show that our SemFormer achieves \textbf{74.3}\% mIoU and surpasses many recent mainstream WSSS approaches by a large margin on PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset. Code will be available at \url{https://github.com/JLChen-C/SemFormer}."
"RGB-T Semantic Segmentation with Location, Activation, and Sharpening","Semantic segmentation is important for scene understanding. To address the scenes of adverse illumination conditions of natural images, thermal infrared (TIR) images are introduced. Most existing RGB-T semantic segmentation methods follow three cross-modal fusion paradigms, i.e. encoder fusion, decoder fusion, and feature fusion. Some methods, unfortunately, ignore the properties of RGB and TIR features or the properties of features at different levels. In this paper, we propose a novel feature fusion-based network for RGB-T semantic segmentation, named \emph{LASNet}, which follows three steps of location, activation, and sharpening. The highlight of LASNet is that we fully consider the characteristics of cross-modal features at different levels, and accordingly propose three specific modules for better segmentation. Concretely, we propose a Collaborative Location Module (CLM) for high-level semantic features, aiming to locate all potential objects. We propose a Complementary Activation Module for middle-level features, aiming to activate exact regions of different objects. We propose an Edge Sharpening Module (ESM) for low-level texture features, aiming to sharpen the edges of objects. Furthermore, in the training phase, we attach a location supervision and an edge supervision after CLM and ESM, respectively, and impose two semantic supervisions in the decoder part to facilitate network convergence. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate that the superiority of our LASNet over relevant state-of-the-art methods. The code and results of our method are available at https://github.com/MathLee/LASNet."
From colouring-in to pointillism: revisiting semantic segmentation supervision,"The prevailing paradigm for producing semantic segmentation training data relies on densely labelling each pixel of each image in the training set, akin to colouring-in books. This approach becomes a bottleneck when scaling up in the number of images, classes, and annotators. Here we propose instead a pointillist approach for semantic segmentation annotation, where only point-wise yes/no questions are answered. We explore design alternatives for such an active learning approach, measure the speed and consistency of human annotators on this task, show that this strategy enables training good segmentation models, and that it is suitable for evaluating models at test time. As concrete proof of the scalability of our method, we collected and released 22.6M point labels over 4,171 classes on the Open Images dataset. Our results enable to rethink the semantic segmentation pipeline of annotation, training, and evaluation from a pointillism point of view."
SphNet: A Spherical Network for Semantic Pointcloud Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation for robotic systems can enable a wide range of applications, from self-driving cars and augmented reality systems to domestic robots. We argue that a spherical representation is a natural one for egocentric pointclouds. Thus, in this work, we present a novel framework exploiting such a representation of LiDAR pointclouds for the task of semantic segmentation. Our approach is based on a spherical convolutional neural network that can seamlessly handle observations from various sensor systems (e.g., different LiDAR systems) and provides an accurate segmentation of the environment. We operate in two distinct stages: First, we encode the projected input pointclouds to spherical features. Second, we decode and back-project the spherical features to achieve an accurate semantic segmentation of the pointcloud. We evaluate our method with respect to state-of-the-art projection-based semantic segmentation approaches using well-known public datasets. We demonstrate that the spherical representation enables us to provide more accurate segmentation and to have a better generalization to sensors with different field-of-view and number of beams than what was seen during training."
Semantic Image Segmentation with Deep Learning for Vine Leaf Phenotyping,"Plant phenotyping refers to a quantitative description of the plants properties, however in image-based phenotyping analysis, our focus is primarily on the plants anatomical, ontogenetical and physiological properties.This technique reinforced by the success of Deep Learning in the field of image based analysis is applicable to a wide range of research areas making high-throughput screens of plants possible, reducing the time and effort needed for phenotypic characterization.In this study, we use Deep Learning methods (supervised and unsupervised learning based approaches) to semantically segment grapevine leaves images in order to develop an automated object detection (through segmentation) system for leaf phenotyping which will yield information regarding their structure and function.In these directions we studied several deep learning approaches with promising results as well as we reported some future challenging tasks in the area of precision agriculture.Our work contributes to plant lifecycle monitoring through which dynamic traits such as growth and development can be captured and quantified, targeted intervention and selective application of agrochemicals and grapevine variety identification which are key prerequisites in sustainable agriculture."
1st Place Solution of The Robust Vision Challenge 2022 Semantic Segmentation Track,"This report describes the winning solution to the Robust Vision Challenge (RVC) semantic segmentation track at ECCV 2022. Our method adopts the FAN-B-Hybrid model as the encoder and uses SegFormer as the segmentation framework. The model is trained on a composite dataset consisting of images from 9 datasets (ADE20K, Cityscapes, Mapillary Vistas, ScanNet, VIPER, WildDash 2, IDD, BDD, and COCO) with a simple dataset balancing strategy. All the original labels are projected to a 256-class unified label space, and the model is trained using a cross-entropy loss. Without significant hyperparameter tuning or any specific loss weighting, our solution ranks the first place on all the testing semantic segmentation benchmarks from multiple domains (ADE20K, Cityscapes, Mapillary Vistas, ScanNet, VIPER, and WildDash 2). The proposed method can serve as a strong baseline for the multi-domain segmentation task and benefit future works. Code will be available at https://github.com/lambert-x/RVC_Segmentation."
An Interpretable Deep Semantic Segmentation Method for Earth Observation,"Earth observation is fundamental for a range of human activities including flood response as it offers vital information to decision makers. Semantic segmentation plays a key role in mapping the raw hyper-spectral data coming from the satellites into a human understandable form assigning class labels to each pixel. In this paper, we introduce a prototype-based interpretable deep semantic segmentation (IDSS) method, which is highly accurate as well as interpretable. Its parameters are in orders of magnitude less than the number of parameters used by deep networks such as U-Net and are clearly interpretable by humans. The proposed here IDSS offers a transparent structure that allows users to inspect and audit the algorithm's decision. Results have demonstrated that IDSS could surpass other algorithms, including U-Net, in terms of IoU (Intersection over Union) total water and Recall total water. We used WorldFloods data set for our experiments and plan to use the semantic segmentation results combined with masks for permanent water to detect flood events."
SLAMs: Semantic Learning based Activation Map for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Recent mainstream weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) approaches mainly relies on image-level classification learning, which has limited representation capacity. In this paper, we propose a novel semantic learning based framework, named SLAMs (Semantic Learning based Activation Map), for WSSS."
Query Semantic Reconstruction for Background in Few-Shot Segmentation,"Few-shot segmentation (FSS) aims to segment unseen classes using a few annotated samples. Typically, a prototype representing the foreground class is extracted from annotated support image(s) and is matched to features representing each pixel in the query image. However, models learnt in this way are insufficiently discriminatory, and often produce false positives: misclassifying background pixels as foreground. Some FSS methods try to address this issue by using the background in the support image(s) to help identify the background in the query image. However, the backgrounds of theses images is often quite distinct, and hence, the support image background information is uninformative. This article proposes a method, QSR, that extracts the background from the query image itself, and as a result is better able to discriminate between foreground and background features in the query image. This is achieved by modifying the training process to associate prototypes with class labels including known classes from the training data and latent classes representing unknown background objects. This class information is then used to extract a background prototype from the query image. To successfully associate prototypes with class labels and extract a background prototype that is capable of predicting a mask for the background regions of the image, the machinery for extracting and using foreground prototypes is induced to become more discriminative between different classes. Experiments for both 1-shot and 5-shot FSS on both the PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i datasets demonstrate that the proposed method results in a significant improvement in performance for the baseline methods it is applied to. As QSR operates only during training, these improved results are produced with no extra computational complexity during testing."
Valuing Vicinity: Memory attention framework for context-based semantic segmentation in histopathology,"The segmentation of histopathological whole slide images into tumourous and non-tumourous types of tissue is a challenging task that requires the consideration of both local and global spatial contexts to classify tumourous regions precisely. The identification of subtypes of tumour tissue complicates the issue as the sharpness of separation decreases and the pathologist's reasoning is even more guided by spatial context. However, the identification of detailed types of tissue is crucial for providing personalized cancer therapies. Due to the high resolution of whole slide images, existing semantic segmentation methods, restricted to isolated image sections, are incapable of processing context information beyond. To take a step towards better context comprehension, we propose a patch neighbour attention mechanism to query the neighbouring tissue context from a patch embedding memory bank and infuse context embeddings into bottleneck hidden feature maps. Our memory attention framework (MAF) mimics a pathologist's annotation procedure -- zooming out and considering surrounding tissue context. The framework can be integrated into any encoder-decoder segmentation method. We evaluate the MAF on a public breast cancer and an internal kidney cancer data set using famous segmentation models (U-Net, DeeplabV3) and demonstrate the superiority over other context-integrating algorithms -- achieving a substantial improvement of up to 17\% on Dice score. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/tio-ikim/valuing-vicinity"
Unsupervised Image Semantic Segmentation through Superpixels and Graph Neural Networks,"Unsupervised image segmentation is an important task in many real-world scenarios where labelled data is of scarce availability. In this paper we propose a novel approach that harnesses recent advances in unsupervised learning using a combination of Mutual Information Maximization (MIM), Neural Superpixel Segmentation and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in an end-to-end manner, an approach that has not been explored yet. We take advantage of the compact representation of superpixels and combine it with GNNs in order to learn strong and semantically meaningful representations of images. Specifically, we show that our GNN based approach allows to model interactions between distant pixels in the image and serves as a strong prior to existing CNNs for an improved accuracy. Our experiments reveal both the qualitative and quantitative advantages of our approach compared to current state-of-the-art methods over four popular datasets."
Transferring learned patterns from ground-based field imagery to predict UAV-based imagery for crop and weed semantic segmentation in precision crop farming,"Weed and crop segmentation is becoming an increasingly integral part of precision farming that leverages the current computer vision and deep learning technologies. Research has been extensively carried out based on images captured with a camera from various platforms. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and ground-based vehicles including agricultural robots are the two popular platforms for data collection in fields. They all contribute to site-specific weed management (SSWM) to maintain crop yield. Currently, the data from these two platforms is processed separately, though sharing the same semantic objects (weed and crop). In our paper, we have developed a deep convolutional network that enables to predict both field and aerial images from UAVs for weed segmentation and mapping with only field images provided in the training phase. The network learning process is visualized by feature maps at shallow and deep layers. The results show that the mean intersection of union (IOU) values of the segmentation for the crop (maize), weeds, and soil background in the developed model for the field dataset are 0.744, 0.577, 0.979, respectively, and the performance of aerial images from an UAV with the same model, the IOU values of the segmentation for the crop (maize), weeds and soil background are 0.596, 0.407, and 0.875, respectively. To estimate the effect on the use of plant protection agents, we quantify the relationship between herbicide spraying saving rate and grid size (spraying resolution) based on the predicted weed map. The spraying saving rate is up to 90% when the spraying resolution is at 1.78 x 1.78 cm2. The study shows that the developed deep convolutional neural network could be used to classify weeds from both field and aerial images and delivers satisfactory results."
HAVANA: Hard negAtiVe sAmples aware self-supervised coNtrastive leArning for Airborne laser scanning point clouds semantic segmentation,"Deep Neural Network (DNN) based point cloud semantic segmentation has presented significant achievements on large-scale labeled aerial laser point cloud datasets. However, annotating such large-scaled point clouds is time-consuming. Due to density variations and spatial heterogeneity of the Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) point clouds, DNNs lack generalization capability and thus lead to unpromising semantic segmentation, as the DNN trained in one region underperform when directly utilized in other regions. However, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) is a promising way to solve this problem by pre-training a DNN model utilizing unlabeled samples followed by a fine-tuned downstream task involving very limited labels. Hence, this work proposes a hard-negative sample aware self-supervised contrastive learning method to pre-train the model for semantic segmentation. The traditional contrastive learning for point clouds selects the hardest negative samples by solely relying on the distance between the embedded features derived from the learning process, potentially evolving some negative samples from the same classes to reduce the contrastive learning effectiveness. Therefore, we design an AbsPAN (Absolute Positive And Negative samples) strategy based on k-means clustering to filter the possible false-negative samples. Experiments on two typical ALS benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is more appealing than supervised training schemes without pre-training. Especially when the labels are severely inadequate (10% of the ISPRS training set), the results obtained by the proposed HAVANA method still exceed 94% of the supervised paradigm performance with full training set."
Pseudo-Label Noise Suppression Techniques for Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Semi-supervised learning (SSL) can reduce the need for large labelled datasets by incorporating unlabelled data into the training. This is particularly interesting for semantic segmentation, where labelling data is very costly and time-consuming. Current SSL approaches use an initially supervised trained model to generate predictions for unlabelled images, called pseudo-labels, which are subsequently used for training a new model from scratch. Since the predictions usually do not come from an error-free neural network, they are naturally full of errors. However, training with partially incorrect labels often reduce the final model performance. Thus, it is crucial to manage errors/noise of pseudo-labels wisely. In this work, we use three mechanisms to control pseudo-label noise and errors: (1) We construct a solid base framework by mixing images with cow-patterns on unlabelled images to reduce the negative impact of wrong pseudo-labels. Nevertheless, wrong pseudo-labels still have a negative impact on the performance. Therefore, (2) we propose a simple and effective loss weighting scheme for pseudo-labels defined by the feedback of the model trained on these pseudo-labels. This allows us to soft-weight the pseudo-label training examples based on their determined confidence score during training. (3) We also study the common practice to ignore pseudo-labels with low confidence and empirically analyse the influence and effect of pseudo-labels with different confidence ranges on SSL and the contribution of pseudo-label filtering to the achievable performance gains. We show that our method performs superior to state of-the-art alternatives on various datasets. Furthermore, we show that our findings also transfer to other tasks such as human pose estimation. Our code is available at https://github.com/ChristmasFan/SSL_Denoising_Segmentation."
p^3VAE: a physics-integrated generative model. Application to the semantic segmentation of optical remote sensing images,"The combination of machine learning models with physical models is a recent research path to learn robust data representations. In this paper, we introduce p^3VAE, a generative model that integrates a perfect physical model which partially explains the true underlying factors of variation in the data. To fully leverage our hybrid design, we propose a semi-supervised optimization procedure and an inference scheme that comes along meaningful uncertainty estimates. We apply p^3VAE to the semantic segmentation of high-resolution hyperspectral remote sensing images. Our experiments on a simulated data set demonstrated the benefits of our hybrid model against conventional machine learning models in terms of extrapolation capabilities and interpretability. In particular, we show that p^3VAE naturally has high disentanglement capabilities. Our code and data have been made publicly available at https://github.com/Romain3Ch216/p3VAE."
Number-Adaptive Prototype Learning for 3D Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation,"3D point cloud semantic segmentation is one of the fundamental tasks for 3D scene understanding and has been widely used in the metaverse applications. Many recent 3D semantic segmentation methods learn a single prototype (classifier weights) for each semantic class, and classify 3D points according to their nearest prototype. However, learning only one prototype for each class limits the model's ability to describe the high variance patterns within a class. Instead of learning a single prototype for each class, in this paper, we propose to use an adaptive number of prototypes to dynamically describe the different point patterns within a semantic class. With the powerful capability of vision transformer, we design a Number-Adaptive Prototype Learning (NAPL) model for point cloud semantic segmentation. To train our NAPL model, we propose a simple yet effective prototype dropout training strategy, which enables our model to adaptively produce prototypes for each class. The experimental results on SemanticKITTI dataset demonstrate that our method achieves 2.3% mIoU improvement over the baseline model based on the point-wise classification paradigm."
Heterogeneous Feature Distillation Network for SAR Image Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation for SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) images has attracted increasing attention in the remote sensing community recently, due to SAR's all-time and all-weather imaging capability. However, SAR images are generally more difficult to be segmented than their EO (Electro-Optical) counterparts, since speckle noises and layovers are inevitably involved in SAR images. To address this problem, we investigate how to introduce EO features to assist the training of a SAR-segmentation model, and propose a heterogeneous feature distillation network for segmenting SAR images, called HFD-Net, where a SAR-segmentation student model gains knowledge from a pre-trained EO-segmentation teacher model. In the proposed HFD-Net, both the student and teacher models employ an identical architecture but different parameter configurations, and a heterogeneous feature distillation model is explored for transferring latent EO features from the teacher model to the student model and then enhancing the ability of the student model for SAR image segmentation. In addition, a heterogeneous feature alignment module is explored to aggregate multi-scale features for segmentation in each of the student model and teacher model. Extensive experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate that the proposed HFD-Net outperforms seven state-of-the-art SAR image semantic segmentation methods."
Fuzzy Positive Learning for Semi-supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Semi-supervised learning (SSL) essentially pursues class boundary exploration with less dependence on human annotations. Although typical attempts focus on ameliorating the inevitable error-prone pseudo-labeling, we think differently and resort to exhausting informative semantics from multiple probably correct candidate labels. In this paper, we introduce Fuzzy Positive Learning (FPL) for accurate SSL semantic segmentation in a plug-and-play fashion, targeting adaptively encouraging fuzzy positive predictions and suppressing highly-probable negatives. Being conceptually simple yet practically effective, FPL can remarkably alleviate interference from wrong pseudo labels and progressively achieve clear pixel-level semantic discrimination. Concretely, our FPL approach consists of two main components, including fuzzy positive assignment (FPA) to provide an adaptive number of labels for each pixel and fuzzy positive regularization (FPR) to restrict the predictions of fuzzy positive categories to be larger than the rest under different perturbations. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on Cityscapes and VOC 2012 with consistent performance gain justify the superiority of our approach."
Semantic Segmentation with Active Semi-Supervised Representation Learning,"Obtaining human per-pixel labels for semantic segmentation is incredibly laborious, often making labeled dataset construction prohibitively expensive. Here, we endeavor to overcome this problem with a novel algorithm that combines semi-supervised and active learning, resulting in the ability to train an effective semantic segmentation algorithm with significantly lesser labeled data. To do this, we extend the prior state-of-the-art S4AL algorithm by replacing its mean teacher approach for semi-supervised learning with a self-training approach that improves learning with noisy labels. We further boost the neural network's ability to query useful data by adding a contrastive learning head, which leads to better understanding of the objects in the scene, and hence, better queries for active learning. We evaluate our method on CamVid and CityScapes datasets, the de-facto standards for active learning for semantic segmentation. We achieve more than 95% of the network's performance on CamVid and CityScapes datasets, utilizing only 12.1% and 15.1% of the labeled data, respectively. We also benchmark our method across existing stand-alone semi-supervised learning methods on the CityScapes dataset and achieve superior performance without any bells or whistles."
Prediction Calibration for Generalized Few-shot Semantic Segmentation,"Generalized Few-shot Semantic Segmentation (GFSS) aims to segment each image pixel into either base classes with abundant training examples or novel classes with only a handful of (e.g., 1-5) training images per class. Compared to the widely studied Few-shot Semantic Segmentation FSS, which is limited to segmenting novel classes only, GFSS is much under-studied despite being more practical. Existing approach to GFSS is based on classifier parameter fusion whereby a newly trained novel class classifier and a pre-trained base class classifier are combined to form a new classifier. As the training data is dominated by base classes, this approach is inevitably biased towards the base classes. In this work, we propose a novel Prediction Calibration Network PCN to address this problem. Instead of fusing the classifier parameters, we fuse the scores produced separately by the base and novel classifiers. To ensure that the fused scores are not biased to either the base or novel classes, a new Transformer-based calibration module is introduced. It is known that the lower-level features are useful of detecting edge information in an input image than higher-level features. Thus, we build a cross-attention module that guides the classifier's final prediction using the fused multi-level features. However, transformers are computationally demanding. Crucially, to make the proposed cross-attention module training tractable at the pixel level, this module is designed based on feature-score cross-covariance and episodically trained to be generalizable at inference time. Extensive experiments on PASCAL-5^{i} and COCO-20^{i} show that our PCN outperforms the state-the-the-art alternatives by large margins."
LESS: Label-Efficient Semantic Segmentation for LiDAR Point Clouds,"Semantic segmentation of LiDAR point clouds is an important task in autonomous driving. However, training deep models via conventional supervised methods requires large datasets which are costly to label. It is critical to have label-efficient segmentation approaches to scale up the model to new operational domains or to improve performance on rare cases. While most prior works focus on indoor scenes, we are one of the first to propose a label-efficient semantic segmentation pipeline for outdoor scenes with LiDAR point clouds. Our method co-designs an efficient labeling process with semi/weakly supervised learning and is applicable to nearly any 3D semantic segmentation backbones. Specifically, we leverage geometry patterns in outdoor scenes to have a heuristic pre-segmentation to reduce the manual labeling and jointly design the learning targets with the labeling process. In the learning step, we leverage prototype learning to get more descriptive point embeddings and use multi-scan distillation to exploit richer semantics from temporally aggregated point clouds to boost the performance of single-scan models. Evaluated on the SemanticKITTI and the nuScenes datasets, we show that our proposed method outperforms existing label-efficient methods. With extremely limited human annotations (e.g., 0.1% point labels), our proposed method is even highly competitive compared to the fully supervised counterpart with 100% labels."
"Hierarchical Approach for Joint Semantic, Plant Instance, and Leaf Instance Segmentation in the Agricultural Domain","Plant phenotyping is a central task in agriculture, as it describes plants' growth stage, development, and other relevant quantities. Robots can help automate this process by accurately estimating plant traits such as the number of leaves, leaf area, and the plant size. In this paper, we address the problem of joint semantic, plant instance, and leaf instance segmentation of crop fields from RGB data. We propose a single convolutional neural network that addresses the three tasks simultaneously, exploiting their underlying hierarchical structure. We introduce task-specific skip connections, which our experimental evaluation proves to be more beneficial than the usual schemes. We also propose a novel automatic post-processing, which explicitly addresses the problem of spatially close instances, common in the agricultural domain because of overlapping leaves. Our architecture simultaneously tackles these problems jointly in the agricultural context. Previous works either focus on plant or leaf segmentation, or do not optimise for semantic segmentation. Results show that our system has superior performance to state-of-the-art approaches, while having a reduced number of parameters and is operating at camera frame rate."
Synthetic-to-real Composite Semantic Segmentation in Additive Manufacturing,"The application of computer vision and machine learning methods in the field of additive manufacturing (AM) for semantic segmentation of the structural elements of 3-D printed products will improve real-time failure analysis systems and can potentially reduce the number of defects by enabling in situ corrections. This work demonstrates the possibilities of using physics-based rendering for labeled image dataset generation, as well as image-to-image translation capabilities to improve the accuracy of real image segmentation for AM systems. Multi-class semantic segmentation experiments were carried out based on the U-Net model and cycle generative adversarial network. The test results demonstrated the capacity of detecting such structural elements of 3-D printed parts as a top layer, infill, shell, and support. A basis for further segmentation system enhancement by utilizing image-to-image style transfer and domain adaptation technologies was also developed. The results indicate that using style transfer as a precursor to domain adaptation can significantly improve real 3-D printing image segmentation in situations where a model trained on synthetic data is the only tool available. The mean intersection over union (mIoU) scores for synthetic test datasets included 94.90% for the entire 3-D printed part, 73.33% for the top layer, 78.93% for the infill, 55.31% for the shell, and 69.45% for supports."
Attribution-aware Weight Transfer: A Warm-Start Initialization for Class-Incremental Semantic Segmentation,"In class-incremental semantic segmentation (CISS), deep learning architectures suffer from the critical problems of catastrophic forgetting and semantic background shift. Although recent works focused on these issues, existing classifier initialization methods do not address the background shift problem and assign the same initialization weights to both background and new foreground class classifiers. We propose to address the background shift with a novel classifier initialization method which employs gradient-based attribution to identify the most relevant weights for new classes from the classifier's weights for the previous background and transfers these weights to the new classifier. This warm-start weight initialization provides a general solution applicable to several CISS methods. Furthermore, it accelerates learning of new classes while mitigating forgetting. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvement in mIoU compared to the state-of-the-art CISS methods on the Pascal-VOC 2012, ADE20K and Cityscapes datasets."
RTFormer: Efficient Design for Real-Time Semantic Segmentation with Transformer,"Recently, transformer-based networks have shown impressive results in semantic segmentation. Yet for real-time semantic segmentation, pure CNN-based approaches still dominate in this field, due to the time-consuming computation mechanism of transformer. We propose RTFormer, an efficient dual-resolution transformer for real-time semantic segmenation, which achieves better trade-off between performance and efficiency than CNN-based models. To achieve high inference efficiency on GPU-like devices, our RTFormer leverages GPU-Friendly Attention with linear complexity and discards the multi-head mechanism. Besides, we find that cross-resolution attention is more efficient to gather global context information for high-resolution branch by spreading the high level knowledge learned from low-resolution branch. Extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed RTFormer, it achieves state-of-the-art on Cityscapes, CamVid and COCOStuff, and shows promising results on ADE20K. Code is available at PaddleSeg: https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleSeg."
Learning with Style: Continual Semantic Segmentation Across Tasks and Domains,"Deep learning models dealing with image understanding in real-world settings must be able to adapt to a wide variety of tasks across different domains. Domain adaptation and class incremental learning deal with domain and task variability separately, whereas their unified solution is still an open problem. We tackle both facets of the problem together, taking into account the semantic shift within both input and label spaces. We start by formally introducing continual learning under task and domain shift. Then, we address the proposed setup by using style transfer techniques to extend knowledge across domains when learning incremental tasks and a robust distillation framework to effectively recollect task knowledge under incremental domain shift. The devised framework (LwS, Learning with Style) is able to generalize incrementally acquired task knowledge across all the domains encountered, proving to be robust against catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experimental evaluation on multiple autonomous driving datasets shows how the proposed method outperforms existing approaches, which prove to be ill-equipped to deal with continual semantic segmentation under both task and domain shift."
ALIFE: Adaptive Logit Regularizer and Feature Replay for Incremental Semantic Segmentation,"We address the problem of incremental semantic segmentation (ISS) recognizing novel object/stuff categories continually without forgetting previous ones that have been learned. The catastrophic forgetting problem is particularly severe in ISS, since pixel-level ground-truth labels are available only for the novel categories at training time. To address the problem, regularization-based methods exploit probability calibration techniques to learn semantic information from unlabeled pixels. While such techniques are effective, there is still a lack of theoretical understanding of them. Replay-based methods propose to memorize a small set of images for previous categories. They achieve state-of-the-art performance at the cost of large memory footprint. We propose in this paper a novel ISS method, dubbed ALIFE, that provides a better compromise between accuracy and efficiency. To this end, we first show an in-depth analysis on the calibration techniques to better understand the effects on ISS. Based on this, we then introduce an adaptive logit regularizer (ALI) that enables our model to better learn new categories, while retaining knowledge for previous ones. We also present a feature replay scheme that memorizes features, instead of images directly, in order to reduce memory requirements significantly. Since a feature extractor is changed continually, memorized features should also be updated at every incremental stage. To handle this, we introduce category-specific rotation matrices updating the features for each category separately. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with extensive experiments on standard ISS benchmarks, and show that our method achieves a better trade-off in terms of accuracy and efficiency."
On the calibration of underrepresented classes in LiDAR-based semantic segmentation,"The calibration of deep learning-based perception models plays a crucial role in their reliability. Our work focuses on a class-wise evaluation of several model's confidence performance for LiDAR-based semantic segmentation with the aim of providing insights into the calibration of underrepresented classes. Those classes often include VRUs and are thus of particular interest for safety reasons. With the help of a metric based on sparsification curves we compare the calibration abilities of three semantic segmentation models with different architectural concepts, each in a in deterministic and a probabilistic version. By identifying and describing the dependency between the predictive performance of a class and the respective calibration quality we aim to facilitate the model selection and refinement for safety-critical applications."
Intermediate Prototype Mining Transformer for Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation,"Few-shot semantic segmentation aims to segment the target objects in query under the condition of a few annotated support images. Most previous works strive to mine more effective category information from the support to match with the corresponding objects in query. However, they all ignored the category information gap between query and support images. If the objects in them show large intra-class diversity, forcibly migrating the category information from the support to the query is ineffective. To solve this problem, we are the first to introduce an intermediate prototype for mining both deterministic category information from the support and adaptive category knowledge from the query. Specifically, we design an Intermediate Prototype Mining Transformer (IPMT) to learn the prototype in an iterative way. In each IPMT layer, we propagate the object information in both support and query features to the prototype and then use it to activate the query feature map. By conducting this process iteratively, both the intermediate prototype and the query feature can be progressively improved. At last, the final query feature is used to yield precise segmentation prediction. Extensive experiments on both PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i datasets clearly verify the effectiveness of our IPMT and show that it outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. Code is available at https://github.com/LIUYUANWEI98/IPMT"
Reducing Annotation Effort by Identifying and Labeling Contextually Diverse Classes for Semantic Segmentation Under Domain Shift,"In Active Domain Adaptation (ADA), one uses Active Learning (AL) to select a subset of images from the target domain, which are then annotated and used for supervised domain adaptation (DA). Given the large performance gap between supervised and unsupervised DA techniques, ADA allows for an excellent trade-off between annotation cost and performance. Prior art makes use of measures of uncertainty or disagreement of models to identify `regions' to be annotated by the human oracle. However, these regions frequently comprise of pixels at object boundaries which are hard and tedious to annotate. Hence, even if the fraction of image pixels annotated reduces, the overall annotation time and the resulting cost still remain high. In this work, we propose an ADA strategy, which given a frame, identifies a set of classes that are hardest for the model to predict accurately, thereby recommending semantically meaningful regions to be annotated in a selected frame. We show that these set of `hard' classes are context-dependent and typically vary across frames, and when annotated help the model generalize better. We propose two ADA techniques: the Anchor-based and Augmentation-based approaches to select complementary and diverse regions in the context of the current training set. Our approach achieves 66.6 mIoU on GTA to Cityscapes dataset with an annotation budget of 4.7% in comparison to 64.9 mIoU by MADA using 5% of annotations. Our technique can also be used as a decorator for any existing frame-based AL technique, e.g., we report 1.5% performance improvement for CDAL on Cityscapes using our approach."
DCANet: Differential Convolution Attention Network for RGB-D Semantic Segmentation,"Combining RGB images and the corresponding depth maps in semantic segmentation proves the effectiveness in the past few years. Existing RGB-D modal fusion methods either lack the non-linear feature fusion ability or treat both modal images equally, regardless of the intrinsic distribution gap or information loss. Here we find that depth maps are suitable to provide intrinsic fine-grained patterns of objects due to their local depth continuity, while RGB images effectively provide a global view. Based on this, we propose a pixel differential convolution attention (DCA) module to consider geometric information and local-range correlations for depth data. Furthermore, we extend DCA to ensemble differential convolution attention (EDCA) which propagates long-range contextual dependencies and seamlessly incorporates spatial distribution for RGB data. DCA and EDCA dynamically adjust convolutional weights by pixel difference to enable self-adaptive in local and long range, respectively. A two-branch network built with DCA and EDCA, called Differential Convolutional Network (DCANet), is proposed to fuse local and global information of two-modal data. Consequently, the individual advantage of RGB and depth data are emphasized. Our DCANet is shown to set a new state-of-the-art performance for RGB-D semantic segmentation on two challenging benchmark datasets, i.e., NYUDv2 and SUN-RGBD."
ACSeg: Adaptive Conceptualization for Unsupervised Semantic Segmentation,"Recently, self-supervised large-scale visual pre-training models have shown great promise in representing pixel-level semantic relationships, significantly promoting the development of unsupervised dense prediction tasks, e.g., unsupervised semantic segmentation (USS). The extracted relationship among pixel-level representations typically contains rich class-aware information that semantically identical pixel embeddings in the representation space gather together to form sophisticated concepts. However, leveraging the learned models to ascertain semantically consistent pixel groups or regions in the image is non-trivial since over/ under-clustering overwhelms the conceptualization procedure under various semantic distributions of different images. In this work, we investigate the pixel-level semantic aggregation in self-supervised ViT pre-trained models as image Segmentation and propose the Adaptive Conceptualization approach for USS, termed ACSeg. Concretely, we explicitly encode concepts into learnable prototypes and design the Adaptive Concept Generator (ACG), which adaptively maps these prototypes to informative concepts for each image. Meanwhile, considering the scene complexity of different images, we propose the modularity loss to optimize ACG independent of the concept number based on estimating the intensity of pixel pairs belonging to the same concept. Finally, we turn the USS task into classifying the discovered concepts in an unsupervised manner. Extensive experiments with state-of-the-art results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ACSeg."
Decomposed Knowledge Distillation for Class-Incremental Semantic Segmentation,"Class-incremental semantic segmentation (CISS) labels each pixel of an image with a corresponding object/stuff class continually. To this end, it is crucial to learn novel classes incrementally without forgetting previously learned knowledge. Current CISS methods typically use a knowledge distillation (KD) technique for preserving classifier logits, or freeze a feature extractor, to avoid the forgetting problem. The strong constraints, however, prevent learning discriminative features for novel classes. We introduce a CISS framework that alleviates the forgetting problem and facilitates learning novel classes effectively. We have found that a logit can be decomposed into two terms. They quantify how likely an input belongs to a particular class or not, providing a clue for a reasoning process of a model. The KD technique, in this context, preserves the sum of two terms (i.e., a class logit), suggesting that each could be changed and thus the KD does not imitate the reasoning process. To impose constraints on each term explicitly, we propose a new decomposed knowledge distillation (DKD) technique, improving the rigidity of a model and addressing the forgetting problem more effectively. We also introduce a novel initialization method to train new classifiers for novel classes. In CISS, the number of negative training samples for novel classes is not sufficient to discriminate old classes. To mitigate this, we propose to transfer knowledge of negatives to the classifiers successively using an auxiliary classifier, boosting the performance significantly. Experimental results on standard CISS benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework."
LACV-Net: Semantic Segmentation of Large-Scale Point Cloud Scene via Local Adaptive and Comprehensive VLAD,"Large-scale point cloud semantic segmentation is an important task in 3D computer vision, which is widely applied in autonomous driving, robotics, and virtual reality. Current large-scale point cloud semantic segmentation methods usually use down-sampling operations to improve computation efficiency and acquire point clouds with multi-resolution. However, this may cause the problem of missing local information. Meanwhile, it is difficult for networks to capture global information in large-scale distributed contexts. To capture local and global information effectively, we propose an end-to-end deep neural network called LACV-Net for large-scale point cloud semantic segmentation. The proposed network contains three main components: 1) a local adaptive feature augmentation module (LAFA) to adaptively learn the similarity of centroids and neighboring points to augment the local context; 2) a comprehensive VLAD module (C-VLAD) that fuses local features with multi-layer, multi-scale, and multi-resolution to represent a comprehensive global description vector; and 3) an aggregation loss function to effectively optimize the segmentation boundaries by constraining the adaptive weight from the LAFA module. Compared to state-of-the-art networks on several large-scale benchmark datasets, including S3DIS, Toronto3D, and SensatUrban, we demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed network."
SegViT: Semantic Segmentation with Plain Vision Transformers,"We explore the capability of plain Vision Transformers (ViTs) for semantic segmentation and propose the SegVit. Previous ViT-based segmentation networks usually learn a pixel-level representation from the output of the ViT. Differently, we make use of the fundamental component -- attention mechanism, to generate masks for semantic segmentation. Specifically, we propose the Attention-to-Mask (ATM) module, in which the similarity maps between a set of learnable class tokens and the spatial feature maps are transferred to the segmentation masks. Experiments show that our proposed SegVit using the ATM module outperforms its counterparts using the plain ViT backbone on the ADE20K dataset and achieves new state-of-the-art performance on COCO-Stuff-10K and PASCAL-Context datasets. Furthermore, to reduce the computational cost of the ViT backbone, we propose query-based down-sampling (QD) and query-based up-sampling (QU) to build a Shrunk structure. With the proposed Shrunk structure, the model can save up to 40\% computations while maintaining competitive performance."
Semantic Segmentation under Adverse Conditions: A Weather and Nighttime-aware Synthetic Data-based Approach,"Recent semantic segmentation models perform well under standard weather conditions and sufficient illumination but struggle with adverse weather conditions and nighttime. Collecting and annotating training data under these conditions is expensive, time-consuming, error-prone, and not always practical. Usually, synthetic data is used as a feasible data source to increase the amount of training data. However, just directly using synthetic data may actually harm the model's performance under normal weather conditions while getting only small gains in adverse situations. Therefore, we present a novel architecture specifically designed for using synthetic training data for domain adaptation. We propose a simple yet powerful addition to DeepLabV3+ by using weather and time-of-the-day supervisors trained with multi-task learning, making it both weather and nighttime aware, which improves its mIoU accuracy by 14 percentage points on the ACDC dataset while maintaining a score of 75\% mIoU on the Cityscapes dataset. Our code is available at https://github.com/lsmcolab/Semantic-Segmentation-under-Adverse-Conditions."
Hypergraph Convolutional Networks for Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation is a fundamental topic in computer vision. Several deep learning methods have been proposed for semantic segmentation with outstanding results. However, these models require a lot of densely annotated images. To address this problem, we propose a new algorithm that uses HyperGraph Convolutional Networks for Weakly-supervised Semantic Segmentation (HyperGCN-WSS). Our algorithm constructs spatial and k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) graphs from the images in the dataset to generate the hypergraphs. Then, we train a specialized HyperGraph Convolutional Network (HyperGCN) architecture using some weak signals. The outputs of the HyperGCN are denominated pseudo-labels, which are later used to train a DeepLab model for semantic segmentation. HyperGCN-WSS is evaluated on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset for semantic segmentation, using scribbles or clicks as weak signals. Our algorithm shows competitive performance against previous methods."
DPANET:Dual Pooling Attention Network for Semantic Segmentation,"Image segmentation is a historic and significant computer vision task. With the help of deep learning techniques, image semantic segmentation has made great progresses. Over recent years, based on guidance of attention mechanism compared with CNN which overcomes the problems of lacking of interaction between different channels, and effective capturing and aggregating contextual information. However, the massive operations generated by the attention mechanism lead to its extremely high complexity and high demand for GPU memory. For this purpose, we propose a lightweight and flexible neural network named Dual Pool Attention Network(DPANet). The most important is that all modules in DPANet generate \textbf{0} parameters. The first component is spatial pool attention module, we formulate an easy and powerful method densely to extract contextual characteristics and reduce the amount of calculation and complexity dramatically.Meanwhile, it demonstrates the power of even and large kernel size. The second component is channel pool attention module. It is known that the computation process of CNN incorporates the information of spatial and channel dimensions. So, the aim of this module is stripping them out, in order to construct relationship of all channels and heighten different channels semantic information selectively. Moreover, we experiments on segmentation datasets, which shows our method simple and effective with low parameters and calculation complexity."
Sequential Ensembling for Semantic Segmentation,"Ensemble approaches for deep-learning-based semantic segmentation remain insufficiently explored despite the proliferation of competitive benchmarks and downstream applications. In this work, we explore and benchmark the popular ensembling approach of combining predictions of multiple, independently-trained, state-of-the-art models at test time on popular datasets. Furthermore, we propose a novel method inspired by boosting to sequentially ensemble networks that significantly outperforms the naive ensemble baseline. Our approach trains a cascade of models conditioned on class probabilities predicted by the previous model as an additional input. A key benefit of this approach is that it allows for dynamic computation offloading, which helps deploy models on mobile devices. Our proposed novel ADaptive modulatiON (ADON) block allows spatial feature modulation at various layers using previous-stage probabilities. Our approach does not require sophisticated sample selection strategies during training and works with multiple neural architectures. We significantly improve over the naive ensemble baseline on challenging datasets such as Cityscapes, ADE-20K, COCO-Stuff, and PASCAL-Context and set a new state-of-the-art."
Image Segmentation Semantic Communication over Internet of Vehicles,"In this paper, the problem of semantic-based efficient image transmission is studied over the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). In the considered model, a vehicle shares massive amount of visual data perceived by its visual sensors to assist other vehicles in making driving decisions. However, it is hard to maintain a high reliable visual data transmission due to the limited spectrum resources. To tackle this problem, a semantic communication approach is introduced to reduce the transmission data amount while ensuring the semantic-level accuracy. Particularly, an image segmentation semantic communication (ISSC) system is proposed, which can extract the semantic features from the perceived images and transmit the features to the receiving vehicle that reconstructs the image segmentations. The ISSC system consists of an encoder and a decoder at the transmitter and the receiver, respectively. To accurately extract the image semantic features, the ISSC system encoder employs a Swin Transformer based multi-scale semantic feature extractor. Then, to resist the wireless noise and reconstruct the image segmentation, a semantic feature decoder and a reconstructor are designed at the receiver. Simulation results show that the proposed ISSC system can reconstruct the image segmentation accurately with a high compression ratio, and can achieve robust transmission performance against channel noise, especially at the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In terms of mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), the ISSC system can achieve an increase by 75%, compared to the baselines using traditional coding method"
TriangleNet: Edge Prior Augmented Network for Semantic Segmentation through Cross-Task Consistency,"Semantic segmentation is a classic computer vision problem dedicated to labeling each pixel with its corresponding category. As a basic task for advanced tasks such as industrial quality inspection, remote sensing information extraction, medical diagnostic aid, and autonomous driving, semantic segmentation has been developed for a long time in combination with deep learning, and a lot of works have been accumulated. However, neither the classic FCN-based works nor the popular Transformer-based works have attained fine-grained localization of pixel labels, which remains the main challenge in this field. Recently, with the popularity of autonomous driving, the segmentation of road scenes has received increasing attention. Based on the cross-task consistency theory, we incorporate edge priors into semantic segmentation tasks to obtain better results. The main contribution is that we provide a model-agnostic method that improves the accuracy of semantic segmentation models with zero extra inference runtime overhead, verified on the datasets of road and non-road scenes. From our experimental results, our method can effectively improve semantic segmentation accuracy."
Semi-supervised Semantic Segmentation with Prototype-based Consistency Regularization,"Semi-supervised semantic segmentation requires the model to effectively propagate the label information from limited annotated images to unlabeled ones. A challenge for such a per-pixel prediction task is the large intra-class variation, i.e., regions belonging to the same class may exhibit a very different appearance even in the same picture. This diversity will make the label propagation hard from pixels to pixels. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach to regularize the distribution of within-class features to ease label propagation difficulty. Specifically, our approach encourages the consistency between the prediction from a linear predictor and the output from a prototype-based predictor, which implicitly encourages features from the same pseudo-class to be close to at least one within-class prototype while staying far from the other between-class prototypes. By further incorporating CutMix operations and a carefully-designed prototype maintenance strategy, we create a semi-supervised semantic segmentation algorithm that demonstrates superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods from extensive experimental evaluation on both Pascal VOC and Cityscapes benchmarks."
Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation with Mask-adapted CLIP,"Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation aims to segment an image into semantic regions according to text descriptions, which may not have been seen during training. Recent two-stage methods first generate class-agnostic mask proposals and then leverage pre-trained vision-language models, e.g., CLIP, to classify masked regions. We identify the performance bottleneck of this paradigm to be the pre-trained CLIP model, since it does not perform well on masked images. To address this, we propose to finetune CLIP on a collection of masked image regions and their corresponding text descriptions. We collect training data by mining an existing image-caption dataset (e.g., COCO Captions), using CLIP to match masked image regions to nouns in the image captions. Compared with the more precise and manually annotated segmentation labels with fixed classes (e.g., COCO-Stuff), we find our noisy but diverse dataset can better retain CLIP's generalization ability. Along with finetuning the entire model, we utilize the ""blank"" areas in masked images using a method we dub mask prompt tuning. Experiments demonstrate mask prompt tuning brings significant improvement without modifying any weights of CLIP, and it can further improve a fully finetuned model. In particular, when trained on COCO and evaluated on ADE20K-150, our best model achieves 29.6% mIoU, which is +8.5% higher than the previous state-of-the-art. For the first time, open-vocabulary generalist models match the performance of supervised specialist models in 2017 without dataset-specific adaptations."
Mask3D: Mask Transformer for 3D Semantic Instance Segmentation,"Modern 3D semantic instance segmentation approaches predominantly rely on specialized voting mechanisms followed by carefully designed geometric clustering techniques. Building on the successes of recent Transformer-based methods for object detection and image segmentation, we propose the first Transformer-based approach for 3D semantic instance segmentation. We show that we can leverage generic Transformer building blocks to directly predict instance masks from 3D point clouds. In our model called Mask3D each object instance is represented as an instance query. Using Transformer decoders, the instance queries are learned by iteratively attending to point cloud features at multiple scales. Combined with point features, the instance queries directly yield all instance masks in parallel. Mask3D has several advantages over current state-of-the-art approaches, since it neither relies on (1) voting schemes which require hand-selected geometric properties (such as centers) nor (2) geometric grouping mechanisms requiring manually-tuned hyper-parameters (e.g. radii) and (3) enables a loss that directly optimizes instance masks. Mask3D sets a new state-of-the-art on ScanNet test (+6.2 mAP), S3DIS 6-fold (+10.1 mAP), STPLS3D (+11.2 mAP) and ScanNet200 test (+12.4 mAP)."
Weak-shot Semantic Segmentation via Dual Similarity Transfer,"Semantic segmentation is an important and prevalent task, but severely suffers from the high cost of pixel-level annotations when extending to more classes in wider applications. To this end, we focus on the problem named weak-shot semantic segmentation, where the novel classes are learnt from cheaper image-level labels with the support of base classes having off-the-shelf pixel-level labels. To tackle this problem, we propose SimFormer, which performs dual similarity transfer upon MaskFormer. Specifically, MaskFormer disentangles the semantic segmentation task into two sub-tasks: proposal classification and proposal segmentation for each proposal. Proposal segmentation allows proposal-pixel similarity transfer from base classes to novel classes, which enables the mask learning of novel classes. We also learn pixel-pixel similarity from base classes and distill such class-agnostic semantic similarity to the semantic masks of novel classes, which regularizes the segmentation model with pixel-level semantic relationship across images. In addition, we propose a complementary loss to facilitate the learning of novel classes. Comprehensive experiments on the challenging COCO-Stuff-10K and ADE20K datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Codes are available at https://github.com/bcmi/SimFormer-Weak-Shot-Semantic-Segmentation."
GMMSeg: Gaussian Mixture based Generative Semantic Segmentation Models,"Prevalent semantic segmentation solutions are, in essence, a dense discriminative classifier of p(class|pixel feature). Though straightforward, this de facto paradigm neglects the underlying data distribution p(pixel feature|class), and struggles to identify out-of-distribution data. Going beyond this, we propose GMMSeg, a new family of segmentation models that rely on a dense generative classifier for the joint distribution p(pixel feature,class). For each class, GMMSeg builds Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) via Expectation-Maximization (EM), so as to capture class-conditional densities. Meanwhile, the deep dense representation is end-to-end trained in a discriminative manner, i.e., maximizing p(class|pixel feature). This endows GMMSeg with the strengths of both generative and discriminative models. With a variety of segmentation architectures and backbones, GMMSeg outperforms the discriminative counterparts on three closed-set datasets. More impressively, without any modification, GMMSeg even performs well on open-world datasets. We believe this work brings fundamental insights into the related fields."
Self-supervised Pre-training for Semantic Segmentation in an Indoor Scene,"The ability to endow maps of indoor scenes with semantic information is an integral part of robotic agents which perform different tasks such as target driven navigation, object search or object rearrangement. The state-of-the-art methods use Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) for predicting semantic segmentation of an image as useful representation for these tasks. The accuracy of semantic segmentation depends on the availability and the amount of labeled data from the target environment or the ability to bridge the domain gap between test and training environment. We propose RegConsist, a method for self-supervised pre-training of a semantic segmentation model, exploiting the ability of the agent to move and register multiple views in the novel environment. Given the spatial and temporal consistency cues used for pixel level data association, we use a variant of contrastive learning to train a DCNN model for predicting semantic segmentation from RGB views in the target environment. The proposed method outperforms models pre-trained on ImageNet and achieves competitive performance when using models that are trained for exactly the same task but on a different dataset. We also perform various ablation studies to analyze and demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method."
FreDSNet: Joint Monocular Depth and Semantic Segmentation with Fast Fourier Convolutions,"In this work we present FreDSNet, a deep learning solution which obtains semantic 3D understanding of indoor environments from single panoramas. Omnidirectional images reveal task-specific advantages when addressing scene understanding problems due to the 360-degree contextual information about the entire environment they provide. However, the inherent characteristics of the omnidirectional images add additional problems to obtain an accurate detection and segmentation of objects or a good depth estimation. To overcome these problems, we exploit convolutions in the frequential domain obtaining a wider receptive field in each convolutional layer. These convolutions allow to leverage the whole context information from omnidirectional images. FreDSNet is the first network that jointly provides monocular depth estimation and semantic segmentation from a single panoramic image exploiting fast Fourier convolutions. Our experiments show that FreDSNet has similar performance as specific state of the art methods for semantic segmentation and depth estimation. FreDSNet code is publicly available in https://github.com/Sbrunoberenguel/FreDSNet"
Cooperative Self-Training for Multi-Target Adaptive Semantic Segmentation,"In this work we address multi-target domain adaptation (MTDA) in semantic segmentation, which consists in adapting a single model from an annotated source dataset to multiple unannotated target datasets that differ in their underlying data distributions. To address MTDA, we propose a self-training strategy that employs pseudo-labels to induce cooperation among multiple domain-specific classifiers. We employ feature stylization as an efficient way to generate image views that forms an integral part of self-training. Additionally, to prevent the network from overfitting to noisy pseudo-labels, we devise a rectification strategy that leverages the predictions from different classifiers to estimate the quality of pseudo-labels. Our extensive experiments on numerous settings, based on four different semantic segmentation datasets, validate the effectiveness of the proposed self-training strategy and show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art MTDA approaches. Code available at: https://github.com/Mael-zys/CoaST"
GaIA: Graphical Information Gain based Attention Network for Weakly Supervised Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation,"While point cloud semantic segmentation is a significant task in 3D scene understanding, this task demands a time-consuming process of fully annotating labels. To address this problem, recent studies adopt a weakly supervised learning approach under the sparse annotation. Different from the existing studies, this study aims to reduce the epistemic uncertainty measured by the entropy for a precise semantic segmentation. We propose the graphical information gain based attention network called GaIA, which alleviates the entropy of each point based on the reliable information. The graphical information gain discriminates the reliable point by employing relative entropy between target point and its neighborhoods. We further introduce anchor-based additive angular margin loss, ArcPoint. The ArcPoint optimizes the unlabeled points containing high entropy towards semantically similar classes of the labeled points on hypersphere space. Experimental results on S3DIS and ScanNet-v2 datasets demonstrate our framework outperforms the existing weakly supervised methods. We have released GaIA at https://github.com/Karel911/GaIA."
ASAP: Accurate semantic segmentation for real time performance,"Feature fusion modules from encoder and self-attention module have been adopted in semantic segmentation. However, the computation of these modules is costly and has operational limitations in real-time environments. In addition, segmentation performance is limited in autonomous driving environments with a lot of contextual information perpendicular to the road surface, such as people, buildings, and general objects. In this paper, we propose an efficient feature fusion method, Feature Fusion with Different Norms (FFDN) that utilizes rich global context of multi-level scale and vertical pooling module before self-attention that preserves most contextual information while reducing the complexity of global context encoding in the vertical direction. By doing this, we could handle the properties of representation in global space and reduce additional computational cost. In addition, we analyze low performance in challenging cases including small and vertically featured objects. We achieve the mean Interaction of-union(mIoU) of 73.1 and the Frame Per Second(FPS) of 191, which are comparable results with state-of-the-arts on Cityscapes test datasets."
Masked Supervised Learning for Semantic Segmentation,"Self-attention is of vital importance in semantic segmentation as it enables modeling of long-range context, which translates into improved performance. We argue that it is equally important to model short-range context, especially to tackle cases where not only the regions of interest are small and ambiguous, but also when there exists an imbalance between the semantic classes. To this end, we propose Masked Supervised Learning (MaskSup), an effective single-stage learning paradigm that models both short- and long-range context, capturing the contextual relationships between pixels via random masking. Experimental results demonstrate the competitive performance of MaskSup against strong baselines in both binary and multi-class segmentation tasks on three standard benchmark datasets, particularly at handling ambiguous regions and retaining better segmentation of minority classes with no added inference cost. In addition to segmenting target regions even when large portions of the input are masked, MaskSup is also generic and can be easily integrated into a variety of semantic segmentation methods. We also show that the proposed method is computationally efficient, yielding an improved performance by 10\% on the mean intersection-over-union (mIoU) while requiring 3\times less learnable parameters."
NAS-based Recursive Stage Partial Network (RSPNet) for Light-Weight Semantic Segmentation,"Current NAS-based semantic segmentation methods focus on accuracy improvements rather than light-weight design. In this paper, we proposed a two-stage framework to design our NAS-based RSPNet model for light-weight semantic segmentation. The first architecture search determines the inner cell structure, and the second architecture search considers exponentially growing paths to finalize the outer structure of the network. It was shown in the literature that the fusion of high- and low-resolution feature maps produces stronger representations. To find the expected macro structure without manual design, we adopt a new path-attention mechanism to efficiently search for suitable paths to fuse useful information for better segmentation. Our search for repeatable micro-structures from cells leads to a superior network architecture in semantic segmentation. In addition, we propose an RSP (recursive Stage Partial) architecture to search a light-weight design for NAS-based semantic segmentation. The proposed architecture is very efficient, simple, and effective that both the macro- and micro- structure searches can be completed in five days of computation on two V100 GPUs. The light-weight NAS architecture with only 1/4 parameter size of SoTA architectures can achieve SoTA performance on semantic segmentation on the Cityscapes dataset without using any backbones."
Contour-Aware Equipotential Learning for Semantic Segmentation,"With increasing demands for high-quality semantic segmentation in the industry, hard-distinguishing semantic boundaries have posed a significant threat to existing solutions. Inspired by real-life experience, i.e., combining varied observations contributes to higher visual recognition confidence, we present the equipotential learning (EPL) method. This novel module transfers the predicted/ground-truth semantic labels to a self-defined potential domain to learn and infer decision boundaries along customized directions. The conversion to the potential domain is implemented via a lightweight differentiable anisotropic convolution without incurring any parameter overhead. Besides, the designed two loss functions, the point loss and the equipotential line loss implement anisotropic field regression and category-level contour learning, respectively, enhancing prediction consistencies in the inter/intra-class boundary areas. More importantly, EPL is agnostic to network architectures, and thus it can be plugged into most existing segmentation models. This paper is the first attempt to address the boundary segmentation problem with field regression and contour learning. Meaningful performance improvements on Pascal Voc 2012 and Cityscapes demonstrate that the proposed EPL module can benefit the off-the-shelf fully convolutional network models when recognizing semantic boundary areas. Besides, intensive comparisons and analysis show the favorable merits of EPL for distinguishing semantically-similar and irregular-shaped categories."
Dual Progressive Transformations for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS), which aims to mine the object regions by merely using class-level labels, is a challenging task in computer vision. The current state-of-the-art CNN-based methods usually adopt Class-Activation-Maps (CAMs) to highlight the potential areas of the object, however, they may suffer from the part-activated issues. To this end, we try an early attempt to explore the global feature attention mechanism of vision transformer in WSSS task. However, since the transformer lacks the inductive bias as in CNN models, it can not boost the performance directly and may yield the over-activated problems. To tackle these drawbacks, we propose a Convolutional Neural Networks Refined Transformer (CRT) to mine a globally complete and locally accurate class activation maps in this paper. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, extensive experiments are conducted on PASCAL VOC 2012 and CUB-200-2011 datasets. Experimental evaluations show that our proposed CRT achieves the new state-of-the-art performance on both the weakly supervised semantic segmentation task the weakly supervised object localization task, which outperform others by a large margin."
Semantic Segmentation of Vegetation in Remote Sensing Imagery Using Deep Learning,"In recent years, the geospatial industry has been developing at a steady pace. This growth implies the addition of satellite constellations that produce a copious supply of satellite imagery and other Remote Sensing data on a daily basis. Sometimes, this information, even if in some cases we are referring to publicly available data, it sits unaccounted for due to the sheer size of it. Processing such large amounts of data with the help of human labour or by using traditional automation methods is not always a viable solution from the standpoint of both time and other resources.  Within the present work, we propose an approach for creating a multi-modal and spatio-temporal dataset comprised of publicly available Remote Sensing data and testing for feasibility using state of the art Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Precisely, the usage of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) models that are capable of separating different classes of vegetation that are present in the proposed dataset. Popularity and success of similar methods in the context of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and Computer Vision (CV) more generally indicate that methods alike should be taken in consideration and further analysed and developed."
PCB-RandNet: Rethinking Random Sampling for LIDAR Semantic Segmentation in Autonomous Driving Scene,"Fast and efficient semantic segmentation of large-scale LiDAR point clouds is a fundamental problem in autonomous driving. To achieve this goal, the existing point-based methods mainly choose to adopt Random Sampling strategy to process large-scale point clouds. However, our quantative and qualitative studies have found that Random Sampling may be less suitable for the autonomous driving scenario, since the LiDAR points follow an uneven or even long-tailed distribution across the space, which prevents the model from capturing sufficient information from points in different distance ranges and reduces the model's learning capability. To alleviate this problem, we propose a new Polar Cylinder Balanced Random Sampling method that enables the downsampled point clouds to maintain a more balanced distribution and improve the segmentation performance under different spatial distributions. In addition, a sampling consistency loss is introduced to further improve the segmentation performance and reduce the model's variance under different sampling methods. Extensive experiments confirm that our approach produces excellent performance on both SemanticKITTI and SemanticPOSS benchmarks, achieving a 2.8% and 4.0% improvement, respectively."
FreeSeg: Free Mask from Interpretable Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining for Semantic Segmentation,"Fully supervised semantic segmentation learns from dense masks, which requires heavy annotation cost for closed set. In this paper, we use natural language as supervision without any pixel-level annotation for open world segmentation. We call the proposed framework as FreeSeg, where the mask is freely available from raw feature map of pretraining model. Compared with zero-shot or openset segmentation, FreeSeg doesn't require any annotated masks, and it widely predicts categories beyond class-agnostic unsupervised segmentation. Specifically, FreeSeg obtains free mask from Image-Text Similarity Map (ITSM) of Interpretable Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (ICLIP). And our core improvements are the smoothed min pooling for dense ICLIP, with the partial label and pixel strategies for segmentation. Furthermore, FreeSeg is very straight forward without complex design like grouping, clustering or retrieval. Besides the simplicity, the performances of FreeSeg surpass previous state-of-the-art at large margins, e.g. 13.4% higher at mIoU on VOC dataset in the same settings."
Self-adversarial Multi-scale Contrastive Learning for Semantic Segmentation of Thermal Facial Images,"Segmentation of thermal facial images is a challenging task. This is because facial features often lack salience due to high-dynamic thermal range scenes and occlusion issues. Limited availability of datasets from unconstrained settings further limits the use of the state-of-the-art segmentation networks, loss functions and learning strategies which have been built and validated for RGB images. To address the challenge, we propose Self-Adversarial Multi-scale Contrastive Learning (SAM-CL) framework as a new training strategy for thermal image segmentation. SAM-CL framework consists of a SAM-CL loss function and a thermal image augmentation (TiAug) module as a domain-specific augmentation technique. We use the Thermal-Face-Database to demonstrate effectiveness of our approach. Experiments conducted on the existing segmentation networks (UNET, Attention-UNET, DeepLabV3 and HRNetv2) evidence the consistent performance gains from the SAM-CL framework. Furthermore, we present a qualitative analysis with UBComfort and DeepBreath datasets to discuss how our proposed methods perform in handling unconstrained situations."
Improving Replay-Based Continual Semantic Segmentation with Smart Data Selection,"Continual learning for Semantic Segmentation (CSS) is a rapidly emerging field, in which the capabilities of the segmentation model are incrementally improved by learning new classes or new domains. A central challenge in Continual Learning is overcoming the effects of catastrophic forgetting, which refers to the sudden drop in accuracy on previously learned tasks after the model is trained on new classes or domains. In continual classification this challenge is often overcome by replaying a small selection of samples from previous tasks, however replay is rarely considered in CSS. Therefore, we investigate the influences of various replay strategies for semantic segmentation and evaluate them in class- and domain-incremental settings. Our findings suggest that in a class-incremental setting, it is critical to achieve a uniform distribution for the different classes in the buffer to avoid a bias towards newly learned classes. In the domain-incremental setting, it is most effective to select buffer samples by uniformly sampling from the distribution of learned feature representations or by choosing samples with median entropy. Finally, we observe that the effective sampling methods help to decrease the representation shift significantly in early layers, which is a major cause of forgetting in domain-incremental learning."
A Causal Intervention Scheme for Semantic Segmentation of Quasi-periodic Cardiovascular Signals,"Precise segmentation is a vital first step to analyze semantic information of cardiac cycle and capture anomaly with cardiovascular signals. However, in the field of deep semantic segmentation, inference is often unilaterally confounded by the individual attribute of data. Towards cardiovascular signals, quasi-periodicity is the essential characteristic to be learned, regarded as the synthesize of the attributes of morphology (Am) and rhythm (Ar). Our key insight is to suppress the over-dependence on Am or Ar while the generation process of deep representations. To address this issue, we establish a structural causal model as the foundation to customize the intervention approaches on Am and Ar, respectively. In this paper, we propose contrastive causal intervention (CCI) to form a novel training paradigm under a frame-level contrastive framework. The intervention can eliminate the implicit statistical bias brought by the single attribute and lead to more objective representations. We conduct comprehensive experiments with the controlled condition for QRS location and heart sound segmentation. The final results indicate that our approach can evidently improve the performance by up to 0.41% for QRS location and 2.73% for heart sound segmentation. The efficiency of the proposed method is generalized to multiple databases and noisy signals."
Semantic Segmentation using Neural Ordinary Differential Equations,"The idea of neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) is to approximate the derivative of a function (data model) instead of the function itself. In residual networks, instead of having a discrete sequence of hidden layers, the derivative of the continuous dynamics of hidden state can be parameterized by an ODE. It has been shown that this type of neural network is able to produce the same results as an equivalent residual network for image classification. In this paper, we design a novel neural ODE for the semantic segmentation task. We start by a baseline network that consists of residual modules, then we use the modules to build our neural ODE network. We show that our neural ODE is able to achieve the state-of-the-art results using 57% less memory for training, 42% less memory for testing, and 68% less number of parameters. We evaluate our model on the Cityscapes, CamVid, LIP, and PASCAL-Context datasets."
CNN based Intelligent Streetlight Management Using Smart CCTV Camera and Semantic Segmentation,"One of the most neglected sources of energy loss is streetlights which generate too much light in areas where it is not required. Energy waste has enormous economic and environmental effects. In addition, due to the conventional manual nature of the operation, streetlights are frequently seen being turned ON during the day and OFF in the evening, which is regrettable even in the twenty-first century. These issues require automated streetlight control in order to be resolved. This study aims to develop a novel streetlight controlling method by combining a smart transport monitoring system powered by computer vision technology with a closed circuit television (CCTV) camera that allows the light-emitting diode (LED) streetlight to automatically light up with the appropriate brightness by detecting the presence of pedestrians or vehicles and dimming the streetlight in their absence using semantic image segmentation from the CCTV video streaming. Consequently, our model distinguishes daylight and nighttime, which made it feasible to automate the process of turning the streetlight 'ON' and 'OFF' to save energy consumption costs. According to the aforementioned approach, geolocation sensor data could be utilized to make more informed streetlight management decisions. To complete the tasks, we consider training the U-net model with ResNet-34 as its backbone. The validity of the models is guaranteed with the use of assessment matrices. The suggested concept is straightforward, economical, energy-efficient, long-lasting, and more resilient than conventional alternatives."
SegNeXt: Rethinking Convolutional Attention Design for Semantic Segmentation,"We present SegNeXt, a simple convolutional network architecture for semantic segmentation. Recent transformer-based models have dominated the field of semantic segmentation due to the efficiency of self-attention in encoding spatial information. In this paper, we show that convolutional attention is a more efficient and effective way to encode contextual information than the self-attention mechanism in transformers. By re-examining the characteristics owned by successful segmentation models, we discover several key components leading to the performance improvement of segmentation models. This motivates us to design a novel convolutional attention network that uses cheap convolutional operations. Without bells and whistles, our SegNeXt significantly improves the performance of previous state-of-the-art methods on popular benchmarks, including ADE20K, Cityscapes, COCO-Stuff, Pascal VOC, Pascal Context, and iSAID. Notably, SegNeXt outperforms EfficientNet-L2 w/ NAS-FPN and achieves 90.6% mIoU on the Pascal VOC 2012 test leaderboard using only 1/10 parameters of it. On average, SegNeXt achieves about 2.0% mIoU improvements compared to the state-of-the-art methods on the ADE20K datasets with the same or fewer computations. Code is available at https://github.com/uyzhang/JSeg (Jittor) and https://github.com/Visual-Attention-Network/SegNeXt (Pytorch)."
Continual Learning for Class- and Domain-Incremental Semantic Segmentation,"The field of continual deep learning is an emerging field and a lot of progress has been made. However, concurrently most of the approaches are only tested on the task of image classification, which is not relevant in the field of intelligent vehicles. Only recently approaches for class-incremental semantic segmentation were proposed. However, all of those approaches are based on some form of knowledge distillation. At the moment there are no investigations on replay-based approaches that are commonly used for object recognition in a continual setting. At the same time while unsupervised domain adaption for semantic segmentation gained a lot of traction, investigations regarding domain-incremental learning in an continual setting is not well-studied. Therefore, the goal of our work is to evaluate and adapt established solutions for continual object recognition to the task of semantic segmentation and to provide baseline methods and evaluation protocols for the task of continual semantic segmentation. We firstly introduce evaluation protocols for the class- and domain-incremental segmentation and analyze selected approaches. We show that the nature of the task of semantic segmentation changes which methods are most effective in mitigating forgetting compared to image classification. Especially, in class-incremental learning knowledge distillation proves to be a vital tool, whereas in domain-incremental learning replay methods are the most effective method."
Causes of Catastrophic Forgetting in Class-Incremental Semantic Segmentation,"Class-incremental learning for semantic segmentation (CiSS) is presently a highly researched field which aims at updating a semantic segmentation model by sequentially learning new semantic classes. A major challenge in CiSS is overcoming the effects of catastrophic forgetting, which describes the sudden drop of accuracy on previously learned classes after the model is trained on a new set of classes. Despite latest advances in mitigating catastrophic forgetting, the underlying causes of forgetting specifically in CiSS are not well understood. Therefore, in a set of experiments and representational analyses, we demonstrate that the semantic shift of the background class and a bias towards new classes are the major causes of forgetting in CiSS. Furthermore, we show that both causes mostly manifest themselves in deeper classification layers of the network, while the early layers of the model are not affected. Finally, we demonstrate how both causes are effectively mitigated utilizing the information contained in the background, with the help of knowledge distillation and an unbiased cross-entropy loss."
Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation via Progressive Patch Learning,"Most of the existing semantic segmentation approaches with image-level class labels as supervision, highly rely on the initial class activation map (CAM) generated from the standard classification network. In this paper, a novel ""Progressive Patch Learning"" approach is proposed to improve the local details extraction of the classification, producing the CAM better covering the whole object rather than only the most discriminative regions as in CAMs obtained in conventional classification models. ""Patch Learning"" destructs the feature maps into patches and independently processes each local patch in parallel before the final aggregation. Such a mechanism enforces the network to find weak information from the scattered discriminative local parts, achieving enhanced local details sensitivity. ""Progressive Patch Learning"" further extends the feature destruction and patch learning to multi-level granularities in a progressive manner. Cooperating with a multi-stage optimization strategy, such a ""Progressive Patch Learning"" mechanism implicitly provides the model with the feature extraction ability across different locality-granularities. As an alternative to the implicit multi-granularity progressive fusion approach, we additionally propose an explicit method to simultaneously fuse features from different granularities in a single model, further enhancing the CAM quality on the full object coverage. Our proposed method achieves outstanding performance on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset e.g., with 69.6$% mIoU on the test set), which surpasses most existing weakly supervised semantic segmentation methods. Code will be made publicly available here https://github.com/TyroneLi/PPL_WSSS."
Image Understands Point Cloud: Weakly Supervised 3D Semantic Segmentation via Association Learning,"Weakly supervised point cloud semantic segmentation methods that require 1\% or fewer labels, hoping to realize almost the same performance as fully supervised approaches, which recently, have attracted extensive research attention. A typical solution in this framework is to use self-training or pseudo labeling to mine the supervision from the point cloud itself, but ignore the critical information from images. In fact, cameras widely exist in LiDAR scenarios and this complementary information seems to be greatly important for 3D applications. In this paper, we propose a novel cross-modality weakly supervised method for 3D segmentation, incorporating complementary information from unlabeled images. Basically, we design a dual-branch network equipped with an active labeling strategy, to maximize the power of tiny parts of labels and directly realize 2D-to-3D knowledge transfer. Afterwards, we establish a cross-modal self-training framework in an Expectation-Maximum (EM) perspective, which iterates between pseudo labels estimation and parameters updating. In the M-Step, we propose a cross-modal association learning to mine complementary supervision from images by reinforcing the cycle-consistency between 3D points and 2D superpixels. In the E-step, a pseudo label self-rectification mechanism is derived to filter noise labels thus providing more accurate labels for the networks to get fully trained. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method even outperforms the state-of-the-art fully supervised competitors with less than 1\% actively selected annotations."
Expansion and Shrinkage of Localization for Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Generating precise class-aware pseudo ground-truths, a.k.a, class activation maps (CAMs), is essential for weakly-supervised semantic segmentation. The original CAM method usually produces incomplete and inaccurate localization maps. To tackle with this issue, this paper proposes an Expansion and Shrinkage scheme based on the offset learning in the deformable convolution, to sequentially improve the recall and precision of the located object in the two respective stages. In the Expansion stage, an offset learning branch in a deformable convolution layer, referred as ""expansion sampler"" seeks for sampling increasingly less discriminative object regions, driven by an inverse supervision signal that maximizes image-level classification loss. The located more complete object in the Expansion stage is then gradually narrowed down to the final object region during the Shrinkage stage. In the Shrinkage stage, the offset learning branch of another deformable convolution layer, referred as ""shrinkage sampler"", is introduced to exclude the false positive background regions attended in the Expansion stage to improve the precision of the localization maps. We conduct various experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 to well demonstrate the superiority of our method over other state-of-the-art methods for weakly-supervised semantic segmentation. Code will be made publicly available here https://github.com/TyroneLi/ESOL_WSSS."
Deliberated Domain Bridging for Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation,"In unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), directly adapting from the source to the target domain usually suffers significant discrepancies and leads to insufficient alignment. Thus, many UDA works attempt to vanish the domain gap gradually and softly via various intermediate spaces, dubbed domain bridging (DB). However, for dense prediction tasks such as domain adaptive semantic segmentation (DASS), existing solutions have mostly relied on rough style transfer and how to elegantly bridge domains is still under-explored. In this work, we resort to data mixing to establish a deliberated domain bridging (DDB) for DASS, through which the joint distributions of source and target domains are aligned and interacted with each in the intermediate space. At the heart of DDB lies a dual-path domain bridging step for generating two intermediate domains using the coarse-wise and the fine-wise data mixing techniques, alongside a cross-path knowledge distillation step for taking two complementary models trained on generated intermediate samples as 'teachers' to develop a superior 'student' in a multi-teacher distillation manner. These two optimization steps work in an alternating way and reinforce each other to give rise to DDB with strong adaptation power. Extensive experiments on adaptive segmentation tasks with different settings demonstrate that our DDB significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at https://github.com/xiaoachen98/DDB.git."
Active Self-Training for Weakly Supervised 3D Scene Semantic Segmentation,"Since the preparation of labeled data for training semantic segmentation networks of point clouds is a time-consuming process, weakly supervised approaches have been introduced to learn from only a small fraction of data. These methods are typically based on learning with contrastive losses while automatically deriving per-point pseudo-labels from a sparse set of user-annotated labels. In this paper, our key observation is that the selection of what samples to annotate is as important as how these samples are used for training. Thus, we introduce a method for weakly supervised segmentation of 3D scenes that combines self-training with active learning. The active learning selects points for annotation that likely result in performance improvements to the trained model, while the self-training makes efficient use of the user-provided labels for learning the model. We demonstrate that our approach leads to an effective method that provides improvements in scene segmentation over previous works and baselines, while requiring only a small number of user annotations."
Learning from Future: A Novel Self-Training Framework for Semantic Segmentation,"Self-training has shown great potential in semi-supervised learning. Its core idea is to use the model learned on labeled data to generate pseudo-labels for unlabeled samples, and in turn teach itself. To obtain valid supervision, active attempts typically employ a momentum teacher for pseudo-label prediction yet observe the confirmation bias issue, where the incorrect predictions may provide wrong supervision signals and get accumulated in the training process. The primary cause of such a drawback is that the prevailing self-training framework acts as guiding the current state with previous knowledge, because the teacher is updated with the past student only. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel self-training strategy, which allows the model to learn from the future. Concretely, at each training step, we first virtually optimize the student (i.e., caching the gradients without applying them to the model weights), then update the teacher with the virtual future student, and finally ask the teacher to produce pseudo-labels for the current student as the guidance. In this way, we manage to improve the quality of pseudo-labels and thus boost the performance. We also develop two variants of our future-self-training (FST) framework through peeping at the future both deeply (FST-D) and widely (FST-W). Taking the tasks of unsupervised domain adaptive semantic segmentation and semi-supervised semantic segmentation as the instances, we experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach under a wide range of settings. Code will be made publicly available."
Certified Defences Against Adversarial Patch Attacks on Semantic Segmentation,"Adversarial patch attacks are an emerging security threat for real world deep learning applications. We present Demasked Smoothing, the first approach (up to our knowledge) to certify the robustness of semantic segmentation models against this threat model. Previous work on certifiably defending against patch attacks has mostly focused on image classification task and often required changes in the model architecture and additional training which is undesirable and computationally expensive. In Demasked Smoothing, any segmentation model can be applied without particular training, fine-tuning, or restriction of the architecture. Using different masking strategies, Demasked Smoothing can be applied both for certified detection and certified recovery. In extensive experiments we show that Demasked Smoothing can on average certify 64% of the pixel predictions for a 1% patch in the detection task and 48% against a 0.5% patch for the recovery task on the ADE20K dataset."
MCIBI++: Soft Mining Contextual Information Beyond Image for Semantic Segmentation,"Co-occurrent visual pattern makes context aggregation become an essential paradigm for semantic segmentation.The existing studies focus on modeling the contexts within image while neglecting the valuable semantics of the corresponding category beyond image. To this end, we propose a novel soft mining contextual information beyond image paradigm named MCIBI++ to further boost the pixel-level representations. Specifically, we first set up a dynamically updated memory module to store the dataset-level distribution information of various categories and then leverage the information to yield the dataset-level category representations during network forward. After that, we generate a class probability distribution for each pixel representation and conduct the dataset-level context aggregation with the class probability distribution as weights. Finally, the original pixel representations are augmented with the aggregated dataset-level and the conventional image-level contextual information. Moreover, in the inference phase, we additionally design a coarse-to-fine iterative inference strategy to further boost the segmentation results. MCIBI++ can be effortlessly incorporated into the existing segmentation frameworks and bring consistent performance improvements. Also, MCIBI++ can be extended into the video semantic segmentation framework with considerable improvements over the baseline. Equipped with MCIBI++, we achieved the state-of-the-art performance on seven challenging image or video semantic segmentation benchmarks."
Boundary Guided Semantic Learning for Real-time COVID-19 Lung Infection Segmentation System,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to have a negative impact on healthcare systems around the world, though the vaccines have been developed and national vaccination coverage rate is steadily increasing. At the current stage, automatically segmenting the lung infection area from CT images is essential for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19. Thanks to the development of deep learning technology, some deep learning solutions for lung infection segmentation have been proposed. However, due to the scattered distribution, complex background interference and blurred boundaries, the accuracy and completeness of the existing models are still unsatisfactory. To this end, we propose a boundary guided semantic learning network (BSNet) in this paper. On the one hand, the dual-branch semantic enhancement module that combines the top-level semantic preservation and progressive semantic integration is designed to model the complementary relationship between different high-level features, thereby promoting the generation of more complete segmentation results. On the other hand, the mirror-symmetric boundary guidance module is proposed to accurately detect the boundaries of the lesion regions in a mirror-symmetric way. Experiments on the publicly available dataset demonstrate that our BSNet outperforms the existing state-of-the-art competitors and achieves a real-time inference speed of 44 FPS."
Transformer-CNN Cohort: Semi-supervised Semantic Segmentation by the Best of Both Students,"The popular methods for semi-supervised semantic segmentation mostly adopt a unitary network model using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and enforce consistency of the model predictions over small perturbations applied to the inputs or model. However, such a learning paradigm suffers from a) limited learning capability of the CNN-based model; b) limited capacity of learning the discriminative features for the unlabeled data; c) limited learning for both global and local information from the whole image. In this paper, we propose a novel Semi-supervised Learning approach, called Transformer-CNN Cohort (TCC), that consists of two students with one based on the vision transformer (ViT) and the other based on the CNN. Our method subtly incorporates the multi-level consistency regularization on the predictions and the heterogeneous feature spaces via pseudo labeling for the unlabeled data. First, as the inputs of the ViT student are image patches, the feature maps extracted encode crucial class-wise statistics. To this end, we propose class-aware feature consistency distillation (CFCD) that first leverages the outputs of each student as the pseudo labels and generates class-aware feature (CF) maps. It then transfers knowledge via the CF maps between the students. Second, as the ViT student has more uniform representations for all layers, we propose consistency-aware cross distillation to transfer knowledge between the pixel-wise predictions from the cohort. We validate the TCC framework on Cityscapes and Pascal VOC 2012 datasets, which significantly outperforms existing semi-supervised methods by a large margin."
Semantic Segmentation in Learned Compressed Domain,"Most machine vision tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation) are based on images encoded and decoded by image compression algorithms (e.g., JPEG). However, these decoded images in the pixel domain introduce distortion, and they are optimized for human perception, making the performance of machine vision tasks suboptimal. In this paper, we propose a method based on the compressed domain to improve segmentation tasks. i) A dynamic and a static channel selection method are proposed to reduce the redundancy of compressed representations that are obtained by encoding. ii) Two different transform modules are explored and analyzed to help the compressed representation be transformed as the features in the segmentation network. The experimental results show that we can save up to 15.8\% bitrates compared with a state-of-the-art compressed domain-based work while saving up to about 83.6\% bitrates and 44.8\% inference time compared with the pixel domain-based method."
Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation with Cross Teacher Training,"Convolutional neural networks can achieve remarkable performance in semantic segmentation tasks. However, such neural network approaches heavily rely on costly pixel-level annotation. Semi-supervised learning is a promising resolution to tackle this issue, but its performance still far falls behind the fully supervised counterpart. This work proposes a cross-teacher training framework with three modules that significantly improves traditional semi-supervised learning approaches. The core is a cross-teacher module, which could simultaneously reduce the coupling among peer networks and the error accumulation between teacher and student networks. In addition, we propose two complementary contrastive learning modules. The high-level module can transfer high-quality knowledge from labeled data to unlabeled ones and promote separation between classes in feature space. The low-level module can encourage low-quality features learning from the high-quality features among peer networks. In experiments, the cross-teacher module significantly improves the performance of traditional student-teacher approaches, and our framework outperforms stateof-the-art methods on benchmark datasets. Our source code of CTT will be released."
Distilling Facial Knowledge With Teacher-Tasks: Semantic-Segmentation-Features For Pose-Invariant Face-Recognition,"This paper demonstrates a novel approach to improve face-recognition pose-invariance using semantic-segmentation features. The proposed Seg-Distilled-ID network jointly learns identification and semantic-segmentation tasks, where the segmentation task is then ""distilled"" (MobileNet encoder). Performance is benchmarked against three state-of-the-art encoders on a publicly available data-set emphasizing head-pose variations. Experimental evaluations show the Seg-Distilled-ID network shows notable robustness benefits, achieving 99.9% test-accuracy in comparison to 81.6% on ResNet-101, 96.1% on VGG-19 and 96.3% on InceptionV3. This is achieved using approximately one-tenth of the top encoder's inference parameters. These results demonstrate distilling semantic-segmentation features can efficiently address face-recognition pose-invariance."
SemSegDepth: A Combined Model for Semantic Segmentation and Depth Completion,"Holistic scene understanding is pivotal for the performance of autonomous machines. In this paper we propose a new end-to-end model for performing semantic segmentation and depth completion jointly. The vast majority of recent approaches have developed semantic segmentation and depth completion as independent tasks. Our approach relies on RGB and sparse depth as inputs to our model and produces a dense depth map and the corresponding semantic segmentation image. It consists of a feature extractor, a depth completion branch, a semantic segmentation branch and a joint branch which further processes semantic and depth information altogether. The experiments done on Virtual KITTI 2 dataset, demonstrate and provide further evidence, that combining both tasks, semantic segmentation and depth completion, in a multi-task network can effectively improve the performance of each task. Code is available at https://github.com/juanb09111/semantic depth."
CLUDA : Contrastive Learning in Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation,"In this work, we propose CLUDA, a simple, yet novel method for performing unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for semantic segmentation by incorporating contrastive losses into a student-teacher learning paradigm, that makes use of pseudo-labels generated from the target domain by the teacher network. More specifically, we extract a multi-level fused-feature map from the encoder, and apply contrastive loss across different classes and different domains, via source-target mixing of images. We consistently improve performance on various feature encoder architectures and for different domain adaptation datasets in semantic segmentation. Furthermore, we introduce a learned-weighted contrastive loss to improve upon on a state-of-the-art multi-resolution training approach in UDA. We produce state-of-the-art results on GTA \rightarrow Cityscapes (74.4 mIOU, +0.6) and Synthia \rightarrow Cityscapes (67.2 mIOU, +1.4) datasets. CLUDA effectively demonstrates contrastive learning in UDA as a generic method, which can be easily integrated into any existing UDA for semantic segmentation tasks. Please refer to the supplementary material for the details on implementation."
FAKD: Feature Augmented Knowledge Distillation for Semantic Segmentation,"In this work, we explore data augmentations for knowledge distillation on semantic segmentation. To avoid over-fitting to the noise in the teacher network, a large number of training examples is essential for knowledge distillation. Imagelevel argumentation techniques like flipping, translation or rotation are widely used in previous knowledge distillation framework. Inspired by the recent progress on semantic directions on feature-space, we propose to include augmentations in feature space for efficient distillation. Specifically, given a semantic direction, an infinite number of augmentations can be obtained for the student in the feature space. Furthermore, the analysis shows that those augmentations can be optimized simultaneously by minimizing an upper bound for the losses defined by augmentations. Based on the observation, a new algorithm is developed for knowledge distillation in semantic segmentation. Extensive experiments on four semantic segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method can boost the performance of current knowledge distillation methods without any significant overhead. Code is available at: https://github.com/jianlong-yuan/FAKD."
An Access Control Method with Secret Key for Semantic Segmentation Models,"A novel method for access control with a secret key is proposed to protect models from unauthorized access in this paper. We focus on semantic segmentation models with the vision transformer (ViT), called segmentation transformer (SETR). Most existing access control methods focus on image classification tasks, or they are limited to CNNs. By using a patch embedding structure that ViT has, trained models and test images can be efficiently encrypted with a secret key, and then semantic segmentation tasks are carried out in the encrypted domain. In an experiment, the method is confirmed to provide the same accuracy as that of using plain images without any encryption to authorized users with a correct key and also to provide an extremely degraded accuracy to unauthorized users."
Autonomous social robot navigation in unknown urban environments using semantic segmentation,"For autonomous robots navigating in urban environments, it is important for the robot to stay on the designated path of travel (i.e., the footpath), and avoid areas such as grass and garden beds, for safety and social conformity considerations. This paper presents an autonomous navigation approach for unknown urban environments that combines the use of semantic segmentation and LiDAR data. The proposed approach uses the segmented image mask to create a 3D obstacle map of the environment, from which, the boundaries of the footpath is computed. Compared to existing methods, our approach does not require a pre-built map and provides a 3D understanding of the safe region of travel, enabling the robot to plan any path through the footpath. Experiments comparing our method with two alternatives using only LiDAR or only semantic segmentation show that overall our proposed approach performs significantly better with greater than 91% success rate outdoors, and greater than 66% indoors. Our method enabled the robot to remain on the safe path of travel at all times, and reduced the number of collisions."
Semi-supervised Semantic Segmentation with Mutual Knowledge Distillation,"Consistency regularization has been widely studied in recent semi-supervised semantic segmentation methods. Remarkable performance has been achieved, benefiting from image, feature, and network perturbations. To make full use of these perturbations, in this work, we propose a new consistency regularization framework called mutual knowledge distillation (MKD). We innovatively introduce two auxiliary mean-teacher models based on the consistency regularization method. More specifically, we use the pseudo label generated by one mean teacher to supervise the other student network to achieve a mutual knowledge distillation between two branches. In addition to using image-level strong and weak augmentation, we also employ feature augmentation considering implicit semantic distributions to add further perturbations to the students. The proposed framework significantly increases the diversity of the training samples. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks show that our framework outperforms previous state-of-the-art(SOTA) methods under various semi-supervised settings. Code is available at: https://github.com/jianlong-yuan/semi-mmseg."
Semi-Automatic Labeling and Semantic Segmentation of Gram-Stained Microscopic Images from DIBaS Dataset,"In this paper, a semi-automatic annotation of bacteria genera and species from DIBaS dataset is implemented using clustering and thresholding algorithms. A Deep learning model is trained to achieve the semantic segmentation and classification of the bacteria species. Classification accuracy of 95% is achieved. Deep learning models find tremendous applications in biomedical image processing. Automatic segmentation of bacteria from gram-stained microscopic images is essential to diagnose respiratory and urinary tract infections, detect cancers, etc. Deep learning will aid the biologists to get reliable results in less time. Additionally, a lot of human intervention can be reduced. This work can be helpful to detect bacteria from urinary smear images, sputum smear images, etc to diagnose urinary tract infections, tuberculosis, pneumonia, etc."
Threshold-adaptive Unsupervised Focal Loss for Domain Adaptation of Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation is an important task for intelligent vehicles to understand the environment. Current deep learning methods require large amounts of labeled data for training. Manual annotation is expensive, while simulators can provide accurate annotations. However, the performance of the semantic segmentation model trained with the data of the simulator will significantly decrease when applied in the actual scene. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for semantic segmentation has recently gained increasing research attention, aiming to reduce the domain gap and improve the performance on the target domain. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage entropy-based UDA method for semantic segmentation. In stage one, we design a threshold-adaptative unsupervised focal loss to regularize the prediction in the target domain, which has a mild gradient neutralization mechanism and mitigates the problem that hard samples are barely optimized in entropy-based methods. In stage two, we introduce a data augmentation method named cross-domain image mixing (CIM) to bridge the semantic knowledge from two domains. Our method achieves state-of-the-art 58.4% and 59.6% mIoUs on SYNTHIA-to-Cityscapes and GTA5-to-Cityscapes using DeepLabV2 and competitive performance using the lightweight BiSeNet."
Multi-Granularity Distillation Scheme Towards Lightweight Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Albeit with varying degrees of progress in the field of Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation, most of its recent successes are involved in unwieldy models and the lightweight solution is still not yet explored. We find that existing knowledge distillation techniques pay more attention to pixel-level concepts from labeled data, which fails to take more informative cues within unlabeled data into account. Consequently, we offer the first attempt to provide lightweight SSSS models via a novel multi-granularity distillation (MGD) scheme, where multi-granularity is captured from three aspects: i) complementary teacher structure; ii) labeled-unlabeled data cooperative distillation; iii) hierarchical and multi-levels loss setting. Specifically, MGD is formulated as a labeled-unlabeled data cooperative distillation scheme, which helps to take full advantage of diverse data characteristics that are essential in the semi-supervised setting. Image-level semantic-sensitive loss, region-level content-aware loss, and pixel-level consistency loss are set up to enrich hierarchical distillation abstraction via structurally complementary teachers. Experimental results on PASCAL VOC2012 and Cityscapes reveal that MGD can outperform the competitive approaches by a large margin under diverse partition protocols. For example, the performance of ResNet-18 and MobileNet-v2 backbone is boosted by 11.5% and 4.6% respectively under 1/16 partition protocol on Cityscapes. Although the FLOPs of the model backbone is compressed by 3.4-5.3x (ResNet-18) and 38.7-59.6x (MobileNetv2), the model manages to achieve satisfactory segmentation results."
Prompt-Matched Semantic Segmentation,"The objective of this work is to explore how to effectively and efficiently adapt pre-trained visual foundation models to various downstream tasks of semantic segmentation. Previous methods usually fine-tuned the entire networks for each specific dataset, which will be burdensome to store massive parameters of these networks. A few recent works attempted to insert some extra trainable parameters into the frozen networks to learn visual prompts for parameter-efficient tuning. However, these works showed poor generality as they were designed specifically for Transformers. Moreover, using limited information in these schemes, they exhibited a poor capacity to learn beneficial prompts. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel Stage-wise Prompt-Matched Framework for generic and effective visual prompt tuning. Specifically, to ensure generality, we divide the pre-trained backbone with frozen parameters into multiple stages and perform prompt learning between different stages, which makes the proposed scheme applicable to various architectures of CNN and Transformer. For effective tuning, a lightweight Semantic-aware Prompt Matcher (SPM) is designed to progressively learn reasonable prompts with a recurrent mechanism, guided by the rich information of interim semantic maps. Working as deep matched filter of representation learning, the proposed SPM can well transform the output of the previous stage into a desirable input for the next stage, thus achieving the better matching/stimulating for the pre-trained knowledge. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed scheme can achieve a promising trade-off between parameter efficiency and performance effectiveness. Our code and models will be released."
Revisiting Weak-to-Strong Consistency in Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"In this work, we revisit the weak-to-strong consistency framework, popularized by FixMatch from semi-supervised classification, where the prediction of a weakly perturbed image serves as supervision for its strongly perturbed version. Intriguingly, we observe that such a simple pipeline already achieves competitive results against recent advanced works, when transferred to our segmentation scenario. Its success heavily relies on the manual design of strong data augmentations, however, which may be limited and inadequate to explore a broader perturbation space. Motivated by this, we propose an auxiliary feature perturbation stream as a supplement, leading to an expanded perturbation space. On the other, to sufficiently probe original image-level augmentations, we present a dual-stream perturbation technique, enabling two strong views to be simultaneously guided by a common weak view. Consequently, our overall Unified Dual-Stream Perturbations approach (UniMatch) surpasses all existing methods significantly across all evaluation protocols on the Pascal, Cityscapes, and COCO benchmarks. Its superiority is also demonstrated in remote sensing interpretation and medical image analysis. We hope our reproduced FixMatch and our results can inspire more future works. Code and logs are available at https://github.com/LiheYoung/UniMatch."
Depth-Assisted ResiDualGAN for Cross-Domain Aerial Images Semantic Segmentation,"Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) is an approach to minimizing domain gap. Generative methods are common approaches to minimizing the domain gap of aerial images which improves the performance of the downstream tasks, e.g., cross-domain semantic segmentation. For aerial images, the digital surface model (DSM) is usually available in both the source domain and the target domain. Depth information in DSM brings external information to generative models. However, little research utilizes it. In this paper, depth-assisted ResiDualGAN (DRDG) is proposed where depth supervised loss (DSL), and depth cycle consistency loss (DCCL) are used to bring depth information into the generative model. Experimental results show that DRDG reaches state-of-the-art accuracy between generative methods in cross-domain semantic segmentation tasks."
Multi-View Correlation Consistency for Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Semi-supervised semantic segmentation needs rich and robust supervision on unlabeled data. Consistency learning enforces the same pixel to have similar features in different augmented views, which is a robust signal but neglects relationships with other pixels. In comparison, contrastive learning considers rich pairwise relationships, but it can be a conundrum to assign binary positive-negative supervision signals for pixel pairs. In this paper, we take the best of both worlds and propose multi-view correlation consistency (MVCC) learning: it considers rich pairwise relationships in self-correlation matrices and matches them across views to provide robust supervision. Together with this correlation consistency loss, we propose a view-coherent data augmentation strategy that guarantees pixel-pixel correspondence between different views. In a series of semi-supervised settings on two datasets, we report competitive accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Notably, on Cityscapes, we achieve 76.8% mIoU with 1/8 labeled data, just 0.6% shy from the fully supervised oracle."
Unsupervised domain adaptation semantic segmentation of high-resolution remote sensing imagery with invariant domain-level prototype memory,"Semantic segmentation is a key technique involved in automatic interpretation of high-resolution remote sensing (HRS) imagery and has drawn much attention in the remote sensing community. Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have been successfully applied to the HRS imagery semantic segmentation task due to their hierarchical representation ability. However, the heavy dependency on a large number of training data with dense annotation and the sensitiveness to the variation of data distribution severely restrict the potential application of DCNNs for the semantic segmentation of HRS imagery. This study proposes a novel unsupervised domain adaptation semantic segmentation network (MemoryAdaptNet) for the semantic segmentation of HRS imagery. MemoryAdaptNet constructs an output space adversarial learning scheme to bridge the domain distribution discrepancy between source domain and target domain and to narrow the influence of domain shift. Specifically, we embed an invariant feature memory module to store invariant domain-level context information because the features obtained from adversarial learning only tend to represent the variant feature of current limited inputs. This module is integrated by a category attention-driven invariant domain-level context aggregation module to current pseudo invariant feature for further augmenting the pixel representations. An entropy-based pseudo label filtering strategy is used to update the memory module with high-confident pseudo invariant feature of current target images. Extensive experiments under three cross-domain tasks indicate that our proposed MemoryAdaptNet is remarkably superior to the state-of-the-art methods."
Surrogate-assisted Multi-objective Neural Architecture Search for Real-time Semantic Segmentation,"The architectural advancements in deep neural networks have led to remarkable leap-forwards across a broad array of computer vision tasks. Instead of relying on human expertise, neural architecture search (NAS) has emerged as a promising avenue toward automating the design of architectures. While recent achievements in image classification have suggested opportunities, the promises of NAS have yet to be thoroughly assessed on more challenging tasks of semantic segmentation. The main challenges of applying NAS to semantic segmentation arise from two aspects: (i) high-resolution images to be processed; (ii) additional requirement of real-time inference speed (i.e., real-time semantic segmentation) for applications such as autonomous driving. To meet such challenges, we propose a surrogate-assisted multi-objective method in this paper. Through a series of customized prediction models, our method effectively transforms the original NAS task into an ordinary multi-objective optimization problem. Followed by a hierarchical pre-screening criterion for in-fill selection, our method progressively achieves a set of efficient architectures trading-off between segmentation accuracy and inference speed. Empirical evaluations on three benchmark datasets together with an application using Huawei Atlas 200 DK suggest that our method can identify architectures significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art architectures designed both manually by human experts and automatically by other NAS methods."
Bidirectional Feature Globalization for Few-shot Semantic Segmentation of 3D Point Cloud Scenes,"Few-shot segmentation of point cloud remains a challenging task, as there is no effective way to convert local point cloud information to global representation, which hinders the generalization ability of point features. In this study, we propose a bidirectional feature globalization (BFG) approach, which leverages the similarity measurement between point features and prototype vectors to embed global perception to local point features in a bidirectional fashion. With point-to-prototype globalization (Po2PrG), BFG aggregates local point features to prototypes according to similarity weights from dense point features to sparse prototypes. With prototype-to-point globalization (Pr2PoG), the global perception is embedded to local point features based on similarity weights from sparse prototypes to dense point features. The sparse prototypes of each class embedded with global perception are summarized to a single prototype for few-shot 3D segmentation based on the metric learning framework. Extensive experiments on S3DIS and ScanNet demonstrate that BFG significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods."
Continual Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation using a Class-Specific Transfer,"In recent years, there has been tremendous progress in the field of semantic segmentation. However, one remaining challenging problem is that segmentation models do not generalize to unseen domains. To overcome this problem, one either has to label lots of data covering the whole variety of domains, which is often infeasible in practice, or apply unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), only requiring labeled source data. In this work, we focus on UDA and additionally address the case of adapting not only to a single domain, but to a sequence of target domains. This requires mechanisms preventing the model from forgetting its previously learned knowledge. To adapt a segmentation model to a target domain, we follow the idea of utilizing light-weight style transfer to convert the style of labeled source images into the style of the target domain, while retaining the source content. To mitigate the distributional shift between the source and the target domain, the model is fine-tuned on the transferred source images in a second step. Existing light-weight style transfer approaches relying on adaptive instance normalization (AdaIN) or Fourier transformation still lack performance and do not substantially improve upon common data augmentation, such as color jittering. The reason for this is that these methods do not focus on region- or class-specific differences, but mainly capture the most salient style. Therefore, we propose a simple and light-weight framework that incorporates two class-conditional AdaIN layers. To extract the class-specific target moments needed for the transfer layers, we use unfiltered pseudo-labels, which we show to be an effective approximation compared to real labels. We extensively validate our approach (CACE) on a synthetic sequence and further propose a challenging sequence consisting of real domains. CACE outperforms existing methods visually and quantitatively."
When CNN Meet with ViT: Towards Semi-Supervised Learning for Multi-Class Medical Image Semantic Segmentation,"Due to the lack of quality annotation in medical imaging community, semi-supervised learning methods are highly valued in image semantic segmentation tasks. In this paper, an advanced consistency-aware pseudo-label-based self-ensembling approach is presented to fully utilize the power of Vision Transformer(ViT) and Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) in semi-supervised learning. Our proposed framework consists of a feature-learning module which is enhanced by ViT and CNN mutually, and a guidance module which is robust for consistency-aware purposes. The pseudo labels are inferred and utilized recurrently and separately by views of CNN and ViT in the feature-learning module to expand the data set and are beneficial to each other. Meanwhile, a perturbation scheme is designed for the feature-learning module, and averaging network weight is utilized to develop the guidance module. By doing so, the framework combines the feature-learning strength of CNN and ViT, strengthens the performance via dual-view co-training, and enables consistency-aware supervision in a semi-supervised manner. A topological exploration of all alternative supervision modes with CNN and ViT are detailed validated, demonstrating the most promising performance and specific setting of our method on semi-supervised medical image segmentation tasks. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on a public benchmark data set with a variety of metrics. The code is publicly available."
Semantic decomposition Network with Contrastive and Structural Constraints for Dental Plaque Segmentation,"Segmenting dental plaque from images of medical reagent staining provides valuable information for diagnosis and the determination of follow-up treatment plan. However, accurate dental plaque segmentation is a challenging task that requires identifying teeth and dental plaque subjected to semantic-blur regions (i.e., confused boundaries in border regions between teeth and dental plaque) and complex variations of instance shapes, which are not fully addressed by existing methods. Therefore, we propose a semantic decomposition network (SDNet) that introduces two single-task branches to separately address the segmentation of teeth and dental plaque and designs additional constraints to learn category-specific features for each branch, thus facilitating the semantic decomposition and improving the performance of dental plaque segmentation. Specifically, SDNet learns two separate segmentation branches for teeth and dental plaque in a divide-and-conquer manner to decouple the entangled relation between them. Each branch that specifies a category tends to yield accurate segmentation. To help these two branches better focus on category-specific features, two constraint modules are further proposed: 1) contrastive constraint module (CCM) to learn discriminative feature representations by maximizing the distance between different category representations, so as to reduce the negative impact of semantic-blur regions on feature extraction; 2) structural constraint module (SCM) to provide complete structural information for dental plaque of various shapes by the supervision of an boundary-aware geometric constraint. Besides, we construct a large-scale open-source Stained Dental Plaque Segmentation dataset (SDPSeg), which provides high-quality annotations for teeth and dental plaque. Experimental results on SDPSeg datasets show SDNet achieves state-of-the-art performance."
Exploring High-quality Target Domain Information for Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation,"In unsupervised domain adaptive (UDA) semantic segmentation, the distillation based methods are currently dominant in performance. However, the distillation technique requires complicate multi-stage process and many training tricks.  In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method that can achieve competitive performance to the advanced distillation methods. Our core idea is to fully explore the target-domain information from the views of boundaries and features.  First, we propose a novel mix-up strategy to generate high-quality target-domain boundaries with ground-truth labels. Different from the source-domain boundaries in previous works, we select the high-confidence target-domain areas and then paste them to the source-domain images. Such a strategy can generate the object boundaries in target domain (edge of target-domain object areas) with the correct labels. Consequently, the boundary information of target domain can be effectively captured by learning on the mixed-up samples.  Second, we design a multi-level contrastive loss to improve the representation of target-domain data, including pixel-level and prototype-level contrastive learning.  By combining two proposed methods, more discriminative features can be extracted and hard object boundaries can be better addressed for the target domain.  The experimental results on two commonly adopted benchmarks (\textit{i.e.}, GTA5 \rightarrow Cityscapes and SYNTHIA \rightarrow Cityscapes) show that our method achieves competitive performance to complicated distillation methods. Notably, for the SYNTHIA\rightarrow Cityscapes scenario, our method  achieves the state-of-the-art performance with 57.8\% mIoU and 64.6\% mIoU on 16 classes and 13 classes. Code is available at https://github.com/ljjcoder/EHTDI."
Domain-invariant Prototypes for Semantic Segmentation,"Deep Learning has greatly advanced the performance of semantic segmentation, however, its success relies on the availability of large amounts of annotated data for training. Hence, many efforts have been devoted to domain adaptive semantic segmentation that focuses on transferring semantic knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Existing self-training methods typically require multiple rounds of training, while another popular framework based on adversarial training is known to be sensitive to hyper-parameters. In this paper, we present an easy-to-train framework that learns domain-invariant prototypes for domain adaptive semantic segmentation. In particular, we show that domain adaptation shares a common character with few-shot learning in that both aim to recognize some types of unseen data with knowledge learned from large amounts of seen data. Thus, we propose a unified framework for domain adaptation and few-shot learning. The core idea is to use the class prototypes extracted from few-shot annotated target images to classify pixels of both source images and target images. Our method involves only one-stage training and does not need to be trained on large-scale un-annotated target images. Moreover, our method can be extended to variants of both domain adaptation and few-shot learning. Experiments on adapting GTA5-to-Cityscapes and SYNTHIA-to-Cityscapes show that our method achieves competitive performance to state-of-the-art."
Efficient Joint-Dimensional Search with Solution Space Regularization for Real-Time Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation is a popular research topic in computer vision, and many efforts have been made on it with impressive results. In this paper, we intend to search an optimal network structure that can run in real-time for this problem. Towards this goal, we jointly search the depth, channel, dilation rate and feature spatial resolution, which results in a search space consisting of about 2.78*10^324 possible choices. To handle such a large search space, we leverage differential architecture search methods. However, the architecture parameters searched using existing differential methods need to be discretized, which causes the discretization gap between the architecture parameters found by the differential methods and their discretized version as the final solution for the architecture search. Hence, we relieve the problem of discretization gap from the innovative perspective of solution space regularization. Specifically, a novel Solution Space Regularization (SSR) loss is first proposed to effectively encourage the supernet to converge to its discrete one. Then, a new Hierarchical and Progressive Solution Space Shrinking method is presented to further achieve high efficiency of searching. In addition, we theoretically show that the optimization of SSR loss is equivalent to the L_0-norm regularization, which accounts for the improved search-evaluation gap. Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed search scheme can efficiently find an optimal network structure that yields an extremely fast speed (175 FPS) of segmentation with a small model size (1 M) while maintaining comparable accuracy."
Semantic Segmentation-Assisted Instance Feature Fusion for Multi-Level 3D Part Instance Segmentation,"Recognizing 3D part instances from a 3D point cloud is crucial for 3D structure and scene understanding. Several learning-based approaches use semantic segmentation and instance center prediction as training tasks and fail to further exploit the inherent relationship between shape semantics and part instances. In this paper, we present a new method for 3D part instance segmentation. Our method exploits semantic segmentation to fuse nonlocal instance features, such as center prediction, and further enhances the fusion scheme in a multi- and cross-level way. We also propose a semantic region center prediction task to train and leverage the prediction results to improve the clustering of instance points. Our method outperforms existing methods with a large-margin improvement in the PartNet benchmark. We also demonstrate that our feature fusion scheme can be applied to other existing methods to improve their performance in indoor scene instance segmentation tasks."
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation via Graph Matching,"Unsupervised domain adaptation for point cloud semantic segmentation has attracted great attention due to its effectiveness in learning with unlabeled data. Most of existing methods use global-level feature alignment to transfer the knowledge from the source domain to the target domain, which may cause the semantic ambiguity of the feature space. In this paper, we propose a graph-based framework to explore the local-level feature alignment between the two domains, which can reserve semantic discrimination during adaptation. Specifically, in order to extract local-level features, we first dynamically construct local feature graphs on both domains and build a memory bank with the graphs from the source domain. In particular, we use optimal transport to generate the graph matching pairs. Then, based on the assignment matrix, we can align the feature distributions between the two domains with the graph-based local feature loss. Furthermore, we consider the correlation between the features of different categories and formulate a category-guided contrastive loss to guide the segmentation model to learn discriminative features on the target domain. Extensive experiments on different synthetic-to-real and real-to-real domain adaptation scenarios demonstrate that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance."
Exploiting Shape Cues for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) aims to produce pixel-wise class predictions with only image-level labels for training. To this end, previous methods adopt the common pipeline: they generate pseudo masks from class activation maps (CAMs) and use such masks to supervise segmentation networks. However, it is challenging to derive comprehensive pseudo masks that cover the whole extent of objects due to the local property of CAMs, i.e., they tend to focus solely on small discriminative object parts. In this paper, we associate the locality of CAMs with the texture-biased property of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Accordingly, we propose to exploit shape information to supplement the texture-biased CNN features, thereby encouraging mask predictions to be not only comprehensive but also well-aligned with object boundaries. We further refine the predictions in an online fashion with a novel refinement method that takes into account both the class and the color affinities, in order to generate reliable pseudo masks to supervise the model. Importantly, our model is end-to-end trained within a single-stage framework and therefore efficient in terms of the training cost. Through extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012, we validate the effectiveness of our method in producing precise and shape-aligned segmentation results. Specifically, our model surpasses the existing state-of-the-art single-stage approaches by large margins. What is more, it also achieves a new state-of-the-art performance over multi-stage approaches, when adopted in a simple two-stage pipeline without bells and whistles."
Extrinsic Camera Calibration with Semantic Segmentation,"Monocular camera sensors are vital to intelligent vehicle operation and automated driving assistance and are also heavily employed in traffic control infrastructure. Calibrating the monocular camera, though, is time-consuming and often requires significant manual intervention. In this work, we present an extrinsic camera calibration approach that automatizes the parameter estimation by utilizing semantic segmentation information from images and point clouds. Our approach relies on a coarse initial measurement of the camera pose and builds on lidar sensors mounted on a vehicle with high-precision localization to capture a point cloud of the camera environment. Afterward, a mapping between the camera and world coordinate spaces is obtained by performing a lidar-to-camera registration of the semantically segmented sensor data. We evaluate our method on simulated and real-world data to demonstrate low error measurements in the calibration results. Our approach is suitable for infrastructure sensors as well as vehicle sensors, while it does not require motion of the camera platform."
Cluster-to-adapt: Few Shot Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation across Disjoint Labels,"Domain adaptation for semantic segmentation across datasets consisting of the same categories has seen several recent successes. However, a more general scenario is when the source and target datasets correspond to non-overlapping label spaces. For example, categories in segmentation datasets change vastly depending on the type of environment or application, yet share many valuable semantic relations. Existing approaches based on feature alignment or discrepancy minimization do not take such category shift into account. In this work, we present Cluster-to-Adapt (C2A), a computationally efficient clustering-based approach for domain adaptation across segmentation datasets with completely different, but possibly related categories. We show that such a clustering objective enforced in a transformed feature space serves to automatically select categories across source and target domains that can be aligned for improving the target performance, while preventing negative transfer for unrelated categories. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on the challenging problem of outdoor to indoor adaptation for semantic segmentation in few-shot as well as zero-shot settings, with consistent improvements in performance over existing approaches and baselines in all cases."
Relict landslide detection in rainforest areas using a combination of k-means clustering algorithm and Deep-Learning semantic segmentation models,"Landslides are destructive and recurrent natural disasters on steep slopes and represent a risk to lives and properties. Knowledge of relict landslides' location is vital to understand their mechanisms, update inventory maps and improve risk assessment. However, relict landslide mapping is complex in tropical regions covered with rainforest vegetation. A new CNN approach is proposed for semi-automatic detection of relict landslides, which uses a dataset generated by a k-means clustering algorithm and has a pre-training step. The weights computed in the pre-training are used to fine-tune the CNN training process. A comparison between the proposed and standard approaches is performed using CBERS-4A WPM images. Three CNNs for semantic segmentation are used (U-Net, FPN, Linknet) with two augmented datasets. A total of 42 combinations of CNNs are tested. Values of precision and recall were very similar between the combinations tested. Recall was higher than 75\% for every combination, but precision values were usually smaller than 20\%. False positives (FP) samples were addressed as the cause for these low precision values. Predictions of the proposed approach were more accurate and correctly detected more landslides. This work demonstrates that there are limitations for detecting relict landslides in areas covered with rainforest, mainly related to similarities between the spectral response of pastures and deforested areas with \textit{Gleichenella sp.} ferns, commonly used as an indicator of landslide scars."
Semantic Segmentation of Fruits on Multi-sensor Fused Data in Natural Orchards,"Semantic segmentation is a fundamental task for agricultural robots to understand the surrounding environments in natural orchards. The recent development of the LiDAR techniques enables the robot to acquire accurate range measurements of the view in the unstructured orchards. Compared to RGB images, 3D point clouds have geometrical properties. By combining the LiDAR and camera, rich information on geometries and textures can be obtained. In this work, we propose a deep-learning-based segmentation method to perform accurate semantic segmentation on fused data from a LiDAR-Camera visual sensor. Two critical problems are explored and solved in this work. The first one is how to efficiently fused the texture and geometrical features from multi-sensor data. The second one is how to efficiently train the 3D segmentation network under severely imbalance class conditions. Moreover, an implementation of 3D segmentation in orchards including LiDAR-Camera data fusion, data collection and labelling, network training, and model inference is introduced in detail. In the experiment, we comprehensively analyze the network setup when dealing with highly unstructured and noisy point clouds acquired from an apple orchard. Overall, our proposed method achieves 86.2% mIoU on the segmentation of fruits on the high-resolution point cloud (100k-200k points). The experiment results show that the proposed method can perform accurate segmentation in real orchard environments."
SSformer: A Lightweight Transformer for Semantic Segmentation,"It is well believed that Transformer performs better in semantic segmentation compared to convolutional neural networks. Nevertheless, the original Vision Transformer may lack of inductive biases of local neighborhoods and possess a high time complexity. Recently, Swin Transformer sets a new record in various vision tasks by using hierarchical architecture and shifted windows while being more efficient. However, as Swin Transformer is specifically designed for image classification, it may achieve suboptimal performance on dense prediction-based segmentation task. Further, simply combing Swin Transformer with existing methods would lead to the boost of model size and parameters for the final segmentation model. In this paper, we rethink the Swin Transformer for semantic segmentation, and design a lightweight yet effective transformer model, called SSformer. In this model, considering the inherent hierarchical design of Swin Transformer, we propose a decoder to aggregate information from different layers, thus obtaining both local and global attentions. Experimental results show the proposed SSformer yields comparable mIoU performance with state-of-the-art models, while maintaining a smaller model size and lower compute."
A Robust Morphological Approach for Semantic Segmentation of Very High Resolution Images,"State-of-the-art methods for semantic segmentation of images involve computationally intensive neural network architectures. Most of these methods are not adaptable to high-resolution image segmentation due to memory and other computational issues. Typical approaches in literature involve design of neural network architectures that can fuse global information from low-resolution images and local information from the high-resolution counterparts. However, architectures designed for processing high resolution images are unnecessarily complex and involve a lot of hyper parameters that can be difficult to tune. Also, most of these architectures require ground truth annotations of the high resolution images to train, which can be hard to obtain. In this article, we develop a robust pipeline based on mathematical morphological (MM) operators that can seamlessly extend any existing semantic segmentation algorithm to high resolution images. Our method does not require the ground truth annotations of the high resolution images. It is based on efficiently utilizing information from the low-resolution counterparts, and gradient information on the high-resolution images. We obtain high quality seeds from the inferred labels on low-resolution images using traditional morphological operators and propagate seed labels using a random walker to refine the semantic labels at the boundaries. We show that the semantic segmentation results obtained by our method beat the existing state-of-the-art algorithms on high-resolution images. We empirically prove the robustness of our approach to the hyper parameters used in our pipeline. Further, we characterize some necessary conditions under which our pipeline is applicable and provide an in-depth analysis of the proposed approach."
FixMatchSeg: Fixing FixMatch for Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Supervised deep learning methods for semantic medical image segmentation are getting increasingly popular in the past few years.However, in resource constrained settings, getting large number of annotated images is very difficult as it mostly requires experts, is expensive and time-consuming.Semi-supervised segmentation can be an attractive solution where a very few labeled images are used along with a large number of unlabeled ones. While the gap between supervised and semi-supervised methods have been dramatically reduced for classification problems in the past couple of years, there still remains a larger gap in segmentation methods. In this work, we adapt a state-of-the-art semi-supervised classification method FixMatch to semantic segmentation task, introducing FixMatchSeg. FixMatchSeg is evaluated in four different publicly available datasets of different anatomy and different modality: cardiac ultrasound, chest X-ray, retinal fundus image, and skin images. When there are few labels, we show that FixMatchSeg performs on par with strong supervised baselines."
Lightweight and Progressively-Scalable Networks for Semantic Segmentation,"Multi-scale learning frameworks have been regarded as a capable class of models to boost semantic segmentation. The problem nevertheless is not trivial especially for the real-world deployments, which often demand high efficiency in inference latency. In this paper, we thoroughly analyze the design of convolutional blocks (the type of convolutions and the number of channels in convolutions), and the ways of interactions across multiple scales, all from lightweight standpoint for semantic segmentation. With such in-depth comparisons, we conclude three principles, and accordingly devise Lightweight and Progressively-Scalable Networks (LPS-Net) that novelly expands the network complexity in a greedy manner. Technically, LPS-Net first capitalizes on the principles to build a tiny network. Then, LPS-Net progressively scales the tiny network to larger ones by expanding a single dimension (the number of convolutional blocks, the number of channels, or the input resolution) at one time to meet the best speed/accuracy tradeoff. Extensive experiments conducted on three datasets consistently demonstrate the superiority of LPS-Net over several efficient semantic segmentation methods. More remarkably, our LPS-Net achieves 73.4% mIoU on Cityscapes test set, with the speed of 413.5FPS on an NVIDIA GTX 1080Ti, leading to a performance improvement by 1.5% and a 65% speed-up against the state-of-the-art STDC. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/YihengZhang-CV/LPS-Net}."
Two-Stream UNET Networks for Semantic Segmentation in Medical Images,"Recent advances of semantic image segmentation greatly benefit from deeper and larger Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models. Compared to image segmentation in the wild, properties of both medical images themselves and of existing medical datasets hinder training deeper and larger models because of overfitting. To this end, we propose a novel two-stream UNET architecture for automatic end-to-end medical image segmentation, in which intensity value and gradient vector flow (GVF) are two inputs for each stream, respectively. We demonstrate that two-stream CNNs with more low-level features greatly benefit semantic segmentation for imperfect medical image datasets. Our proposed two-stream networks are trained and evaluated on the popular medical image segmentation benchmarks, and the results are competitive with the state of the art. The code will be released soon."
GPS-GLASS: Learning Nighttime Semantic Segmentation Using Daytime Video and GPS data,"Semantic segmentation for autonomous driving should be robust against various in-the-wild environments. Nighttime semantic segmentation is especially challenging due to a lack of annotated nighttime images and a large domain gap from daytime images with sufficient annotation. In this paper, we propose a novel GPS-based training framework for nighttime semantic segmentation. Given GPS-aligned pairs of daytime and nighttime images, we perform cross-domain correspondence matching to obtain pixel-level pseudo supervision. Moreover, we conduct flow estimation between daytime video frames and apply GPS-based scaling to acquire another pixel-level pseudo supervision. Using these pseudo supervisions with a confidence map, we train a nighttime semantic segmentation network without any annotation from nighttime images. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on several nighttime semantic segmentation datasets. Our source code is available at https://github.com/jimmy9704/GPS-GLASS."
Incremental Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation via Embedding Adaptive-Update and Hyper-class Representation,"Incremental few-shot semantic segmentation (IFSS) targets at incrementally expanding model's capacity to segment new class of images supervised by only a few samples. However, features learned on old classes could significantly drift, causing catastrophic forgetting. Moreover, few samples for pixel-level segmentation on new classes lead to notorious overfitting issues in each learning session. In this paper, we explicitly represent class-based knowledge for semantic segmentation as a category embedding and a hyper-class embedding, where the former describes exclusive semantical properties, and the latter expresses hyper-class knowledge as class-shared semantic properties. Aiming to solve IFSS problems, we present EHNet, i.e., Embedding adaptive-update and Hyper-class representation Network from two aspects. First, we propose an embedding adaptive-update strategy to avoid feature drift, which maintains old knowledge by hyper-class representation, and adaptively update category embeddings with a class-attention scheme to involve new classes learned in individual sessions. Second, to resist overfitting issues caused by few training samples, a hyper-class embedding is learned by clustering all category embeddings for initialization and aligned with category embedding of the new class for enhancement, where learned knowledge assists to learn new knowledge, thus alleviating performance dependence on training data scale. Significantly, these two designs provide representation capability for classes with sufficient semantics and limited biases, enabling to perform segmentation tasks requiring high semantic dependence. Experiments on PASCAL-5i and COCO datasets show that EHNet achieves new state-of-the-art performance with remarkable advantages."
"Semantic Segmentation for Autonomous Driving: Model Evaluation, Dataset Generation, Perspective Comparison, and Real-Time Capability","Environmental perception is an important aspect within the field of autonomous vehicles that provides crucial information about the driving domain, including but not limited to identifying clear driving areas and surrounding obstacles. Semantic segmentation is a widely used perception method for self-driving cars that associates each pixel of an image with a predefined class. In this context, several segmentation models are evaluated regarding accuracy and efficiency. Experimental results on the generated dataset confirm that the segmentation model FasterSeg is fast enough to be used in realtime on lowpower computational (embedded) devices in self-driving cars. A simple method is also introduced to generate synthetic training data for the model. Moreover, the accuracy of the first-person perspective and the bird's eye view perspective are compared. For a 320 \times 256 input in the first-person perspective, FasterSeg achieves 65.44\,\% mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), and for a 320 \times 256 input from the bird's eye view perspective, FasterSeg achieves 64.08\,\% mIoU. Both perspectives achieve a frame rate of 247.11 Frames per Second (FPS) on the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier. Lastly, the frame rate and the accuracy with respect to the arithmetic 16-bit Floating Point (FP16) and 32-bit Floating Point (FP32) of both perspectives are measured and compared on the target hardware."
CENet: Toward Concise and Efficient LiDAR Semantic Segmentation for Autonomous Driving,"Accurate and fast scene understanding is one of the challenging task for autonomous driving, which requires to take full advantage of LiDAR point clouds for semantic segmentation. In this paper, we present a \textbf{concise} and \textbf{efficient} image-based semantic segmentation network, named \textbf{CENet}. In order to improve the descriptive power of learned features and reduce the computational as well as time complexity, our CENet integrates the convolution with larger kernel size instead of MLP, carefully-selected activation functions, and multiple auxiliary segmentation heads with corresponding loss functions into architecture. Quantitative and qualitative experiments conducted on publicly available benchmarks, SemanticKITTI and SemanticPOSS, demonstrate that our pipeline achieves much better mIoU and inference performance compared with state-of-the-art models. The code will be available at https://github.com/huixiancheng/CENet."
Behind Every Domain There is a Shift: Adapting Distortion-aware Vision Transformers for Panoramic Semantic Segmentation,"In this paper, we address panoramic semantic segmentation, which provides a full-view and dense-pixel understanding of surroundings in a holistic way. Panoramic segmentation is under-explored due to two critical challenges: (1) image distortions and object deformations on panoramas; (2) lack of annotations for training panoramic segmenters. To tackle these problems, we propose a Transformer for Panoramic Semantic Segmentation (Trans4PASS) architecture. First, to enhance distortion awareness, Trans4PASS, equipped with Deformable Patch Embedding (DPE) and Deformable MLP (DMLP) modules, is capable of handling object deformations and image distortions whenever (before or after adaptation) and wherever (shallow or deep levels) by design. We further introduce the upgraded Trans4PASS+ model, featuring DMLPv2 with parallel token mixing to improve the flexibility and generalizability in modeling discriminative cues. Second, we propose a Mutual Prototypical Adaptation (MPA) strategy for unsupervised domain adaptation. Third, aside from Pinhole-to-Panoramic (Pin2Pan) adaptation, we create a new dataset (SynPASS) with 9,080 panoramic images to explore a Synthetic-to-Real (Syn2Real) adaptation scheme in 360° imagery. Extensive experiments are conducted, which cover indoor and outdoor scenarios, and each of them is investigated with Pin2Pan and Syn2Real regimens. Trans4PASS+ achieves state-of-the-art performances on four domain adaptive panoramic semantic segmentation benchmarks. Code is available at https://github.com/jamycheung/Trans4PASS."
Self-Support Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation,"Existing few-shot segmentation methods have achieved great progress based on the support-query matching framework. But they still heavily suffer from the limited coverage of intra-class variations from the few-shot supports provided. Motivated by the simple Gestalt principle that pixels belonging to the same object are more similar than those to different objects of same class, we propose a novel self-support matching strategy to alleviate this problem, which uses query prototypes to match query features, where the query prototypes are collected from high-confidence query predictions. This strategy can effectively capture the consistent underlying characteristics of the query objects, and thus fittingly match query features. We also propose an adaptive self-support background prototype generation module and self-support loss to further facilitate the self-support matching procedure. Our self-support network substantially improves the prototype quality, benefits more improvement from stronger backbones and more supports, and achieves SOTA on multiple datasets.

Improving Predictive Performance and Calibration by Weight Fusion in Semantic Segmentation,"Averaging predictions of a deep ensemble of networks is apopular and effective method to improve predictive performance andcalibration in various benchmarks and Kaggle competitions. However, theruntime and training cost of deep ensembles grow linearly with the size ofthe ensemble, making them unsuitable for many applications. Averagingensemble weights instead of predictions circumvents this disadvantageduring inference and is typically applied to intermediate checkpoints ofa model to reduce training cost. Albeit effective, only few works haveimproved the understanding and the performance of weight averaging.Here, we revisit this approach and show that a simple weight fusion (WF)strategy can lead to a significantly improved predictive performance andcalibration. We describe what prerequisites the weights must meet interms of weight space, functional space and loss. Furthermore, we presenta new test method (called oracle test) to measure the functional spacebetween weights. We demonstrate the versatility of our WF strategy acrossstate of the art segmentation CNNs and Transformers as well as real worlddatasets such as BDD100K and Cityscapes. We compare WF with similarapproaches and show our superiority for in- and out-of-distribution datain terms of predictive performance and calibration."
Latent Space Unsupervised Semantic Segmentation,"The development of compact and energy-efficient wearable sensors has led to an increase in the availability of biosignals. To analyze these continuously recorded, and often multidimensional, time series at scale, being able to conduct meaningful unsupervised data segmentation is an auspicious target. A common way to achieve this is to identify change-points within the time series as the segmentation basis. However, traditional change-point detection algorithms often come with drawbacks, limiting their real-world applicability. Notably, they generally rely on the complete time series to be available and thus cannot be used for real-time applications. Another common limitation is that they poorly (or cannot) handle the segmentation of multidimensional time series. Consequently, the main contribution of this work is to propose a novel unsupervised segmentation algorithm for multidimensional time series named Latent Space Unsupervised Semantic Segmentation (LS-USS), which was designed to work easily with both online and batch data. When comparing LS-USS against other state-of-the-art change-point detection algorithms on a variety of real-world datasets, in both the offline and real-time setting, LS-USS systematically achieves on par or better performances."
Bi-directional Contrastive Learning for Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation,"We present a novel unsupervised domain adaptation method for semantic segmentation that generalizes a model trained with source images and corresponding ground-truth labels to a target domain. A key to domain adaptive semantic segmentation is to learn domain-invariant and discriminative features without target ground-truth labels. To this end, we propose a bi-directional pixel-prototype contrastive learning framework that minimizes intra-class variations of features for the same object class, while maximizing inter-class variations for different ones, regardless of domains. Specifically, our framework aligns pixel-level features and a prototype of the same object class in target and source images (i.e., positive pairs), respectively, sets them apart for different classes (i.e., negative pairs), and performs the alignment and separation processes toward the other direction with pixel-level features in the source image and a prototype in the target image. The cross-domain matching encourages domain-invariant feature representations, while the bidirectional pixel-prototype correspondences aggregate features for the same object class, providing discriminative features. To establish training pairs for contrastive learning, we propose to generate dynamic pseudo labels of target images using a non-parametric label transfer, that is, pixel-prototype correspondences across different domains. We also present a calibration method compensating class-wise domain biases of prototypes gradually during training."
Online Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation in Ever-Changing Conditions,"Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) aims at reducing the domain gap between training and testing data and is, in most cases, carried out in offline manner. However, domain changes may occur continuously and unpredictably during deployment (e.g. sudden weather changes). In such conditions, deep neural networks witness dramatic drops in accuracy and offline adaptation may not be enough to contrast it. In this paper, we tackle Online Domain Adaptation (OnDA) for semantic segmentation. We design a pipeline that is robust to continuous domain shifts, either gradual or sudden, and we evaluate it in the case of rainy and foggy scenarios. Our experiments show that our framework can effectively adapt to new domains during deployment, while not being affected by catastrophic forgetting of the previous domains."
Mining Relations among Cross-Frame Affinities for Video Semantic Segmentation,"The essence of video semantic segmentation (VSS) is how to leverage temporal information for prediction. Previous efforts are mainly devoted to developing new techniques to calculate the cross-frame affinities such as optical flow and attention. Instead, this paper contributes from a different angle by mining relations among cross-frame affinities, upon which better temporal information aggregation could be achieved. We explore relations among affinities in two aspects: single-scale intrinsic correlations and multi-scale relations. Inspired by traditional feature processing, we propose Single-scale Affinity Refinement (SAR) and Multi-scale Affinity Aggregation (MAA). To make it feasible to execute MAA, we propose a Selective Token Masking (STM) strategy to select a subset of consistent reference tokens for different scales when calculating affinities, which also improves the efficiency of our method. At last, the cross-frame affinities strengthened by SAR and MAA are adopted for adaptively aggregating temporal information. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method performs favorably against state-of-the-art VSS methods. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/GuoleiSun/VSS-MRCFA"
DecoupleNet: Decoupled Network for Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation,"Unsupervised domain adaptation in semantic segmentation has been raised to alleviate the reliance on expensive pixel-wise annotations. It leverages a labeled source domain dataset as well as unlabeled target domain images to learn a segmentation network. In this paper, we observe two main issues of the existing domain-invariant learning framework. (1) Being distracted by the feature distribution alignment, the network cannot focus on the segmentation task. (2) Fitting source domain data well would compromise the target domain performance. To address these issues, we propose DecoupleNet that alleviates source domain overfitting and enables the final model to focus more on the segmentation task. Furthermore, we put forward Self-Discrimination (SD) and introduce an auxiliary classifier to learn more discriminative target domain features with pseudo labels. Finally, we propose Online Enhanced Self-Training (OEST) to contextually enhance the quality of pseudo labels in an online manner. Experiments show our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, and extensive ablation studies verify the effectiveness of each component. Code is available at https://github.com/dvlab-research/DecoupleNet."
CoSMix: Compositional Semantic Mix for Domain Adaptation in 3D LiDAR Segmentation,"3D LiDAR semantic segmentation is fundamental for autonomous driving. Several Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) methods for point cloud data have been recently proposed to improve model generalization for different sensors and environments. Researchers working on UDA problems in the image domain have shown that sample mixing can mitigate domain shift. We propose a new approach of sample mixing for point cloud UDA, namely Compositional Semantic Mix (CoSMix), the first UDA approach for point cloud segmentation based on sample mixing. CoSMix consists of a two-branch symmetric network that can process labelled synthetic data (source) and real-world unlabelled point clouds (target) concurrently. Each branch operates on one domain by mixing selected pieces of data from the other one, and by using the semantic information derived from source labels and target pseudo-labels. We evaluate CoSMix on two large-scale datasets, showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. Our code is available at https://github.com/saltoricristiano/cosmix-uda."
Vision Transformers: From Semantic Segmentation to Dense Prediction,"The emergence of vision transformers (ViTs) in image classification has shifted the methodologies for visual representation learning. In particular, ViTs learn visual representation at full receptive field per layer across all the image patches, in comparison to the increasing receptive fields of CNNs across layers and other alternatives (e.g., large kernels and atrous convolution). In this work, for the first time we explore the global context learning potentials of ViTs for dense visual prediction (e.g., semantic segmentation). Our motivation is that through learning global context at full receptive field layer by layer, ViTs may capture stronger long-range dependency information, critical for dense prediction tasks. We first demonstrate that encoding an image as a sequence of patches, a vanilla ViT without local convolution and resolution reduction can yield stronger visual representation for semantic segmentation. For example, our model, termed as SEgmentation TRansformer (SETR), excels on ADE20K (50.28% mIoU, the first position in the test leaderboard on the day of submission) and Pascal Context (55.83% mIoU), and performs competitively on Cityscapes. For tackling general dense visual prediction tasks in a cost-effective manner, we further formulate a family of Hierarchical Local-Global (HLG) Transformers, characterized by local attention within windows and global-attention across windows in a pyramidal architecture. Extensive experiments show that our methods achieve appealing performance on a variety of dense prediction tasks (e.g., object detection and instance segmentation and semantic segmentation) as well as image classification. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/fudan-zvg/SETR."
Global and Local Features through Gaussian Mixture Models on Image Semantic Segmentation,"The semantic segmentation task aims at dense classification at the pixel-wise level. Deep models exhibited progress in tackling this task. However, one remaining problem with these approaches is the loss of spatial precision, often produced at the segmented objects' boundaries. Our proposed model addresses this problem by providing an internal structure for the feature representations while extracting a global representation that supports the former. To fit the internal structure, during training, we predict a Gaussian Mixture Model from the data, which, merged with the skip connections and the decoding stage, helps avoid wrong inductive biases. Furthermore, our results show that we can improve semantic segmentation by providing both learning representations (global and local) with a clustering behavior and combining them. Finally, we present results demonstrating our advances in Cityscapes and Synthia datasets."
ML-BPM: Multi-teacher Learning with Bidirectional Photometric Mixing for Open Compound Domain Adaptation in Semantic Segmentation,"Open compound domain adaptation (OCDA) considers the target domain as the compound of multiple unknown homogeneous subdomains. The goal of OCDA is to minimize the domain gap between the labeled source domain and the unlabeled compound target domain, which benefits the model generalization to the unseen domains. Current OCDA for semantic segmentation methods adopt manual domain separation and employ a single model to simultaneously adapt to all the target subdomains. However, adapting to a target subdomain might hinder the model from adapting to other dissimilar target subdomains, which leads to limited performance. In this work, we introduce a multi-teacher framework with bidirectional photometric mixing to separately adapt to every target subdomain. First, we present an automatic domain separation to find the optimal number of subdomains. On this basis, we propose a multi-teacher framework in which each teacher model uses bidirectional photometric mixing to adapt to one target subdomain. Furthermore, we conduct an adaptive distillation to learn a student model and apply consistency regularization to improve the student generalization. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show the efficacy of the proposed approach for both the compound domain and the open domains against existing state-of-the-art approaches."
A hierarchical semantic segmentation framework for computer vision-based bridge damage detection,"Computer vision-based damage detection using remote cameras and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) enables efficient and low-cost bridge health monitoring that reduces labor costs and the needs for sensor installation and maintenance. By leveraging recent semantic image segmentation approaches, we are able to find regions of critical structural components and recognize damage at the pixel level using images as the only input. However, existing methods perform poorly when detecting small damages (e.g., cracks and exposed rebars) and thin objects with limited image samples, especially when the components of interest are highly imbalanced. To this end, this paper introduces a semantic segmentation framework that imposes the hierarchical semantic relationship between component category and damage types. For example, certain concrete cracks only present on bridge columns and therefore the non-column region will be masked out when detecting such damages. In this way, the damage detection model could focus on learning features from possible damaged regions only and avoid the effects of other irrelevant regions. We also utilize multi-scale augmentation that provides views with different scales that preserves contextual information of each image without losing the ability of handling small and thin objects. Furthermore, the proposed framework employs important sampling that repeatedly samples images containing rare components (e.g., railway sleeper and exposed rebars) to provide more data samples, which addresses the imbalanced data challenge."
Open-world Semantic Segmentation via Contrasting and Clustering Vision-Language Embedding,"To bridge the gap between supervised semantic segmentation and real-world applications that acquires one model to recognize arbitrary new concepts, recent zero-shot segmentation attracts a lot of attention by exploring the relationships between unseen and seen object categories, yet requiring large amounts of densely-annotated data with diverse base classes. In this paper, we propose a new open-world semantic segmentation pipeline that makes the first attempt to learn to segment semantic objects of various open-world categories without any efforts on dense annotations, by purely exploiting the image-caption data that naturally exist on the Internet. Our method, Vision-language-driven Semantic Segmentation (ViL-Seg), employs an image and a text encoder to generate visual and text embeddings for the image-caption data, with two core components that endow its segmentation ability: First, the image encoder is jointly trained with a vision-based contrasting and a cross-modal contrasting, which encourage the visual embeddings to preserve both fine-grained semantics and high-level category information that are crucial for the segmentation task. Furthermore, an online clustering head is devised over the image encoder, which allows to dynamically segment the visual embeddings into distinct semantic groups such that they can be classified by comparing with various text embeddings to complete our segmentation pipeline. Experiments show that without using any data with dense annotations, our method can directly segment objects of arbitrary categories, outperforming zero-shot segmentation methods that require data labeling on three benchmark datasets."
Automatic universal taxonomies for multi-domain semantic segmentation,"Training semantic segmentation models on multiple datasets has sparked a lot of recent interest in the computer vision community. This interest has been motivated by expensive annotations and a desire to achieve proficiency across multiple visual domains. However, established datasets have mutually incompatible labels which disrupt principled inference in the wild. We address this issue by automatic construction of universal taxonomies through iterative dataset integration. Our method detects subset-superset relationships between dataset-specific labels, and supports learning of sub-class logits by treating super-classes as partial labels. We present experiments on collections of standard datasets and demonstrate competitive generalization performance with respect to previous work."
"BCS-Net: Boundary, Context and Semantic for Automatic COVID-19 Lung Infection Segmentation from CT Images","The spread of COVID-19 has brought a huge disaster to the world, and the automatic segmentation of infection regions can help doctors to make diagnosis quickly and reduce workload. However, there are several challenges for the accurate and complete segmentation, such as the scattered infection area distribution, complex background noises, and blurred segmentation boundaries. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel network for automatic COVID-19 lung infection segmentation from CT images, named BCS-Net, which considers the boundary, context, and semantic attributes. The BCS-Net follows an encoder-decoder architecture, and more designs focus on the decoder stage that includes three progressively Boundary-Context-Semantic Reconstruction (BCSR) blocks. In each BCSR block, the attention-guided global context (AGGC) module is designed to learn the most valuable encoder features for decoder by highlighting the important spatial and boundary locations and modeling the global context dependence. Besides, a semantic guidance (SG) unit generates the semantic guidance map to refine the decoder features by aggregating multi-scale high-level features at the intermediate resolution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms the existing competitors both qualitatively and quantitatively."
LapSeg3D: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation of Point Clouds Representing Laparoscopic Scenes,"The semantic segmentation of surgical scenes is a prerequisite for task automation in robot assisted interventions. We propose LapSeg3D, a novel DNN-based approach for the voxel-wise annotation of point clouds representing surgical scenes. As the manual annotation of training data is highly time consuming, we introduce a semi-autonomous clustering-based pipeline for the annotation of the gallbladder, which is used to generate segmented labels for the DNN. When evaluated against manually annotated data, LapSeg3D achieves an F1 score of 0.94 for gallbladder segmentation on various datasets of ex-vivo porcine livers. We show LapSeg3D to generalize accurately across different gallbladders and datasets recorded with different RGB-D camera systems."
Refign: Align and Refine for Adaptation of Semantic Segmentation to Adverse Conditions,"Due to the scarcity of dense pixel-level semantic annotations for images recorded in adverse visual conditions, there has been a keen interest in unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for the semantic segmentation of such images. UDA adapts models trained on normal conditions to the target adverse-condition domains. Meanwhile, multiple datasets with driving scenes provide corresponding images of the same scenes across multiple conditions, which can serve as a form of weak supervision for domain adaptation. We propose Refign, a generic extension to self-training-based UDA methods which leverages these cross-domain correspondences. Refign consists of two steps: (1) aligning the normal-condition image to the corresponding adverse-condition image using an uncertainty-aware dense matching network, and (2) refining the adverse prediction with the normal prediction using an adaptive label correction mechanism. We design custom modules to streamline both steps and set the new state of the art for domain-adaptive semantic segmentation on several adverse-condition benchmarks, including ACDC and Dark Zurich. The approach introduces no extra training parameters, minimal computational overhead -- during training only -- and can be used as a drop-in extension to improve any given self-training-based UDA method. Code is available at https://github.com/brdav/refign."
A Multi-Modality Ovarian Tumor Ultrasound Image Dataset for Unsupervised Cross-Domain Semantic Segmentation,"Ovarian cancer is one of the most harmful gynecological diseases. Detecting ovarian tumors in early stage with computer-aided techniques can efficiently decrease the mortality rate. With the improvement of medical treatment standard, ultrasound images are widely applied in clinical treatment. However, recent notable methods mainly focus on single-modality ultrasound ovarian tumor segmentation or recognition, which means there still lacks researches on exploring the representation capability of multi-modality ultrasound ovarian tumor images. To solve this problem, we propose a Multi-Modality Ovarian Tumor Ultrasound (MMOTU) image dataset containing 1469 2d ultrasound images and 170 contrast enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) images with pixel-wise and global-wise annotations. Based on MMOTU, we mainly focus on unsupervised cross-domain semantic segmentation task. To solve the domain shift problem, we propose a feature alignment based architecture named Dual-Scheme Domain-Selected Network (DS2Net). Specifically, we first design source-encoder and target-encoder to extract two-style features of source and target images. Then, we propose Domain-Distinct Selected Module (DDSM) and Domain-Universal Selected Module (DUSM) to extract the distinct and universal features in two styles (source-style or target-style). Finally, we fuse these two kinds of features and feed them into the source-decoder and target-decoder to generate final predictions. Extensive comparison experiments and analysis on MMOTU image dataset show that DS2Net can boost the segmentation performance for bidirectional cross-domain adaptation of 2d ultrasound images and CEUS images. Our proposed dataset and code are all available at https://github.com/cv516Buaa/MMOTU_DS2Net."
GeoSegNet: Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation via Geometric Encoder-Decoder Modeling,"Semantic segmentation of point clouds, aiming to assign each point a semantic category, is critical to 3D scene understanding.Despite of significant advances in recent years, most of existing methods still suffer from either the object-level misclassification or the boundary-level ambiguity. In this paper, we present a robust semantic segmentation network by deeply exploring the geometry of point clouds, dubbed GeoSegNet. Our GeoSegNet consists of a multi-geometry based encoder and a boundary-guided decoder. In the encoder, we develop a new residual geometry module from multi-geometry perspectives to extract object-level features. In the decoder, we introduce a contrastive boundary learning module to enhance the geometric representation of boundary points. Benefiting from the geometric encoder-decoder modeling, our GeoSegNet can infer the segmentation of objects effectively while making the intersections (boundaries) of two or more objects clear. Experiments show obvious improvements of our method over its competitors in terms of the overall segmentation accuracy and object boundary clearness. Code is available at https://github.com/Chen-yuiyui/GeoSegNet."
Prototypical Contrast Adaptation for Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation,"Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) aims to adapt the model trained on the labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. In this paper, we present Prototypical Contrast Adaptation (ProCA), a simple and efficient contrastive learning method for unsupervised domain adaptive semantic segmentation. Previous domain adaptation methods merely consider the alignment of the intra-class representational distributions across various domains, while the inter-class structural relationship is insufficiently explored, resulting in the aligned representations on the target domain might not be as easily discriminated as done on the source domain anymore. Instead, ProCA incorporates inter-class information into class-wise prototypes, and adopts the class-centered distribution alignment for adaptation. By considering the same class prototypes as positives and other class prototypes as negatives to achieve class-centered distribution alignment, ProCA achieves state-of-the-art performance on classical domain adaptation tasks, {\em i.e., GTA5 \to Cityscapes \text{and} SYNTHIA \to Cityscapes}. Code is available at \href{https://github.com/jiangzhengkai/ProCA}{ProCA}"
SlimSeg: Slimmable Semantic Segmentation with Boundary Supervision,"Accurate semantic segmentation models typically require significant computational resources, inhibiting their use in practical applications. Recent works rely on well-crafted lightweight models to achieve fast inference. However, these models cannot flexibly adapt to varying accuracy and efficiency requirements. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective slimmable semantic segmentation (SlimSeg) method, which can be executed at different capacities during inference depending on the desired accuracy-efficiency tradeoff. More specifically, we employ parametrized channel slimming by stepwise downward knowledge distillation during training. Motivated by the observation that the differences between segmentation results of each submodel are mainly near the semantic borders, we introduce an additional boundary guided semantic segmentation loss to further improve the performance of each submodel. We show that our proposed SlimSeg with various mainstream networks can produce flexible models that provide dynamic adjustment of computational cost and better performance than independent models. Extensive experiments on semantic segmentation benchmarks, Cityscapes and CamVid, demonstrate the generalization ability of our framework."
Automated Detection of Label Errors in Semantic Segmentation Datasets via Deep Learning and Uncertainty Quantification,"In this work, we for the first time present a method for detecting label errors in image datasets with semantic segmentation, i.e., pixel-wise class labels. Annotation acquisition for semantic segmentation datasets is time-consuming and requires plenty of human labor. In particular, review processes are time consuming and label errors can easily be overlooked by humans. The consequences are biased benchmarks and in extreme cases also performance degradation of deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on such datasets. DNNs for semantic segmentation yield pixel-wise predictions, which makes detection of label errors via uncertainty quantification a complex task. Uncertainty is particularly pronounced at the transitions between connected components of the prediction. By lifting the consideration of uncertainty to the level of predicted components, we enable the usage of DNNs together with component-level uncertainty quantification for the detection of label errors. We present a principled approach to benchmarking the task of label error detection by dropping labels from the Cityscapes dataset as well from a dataset extracted from the CARLA driving simulator, where in the latter case we have the labels under control. Our experiments show that our approach is able to detect the vast majority of label errors while controlling the number of false label error detections. Furthermore, we apply our method to semantic segmentation datasets frequently used by the computer vision community and present a collection of label errors along with sample statistics."
A Near Sensor Edge Computing System for Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation,"Point cloud semantic segmentation has attracted attentions due to its robustness to light condition. This makes it an ideal semantic solution for autonomous driving. However, considering the large computation burden and bandwidth demanding of neural networks, putting all the computing into vehicle Electronic Control Unit (ECU) is not efficient or practical. In this paper, we proposed a light weighted point cloud semantic segmentation network based on range view. Due to its simple pre-processing and standard convolution, it is efficient when running on deep learning accelerator like DPU. Furthermore, a near sensor computing system is built for autonomous vehicles. In this system, a FPGA-based deep learning accelerator core (DPU) is placed next to the LiDAR sensor, to perform point cloud pre-processing and segmentation neural network. By leaving only the post-processing step to ECU, this solution heavily alleviate the computation burden of ECU and consequently shortens the decision making and vehicles reaction latency. Our semantic segmentation network achieved 10 frame per second (fps) on Xilinx DPU with computation efficiency 42.5 GOP/W."
Wound Segmentation with Dynamic Illumination Correction and Dual-view Semantic Fusion,"Wound image segmentation is a critical component for the clinical diagnosis and in-time treatment of wounds. Recently, deep learning has become the mainstream methodology for wound image segmentation. However, the pre-processing of the wound image, such as the illumination correction, is required before the training phase as the performance can be greatly improved. The correction procedure and the training of deep models are independent of each other, which leads to sub-optimal segmentation performance as the fixed illumination correction may not be suitable for all images. To address aforementioned issues, an end-to-end dual-view segmentation approach was proposed in this paper, by incorporating a learn-able illumination correction module into the deep segmentation models. The parameters of the module can be learned and updated during the training stage automatically, while the dual-view fusion can fully employ the features from both the raw images and the enhanced ones. To demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework, the extensive experiments are conducted on the benchmark datasets. The encouraging results suggest that our framework can significantly improve the segmentation performance, compared to the state-of-the-art methods."
eX-ViT: A Novel eXplainable Vision Transformer for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Recently vision transformer models have become prominent models for a range of vision tasks. These models, however, are usually opaque with weak feature interpretability. Moreover, there is no method currently built for an intrinsically interpretable transformer, which is able to explain its reasoning process and provide a faithful explanation. To close these crucial gaps, we propose a novel vision transformer dubbed the eXplainable Vision Transformer (eX-ViT), an intrinsically interpretable transformer model that is able to jointly discover robust interpretable features and perform the prediction. Specifically, eX-ViT is composed of the Explainable Multi-Head Attention (E-MHA) module, the Attribute-guided Explainer (AttE) module and the self-supervised attribute-guided loss. The E-MHA tailors explainable attention weights that are able to learn semantically interpretable representations from local patches in terms of model decisions with noise robustness. Meanwhile, AttE is proposed to encode discriminative attribute features for the target object through diverse attribute discovery, which constitutes faithful evidence for the model's predictions. In addition, a self-supervised attribute-guided loss is developed for our eX-ViT, which aims at learning enhanced representations through the attribute discriminability mechanism and attribute diversity mechanism, to localize diverse and discriminative attributes and generate more robust explanations. As a result, we can uncover faithful and robust interpretations with diverse attributes through the proposed eX-ViT."
Normalized Feature Distillation for Semantic Segmentation,"As a promising approach in model compression, knowledge distillation improves the performance of a compact model by transferring the knowledge from a cumbersome one. The kind of knowledge used to guide the training of the student is important. Previous distillation methods in semantic segmentation strive to extract various forms of knowledge from the features, which involve elaborate manual design relying on prior information and have limited performance gains. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective feature distillation method called normalized feature distillation (NFD), aiming to enable effective distillation with the original features without the need to manually design new forms of knowledge. The key idea is to prevent the student from focusing on imitating the magnitude of the teacher's feature response by normalization. Our method achieves state-of-the-art distillation results for semantic segmentation on Cityscapes, VOC 2012, and ADE20K datasets. Code will be available."
Unsupervised Semantic Segmentation with Self-supervised Object-centric Representations,"In this paper, we show that recent advances in self-supervised feature learning enable unsupervised object discovery and semantic segmentation with a performance that matches the state of the field on supervised semantic segmentation 10 years ago. We propose a methodology based on unsupervised saliency masks and self-supervised feature clustering to kickstart object discovery followed by training a semantic segmentation network on pseudo-labels to bootstrap the system on images with multiple objects. We present results on PASCAL VOC that go far beyond the current state of the art (50.0 mIoU), and we report for the first time results on MS COCO for the whole set of 81 classes: our method discovers 34 categories with more than 20\% IoU, while obtaining an average IoU of 19.6 for all 81 categories."
"SFNet: Faster, Accurate, and Domain Agnostic Semantic Segmentation via Semantic Flow","In this paper, we focus on exploring effective methods for faster, accurate, and domain agnostic semantic segmentation. Inspired by the Optical Flow for motion alignment between adjacent video frames, we propose a Flow Alignment Module (FAM) to learn \textit{Semantic Flow} between feature maps of adjacent levels, and broadcast high-level features to high resolution features effectively and efficiently. Furthermore, integrating our FAM to a common feature pyramid structure exhibits superior performance over other real-time methods even on light-weight backbone networks, such as ResNet-18 and DFNet. Then to further speed up the inference procedure, we also present a novel Gated Dual Flow Alignment Module to directly align high resolution feature maps and low resolution feature maps where we term improved version network as SFNet-Lite. Extensive experiments are conducted on several challenging datasets, where results show the effectiveness of both SFNet and SFNet-Lite. In particular, the proposed SFNet-Lite series achieve 80.1 mIoU while running at 60 FPS using ResNet-18 backbone and 78.8 mIoU while running at 120 FPS using STDC backbone on RTX-3090. Moreover, we unify four challenging driving datasets (i.e., Cityscapes, Mapillary, IDD and BDD) into one large dataset, which we named Unified Driving Segmentation (UDS) dataset. It contains diverse domain and style information. We benchmark several representative works on UDS. Both SFNet and SFNet-Lite still achieve the best speed and accuracy trade-off on UDS which serves as a strong baseline in such a new challenging setting. All the code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/lxtGH/SFSegNets."
Self-supervised Learning with Local Contrastive Loss for Detection and Semantic Segmentation,"We present a self-supervised learning (SSL) method suitable for semi-global tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation. We enforce local consistency between self-learned features, representing corresponding image locations of transformed versions of the same image, by minimizing a pixel-level local contrastive (LC) loss during training. LC-loss can be added to existing self-supervised learning methods with minimal overhead. We evaluate our SSL approach on two downstream tasks -- object detection and semantic segmentation, using COCO, PASCAL VOC, and CityScapes datasets. Our method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art SSL approaches by 1.9% on COCO object detection, 1.4% on PASCAL VOC detection, and 0.6% on CityScapes segmentation."
2DPASS: 2D Priors Assisted Semantic Segmentation on LiDAR Point Clouds,"As camera and LiDAR sensors capture complementary information used in autonomous driving, great efforts have been made to develop semantic segmentation algorithms through multi-modality data fusion. However, fusion-based approaches require paired data, i.e., LiDAR point clouds and camera images with strict point-to-pixel mappings, as the inputs in both training and inference, which seriously hinders their application in practical scenarios. Thus, in this work, we propose the 2D Priors Assisted Semantic Segmentation (2DPASS), a general training scheme, to boost the representation learning on point clouds, by fully taking advantage of 2D images with rich appearance. In practice, by leveraging an auxiliary modal fusion and multi-scale fusion-to-single knowledge distillation (MSFSKD), 2DPASS acquires richer semantic and structural information from the multi-modal data, which are then online distilled to the pure 3D network. As a result, equipped with 2DPASS, our baseline shows significant improvement with only point cloud inputs. Specifically, it achieves the state-of-the-arts on two large-scale benchmarks (i.e. SemanticKITTI and NuScenes), including top-1 results in both single and multiple scan(s) competitions of SemanticKITTI."
SHDM-NET: Heat Map Detail Guidance with Image Matting for Industrial Weld Semantic Segmentation Network,"In actual industrial production, the assessment of the steel plate welding effect is an important task, and the segmentation of the weld section is the basis of the assessment. This paper proposes an industrial weld segmentation network based on a deep learning semantic segmentation algorithm fused with heatmap detail guidance and Image Matting to solve the automatic segmentation problem of weld regions. In the existing semantic segmentation networks, the boundary information can be preserved by fusing the features of both high-level and low-level layers. However, this method can lead to insufficient expression of the spatial information in the low-level layer, resulting in inaccurate segmentation boundary positioning. We propose a detailed guidance module based on heatmaps to fully express the segmented region boundary information in the low-level network to address this problem. Specifically, the expression of boundary information can be enhanced by adding a detailed branch to predict segmented boundary and then matching it with the boundary heat map generated by mask labels to calculate the mean square error loss. In addition, although deep learning has achieved great success in the field of semantic segmentation, the precision of the segmentation boundary region is not high due to the loss of detailed information caused by the classical segmentation network in the process of encoding and decoding process. This paper introduces a matting algorithm to calibrate the boundary of the segmentation region of the semantic segmentation network to solve this problem. Through many experiments on industrial weld data sets, the effectiveness of our method is demonstrated, and the MIOU reaches 97.93%. It is worth noting that this performance is comparable to human manual segmentation ( MIOU 97.96%)."
False Negative Reduction in Semantic Segmentation under Domain Shift using Depth Estimation,"State-of-the-art deep neural networks demonstrate outstanding performance in semantic segmentation. However, their performance is tied to the domain represented by the training data. Open world scenarios cause inaccurate predictions which is hazardous in safety relevant applications like automated driving. In this work, we enhance semantic segmentation predictions using monocular depth estimation to improve segmentation by reducing the occurrence of non-detected objects in presence of domain shift. To this end, we infer a depth heatmap via a modified segmentation network which generates foreground-background masks, operating in parallel to a given semantic segmentation network. Both segmentation masks are aggregated with a focus on foreground classes (here road users) to reduce false negatives. To also reduce the occurrence of false positives, we apply a pruning based on uncertainty estimates. Our approach is modular in a sense that it post-processes the output of any semantic segmentation network. In our experiments, we observe less non-detected objects of most important classes and an enhanced generalization to other domains compared to the basic semantic segmentation prediction."
Entropy-Based Feature Extraction For Real-Time Semantic Segmentation,"This paper introduces an efficient patch-based computational module, coined Entropy-based Patch Encoder (EPE) module, for resource-constrained semantic segmentation. The EPE module consists of three lightweight fully-convolutional encoders, each extracting features from image patches with a different amount of entropy. Patches with high entropy are being processed by the encoder with the largest number of parameters, patches with moderate entropy are processed by the encoder with a moderate number of parameters, and patches with low entropy are processed by the smallest encoder. The intuition behind the module is the following: as patches with high entropy contain more information, they need an encoder with more parameters, unlike low entropy patches, which can be processed using a small encoder. Consequently, processing part of the patches via the smaller encoder can significantly reduce the computational cost of the module. Experiments show that EPE can boost the performance of existing real-time semantic segmentation models with a slight increase in the computational cost. Specifically, EPE increases the mIOU performance of DFANet A by 0.9% with only 1.2% increase in the number of parameters and the mIOU performance of EDANet by 1% with 10% increase of the model parameters."
GFNet: Geometric Flow Network for 3D Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation,"Point cloud semantic segmentation from projected views, such as range-view (RV) and bird's-eye-view (BEV), has been intensively investigated. Different views capture different information of point clouds and thus are complementary to each other. However, recent projection-based methods for point cloud semantic segmentation usually utilize a vanilla late fusion strategy for the predictions of different views, failing to explore the complementary information from a geometric perspective during the representation learning. In this paper, we introduce a geometric flow network (GFNet) to explore the geometric correspondence between different views in an align-before-fuse manner. Specifically, we devise a novel geometric flow module (GFM) to bidirectionally align and propagate the complementary information across different views according to geometric relationships under the end-to-end learning scheme. We perform extensive experiments on two widely used benchmark datasets, SemanticKITTI and nuScenes, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our GFNet for project-based point cloud semantic segmentation. Concretely, GFNet not only significantly boosts the performance of each individual view but also achieves state-of-the-art results over all existing projection-based models. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/haibo-qiu/GFNet}."
Complementary Bi-directional Feature Compression for Indoor 360° Semantic Segmentation with Self-distillation,"Recently, horizontal representation-based panoramic semantic segmentation approaches outperform projection-based solutions, because the distortions can be effectively removed by compressing the spherical data in the vertical direction. However, these methods ignore the distortion distribution prior and are limited to unbalanced receptive fields, e.g., the receptive fields are sufficient in the vertical direction and insufficient in the horizontal direction. Differently, a vertical representation compressed in another direction can offer implicit distortion prior and enlarge horizontal receptive fields. In this paper, we combine the two different representations and propose a novel 360° semantic segmentation solution from a complementary perspective. Our network comprises three modules: a feature extraction module, a bi-directional compression module, and an ensemble decoding module. First, we extract multi-scale features from a panorama. Then, a bi-directional compression module is designed to compress features into two complementary low-dimensional representations, which provide content perception and distortion prior. Furthermore, to facilitate the fusion of bi-directional features, we design a unique self distillation strategy in the ensemble decoding module to enhance the interaction of different features and further improve the performance. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions with at least 10\% improvement on quantitative evaluations while displaying the best performance on visual appearance."
CoBEVT: Cooperative Bird's Eye View Semantic Segmentation with Sparse Transformers,"Bird's eye view (BEV) semantic segmentation plays a crucial role in spatial sensing for autonomous driving. Although recent literature has made significant progress on BEV map understanding, they are all based on single-agent camera-based systems. These solutions sometimes have difficulty handling occlusions or detecting distant objects in complex traffic scenes. Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication technologies have enabled autonomous vehicles to share sensing information, dramatically improving the perception performance and range compared to single-agent systems. In this paper, we propose CoBEVT, the first generic multi-agent multi-camera perception framework that can cooperatively generate BEV map predictions. To efficiently fuse camera features from multi-view and multi-agent data in an underlying Transformer architecture, we design a fused axial attention module (FAX), which captures sparsely local and global spatial interactions across views and agents. The extensive experiments on the V2V perception dataset, OPV2V, demonstrate that CoBEVT achieves state-of-the-art performance for cooperative BEV semantic segmentation. Moreover, CoBEVT is shown to be generalizable to other tasks, including 1) BEV segmentation with single-agent multi-camera and 2) 3D object detection with multi-agent LiDAR systems, achieving state-of-the-art performance with real-time inference speed. The code is available at https://github.com/DerrickXuNu/CoBEVT."
Improving Semantic Segmentation in Transformers using Hierarchical Inter-Level Attention,"Existing transformer-based image backbones typically propagate feature information in one direction from lower to higher-levels. This may not be ideal since the localization ability to delineate accurate object boundaries, is most prominent in the lower, high-resolution feature maps, while the semantics that can disambiguate image signals belonging to one object vs. another, typically emerges in a higher level of processing. We present Hierarchical Inter-Level Attention (HILA), an attention-based method that captures Bottom-Up and Top-Down Updates between features of different levels. HILA extends hierarchical vision transformer architectures by adding local connections between features of higher and lower levels to the backbone encoder. In each iteration, we construct a hierarchy by having higher-level features compete for assignments to update lower-level features belonging to them, iteratively resolving object-part relationships. These improved lower-level features are then used to re-update the higher-level features. HILA can be integrated into the majority of hierarchical architectures without requiring any changes to the base model. We add HILA into SegFormer and the Swin Transformer and show notable improvements in accuracy in semantic segmentation with fewer parameters and FLOPS.

Latents2Segments: Disentangling the Latent Space of Generative Models for Semantic Segmentation of Face Images,"With the advent of an increasing number of Augmented and Virtual Reality applications that aim to perform meaningful and controlled style edits on images of human faces, the impetus for the task of parsing face images to produce accurate and fine-grained semantic segmentation maps is more than ever before. Few State of the Art (SOTA) methods which solve this problem, do so by incorporating priors with respect to facial structure or other face attributes such as expression and pose in their deep classifier architecture. Our endeavour in this work is to do away with the priors and complex pre-processing operations required by SOTA multi-class face segmentation models by reframing this operation as a downstream task post infusion of disentanglement with respect to facial semantic regions of interest (ROIs) in the latent space of a Generative Autoencoder model. We present results for our model's performance on the CelebAMask-HQ and HELEN datasets. The encoded latent space of our model achieves significantly higher disentanglement with respect to semantic ROIs than that of other SOTA works. Moreover, it achieves a 13% faster inference rate and comparable accuracy with respect to the publicly available SOTA for the downstream task of semantic segmentation of face images."
DeepPyramid: Enabling Pyramid View and Deformable Pyramid Reception for Semantic Segmentation in Cataract Surgery Videos,"Semantic segmentation in cataract surgery has a wide range of applications contributing to surgical outcome enhancement and clinical risk reduction. However, the varying issues in segmenting the different relevant structures in these surgeries make the designation of a unique network quite challenging. This paper proposes a semantic segmentation network, termed DeepPyramid, that can deal with these challenges using three novelties: (1) a Pyramid View Fusion module which provides a varying-angle global view of the surrounding region centering at each pixel position in the input convolutional feature map; (2) a Deformable Pyramid Reception module which enables a wide deformable receptive field that can adapt to geometric transformations in the object of interest; and (3) a dedicated Pyramid Loss that adaptively supervises multi-scale semantic feature maps. Combined, we show that these modules can effectively boost semantic segmentation performance, especially in the case of transparency, deformability, scalability, and blunt edges in objects. We demonstrate that our approach performs at a state-of-the-art level and outperforms a number of existing methods with a large margin (3.66% overall improvement in intersection over union compared to the best rival approach)."
Open-world Semantic Segmentation for LIDAR Point Clouds,"Current methods for LIDAR semantic segmentation are not robust enough for real-world applications, e.g., autonomous driving, since it is closed-set and static. The closed-set assumption makes the network only able to output labels of trained classes, even for objects never seen before, while a static network cannot update its knowledge base according to what it has seen. Therefore, in this work, we propose the open-world semantic segmentation task for LIDAR point clouds, which aims to 1) identify both old and novel classes using open-set semantic segmentation, and 2) gradually incorporate novel objects into the existing knowledge base using incremental learning without forgetting old classes. For this purpose, we propose a REdundAncy cLassifier (REAL) framework to provide a general architecture for both the open-set semantic segmentation and incremental learning problems. The experimental results show that REAL can simultaneously achieves state-of-the-art performance in the open-set semantic segmentation task on the SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets, and alleviate the catastrophic forgetting problem with a large margin during incremental learning."
Positive-Negative Equal Contrastive Loss for Semantic Segmentation,"The contextual information is critical for various computer vision tasks, previous works commonly design plug-and-play modules and structural losses to effectively extract and aggregate the global context. These methods utilize fine-label to optimize the model but ignore that fine-trained features are also precious training resources, which can introduce preferable distribution to hard pixels (i.e., misclassified pixels). Inspired by contrastive learning in unsupervised paradigm, we apply the contrastive loss in a supervised manner and re-design the loss function to cast off the stereotype of unsupervised learning (e.g., imbalance of positives and negatives, confusion of anchors computing). To this end, we propose Positive-Negative Equal contrastive loss (PNE loss), which increases the latent impact of positive embedding on the anchor and treats the positive as well as negative sample pairs equally. The PNE loss can be directly plugged right into existing semantic segmentation frameworks and leads to excellent performance with neglectable extra computational costs. We utilize a number of classic segmentation methods (e.g., DeepLabV3, HRNetV2, OCRNet, UperNet) and backbone (e.g., ResNet, HRNet, Swin Transformer) to conduct comprehensive experiments and achieve state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets (e.g., Cityscapes, COCO-Stuff and ADE20K). Our code will be publicly available soon."
Rethinking Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation,"Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) adapts a model trained on one domain (called source) to a novel domain (called target) using only unlabeled data. Due to its high annotation cost, researchers have developed many UDA methods for semantic segmentation, which assume no labeled sample is available in the target domain. We question the practicality of this assumption for two reasons. First, after training a model with a UDA method, we must somehow verify the model before deployment. Second, UDA methods have at least a few hyper-parameters that need to be determined. The surest solution to these is to evaluate the model using validation data, i.e., a certain amount of labeled target-domain samples. This question about the basic assumption of UDA leads us to rethink UDA from a data-centric point of view. Specifically, we assume we have access to a minimum level of labeled data. Then, we ask how much is necessary to find good hyper-parameters of existing UDA methods. We then consider what if we use the same data for supervised training of the same model, e.g., finetuning. We conducted experiments to answer these questions with popular scenarios, {GTA5, SYNTHIA}\rightarrowCityscapes. We found that i) choosing good hyper-parameters needs only a few labeled images for some UDA methods whereas a lot more for others; and ii) simple finetuning works surprisingly well; it outperforms many UDA methods if only several dozens of labeled images are available."
LaserMix for Semi-Supervised LiDAR Semantic Segmentation,"Densely annotating LiDAR point clouds is costly, which restrains the scalability of fully-supervised learning methods. In this work, we study the underexplored semi-supervised learning (SSL) in LiDAR segmentation. Our core idea is to leverage the strong spatial cues of LiDAR point clouds to better exploit unlabeled data. We propose LaserMix to mix laser beams from different LiDAR scans, and then encourage the model to make consistent and confident predictions before and after mixing. Our framework has three appealing properties: 1) Generic: LaserMix is agnostic to LiDAR representations (e.g., range view and voxel), and hence our SSL framework can be universally applied. 2) Statistically grounded: We provide a detailed analysis to theoretically explain the applicability of the proposed framework. 3) Effective: Comprehensive experimental analysis on popular LiDAR segmentation datasets (nuScenes, SemanticKITTI, and ScribbleKITTI) demonstrates our effectiveness and superiority. Notably, we achieve competitive results over fully-supervised counterparts with 2x to 5x fewer labels and improve the supervised-only baseline significantly by 10.8% on average. We hope this concise yet high-performing framework could facilitate future research in semi-supervised LiDAR segmentation. Code is publicly available."
Multi-scale Network with Attentional Multi-resolution Fusion for Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation,"In this paper, we present a comprehensive point cloud semantic segmentation network that aggregates both local and global multi-scale information. First, we propose an Angle Correlation Point Convolution (ACPConv) module to effectively learn the local shapes of points. Second, based upon ACPConv, we introduce a local multi-scale split (MSS) block that hierarchically connects features within one single block and gradually enlarges the receptive field which is beneficial for exploiting the local context. Third, inspired by HRNet which has excellent performance on 2D image vision tasks, we build an HRNet customized for point cloud to learn global multi-scale context. Lastly, we introduce a point-wise attention fusion approach that fuses multi-resolution predictions and further improves point cloud semantic segmentation performance. Our experimental results and ablations on several benchmark datasets show that our proposed method is effective and able to achieve state-of-the-art performances compared to existing methods."
LaRa: Latents and Rays for Multi-Camera Bird's-Eye-View Semantic Segmentation,"Recent works in autonomous driving have widely adopted the bird's-eye-view (BEV) semantic map as an intermediate representation of the world. Online prediction of these BEV maps involves non-trivial operations such as multi-camera data extraction as well as fusion and projection into a common topview grid. This is usually done with error-prone geometric operations (e.g., homography or back-projection from monocular depth estimation) or expensive direct dense mapping between image pixels and pixels in BEV (e.g., with MLP or attention). In this work, we present 'LaRa', an efficient encoder-decoder, transformer-based model for vehicle semantic segmentation from multiple cameras. Our approach uses a system of cross-attention to aggregate information over multiple sensors into a compact, yet rich, collection of latent representations. These latent representations, after being processed by a series of self-attention blocks, are then reprojected with a second cross-attention in the BEV space. We demonstrate that our model outperforms the best previous works using transformers on nuScenes. The code and trained models are available at https://github.com/valeoai/LaRa"
CV 3315 Is All You Need : Semantic Segmentation Competition,"This competition focus on Urban-Sense Segmentation based on the vehicle camera view. Class highly unbalanced Urban-Sense images dataset challenge the existing solutions and further studies. Deep Conventional neural network-based semantic segmentation methods such as encoder-decoder architecture and multi-scale and pyramid-based approaches become flexible solutions applicable to real-world applications. In this competition, we mainly review the literature and conduct experiments on transformer-driven methods especially SegFormer, to achieve an optimal trade-off between performance and efficiency. For example, SegFormer-B0 achieved 74.6% mIoU with the smallest FLOPS, 15.6G, and the largest model, SegFormer- B5 archived 80.2% mIoU. According to multiple factors, including individual case failure analysis, individual class performance, training pressure and efficiency estimation, the final candidate model for the competition is SegFormer- B2 with 50.6 GFLOPS and 78.5% mIoU evaluated on the testing set.

"LidarMultiNet: Unifying LiDAR Semantic Segmentation, 3D Object Detection, and Panoptic Segmentation in a Single Multi-task Network","This technical report presents the 1st place winning solution for the Waymo Open Dataset 3D semantic segmentation challenge 2022. Our network, termed LidarMultiNet, unifies the major LiDAR perception tasks such as 3D semantic segmentation, object detection, and panoptic segmentation in a single framework. At the core of LidarMultiNet is a strong 3D voxel-based encoder-decoder network with a novel Global Context Pooling (GCP) module extracting global contextual features from a LiDAR frame to complement its local features. An optional second stage is proposed to refine the first-stage segmentation or generate accurate panoptic segmentation results. Our solution achieves a mIoU of 71.13 and is the best for most of the 22 classes on the Waymo 3D semantic segmentation test set, outperforming all the other 3D semantic segmentation methods on the official leaderboard. We demonstrate for the first time that major LiDAR perception tasks can be unified in a single strong network that can be trained end-to-end."
Toward Unpaired Multi-modal Medical Image Segmentation via Learning Structured Semantic Consistency,"Integrating multi-modal data to promote medical image analysis has recently gained great attention. This paper presents a novel scheme to learn the mutual benefits of different modalities to achieve better segmentation results for unpaired multi-modal medical images. Our approach tackles two critical issues of this task from a practical perspective: (1) how to effectively learn the semantic consistencies of various modalities (e.g., CT and MRI), and (2) how to leverage the above consistencies to regularize the network learning while preserving its simplicity. To address (1), we leverage a carefully designed External Attention Module (EAM) to align semantic class representations and their correlations of different modalities. To solve (2), the proposed EAM is designed as an external plug-and-play one, which can be discarded once the model is optimized. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method on two medical image segmentation scenarios: (1) cardiac structure segmentation, and (2) abdominal multi-organ segmentation. Extensive results show that the proposed method outperforms its counterparts by a wide margin."
Distribution Regularized Self-Supervised Learning for Domain Adaptation of Semantic Segmentation,"This paper proposes a novel pixel-level distribution regularization scheme (DRSL) for self-supervised domain adaptation of semantic segmentation. In a typical setting, the classification loss forces the semantic segmentation model to greedily learn the representations that capture inter-class variations in order to determine the decision (class) boundary. Due to the domain shift, this decision boundary is unaligned in the target domain, resulting in noisy pseudo labels adversely affecting self-supervised domain adaptation. To overcome this limitation, along with capturing inter-class variation, we capture pixel-level intra-class variations through class-aware multi-modal distribution learning (MMDL). Thus, the information necessary for capturing the intra-class variations is explicitly disentangled from the information necessary for inter-class discrimination. Features captured thus are much more informative, resulting in pseudo-labels with low noise. This disentanglement allows us to perform separate alignments in discriminative space and multi-modal distribution space, using cross-entropy based self-learning for the former. For later, we propose a novel stochastic mode alignment method, by explicitly decreasing the distance between the target and source pixels that map to the same mode. The distance metric learning loss, computed over pseudo-labels and backpropagated from multi-modal modeling head, acts as the regularizer over the base network shared with the segmentation head. The results from comprehensive experiments on synthetic to real domain adaptation setups, i.e., GTA-V/SYNTHIA to Cityscapes, show that DRSL outperforms many existing approaches (a minimum margin of 2.3% and 2.5% in mIoU for SYNTHIA to Cityscapes)."
Saliency Guided Inter- and Intra-Class Relation Constraints for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Weakly supervised semantic segmentation with only image-level labels aims to reduce annotation costs for the segmentation task. Existing approaches generally leverage class activation maps (CAMs) to locate the object regions for pseudo label generation. However, CAMs can only discover the most discriminative parts of objects, thus leading to inferior pixel-level pseudo labels. To address this issue, we propose a saliency guided Inter- and Intra-Class Relation Constrained (I^2CRC) framework to assist the expansion of the activated object regions in CAMs. Specifically, we propose a saliency guided class-agnostic distance module to pull the intra-category features closer by aligning features to their class prototypes. Further, we propose a class-specific distance module to push the inter-class features apart and encourage the object region to have a higher activation than the background. Besides strengthening the capability of the classification network to activate more integral object regions in CAMs, we also introduce an object guided label refinement module to take a full use of both the segmentation prediction and the initial labels for obtaining superior pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 and COCO datasets demonstrate well the effectiveness of I^2CRC over other state-of-the-art counterparts. The source codes, models, and data have been made available at \url{https://github.com/NUST-Machine-Intelligence-Laboratory/I2CRC}."
3D Face Parsing via Surface Parameterization and 2D Semantic Segmentation Network,"Face parsing assigns pixel-wise semantic labels as the face representation for computers, which is the fundamental part of many advanced face technologies. Compared with 2D face parsing, 3D face parsing shows more potential to achieve better performance and further application, but it is still challenging due to 3D mesh data computation. Recent works introduced different methods for 3D surface segmentation, while the performance is still limited. In this paper, we propose a method based on the ""3D-2D-3D"" strategy to accomplish 3D face parsing. The topological disk-like 2D face image containing spatial and textural information is transformed from the sampled 3D face data through the face parameterization algorithm, and a specific 2D network called CPFNet is proposed to achieve the semantic segmentation of the 2D parameterized face data with multi-scale technologies and feature aggregation. The 2D semantic result is then inversely re-mapped to 3D face data, which finally achieves the 3D face parsing. Experimental results show that both CPFNet and the ""3D-2D-3D"" strategy accomplish high-quality 3D face parsing and outperform state-of-the-art 2D networks as well as 3D methods in both qualitative and quantitative comparisons."
Learning Implicit Feature Alignment Function for Semantic Segmentation,"Integrating high-level context information with low-level details is of central importance in semantic segmentation. Towards this end, most existing segmentation models apply bilinear up-sampling and convolutions to feature maps of different scales, and then align them at the same resolution. However, bilinear up-sampling blurs the precise information learned in these feature maps and convolutions incur extra computation costs. To address these issues, we propose the Implicit Feature Alignment function (IFA). Our method is inspired by the rapidly expanding topic of implicit neural representations, where coordinate-based neural networks are used to designate fields of signals. In IFA, feature vectors are viewed as representing a 2D field of information. Given a query coordinate, nearby feature vectors with their relative coordinates are taken from the multi-level feature maps and then fed into an MLP to generate the corresponding output. As such, IFA implicitly aligns the feature maps at different levels and is capable of producing segmentation maps in arbitrary resolutions. We demonstrate the efficacy of IFA on multiple datasets, including Cityscapes, PASCAL Context, and ADE20K. Our method can be combined with improvement on various architectures, and it achieves state-of-the-art computation-accuracy trade-off on common benchmarks. Code will be made available at https://github.com/hzhupku/IFA."
On Efficient Real-Time Semantic Segmentation: A Survey,"Semantic segmentation is the problem of assigning a class label to every pixel in an image, and is an important component of an autonomous vehicle vision stack for facilitating scene understanding and object detection. However, many of the top performing semantic segmentation models are extremely complex and cumbersome, and as such are not suited to deployment onboard autonomous vehicle platforms where computational resources are limited and low-latency operation is a vital requirement. In this survey, we take a thorough look at the works that aim to address this misalignment with more compact and efficient models capable of deployment on low-memory embedded systems while meeting the constraint of real-time inference. We discuss several of the most prominent works in the field, placing them within a taxonomy based on their major contributions, and finally we evaluate the inference speed of the discussed models under consistent hardware and software setups that represent a typical research environment with high-end GPU and a realistic deployed scenario using low-memory embedded GPU hardware. Our experimental results demonstrate that many works are capable of real-time performance on resource-constrained hardware, while illustrating the consistent trade-off between latency and accuracy."
Simple and Efficient Architectures for Semantic Segmentation,"Though the state-of-the architectures for semantic segmentation, such as HRNet, demonstrate impressive accuracy, the complexity arising from their salient design choices hinders a range of model acceleration tools, and further they make use of operations that are inefficient on current hardware. This paper demonstrates that a simple encoder-decoder architecture with a ResNet-like backbone and a small multi-scale head, performs on-par or better than complex semantic segmentation architectures such as HRNet, FANet and DDRNets. Naively applying deep backbones designed for Image Classification to the task of Semantic Segmentation leads to sub-par results, owing to a much smaller effective receptive field of these backbones. Implicit among the various design choices put forth in works like HRNet, DDRNet, and FANet are networks with a large effective receptive field. It is natural to ask if a simple encoder-decoder architecture would compare favorably if comprised of backbones that have a larger effective receptive field, though without the use of inefficient operations like dilated convolutions. We show that with minor and inexpensive modifications to ResNets, enlarging the receptive field, very simple and competitive baselines can be created for Semantic Segmentation. We present a family of such simple architectures for desktop as well as mobile targets, which match or exceed the performance of complex models on the Cityscapes dataset. We hope that our work provides simple yet effective baselines for practitioners to develop efficient semantic segmentation models."
Volumetric Supervised Contrastive Learning for Seismic Semantic Segmentation,"In seismic interpretation, pixel-level labels of various rock structures can be time-consuming and expensive to obtain. As a result, there oftentimes exists a non-trivial quantity of unlabeled data that is left unused simply because traditional deep learning methods rely on access to fully labeled volumes. To rectify this problem, contrastive learning approaches have been proposed that use a self-supervised methodology in order to learn useful representations from unlabeled data. However, traditional contrastive learning approaches are based on assumptions from the domain of natural images that do not make use of seismic context. In order to incorporate this context within contrastive learning, we propose a novel positive pair selection strategy based on the position of slices within a seismic volume. We show that the learnt representations from our method out-perform a state of the art contrastive learning methodology in a semantic segmentation task."
How to Reduce Change Detection to Semantic Segmentation,"Change detection (CD) aims to identify changes that occur in an image pair taken different times. Prior methods devise specific networks from scratch to predict change masks in pixel-level, and struggle with general segmentation problems. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm that reduces CD to semantic segmentation which means tailoring an existing and powerful semantic segmentation network to solve CD. This new paradigm conveniently enjoys the mainstream semantic segmentation techniques to deal with general segmentation problems in CD. Hence we can concentrate on studying how to detect changes. We propose a novel and importance insight that different change types exist in CD and they should be learned separately. Based on it, we devise a module named MTF to extract the change information and fuse temporal features. MTF enjoys high interpretability and reveals the essential characteristic of CD. And most segmentation networks can be adapted to solve the CD problems with our MTF module. Finally, we propose C-3PO, a network to detect changes at pixel-level. C-3PO achieves state-of-the-art performance without bells and whistles. It is simple but effective and can be considered as a new baseline in this field. Our code is at https://github.com/DoctorKey/C-3PO."
S^2-FPN: Scale-ware Strip Attention Guided Feature Pyramid Network for Real-time Semantic Segmentation,"Modern high-performance semantic segmentation methods employ a heavy backbone and dilated convolution to extract the relevant feature. Although extracting features with both contextual and semantic information is critical for the segmentation tasks, it brings a memory footprint and high computation cost for real-time applications. This paper presents a new model to achieve a trade-off between accuracy/speed for real-time road scene semantic segmentation. Specifically, we proposed a lightweight model named Scale-aware Strip Attention Guided Feature Pyramid Network (S^2-FPN). Our network consists of three main modules: Attention Pyramid Fusion (APF) module, Scale-aware Strip Attention Module (SSAM), and Global Feature Upsample (GFU) module. APF adopts an attention mechanisms to learn discriminative multi-scale features and help close the semantic gap between different levels. APF uses the scale-aware attention to encode global context with vertical stripping operation and models the long-range dependencies, which helps relate pixels with similar semantic label. In addition, APF employs channel-wise reweighting block (CRB) to emphasize the channel features. Finally, the decoder of S^2-FPN then adopts GFU, which is used to fuse features from APF and the encoder. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two challenging semantic segmentation benchmarks, which demonstrate that our approach achieves better accuracy/speed trade-off with different model settings. The proposed models have achieved a results of 76.2\%mIoU/87.3FPS, 77.4\%mIoU/67FPS, and 77.8\%mIoU/30.5FPS on Cityscapes dataset, and 69.6\%mIoU,71.0\% mIoU, and 74.2\% mIoU on Camvid dataset. The code for this work will be made available at \url{https://github.com/mohamedac29/S2-FPN"
Proximal Splitting Adversarial Attacks for Semantic Segmentation,"Classification has been the focal point of research on adversarial attacks, but only a few works investigate methods suited to denser prediction tasks, such as semantic segmentation. The methods proposed in these works do not accurately solve the adversarial segmentation problem and, therefore, overestimate the size of the perturbations required to fool models. Here, we propose a white-box attack for these models based on a proximal splitting to produce adversarial perturbations with much smaller \ell_\infty norms. Our attack can handle large numbers of constraints within a nonconvex minimization framework via an Augmented Lagrangian approach, coupled with adaptive constraint scaling and masking strategies. We demonstrate that our attack significantly outperforms previously proposed ones, as well as classification attacks that we adapted for segmentation, providing a first comprehensive benchmark for this dense task."
Discovering Object Masks with Transformers for Unsupervised Semantic Segmentation,"The task of unsupervised semantic segmentation aims to cluster pixels into semantically meaningful groups. Specifically, pixels assigned to the same cluster should share high-level semantic properties like their object or part category. This paper presents MaskDistill: a novel framework for unsupervised semantic segmentation based on three key ideas. First, we advocate a data-driven strategy to generate object masks that serve as a pixel grouping prior for semantic segmentation. This approach omits handcrafted priors, which are often designed for specific scene compositions and limit the applicability of competing frameworks. Second, MaskDistill clusters the object masks to obtain pseudo-ground-truth for training an initial object segmentation model. Third, we leverage this model to filter out low-quality object masks. This strategy mitigates the noise in our pixel grouping prior and results in a clean collection of masks which we use to train a final segmentation model. By combining these components, we can considerably outperform previous works for unsupervised semantic segmentation on PASCAL (+11% mIoU) and COCO (+4% mask AP50). Interestingly, as opposed to existing approaches, our framework does not latch onto low-level image cues and is not limited to object-centric datasets. The code and models will be made available."
Energy Consumption Analysis of pruned Semantic Segmentation Networks on an Embedded GPU,"Deep neural networks are the state of the art in many computer vision tasks. Their deployment in the context of autonomous vehicles is of particular interest, since their limitations in terms of energy consumption prohibit the use of very large networks, that typically reach the best performance. A common method to reduce the complexity of these architectures, without sacrificing accuracy, is to rely on pruning, in which the least important portions are eliminated. There is a large literature on the subject, but interestingly few works have measured the actual impact of pruning on energy. In this work, we are interested in measuring it in the specific context of semantic segmentation for autonomous driving, using the Cityscapes dataset. To this end, we analyze the impact of recently proposed structured pruning methods when trained architectures are deployed on a Jetson Xavier embedded GPU."
Access Control of Semantic Segmentation Models Using Encrypted Feature Maps,"In this paper, we propose an access control method with a secret key for semantic segmentation models for the first time so that unauthorized users without a secret key cannot benefit from the performance of trained models. The method enables us not only to provide a high segmentation performance to authorized users but to also degrade the performance for unauthorized users. We first point out that, for the application of semantic segmentation, conventional access control methods which use encrypted images for classification tasks are not directly applicable due to performance degradation. Accordingly, in this paper, selected feature maps are encrypted with a secret key for training and testing models, instead of input images. In an experiment, the protected models allowed authorized users to obtain almost the same performance as that of non-protected models but also with robustness against unauthorized access without a key."
Depth-Adapted CNNs for RGB-D Semantic Segmentation,"Recent RGB-D semantic segmentation has motivated research interest thanks to the accessibility of complementary modalities from the input side. Existing works often adopt a two-stream architecture that processes photometric and geometric information in parallel, with few methods explicitly leveraging the contribution of depth cues to adjust the sampling position on RGB images. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to incorporate the depth information in the RGB convolutional neural network (CNN), termed Z-ACN (Depth-Adapted CNN). Specifically, our Z-ACN generates a 2D depth-adapted offset which is fully constrained by low-level features to guide the feature extraction on RGB images. With the generated offset, we introduce two intuitive and effective operations to replace basic CNN operators: depth-adapted convolution and depth-adapted average pooling. Extensive experiments on both indoor and outdoor semantic segmentation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."
Point-to-Voxel Knowledge Distillation for LiDAR Semantic Segmentation,"This article addresses the problem of distilling knowledge from a large teacher model to a slim student network for LiDAR semantic segmentation. Directly employing previous distillation approaches yields inferior results due to the intrinsic challenges of point cloud, i.e., sparsity, randomness and varying density. To tackle the aforementioned problems, we propose the Point-to-Voxel Knowledge Distillation (PVD), which transfers the hidden knowledge from both point level and voxel level. Specifically, we first leverage both the pointwise and voxelwise output distillation to complement the sparse supervision signals. Then, to better exploit the structural information, we divide the whole point cloud into several supervoxels and design a difficulty-aware sampling strategy to more frequently sample supervoxels containing less-frequent classes and faraway objects. On these supervoxels, we propose inter-point and inter-voxel affinity distillation, where the similarity information between points and voxels can help the student model better capture the structural information of the surrounding environment. We conduct extensive experiments on two popular LiDAR segmentation benchmarks, i.e., nuScenes and SemanticKITTI. On both benchmarks, our PVD consistently outperforms previous distillation approaches by a large margin on three representative backbones, i.e., Cylinder3D, SPVNAS and MinkowskiNet. Notably, on the challenging nuScenes and SemanticKITTI datasets, our method can achieve roughly 75% MACs reduction and 2x speedup on the competitive Cylinder3D model and rank 1st on the SemanticKITTI leaderboard among all published algorithms. Our code is available at https://github.com/cardwing/Codes-for-PVKD."
PIDNet: A Real-time Semantic Segmentation Network Inspired by PID Controllers,"Two-branch network architecture has shown its efficiency and effectiveness in real-time semantic segmentation tasks. However, direct fusion of high-resolution details and low-frequency context has the drawback of detailed features being easily overwhelmed by surrounding contextual information. This overshoot phenomenon limits the improvement of the segmentation accuracy of existing two-branch models. In this paper, we make a connection between Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controllers and reveal that a two-branch network is equivalent to a Proportional-Integral (PI) controller, which inherently suffers from similar overshoot issues. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel three-branch network architecture: PIDNet, which contains three branches to parse detailed, context and boundary information, respectively, and employs boundary attention to guide the fusion of detailed and context branches. Our family of PIDNets achieve the best trade-off between inference speed and accuracy and their accuracy surpasses all the existing models with similar inference speed on the Cityscapes and CamVid datasets. Specifically, PIDNet-S achieves 78.6% mIOU with inference speed of 93.2 FPS on Cityscapes and 80.1% mIOU with speed of 153.7 FPS on CamVid."
Box2Mask: Weakly Supervised 3D Semantic Instance Segmentation Using Bounding Boxes,"Current 3D segmentation methods heavily rely on large-scale point-cloud datasets, which are notoriously laborious to annotate. Few attempts have been made to circumvent the need for dense per-point annotations. In this work, we look at weakly-supervised 3D semantic instance segmentation. The key idea is to leverage 3D bounding box labels which are easier and faster to annotate. Indeed, we show that it is possible to train dense segmentation models using only bounding box labels. At the core of our method, \name{}, lies a deep model, inspired by classical Hough voting, that directly votes for bounding box parameters, and a clustering method specifically tailored to bounding box votes. This goes beyond commonly used center votes, which would not fully exploit the bounding box annotations. On ScanNet test, our weakly supervised model attains leading performance among other weakly supervised approaches (+18 mAP@50). Remarkably, it also achieves 97% of the mAP@50 score of current fully supervised models. To further illustrate the practicality of our work, we train Box2Mask on the recently released ARKitScenes dataset which is annotated with 3D bounding boxes only, and show, for the first time, compelling 3D instance segmentation masks."
A Dual-fusion Semantic Segmentation Framework With GAN For SAR Images,"Deep learning based semantic segmentation is one of the popular methods in remote sensing image segmentation. In this paper, a network based on the widely used encoderdecoder architecture is proposed to accomplish the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images segmentation. With the better representation capability of optical images, we propose to enrich SAR images with generated optical images via the generative adversative network (GAN) trained by numerous SAR and optical images. These optical images can be used as expansions of original SAR images, thus ensuring robust result of segmentation. Then the optical images generated by the GAN are stitched together with the corresponding real images. An attention module following the stitched data is used to strengthen the representation of the objects. Experiments indicate that our method is efficient compared to other commonly used methods"
"Amodal Cityscapes: A New Dataset, its Generation, and an Amodal Semantic Segmentation Challenge Baseline","Amodal perception terms the ability of humans to imagine the entire shapes of occluded objects. This gives humans an advantage to keep track of everything that is going on, especially in crowded situations. Typical perception functions, however, lack amodal perception abilities and are therefore at a disadvantage in situations with occlusions. Complex urban driving scenarios often experience many different types of occlusions and, therefore, amodal perception for automated vehicles is an important task to investigate. In this paper, we consider the task of amodal semantic segmentation and propose a generic way to generate datasets to train amodal semantic segmentation methods. We use this approach to generate an amodal Cityscapes dataset. Moreover, we propose and evaluate a method as baseline on Amodal Cityscapes, showing its applicability for amodal semantic segmentation in automotive environment perception. We provide the means to re-generate this dataset on github."
Labeling Where Adapting Fails: Cross-Domain Semantic Segmentation with Point Supervision via Active Selection,"Training models dedicated to semantic segmentation requires a large amount of pixel-wise annotated data. Due to their costly nature, these annotations might not be available for the task at hand. To alleviate this problem, unsupervised domain adaptation approaches aim at aligning the feature distributions between the labeled source and the unlabeled target data. While these strategies lead to noticeable improvements, their effectiveness remains limited. To guide the domain adaptation task more efficiently, previous works attempted to include human interactions in this process under the form of sparse single-pixel annotations in the target data. In this work, we propose a new domain adaptation framework for semantic segmentation with annotated points via active selection. First, we conduct an unsupervised domain adaptation of the model; from this adaptation, we use an entropy-based uncertainty measurement for target points selection. Finally, to minimize the domain gap, we propose a domain adaptation framework utilizing these target points annotated by human annotators. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of our methods against existing unsupervised domain adaptation approaches. The propose pipeline is generic and can be included as an extra module to existing domain adaptation strategies."
Calibrated Bagging Deep Learning for Image Semantic Segmentation: A Case Study on COVID-19 Chest X-ray Image,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Imaging tests such as chest X-ray (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) can provide useful information to clinical staff for facilitating a diagnosis of COVID-19 in a more efficient and comprehensive manner. As a breakthrough of artificial intelligence (AI), deep learning has been applied to perform COVID-19 infection region segmentation and disease classification by analyzing CXR and CT data. However, prediction uncertainty of deep learning models for these tasks, which is very important to safety-critical applications like medical image processing, has not been comprehensively investigated. In this work, we propose a novel ensemble deep learning model through integrating bagging deep learning and model calibration to not only enhance segmentation performance, but also reduce prediction uncertainty. The proposed method has been validated on a large dataset that is associated with CXR image segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can improve the segmentation performance, as well as decrease prediction uncertainties."
Co-Training for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation of Semantic Segmentation Models,"Semantic image segmentation is a central and challenging task in autonomous driving, addressed by training deep models. Since this training draws to a curse of human-based image labeling, using synthetic images with automatically generated labels together with unlabeled real-world images is a promising alternative. This implies to address an unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) problem. In this paper, we propose a new co-training procedure for synth-to-real UDA of semantic segmentation models. It consists of a self-training stage, which provides two domain-adapted models, and a model collaboration loop for the mutual improvement of these two models. These models are then used to provide the final semantic segmentation labels (pseudo-labels) for the real-world images. The overall procedure treats the deep models as black boxes and drives their collaboration at the level of pseudo-labeled target images, i.e., neither modifying loss functions is required, nor explicit feature alignment. We test our proposal on standard synthetic and real-world datasets for on-board semantic segmentation. Our procedure shows improvements ranging from ~13 to ~26 mIoU points over baselines, so establishing new state-of-the-art results."
MVMO: A Multi-Object Dataset for Wide Baseline Multi-View Semantic Segmentation,"We present MVMO (Multi-View, Multi-Object dataset): a synthetic dataset of 116,000 scenes containing randomly placed objects of 10 distinct classes and captured from 25 camera locations in the upper hemisphere. MVMO comprises photorealistic, path-traced image renders, together with semantic segmentation ground truth for every view. Unlike existing multi-view datasets, MVMO features wide baselines between cameras and high density of objects, which lead to large disparities, heavy occlusions and view-dependent object appearance. Single view semantic segmentation is hindered by self and inter-object occlusions that could benefit from additional viewpoints. Therefore, we expect that MVMO will propel research in multi-view semantic segmentation and cross-view semantic transfer. We also provide baselines that show that new research is needed in such fields to exploit the complementary information of multi-view setups."
EfficientViT: Lightweight Multi-Scale Attention for On-Device Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation enables many appealing real-world applications, such as computational photography, autonomous driving, etc. However, the vast computational cost makes deploying state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models on edge devices with limited hardware resources difficult. This work presents EfficientViT, a new family of semantic segmentation models with a novel lightweight multi-scale attention for on-device semantic segmentation. Unlike prior semantic segmentation models that rely on heavy self-attention, hardware-inefficient large-kernel convolution, or complicated topology structure to obtain good performances, our lightweight multi-scale attention achieves a global receptive field and multi-scale learning (two critical features for semantic segmentation models) with only lightweight and hardware-efficient operations. As such, EfficientViT delivers remarkable performance gains over previous state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models across popular benchmark datasets with significant speedup on the mobile platform. Without performance loss on Cityscapes, our EfficientViT provides up to 15x and 9.3x mobile latency reduction over SegFormer and SegNeXt, respectively. Maintaining the same mobile latency, EfficientViT provides +7.4 mIoU gain on ADE20K over SegNeXt. Code: https://github.com/mit-han-lab/efficientvit."
Efficient textual explanations for complex road and traffic scenarios based on semantic segmentation,"The complex driving environment brings great challenges to the visual perception of autonomous vehicles. It's essential to extract clear and explainable information from the complex road and traffic scenarios and offer clues to decision and control. However, the previous scene explanation had been implemented as a separate model. The black box model makes it difficult to interpret the driving environment. It cannot detect comprehensive textual information and requires a high computational load and time consumption. Thus, this study proposed a comprehensive and efficient textual explanation model. From 336k video frames of the driving environment, critical images of complex road and traffic scenarios were selected into a dataset. Through transfer learning, this study established an accurate and efficient segmentation model to obtain the critical traffic elements in the environment. Based on the XGBoost algorithm, a comprehensive model was developed. The model provided textual information about states of traffic elements, the motion of conflict objects, and scenario complexity. The approach was verified on the real-world road. It improved the perception accuracy of critical traffic elements to 78.8%. The time consumption reached 13 minutes for each epoch, which was 11.5 times more efficient than the pre-trained network. The textual information analyzed from the model was also accordant with reality. The findings offer clear and explainable information about the complex driving environment, which lays a foundation for subsequent decision and control. It can improve the visual perception ability and enrich the prior knowledge and judgments of complex traffic situations."
Deep Sensor Fusion with Pyramid Fusion Networks for 3D Semantic Segmentation,"Robust environment perception for autonomous vehicles is a tremendous challenge, which makes a diverse sensor set with e.g. camera, lidar and radar crucial. In the process of understanding the recorded sensor data, 3D semantic segmentation plays an important role. Therefore, this work presents a pyramid-based deep fusion architecture for lidar and camera to improve 3D semantic segmentation of traffic scenes. Individual sensor backbones extract feature maps of camera images and lidar point clouds. A novel Pyramid Fusion Backbone fuses these feature maps at different scales and combines the multimodal features in a feature pyramid to compute valuable multimodal, multi-scale features. The Pyramid Fusion Head aggregates these pyramid features and further refines them in a late fusion step, incorporating the final features of the sensor backbones. The approach is evaluated on two challenging outdoor datasets and different fusion strategies and setups are investigated. It outperforms recent range view based lidar approaches as well as all so far proposed fusion strategies and architectures."
SemAffiNet: Semantic-Affine Transformation for Point Cloud Segmentation,"Conventional point cloud semantic segmentation methods usually employ an encoder-decoder architecture, where mid-level features are locally aggregated to extract geometric information. However, the over-reliance on these class-agnostic local geometric representations may raise confusion between local parts from different categories that are similar in appearance or spatially adjacent. To address this issue, we argue that mid-level features can be further enhanced with semantic information, and propose semantic-affine transformation that transforms features of mid-level points belonging to different categories with class-specific affine parameters. Based on this technique, we propose SemAffiNet for point cloud semantic segmentation, which utilizes the attention mechanism in the Transformer module to implicitly and explicitly capture global structural knowledge within local parts for overall comprehension of each category. We conduct extensive experiments on the ScanNetV2 and NYUv2 datasets, and evaluate semantic-affine transformation on various 3D point cloud and 2D image segmentation baselines, where both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the superiority and generalization ability of our proposed approach. Code is available at https://github.com/wangzy22/SemAffiNet."
Semantic Segmentation for Thermal Images: A Comparative Survey,"Semantic segmentation is a challenging task since it requires excessively more low-level spatial information of the image compared to other computer vision problems. The accuracy of pixel-level classification can be affected by many factors, such as imaging limitations and the ambiguity of object boundaries in an image. Conventional methods exploit three-channel RGB images captured in the visible spectrum with deep neural networks (DNN). Thermal images can significantly contribute during the segmentation since thermal imaging cameras are capable of capturing details despite the weather and illumination conditions. Using infrared spectrum in semantic segmentation has many real-world use cases, such as autonomous driving, medical imaging, agriculture, defense industry, etc. Due to this wide range of use cases, designing accurate semantic segmentation algorithms with the help of infrared spectrum is an important challenge. One approach is to use both visible and infrared spectrum images as inputs. These methods can accomplish higher accuracy due to enriched input information, with the cost of extra effort for the alignment and processing of multiple inputs. Another approach is to use only thermal images, enabling less hardware cost for smaller use cases. Even though there are multiple surveys on semantic segmentation methods, the literature lacks a comprehensive survey centered explicitly around semantic segmentation using infrared spectrum. This work aims to fill this gap by presenting algorithms in the literature and categorizing them by their input images."
Decoder Denoising Pretraining for Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation labels are expensive and time consuming to acquire. Hence, pretraining is commonly used to improve the label-efficiency of segmentation models. Typically, the encoder of a segmentation model is pretrained as a classifier and the decoder is randomly initialized. Here, we argue that random initialization of the decoder can be suboptimal, especially when few labeled examples are available. We propose a decoder pretraining approach based on denoising, which can be combined with supervised pretraining of the encoder. We find that decoder denoising pretraining on the ImageNet dataset strongly outperforms encoder-only supervised pretraining. Despite its simplicity, decoder denoising pretraining achieves state-of-the-art results on label-efficient semantic segmentation and offers considerable gains on the Cityscapes, Pascal Context, and ADE20K datasets."
Enhanced Prototypical Learning for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation in LiDAR Semantic Segmentation,"Despite its importance, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) on LiDAR semantic segmentation is a task that has not received much attention from the research community. Only recently, a completion-based 3D method has been proposed to tackle the problem and formally set up the adaptive scenarios. However, the proposed pipeline is complex, voxel-based and requires multi-stage inference, which inhibits it for real-time inference. We propose a range image-based, effective and efficient method for solving UDA on LiDAR segmentation. The method exploits class prototypes from the source domain to pseudo label target domain pixels, which is a research direction showing good performance in UDA for natural image semantic segmentation. Applying such approaches to LiDAR scans has not been considered because of the severe domain shift and lack of pre-trained feature extractor that is unavailable in the LiDAR segmentation setup. However, we show that proper strategies, including reconstruction-based pre-training, enhanced prototypes, and selective pseudo labeling based on distance to prototypes, is sufficient enough to enable the use of prototypical approaches. We evaluate the performance of our method on the recently proposed LiDAR segmentation UDA scenarios. Our method achieves remarkable performance among contemporary methods."
Continual Barlow Twins: continual self-supervised learning for remote sensing semantic segmentation,"In the field of Earth Observation (EO), Continual Learning (CL) algorithms have been proposed to deal with large datasets by decomposing them into several subsets and processing them incrementally. The majority of these algorithms assume that data is (a) coming from a single source, and (b) fully labeled. Real-world EO datasets are instead characterized by a large heterogeneity (e.g., coming from aerial, satellite, or drone scenarios), and for the most part they are unlabeled, meaning they can be fully exploited only through the emerging Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) paradigm. For these reasons, in this paper we propose a new algorithm for merging SSL and CL for remote sensing applications, that we call Continual Barlow Twins (CBT). It combines the advantages of one of the simplest self-supervision techniques, i.e., Barlow Twins, with the Elastic Weight Consolidation method to avoid catastrophic forgetting. In addition, for the first time we evaluate SSL methods on a highly heterogeneous EO dataset, showing the effectiveness of these strategies on a novel combination of three almost non-overlapping domains datasets (airborne Potsdam dataset, satellite US3D dataset, and drone UAVid dataset), on a crucial downstream task in EO, i.e., semantic segmentation. Encouraging results show the superiority of SSL in this setting, and the effectiveness of creating an incremental effective pretrained feature extractor, based on ResNet50, without the need of relying on the complete availability of all the data, with a valuable saving of time and resources."
Active Domain Adaptation with Multi-level Contrastive Units for Semantic Segmentation,"To further reduce the cost of semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) labeling, a more effective way is to use active learning (AL) to annotate a selected subset with specific properties. However, domain adaptation tasks are always addressed in two interactive aspects: domain transfer and the enhancement of discrimination, which requires the selected data to be both uncertain under the model and diverse in feature space. Contrary to active learning in classification tasks, it is usually challenging to select pixels that contain both the above properties in segmentation tasks, leading to the complex design of pixel selection strategy. To address such an issue, we propose a novel Active Domain Adaptation scheme with Multi-level Contrastive Units (ADA-MCU) for semantic image segmentation. A simple pixel selection strategy followed with the construction of multi-level contrastive units is introduced to optimize the model for both domain adaptation and active supervised learning. In practice, MCUs are constructed from intra-image, cross-image, and cross-domain levels by using both labeled and unlabeled pixels. At each level, we define contrastive losses from center-to-center and pixel-to-pixel manners, with the aim of jointly aligning the category centers and reducing outliers near the decision boundaries. In addition, we also introduce a categories correlation matrix to implicitly describe the relationship between categories, which are used to adjust the weights of the losses for MCUs. Extensive experimental results on standard benchmarks show that the proposed method achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art SSDA methods with 50% fewer labeled pixels and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art with a large margin by using the same level of annotation cost."
On the Feasibility and Generality of Patch-based Adversarial Attacks on Semantic Segmentation Problems,"Deep neural networks were applied with success in a myriad of applications, but in safety critical use cases adversarial attacks still pose a significant threat. These attacks were demonstrated on various classification and detection tasks and are usually considered general in a sense that arbitrary network outputs can be generated by them.  In this paper we will demonstrate through simple case studies both in simulation and in real-life, that patch based attacks can be utilised to alter the output of segmentation networks. Through a few examples and the investigation of network complexity, we will also demonstrate that the number of possible output maps which can be generated via patch-based attacks of a given size is typically smaller than the area they effect or areas which should be attacked in case of practical applications.  We will prove that based on these results most patch-based attacks cannot be general in practice, namely they can not generate arbitrary output maps or if they could, they are spatially limited and this limit is significantly smaller than the receptive field of the patches."
UCC: Uncertainty guided Cross-head Co-training for Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) have witnessed great successes in semantic segmentation, which requires a large number of labeled data for training. We present a novel learning framework called Uncertainty guided Cross-head Co-training (UCC) for semi-supervised semantic segmentation. Our framework introduces weak and strong augmentations within a shared encoder to achieve co-training, which naturally combines the benefits of consistency and self-training. Every segmentation head interacts with its peers and, the weak augmentation result is used for supervising the strong. The consistency training samples' diversity can be boosted by Dynamic Cross-Set Copy-Paste (DCSCP), which also alleviates the distribution mismatch and class imbalance problems. Moreover, our proposed Uncertainty Guided Re-weight Module (UGRM) enhances the self-training pseudo labels by suppressing the effect of the low-quality pseudo labels from its peer via modeling uncertainty. Extensive experiments on Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC 2012 demonstrate the effectiveness of our UCC. Our approach significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art semi-supervised semantic segmentation methods. It achieves 77.17\%, 76.49\% mIoU on Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC 2012 datasets respectively under 1/16 protocols, which are +10.1\%, +7.91\% better than the supervised baseline."
Light In The Black: An Evaluation of Data Augmentation Techniques for COVID-19 CT's Semantic Segmentation,"With the COVID-19 global pandemic, computer-assisted diagnoses of medical images have gained much attention, and robust methods of Semantic Segmentation of Computed Tomography (CT) became highly desirable. Semantic Segmentation of CT is one of many research fields of automatic detection of COVID-19 and has been widely explored since the COVID-19 outbreak. In this work, we propose an extensive analysis of how different data augmentation techniques improve the training of encoder-decoder neural networks on this problem. Twenty different data augmentation techniques were evaluated on five different datasets. Each dataset was validated through a five-fold cross-validation strategy, thus resulting in over 3,000 experiments. Our findings show that spatial level transformations are the most promising to improve the learning of neural networks on this problem."
blob loss: instance imbalance aware loss functions for semantic segmentation,"Deep convolutional neural networks have proven to be remarkably effective in semantic segmentation tasks. Most popular loss functions were introduced targeting improved volumetric scores, such as the Sorensen Dice coefficient. By design, DSC can tackle class imbalance; however, it does not recognize instance imbalance within a class. As a result, a large foreground instance can dominate minor instances and still produce a satisfactory Sorensen Dice coefficient. Nevertheless, missing out on instances will lead to poor detection performance. This represents a critical issue in applications such as disease progression monitoring. For example, it is imperative to locate and surveil small-scale lesions in the follow-up of multiple sclerosis patients. We propose a novel family of loss functions, nicknamed blob loss, primarily aimed at maximizing instance-level detection metrics, such as F1 score and sensitivity. Blob loss is designed for semantic segmentation problems in which the instances are the connected components within a class. We extensively evaluate a DSC-based blob loss in five complex 3D semantic segmentation tasks featuring pronounced instance heterogeneity in terms of texture and morphology. Compared to soft Dice loss, we achieve 5 percent improvement for MS lesions, 3 percent improvement for liver tumor, and an average 2 percent improvement for Microscopy segmentation tasks considering F1 score."
Region-Aware Metric Learning for Open World Semantic Segmentation via Meta-Channel Aggregation,"As one of the most challenging and practical segmentation tasks, open-world semantic segmentation requires the model to segment the anomaly regions in the images and incrementally learn to segment out-of-distribution (OOD) objects, especially under a few-shot condition. The current state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, Deep Metric Learning Network (DMLNet), relies on pixel-level metric learning, with which the identification of similar regions having different semantics is difficult. Therefore, we propose a method called region-aware metric learning (RAML), which first separates the regions of the images and generates region-aware features for further metric learning. RAML improves the integrity of the segmented anomaly regions. Moreover, we propose a novel meta-channel aggregation (MCA) module to further separate anomaly regions, forming high-quality sub-region candidates and thereby improving the model performance for OOD objects. To evaluate the proposed RAML, we have conducted extensive experiments and ablation studies on Lost And Found and Road Anomaly datasets for anomaly segmentation and the CityScapes dataset for incremental few-shot learning. The results show that the proposed RAML achieves SOTA performance in both stages of open world segmentation. Our code and appendix are available at https://github.com/czifan/RAML."
Deep Spectral Methods: A Surprisingly Strong Baseline for Unsupervised Semantic Segmentation and Localization,"Unsupervised localization and segmentation are long-standing computer vision challenges that involve decomposing an image into semantically-meaningful segments without any labeled data. These tasks are particularly interesting in an unsupervised setting due to the difficulty and cost of obtaining dense image annotations, but existing unsupervised approaches struggle with complex scenes containing multiple objects. Differently from existing methods, which are purely based on deep learning, we take inspiration from traditional spectral segmentation methods by reframing image decomposition as a graph partitioning problem. Specifically, we examine the eigenvectors of the Laplacian of a feature affinity matrix from self-supervised networks. We find that these eigenvectors already decompose an image into meaningful segments, and can be readily used to localize objects in a scene. Furthermore, by clustering the features associated with these segments across a dataset, we can obtain well-delineated, nameable regions, i.e. semantic segmentations. Experiments on complex datasets (Pascal VOC, MS-COCO) demonstrate that our simple spectral method outperforms the state-of-the-art in unsupervised localization and segmentation by a significant margin. Furthermore, our method can be readily used for a variety of complex image editing tasks, such as background removal and compositing."
Real-time semantic segmentation on FPGAs for autonomous vehicles with hls4ml,"In this paper, we investigate how field programmable gate arrays can serve as hardware accelerators for real-time semantic segmentation tasks relevant for autonomous driving. Considering compressed versions of the ENet convolutional neural network architecture, we demonstrate a fully-on-chip deployment with a latency of 4.9 ms per image, using less than 30% of the available resources on a Xilinx ZCU102 evaluation board. The latency is reduced to 3 ms per image when increasing the batch size to ten, corresponding to the use case where the autonomous vehicle receives inputs from multiple cameras simultaneously. We show, through aggressive filter reduction and heterogeneous quantization-aware training, and an optimized implementation of convolutional layers, that the power consumption and resource utilization can be significantly reduced while maintaining accuracy on the Cityscapes dataset."
Transformer Scale Gate for Semantic Segmentation,"Effectively encoding multi-scale contextual information is crucial for accurate semantic segmentation. Existing transformer-based segmentation models combine features across scales without any selection, where features on sub-optimal scales may degrade segmentation outcomes. Leveraging from the inherent properties of Vision Transformers, we propose a simple yet effective module, Transformer Scale Gate (TSG), to optimally combine multi-scale features.TSG exploits cues in self and cross attentions in Vision Transformers for the scale selection. TSG is a highly flexible plug-and-play module, and can easily be incorporated with any encoder-decoder-based hierarchical vision Transformer architecture. Extensive experiments on the Pascal Context and ADE20K datasets demonstrate that our feature selection strategy achieves consistent gains."
Learning Non-target Knowledge for Few-shot Semantic Segmentation,"Existing studies in few-shot semantic segmentation only focus on mining the target object information, however, often are hard to tell ambiguous regions, especially in non-target regions, which include background (BG) and Distracting Objects (DOs). To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel framework, namely Non-Target Region Eliminating (NTRE) network, to explicitly mine and eliminate BG and DO regions in the query. First, a BG Mining Module (BGMM) is proposed to extract the BG region via learning a general BG prototype. To this end, we design a BG loss to supervise the learning of BGMM only using the known target object segmentation ground truth. Then, a BG Eliminating Module and a DO Eliminating Module are proposed to successively filter out the BG and DO information from the query feature, based on which we can obtain a BG and DO-free target object segmentation result. Furthermore, we propose a prototypical contrastive learning algorithm to improve the model ability of distinguishing the target object from DOs. Extensive experiments on both PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i datasets show that our approach is effective despite its simplicity."
STDC-MA Network for Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation is applied extensively in autonomous driving and intelligent transportation with methods that highly demand spatial and semantic information. Here, an STDC-MA network is proposed to meet these demands. First, the STDC-Seg structure is employed in STDC-MA to ensure a lightweight and efficient structure. Subsequently, the feature alignment module (FAM) is applied to understand the offset between high-level and low-level features, solving the problem of pixel offset related to upsampling on the high-level feature map. Our approach implements the effective fusion between high-level features and low-level features. A hierarchical multiscale attention mechanism is adopted to reveal the relationship among attention regions from two different input sizes of one image. Through this relationship, regions receiving much attention are integrated into the segmentation results, thereby reducing the unfocused regions of the input image and improving the effective utilization of multiscale features. STDC- MA maintains the segmentation speed as an STDC-Seg network while improving the segmentation accuracy of small objects. STDC-MA was verified on the verification set of Cityscapes. The segmentation result of STDC-MA attained 76.81% mIOU with the input of 0.5x scale, 3.61% higher than STDC-Seg."
Mixed-UNet: Refined Class Activation Mapping for Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation with Multi-scale Inference,"Deep learning techniques have shown great potential in medical image processing, particularly through accurate and reliable image segmentation on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans or computed tomography (CT) scans, which allow the localization and diagnosis of lesions. However, training these segmentation models requires a large number of manually annotated pixel-level labels, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive, in contrast to image-level labels that are easier to obtain. It is imperative to resolve this problem through weakly-supervised semantic segmentation models using image-level labels as supervision since it can significantly reduce human annotation efforts. Most of the advanced solutions exploit class activation mapping (CAM). However, the original CAMs rarely capture the precise boundaries of lesions. In this study, we propose the strategy of multi-scale inference to refine CAMs by reducing the detail loss in single-scale reasoning. For segmentation, we develop a novel model named Mixed-UNet, which has two parallel branches in the decoding phase. The results can be obtained after fusing the extracted features from two branches. We evaluate the designed Mixed-UNet against several prevalent deep learning-based segmentation approaches on our dataset collected from the local hospital and public datasets. The validation results demonstrate that our model surpasses available methods under the same supervision level in the segmentation of various lesions from brain imaging."
Improved-Flow Warp Module for Remote Sensing Semantic Segmentation,"Remote sensing semantic segmentation aims to assign automatically each pixel on aerial images with specific label. In this letter, we proposed a new module, called improved-flow warp module (IFWM), to adjust semantic feature maps across different scales for remote sensing semantic segmentation. The improved-flow warp module is applied along with the feature extraction process in the convolutional neural network. First, IFWM computes the offsets of pixels by a learnable way, which can alleviate the misalignment of the multi-scale features. Second, the offsets help with the low-resolution deep feature up-sampling process to improve the feature accordance, which boosts the accuracy of semantic segmentation. We validate our method on several remote sensing datasets, and the results prove the effectiveness of our method.."
Distilling Inter-Class Distance for Semantic Segmentation,"Knowledge distillation is widely adopted in semantic segmentation to reduce the computation cost.The previous knowledge distillation methods for semantic segmentation focus on pixel-wise feature alignment and intra-class feature variation distillation, neglecting to transfer the knowledge of the inter-class distance in the feature space, which is important for semantic segmentation. To address this issue, we propose an Inter-class Distance Distillation (IDD) method to transfer the inter-class distance in the feature space from the teacher network to the student network. Furthermore, semantic segmentation is a position-dependent task,thus we exploit a position information distillation module to help the student network encode more position information. Extensive experiments on three popular datasets: Cityscapes, Pascal VOC and ADE20K show that our method is helpful to improve the accuracy of semantic segmentation models and achieves the state-of-the-art performance. E.g. it boosts the benchmark model(""PSPNet+ResNet18"") by 7.50% in accuracy on the Cityscapes dataset."
Automatic Velocity Picking Using a Multi-Information Fusion Deep Semantic Segmentation Network,"Velocity picking, a critical step in seismic data processing, has been studied for decades. Although manual picking can produce accurate normal moveout (NMO) velocities from the velocity spectra of prestack gathers, it is time-consuming and becomes infeasible with the emergence of large amount of seismic data. Numerous automatic velocity picking methods have thus been developed. In recent years, deep learning (DL) methods have produced good results on the seismic data with medium and high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). Unfortunately, it still lacks a picking method to automatically generate accurate velocities in the situations of low SNR. In this paper, we propose a multi-information fusion network (MIFN) to estimate stacking velocity from the fusion information of velocity spectra and stack gather segments (SGS). In particular, we transform the velocity picking problem into a semantic segmentation problem based on the velocity spectrum images. Meanwhile, the information provided by SGS is used as a prior in the network to assist segmentation. The experimental results on two field datasets show that the picking results of MIFN are stable and accurate for the scenarios with medium and high SNR, and it also performs well in low SNR scenarios."
Semantics-Guided Moving Object Segmentation with 3D LiDAR,"Moving object segmentation (MOS) is a task to distinguish moving objects, e.g., moving vehicles and pedestrians, from the surrounding static environment. The segmentation accuracy of MOS can have an influence on odometry, map construction, and planning tasks. In this paper, we propose a semantics-guided convolutional neural network for moving object segmentation. The network takes sequential LiDAR range images as inputs. Instead of segmenting the moving objects directly, the network conducts single-scan-based semantic segmentation and multiple-scan-based moving object segmentation in turn. The semantic segmentation module provides semantic priors for the MOS module, where we propose an adjacent scan association (ASA) module to convert the semantic features of adjacent scans into the same coordinate system to fully exploit the cross-scan semantic features. Finally, by analyzing the difference between the transformed features, reliable MOS result can be obtained quickly. Experimental results on the SemanticKITTI MOS dataset proves the effectiveness of our work."
Cross-view Transformers for real-time Map-view Semantic Segmentation,"We present cross-view transformers, an efficient attention-based model for map-view semantic segmentation from multiple cameras. Our architecture implicitly learns a mapping from individual camera views into a canonical map-view representation using a camera-aware cross-view attention mechanism. Each camera uses positional embeddings that depend on its intrinsic and extrinsic calibration. These embeddings allow a transformer to learn the mapping across different views without ever explicitly modeling it geometrically. The architecture consists of a convolutional image encoder for each view and cross-view transformer layers to infer a map-view semantic segmentation. Our model is simple, easily parallelizable, and runs in real-time. The presented architecture performs at state-of-the-art on the nuScenes dataset, with 4x faster inference speeds. Code is available at https://github.com/bradyz/cross_view_transformers."
Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation using Multi Scale Sparse Convolution Neural Network,"In recent years, with the development of computing resources and LiDAR, point cloud semantic segmentation has attracted many researchers. For the sparsity of point clouds, although there is already a way to deal with sparse convolution, multi-scale features are not considered. In this letter, we propose a feature extraction module based on multi-scale sparse convolution and a feature selection module based on channel attention and build a point cloud segmentation network framework based on this. By introducing multi-scale sparse convolution, the network could capture richer feature information based on convolution kernels with different sizes, improving the segmentation result of point cloud segmentation. Experimental results on Stanford large-scale 3-D Indoor Spaces(S3DIS) dataset and outdoor dataset(SemanticKITTI), demonstrate effectiveness and superiority of the proposed mothod."
"Multitask Network for Joint Object Detection, Semantic Segmentation and Human Pose Estimation in Vehicle Occupancy Monitoring","In order to ensure safe autonomous driving, precise information about the conditions in and around the vehicle must be available. Accordingly, the monitoring of occupants and objects inside the vehicle is crucial. In the state-of-the-art, single or multiple deep neural networks are used for either object recognition, semantic segmentation, or human pose estimation. In contrast, we propose our Multitask Detection, Segmentation and Pose Estimation Network (MDSP) -- the first multitask network solving all these three tasks jointly in the area of occupancy monitoring. Due to the shared architecture, memory and computing costs can be saved while achieving higher accuracy. Furthermore, our architecture allows a flexible combination of the three mentioned tasks during a simple end-to-end training. We perform comprehensive evaluations on the public datasets SVIRO and TiCaM in order to demonstrate the superior performance."
One Weird Trick to Improve Your Semi-Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation Model,"Semi-weakly supervised semantic segmentation (SWSSS) aims to train a model to identify objects in images based on a small number of images with pixel-level labels, and many more images with only image-level labels. Most existing SWSSS algorithms extract pixel-level pseudo-labels from an image classifier - a very difficult task to do well, hence requiring complicated architectures and extensive hyperparameter tuning on fully-supervised validation sets. We propose a method called prediction filtering, which instead of extracting pseudo-labels, just uses the classifier as a classifier: it ignores any segmentation predictions from classes which the classifier is confident are not present. Adding this simple post-processing method to baselines gives results competitive with or better than prior SWSSS algorithms. Moreover, it is compatible with pseudo-label methods: adding prediction filtering to existing SWSSS algorithms further improves segmentation performance."
Cross-Domain Correlation Distillation for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation in Nighttime Semantic Segmentation,"The performance of nighttime semantic segmentation is restricted by the poor illumination and a lack of pixel-wise annotation, which severely limit its application in autonomous driving. Existing works, e.g., using the twilight as the intermediate target domain to perform the adaptation from daytime to nighttime, may fail to cope with the inherent difference between datasets caused by the camera equipment and the urban style. Faced with these two types of domain shifts, i.e., the illumination and the inherent difference of the datasets, we propose a novel domain adaptation framework via cross-domain correlation distillation, called CCDistill. The invariance of illumination or inherent difference between two images is fully explored so as to make up for the lack of labels for nighttime images. Specifically, we extract the content and style knowledge contained in features, calculate the degree of inherent or illumination difference between two images. The domain adaptation is achieved using the invariance of the same kind of difference. Extensive experiments on Dark Zurich and ACDC demonstrate that CCDistill achieves the state-of-the-art performance for nighttime semantic segmentation. Notably, our method is a one-stage domain adaptation network which can avoid affecting the inference time. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/ghuan99/CCDistill."
Source Domain Subset Sampling for Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation in Semantic Segmentation,"In this paper, we introduce source domain subset sampling (SDSS) as a new perspective of semi-supervised domain adaptation. We propose domain adaptation by sampling and exploiting only a meaningful subset from source data for training. Our key assumption is that the entire source domain data may contain samples that are unhelpful for the adaptation. Therefore, the domain adaptation can benefit from a subset of source data composed solely of helpful and relevant samples. The proposed method effectively subsamples full source data to generate a small-scale meaningful subset. Therefore, training time is reduced, and performance is improved with our subsampled source data. To further verify the scalability of our method, we construct a new dataset called Ocean Ship, which comprises 500 real and 200K synthetic sample images with ground-truth labels. The SDSS achieved a state-of-the-art performance when applied on GTA5 to Cityscapes and SYNTHIA to Cityscapes public benchmark datasets and a 9.13 mIoU improvement on our Ocean Ship dataset over a baseline model."
Elucidating Meta-Structures of Noisy Labels in Semantic Segmentation by Deep Neural Networks,"Supervised training of deep neural networks (DNNs) by noisy labels has been studied extensively in image classification but much less in image segmentation. Our understanding of the learning behavior of DNNs trained by noisy segmentation labels remains limited. We address this deficiency in both binary segmentation of biological microscopy images and multi-class segmentation of natural images. We classify segmentation labels according to their noise transition matrices (NTMs) and compare performance of DNNs trained by different types of labels. When we randomly sample a small fraction (e.g., 10%) or flip a large fraction (e.g., 90%) of the ground-truth labels to train DNNs, their segmentation performance remains largely unchanged. This indicates that DNNs learn structures hidden in labels rather than pixel-level labels per se in their supervised training for semantic segmentation. We call these hidden structures meta-structures. When labels with different perturbations to the meta-structures are used to train DNNs, their performance in feature extraction and segmentation degrades consistently. In contrast, addition of meta-structure information substantially improves performance of an unsupervised model in binary semantic segmentation. We formulate meta-structures mathematically as spatial density distributions. We show theoretically and experimentally how this formulation explains key observed learning behavior of DNNs."
Region-level Contrastive and Consistency Learning for Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Current semi-supervised semantic segmentation methods mainly focus on designing pixel-level consistency and contrastive regularization. However, pixel-level regularization is sensitive to noise from pixels with incorrect predictions, and pixel-level contrastive regularization has memory and computational cost with O(pixel_num^2). To address the issues, we propose a novel region-level contrastive and consistency learning framework (RC^2L) for semi-supervised semantic segmentation. Specifically, we first propose a Region Mask Contrastive (RMC) loss and a Region Feature Contrastive (RFC) loss to accomplish region-level contrastive property. Furthermore, Region Class Consistency (RCC) loss and Semantic Mask Consistency (SMC) loss are proposed for achieving region-level consistency. Based on the proposed region-level contrastive and consistency regularization, we develop a region-level contrastive and consistency learning framework (RC^2L) for semi-supervised semantic segmentation, and evaluate our RC^2L on two challenging benchmarks (PASCAL VOC 2012 and Cityscapes), outperforming the state-of-the-art."
HRDA: Context-Aware High-Resolution Domain-Adaptive Semantic Segmentation,"Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to adapt a model trained on the source domain (e.g. synthetic data) to the target domain (e.g. real-world data) without requiring further annotations on the target domain. This work focuses on UDA for semantic segmentation as real-world pixel-wise annotations are particularly expensive to acquire. As UDA methods for semantic segmentation are usually GPU memory intensive, most previous methods operate only on downscaled images. We question this design as low-resolution predictions often fail to preserve fine details. The alternative of training with random crops of high-resolution images alleviates this problem but falls short in capturing long-range, domain-robust context information. Therefore, we propose HRDA, a multi-resolution training approach for UDA, that combines the strengths of small high-resolution crops to preserve fine segmentation details and large low-resolution crops to capture long-range context dependencies with a learned scale attention, while maintaining a manageable GPU memory footprint. HRDA enables adapting small objects and preserving fine segmentation details. It significantly improves the state-of-the-art performance by 5.5 mIoU for GTA-to-Cityscapes and 4.9 mIoU for Synthia-to-Cityscapes, resulting in unprecedented 73.8 and 65.8 mIoU, respectively. The implementation is available at https://github.com/lhoyer/HRDA."
Self-Supervised Learning of Object Parts for Semantic Segmentation,"Progress in self-supervised learning has brought strong general image representation learning methods. Yet so far, it has mostly focused on image-level learning. In turn, tasks such as unsupervised image segmentation have not benefited from this trend as they require spatially-diverse representations. However, learning dense representations is challenging, as in the unsupervised context it is not clear how to guide the model to learn representations that correspond to various potential object categories. In this paper, we argue that self-supervised learning of object parts is a solution to this issue. Object parts are generalizable: they are a priori independent of an object definition, but can be grouped to form objects a posteriori. To this end, we leverage the recently proposed Vision Transformer's capability of attending to objects and combine it with a spatially dense clustering task for fine-tuning the spatial tokens. Our method surpasses the state-of-the-art on three semantic segmentation benchmarks by 17%-3%, showing that our representations are versatile under various object definitions. Finally, we extend this to fully unsupervised segmentation - which refrains completely from using label information even at test-time - and demonstrate that a simple method for automatically merging discovered object parts based on community detection yields substantial gains."
MM-TTA: Multi-Modal Test-Time Adaptation for 3D Semantic Segmentation,"Test-time adaptation approaches have recently emerged as a practical solution for handling domain shift without access to the source domain data. In this paper, we propose and explore a new multi-modal extension of test-time adaptation for 3D semantic segmentation. We find that directly applying existing methods usually results in performance instability at test time because multi-modal input is not considered jointly. To design a framework that can take full advantage of multi-modality, where each modality provides regularized self-supervisory signals to other modalities, we propose two complementary modules within and across the modalities. First, Intra-modal Pseudolabel Generation (Intra-PG) is introduced to obtain reliable pseudo labels within each modality by aggregating information from two models that are both pre-trained on source data but updated with target data at different paces. Second, Inter-modal Pseudo-label Refinement (Inter-PR) adaptively selects more reliable pseudo labels from different modalities based on a proposed consistency scheme. Experiments demonstrate that our regularized pseudo labels produce stable self-learning signals in numerous multi-modal test-time adaptation scenarios for 3D semantic segmentation.

ProCST: Boosting Semantic Segmentation Using Progressive Cyclic Style-Transfer,"Using synthetic data for training neural networks that achieve good performance on real-world data is an important task as it can reduce the need for costly data annotation. Yet, synthetic and real world data have a domain gap. Reducing this gap, also known as domain adaptation, has been widely studied in recent years. Closing the domain gap between the source (synthetic) and target (real) data by directly performing the adaptation between the two is challenging. In this work, we propose a novel two-stage framework for improving domain adaptation techniques on image data. In the first stage, we progressively train a multi-scale neural network to perform image translation from the source domain to the target domain. We denote the new transformed data as ""Source in Target"" (SiT). Then, we insert the generated SiT data as the input to any standard UDA approach. This new data has a reduced domain gap from the desired target domain, which facilitates the applied UDA approach to close the gap further. We emphasize the effectiveness of our method via a comparison to other leading UDA and image-to-image translation techniques when used as SiT generators. Moreover, we demonstrate the improvement of our framework with three state-of-the-art UDA methods for semantic segmentation, HRDA, DAFormer and ProDA, on two UDA tasks, GTA5 to Cityscapes and Synthia to Cityscapes."
Multi-Head Distillation for Continual Unsupervised Domain Adaptation in Semantic Segmentation,"Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) is a transfer learning task which aims at training on an unlabeled target domain by leveraging a labeled source domain. Beyond the traditional scope of UDA with a single source domain and a single target domain, real-world perception systems face a variety of scenarios to handle, from varying lighting conditions to many cities around the world. In this context, UDAs with several domains increase the challenges with the addition of distribution shifts within the different target domains. This work focuses on a novel framework for learning UDA, continuous UDA, in which models operate on multiple target domains discovered sequentially, without access to previous target domains. We propose MuHDi, for Multi-Head Distillation, a method that solves the catastrophic forgetting problem, inherent in continual learning tasks. MuHDi performs distillation at multiple levels from the previous model as well as an auxiliary target-specialist segmentation head. We report both extensive ablation and experiments on challenging multi-target UDA semantic segmentation benchmarks to validate the proposed learning scheme and architecture."
Unsupervised Hierarchical Semantic Segmentation with Multiview Cosegmentation and Clustering Transformers,"Unsupervised semantic segmentation aims to discover groupings within and across images that capture object and view-invariance of a category without external supervision. Grouping naturally has levels of granularity, creating ambiguity in unsupervised segmentation. Existing methods avoid this ambiguity and treat it as a factor outside modeling, whereas we embrace it and desire hierarchical grouping consistency for unsupervised segmentation.  We approach unsupervised segmentation as a pixel-wise feature learning problem. Our idea is that a good representation shall reveal not just a particular level of grouping, but any level of grouping in a consistent and predictable manner. We enforce spatial consistency of grouping and bootstrap feature learning with co-segmentation among multiple views of the same image, and enforce semantic consistency across the grouping hierarchy with clustering transformers between coarse- and fine-grained features.  We deliver the first data-driven unsupervised hierarchical semantic segmentation method called Hierarchical Segment Grouping (HSG). Capturing visual similarity and statistical co-occurrences, HSG also outperforms existing unsupervised segmentation methods by a large margin on five major object- and scene-centric benchmarks. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/twke18/HSG ."
Learning Shape Priors by Pairwise Comparison for Robust Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation is important in medical image analysis. Inspired by the strong ability of traditional image analysis techniques in capturing shape priors and inter-subject similarity, many deep learning (DL) models have been recently proposed to exploit such prior information and achieved robust performance. However, these two types of important prior information are usually studied separately in existing models. In this paper, we propose a novel DL model to model both type of priors within a single framework. Specifically, we introduce an extra encoder into the classic encoder-decoder structure to form a Siamese structure for the encoders, where one of them takes a target image as input (the image-encoder), and the other concatenates a template image and its foreground regions as input (the template-encoder). The template-encoder encodes the shape priors and appearance characteristics of each foreground class in the template image. A cosine similarity based attention module is proposed to fuse the information from both encoders, to utilize both types of prior information encoded by the template-encoder and model the inter-subject similarity for each foreground class. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our proposed method can produce superior performance to competing methods."
SegDiscover: Visual Concept Discovery via Unsupervised Semantic Segmentation,"Visual concept discovery has long been deemed important to improve interpretability of neural networks, because a bank of semantically meaningful concepts would provide us with a starting point for building machine learning models that exhibit intelligible reasoning process. Previous methods have disadvantages: either they rely on labelled support sets that incorporate human biases for objects that are ""useful,"" or they fail to identify multiple concepts that occur within a single image. We reframe the concept discovery task as an unsupervised semantic segmentation problem, and present SegDiscover, a novel framework that discovers semantically meaningful visual concepts from imagery datasets with complex scenes without supervision. Our method contains three important pieces: generating concept primitives from raw images, discovering concepts by clustering in the latent space of a self-supervised pretrained encoder, and concept refinement via neural network smoothing. Experimental results provide evidence that our method can discover multiple concepts within a single image and outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods on complex datasets such as Cityscapes and COCO-Stuff. Our method can be further used as a neural network explanation tool by comparing results obtained by different encoders."
Dynamic Prototype Convolution Network for Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation,"The key challenge for few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) is how to tailor a desirable interaction among support and query features and/or their prototypes, under the episodic training scenario. Most existing FSS methods implement such support-query interactions by solely leveraging plain operations - e.g., cosine similarity and feature concatenation - for segmenting the query objects. However, these interaction approaches usually cannot well capture the intrinsic object details in the query images that are widely encountered in FSS, e.g., if the query object to be segmented has holes and slots, inaccurate segmentation almost always happens. To this end, we propose a dynamic prototype convolution network (DPCN) to fully capture the aforementioned intrinsic details for accurate FSS. Specifically, in DPCN, a dynamic convolution module (DCM) is firstly proposed to generate dynamic kernels from support foreground, then information interaction is achieved by convolution operations over query features using these kernels. Moreover, we equip DPCN with a support activation module (SAM) and a feature filtering module (FFM) to generate pseudo mask and filter out background information for the query images, respectively. SAM and FFM together can mine enriched context information from the query features. Our DPCN is also flexible and efficient under the k-shot FSS setting. Extensive experiments on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i show that DPCN yields superior performances under both 1-shot and 5-shot settings."
DooDLeNet: Double DeepLab Enhanced Feature Fusion for Thermal-color Semantic Segmentation,"In this paper we present a new approach for feature fusion between RGB and LWIR Thermal images for the task of semantic segmentation for driving perception. We propose DooDLeNet, a double DeepLab architecture with specialized encoder-decoders for thermal and color modalities and a shared decoder for final segmentation. We combine two strategies for feature fusion: confidence weighting and correlation weighting. We report state-of-the-art mean IoU results on the MF dataset."
CPGNet: Cascade Point-Grid Fusion Network for Real-Time LiDAR Semantic Segmentation,"LiDAR semantic segmentation essential for advanced autonomous driving is required to be accurate, fast, and easy-deployed on mobile platforms. Previous point-based or sparse voxel-based methods are far away from real-time applications since time-consuming neighbor searching or sparse 3D convolution are employed. Recent 2D projection-based methods, including range view and multi-view fusion, can run in real time, but suffer from lower accuracy due to information loss during the 2D projection. Besides, to improve the performance, previous methods usually adopt test time augmentation (TTA), which further slows down the inference process. To achieve a better speed-accuracy trade-off, we propose Cascade Point-Grid Fusion Network (CPGNet), which ensures both effectiveness and efficiency mainly by the following two techniques: 1) the novel Point-Grid (PG) fusion block extracts semantic features mainly on the 2D projected grid for efficiency, while summarizes both 2D and 3D features on 3D point for minimal information loss; 2) the proposed transformation consistency loss narrows the gap between the single-time model inference and TTA. The experiments on the SemanticKITTI and nuScenes benchmarks demonstrate that the CPGNet without ensemble models or TTA is comparable with the state-of-the-art RPVNet, while it runs 4.7 times faster."
SePiCo: Semantic-Guided Pixel Contrast for Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation,"Domain adaptive semantic segmentation attempts to make satisfactory dense predictions on an unlabeled target domain by utilizing the supervised model trained on a labeled source domain. In this work, we propose Semantic-Guided Pixel Contrast (SePiCo), a novel one-stage adaptation framework that highlights the semantic concepts of individual pixels to promote learning of class-discriminative and class-balanced pixel representations across domains, eventually boosting the performance of self-training methods. Specifically, to explore proper semantic concepts, we first investigate a centroid-aware pixel contrast that employs the category centroids of the entire source domain or a single source image to guide the learning of discriminative features. Considering the possible lack of category diversity in semantic concepts, we then blaze a trail of distributional perspective to involve a sufficient quantity of instances, namely distribution-aware pixel contrast, in which we approximate the true distribution of each semantic category from the statistics of labeled source data. Moreover, such an optimization objective can derive a closed-form upper bound by implicitly involving an infinite number of (dis)similar pairs, making it computationally efficient. Extensive experiments show that SePiCo not only helps stabilize training but also yields discriminative representations, making significant progress on both synthetic-to-real and daytime-to-nighttime adaptation scenarios."
Unsupervised Contrastive Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation models struggle to generalize in the presence of domain shift. In this paper, we introduce contrastive learning for feature alignment in cross-domain adaptation. We assemble both in-domain contrastive pairs and cross-domain contrastive pairs to learn discriminative features that align across domains. Based on the resulting well-aligned feature representations we introduce a label expansion approach that is able to discover samples from hard classes during the adaptation process to further boost performance. The proposed approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods for domain adaptation. It achieves 60.2% mIoU on the Cityscapes dataset when training on the synthetic GTA5 dataset together with unlabeled Cityscapes images."
Augmentation Invariance and Adaptive Sampling in Semantic Segmentation of Agricultural Aerial Images,"In this paper, we investigate the problem of Semantic Segmentation for agricultural aerial imagery. We observe that the existing methods used for this task are designed without considering two characteristics of the aerial data: (i) the top-down perspective implies that the model cannot rely on a fixed semantic structure of the scene, because the same scene may be experienced with different rotations of the sensor; (ii) there can be a strong imbalance in the distribution of semantic classes because the relevant objects of the scene may appear at extremely different scales (e.g., a field of crops and a small vehicle). We propose a solution to these problems based on two ideas: (i) we use together a set of suitable augmentation and a consistency loss to guide the model to learn semantic representations that are invariant to the photometric and geometric shifts typical of the top-down perspective (Augmentation Invariance); (ii) we use a sampling method (Adaptive Sampling) that selects the training images based on a measure of pixel-wise distribution of classes and actual network confidence. With an extensive set of experiments conducted on the Agriculture-Vision dataset, we demonstrate that our proposed strategies improve the performance of the current state-of-the-art method."
Language-Grounded Indoor 3D Semantic Segmentation in the Wild,"Recent advances in 3D semantic segmentation with deep neural networks have shown remarkable success, with rapid performance increase on available datasets. However, current 3D semantic segmentation benchmarks contain only a small number of categories -- less than 30 for ScanNet and SemanticKITTI, for instance, which are not enough to reflect the diversity of real environments (e.g., semantic image understanding covers hundreds to thousands of classes). Thus, we propose to study a larger vocabulary for 3D semantic segmentation with a new extended benchmark on ScanNet data with 200 class categories, an order of magnitude more than previously studied. This large number of class categories also induces a large natural class imbalance, both of which are challenging for existing 3D semantic segmentation methods. To learn more robust 3D features in this context, we propose a language-driven pre-training method to encourage learned 3D features that might have limited training examples to lie close to their pre-trained text embeddings. Extensive experiments show that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art 3D pre-training for 3D semantic segmentation on our proposed benchmark (+9% relative mIoU), including limited-data scenarios with +25% relative mIoU using only 5% annotations."
Bidirectional Self-Training with Multiple Anisotropic Prototypes for Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation,"A thriving trend for domain adaptive segmentation endeavors to generate the high-quality pseudo labels for target domain and retrain the segmentor on them. Under this self-training paradigm, some competitive methods have sought to the latent-space information, which establishes the feature centroids (a.k.a prototypes) of the semantic classes and determines the pseudo label candidates by their distances from these centroids. In this paper, we argue that the latent space contains more information to be exploited thus taking one step further to capitalize on it. Firstly, instead of merely using the source-domain prototypes to determine the target pseudo labels as most of the traditional methods do, we bidirectionally produce the target-domain prototypes to degrade those source features which might be too hard or disturbed for the adaptation. Secondly, existing attempts simply model each category as a single and isotropic prototype while ignoring the variance of the feature distribution, which could lead to the confusion of similar categories. To cope with this issue, we propose to represent each category with multiple and anisotropic prototypes via Gaussian Mixture Model, in order to fit the de facto distribution of source domain and estimate the likelihood of target samples based on the probability density. We apply our method on GTA5->Cityscapes and Synthia->Cityscapes tasks and achieve 61.2 and 62.8 respectively in terms of mean IoU, substantially outperforming other competitive self-training methods. Noticeably, in some categories which severely suffer from the categorical confusion such as ""truck"" and ""bus"", our method achieves 56.4 and 68.8 respectively, which further demonstrates the effectiveness of our design."
Learning Multi-View Aggregation In the Wild for Large-Scale 3D Semantic Segmentation,"Recent works on 3D semantic segmentation propose to exploit the synergy between images and point clouds by processing each modality with a dedicated network and projecting learned 2D features onto 3D points. Merging large-scale point clouds and images raises several challenges, such as constructing a mapping between points and pixels, and aggregating features between multiple views. Current methods require mesh reconstruction or specialized sensors to recover occlusions, and use heuristics to select and aggregate available images. In contrast, we propose an end-to-end trainable multi-view aggregation model leveraging the viewing conditions of 3D points to merge features from images taken at arbitrary positions. Our method can combine standard 2D and 3D networks and outperforms both 3D models operating on colorized point clouds and hybrid 2D/3D networks without requiring colorization, meshing, or true depth maps. We set a new state-of-the-art for large-scale indoor/outdoor semantic segmentation on S3DIS (74.7 mIoU 6-Fold) and on KITTI-360 (58.3 mIoU). Our full pipeline is accessible at https://github.com/drprojects/DeepViewAgg, and only requires raw 3D scans and a set of images and poses."
Cross-Image Relational Knowledge Distillation for Semantic Segmentation,"Current Knowledge Distillation (KD) methods for semantic segmentation often guide the student to mimic the teacher's structured information generated from individual data samples. However, they ignore the global semantic relations among pixels across various images that are valuable for KD. This paper proposes a novel Cross-Image Relational KD (CIRKD), which focuses on transferring structured pixel-to-pixel and pixel-to-region relations among the whole images. The motivation is that a good teacher network could construct a well-structured feature space in terms of global pixel dependencies. CIRKD makes the student mimic better structured semantic relations from the teacher, thus improving the segmentation performance. Experimental results over Cityscapes, CamVid and Pascal VOC datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach against state-of-the-art distillation methods. The code is available at https://github.com/winycg/CIRKD."
RecurSeed and EdgePredictMix: Single-stage Learning is Sufficient for Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Although weakly-supervised semantic segmentation using only image-level labels (WSSS-IL) is potentially useful, its low performance and implementation complexity still limit its application. The main causes are (a) non-detection and (b) false-detection phenomena: (a) The class activation maps refined from existing WSSS-IL methods still only represent partial regions for large-scale objects, and (b) for small-scale objects, over-activation causes them to deviate from the object edges. We propose RecurSeed which alternately reduces non and false-detections through recursive iterations, thereby implicitly finding an optimal junction that minimizes both errors. We also propose a novel data augmentation (DA) approach called EdgePredictMix, which further expresses an object's edge by utilizing the probability difference information between adjacent pixels in combining the segmentation results, thereby compensating for the shortcomings when applying the existing DA methods to WSSS. We achieved new state-of-the-art performances on both the PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 benchmarks (VOC val 74.4%, COCO val 46.4%). The code is available at https://github.com/OFRIN/RecurSeed_and_EdgePredictMix."
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation with Implicit Pseudo Supervision for Semantic Segmentation,"Pseudo-labelling is a popular technique in unsuper-vised domain adaptation for semantic segmentation. However, pseudo labels are noisy and inevitably have confirmation bias due to the discrepancy between source and target domains and training process. In this paper, we train the model by the pseudo labels which are implicitly produced by itself to learn new complementary knowledge about target domain. Specifically, we propose a tri-learning architecture, where every two branches produce the pseudo labels to train the third one. And we align the pseudo labels based on the similarity of the probability distributions for each two branches. To further implicitly utilize the pseudo labels, we maximize the distances of features for different classes and minimize the distances for the same classes by triplet loss. Extensive experiments on GTA5 to Cityscapes and SYNTHIA to Cityscapes tasks show that the proposed method has considerable improvements."
WSSS4LUAD: Grand Challenge on Weakly-supervised Tissue Semantic Segmentation for Lung Adenocarcinoma,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, and adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common subtype. Exploiting the potential value of the histopathology images can promote precision medicine in oncology. Tissue segmentation is the basic upstream task of histopathology image analysis. Existing deep learning models have achieved superior segmentation performance but require sufficient pixel-level annotations, which is time-consuming and expensive. To enrich the label resources of LUAD and to alleviate the annotation efforts, we organize this challenge WSSS4LUAD to call for the outstanding weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) techniques for histopathology images of LUAD. Participants have to design the algorithm to segment tumor epithelial, tumor-associated stroma and normal tissue with only patch-level labels. This challenge includes 10,091 patch-level annotations (the training set) and over 130 million labeled pixels (the validation and test sets), from 87 WSIs (67 from GDPH, 20 from TCGA). All the labels were generated by a pathologist-in-the-loop pipeline with the help of AI models and checked by the label review board. Among 532 registrations, 28 teams submitted the results in the test phase with over 1,000 submissions. Finally, the first place team achieved mIoU of 0.8413 (tumor: 0.8389, stroma: 0.7931, normal: 0.8919). According to the technical reports of the top-tier teams, CAM is still the most popular approach in WSSS. Cutmix data augmentation has been widely adopted to generate more reliable samples. With the success of this challenge, we believe that WSSS approaches with patch-level annotations can be a complement to the traditional pixel annotations while reducing the annotation efforts. The entire dataset has been released to encourage more researches on computational pathology in LUAD and more novel WSSS techniques."
Undoing the Damage of Label Shift for Cross-domain Semantic Segmentation,"Existing works typically treat cross-domain semantic segmentation (CDSS) as a data distribution mismatch problem and focus on aligning the marginal distribution or conditional distribution. However, the label shift issue is unfortunately overlooked, which actually commonly exists in the CDSS task, and often causes a classifier bias in the learnt model. In this paper, we give an in-depth analysis and show that the damage of label shift can be overcome by aligning the data conditional distribution and correcting the posterior probability. To this end, we propose a novel approach to undo the damage of the label shift problem in CDSS. In implementation, we adopt class-level feature alignment for conditional distribution alignment, as well as two simple yet effective methods to rectify the classifier bias from source to target by remolding the classifier predictions. We conduct extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets of urban scenes, including GTA5 to Cityscapes and SYNTHIA to Cityscapes, where our proposed approach outperforms previous methods by a large margin. For instance, our model equipped with a self-training strategy reaches 59.3% mIoU on GTA5 to Cityscapes, pushing to a new state-of-the-art. The code will be available at https://github.com/manmanjun/Undoing UDA."
TopFormer: Token Pyramid Transformer for Mobile Semantic Segmentation,"Although vision transformers (ViTs) have achieved great success in computer vision, the heavy computational cost hampers their applications to dense prediction tasks such as semantic segmentation on mobile devices. In this paper, we present a mobile-friendly architecture named \textbf{To}ken \textbf{P}yramid Vision Trans\textbf{former} (\textbf{TopFormer}). The proposed \textbf{TopFormer} takes Tokens from various scales as input to produce scale-aware semantic features, which are then injected into the corresponding tokens to augment the representation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms CNN- and ViT-based networks across several semantic segmentation datasets and achieves a good trade-off between accuracy and latency. On the ADE20K dataset, TopFormer achieves 5\% higher accuracy in mIoU than MobileNetV3 with lower latency on an ARM-based mobile device. Furthermore, the tiny version of TopFormer achieves real-time inference on an ARM-based mobile device with competitive results. The code and models are available at: https://github.com/hustvl/TopFormer"
"Panoptic, Instance and Semantic Relations: A Relational Context Encoder to Enhance Panoptic Segmentation","This paper presents a novel framework to integrate both semantic and instance contexts for panoptic segmentation. In existing works, it is common to use a shared backbone to extract features for both things (countable classes such as vehicles) and stuff (uncountable classes such as roads). This, however, fails to capture the rich relations among them, which can be utilized to enhance visual understanding and segmentation performance. To address this shortcoming, we propose a novel Panoptic, Instance, and Semantic Relations (PISR) module to exploit such contexts. First, we generate panoptic encodings to summarize key features of the semantic classes and predicted instances. A Panoptic Relational Attention (PRA) module is then applied to the encodings and the global feature map from the backbone. It produces a feature map that captures 1) the relations across semantic classes and instances and 2) the relations between these panoptic categories and spatial features. PISR also automatically learns to focus on the more important instances, making it robust to the number of instances used in the relational attention module. Moreover, PISR is a general module that can be applied to any existing panoptic segmentation architecture. Through extensive evaluations on panoptic segmentation benchmarks like Cityscapes, COCO, and ADE20K, we show that PISR attains considerable improvements over existing approaches."
A Semantic Segmentation Network Based Real-Time Computer-Aided Diagnosis System for Hydatidiform Mole Hydrops Lesion Recognition in Microscopic View,"As a disease with malignant potential, hydatidiform mole (HM) is one of the most common gestational trophoblastic diseases. For pathologists, the HM section of hydrops lesions is an important basis for diagnosis. In pathology departments, the diverse microscopic manifestations of HM lesions and the limited view under the microscope mean that physicians with extensive diagnostic experience are required to prevent missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis. Feature extraction can significantly improve the accuracy and speed of the diagnostic process. As a remarkable diagnosis assisting technology, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) has been widely used in clinical practice. We constructed a deep-learning-based CAD system to identify HM hydrops lesions in the microscopic view in real-time. The system consists of three modules; the image mosaic module and edge extension module process the image to improve the outcome of the hydrops lesion recognition module, which adopts a semantic segmentation network, our novel compound loss function, and a stepwise training function in order to achieve the best performance in identifying hydrops lesions. We evaluated our system using an HM hydrops dataset. Experiments show that our system is able to respond in real-time and correctly display the entire microscopic view with accurately labeled HM hydrops lesions."
Semantic Segmentation for Point Cloud Scenes via Dilated Graph Feature Aggregation and Pyramid Decoders,"Semantic segmentation of point clouds generates comprehensive understanding of scenes through densely predicting the category for each point. Due to the unicity of receptive field, semantic segmentation of point clouds remains challenging for the expression of multi-receptive field features, which brings about the misclassification of instances with similar spatial structures. In this paper, we propose a graph convolutional network DGFA-Net rooted in dilated graph feature aggregation (DGFA), guided by multi-basis aggregation loss (MALoss) calculated through Pyramid Decoders. To configure multi-receptive field features, DGFA which takes the proposed dilated graph convolution (DGConv) as its basic building block, is designed to aggregate multi-scale feature representation by capturing dilated graphs with various receptive regions. By simultaneously considering penalizing the receptive field information with point sets of different resolutions as calculation bases, we introduce Pyramid Decoders driven by MALoss for the diversity of receptive field bases. Combining these two aspects, DGFA-Net significantly improves the segmentation performance of instances with similar spatial structures. Experiments on S3DIS, ShapeNetPart and Toronto-3D show that DGFA-Net outperforms the baseline approach, achieving a new state-of-the-art segmentation performance."
Anti-Adversarially Manipulated Attributions for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation and Object Localization,"Obtaining accurate pixel-level localization from class labels is a crucial process in weakly supervised semantic segmentation and object localization. Attribution maps from a trained classifier are widely used to provide pixel-level localization, but their focus tends to be restricted to a small discriminative region of the target object. An AdvCAM is an attribution map of an image that is manipulated to increase the classification score produced by a classifier before the final softmax or sigmoid layer. This manipulation is realized in an anti-adversarial manner, so that the original image is perturbed along pixel gradients in directions opposite to those used in an adversarial attack. This process enhances non-discriminative yet class-relevant features, which make an insufficient contribution to previous attribution maps, so that the resulting AdvCAM identifies more regions of the target object. In addition, we introduce a new regularization procedure that inhibits the incorrect attribution of regions unrelated to the target object and the excessive concentration of attributions on a small region of the target object. Our method achieves a new state-of-the-art performance in weakly and semi-supervised semantic segmentation, on both the PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 datasets. In weakly supervised object localization, it achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on the CUB-200-2011 and ImageNet-1K datasets."
Scale Invariant Semantic Segmentation with RGB-D Fusion,"In this paper, we propose a neural network architecture for scale-invariant semantic segmentation using RGB-D images. We utilize depth information as an additional modality apart from color images only. Especially in an outdoor scene which consists of different scale objects due to the distance of the objects from the camera. The near distance objects consist of significantly more pixels than the far ones. We propose to incorporate depth information to the RGB data for pixel-wise semantic segmentation to address the different scale objects in an outdoor scene. We adapt to a well-known DeepLab-v2(ResNet-101) model as our RGB baseline. Depth images are passed separately as an additional input with a distinct branch. The intermediate feature maps of both color and depth image branch are fused using a novel fusion block. Our model is compact and can be easily applied to the other RGB model. We perform extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluation on a challenging dataset Cityscapes. The results obtained are comparable to the state-of-the-art. Additionally, we evaluated our model on a self-recorded real dataset. For the shake of extended evaluation of a driving scene with ground truth we generated a synthetic dataset using popular vehicle simulation project CARLA. The results obtained from the real and synthetic dataset shows the effectiveness of our approach."
Attention guided global enhancement and local refinement network for semantic segmentation,"The encoder-decoder architecture is widely used as a lightweight semantic segmentation network. However, it struggles with a limited performance compared to a well-designed Dilated-FCN model for two major problems. First, commonly used upsampling methods in the decoder such as interpolation and deconvolution suffer from a local receptive field, unable to encode global contexts. Second, low-level features may bring noises to the network decoder through skip connections for the inadequacy of semantic concepts in early encoder layers. To tackle these challenges, a Global Enhancement Method is proposed to aggregate global information from high-level feature maps and adaptively distribute them to different decoder layers, alleviating the shortage of global contexts in the upsampling process. Besides, a Local Refinement Module is developed by utilizing the decoder features as the semantic guidance to refine the noisy encoder features before the fusion of these two (the decoder features and the encoder features). Then, the two methods are integrated into a Context Fusion Block, and based on that, a novel Attention guided Global enhancement and Local refinement Network (AGLN) is elaborately designed. Extensive experiments on PASCAL Context, ADE20K, and PASCAL VOC 2012 datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach. In particular, with a vanilla ResNet-101 backbone, AGLN achieves the state-of-the-art result (56.23% mean IoU) on the PASCAL Context dataset. The code is available at https://github.com/zhasen1996/AGLN."
Feature-enhanced Adversarial Semi-supervised Semantic Segmentation Network for Pulmonary Embolism Annotation,"This study established a feature-enhanced adversarial semi-supervised semantic segmentation model to automatically annotate pulmonary embolism lesion areas in computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) images. In current studies, all of the PE CTPA image segmentation methods are trained by supervised learning. However, the supervised learning models need to be retrained and the images need to be relabeled when the CTPA images come from different hospitals. This study proposed a semi-supervised learning method to make the model applicable to different datasets by adding a small amount of unlabeled images. By training the model with both labeled and unlabeled images, the accuracy of unlabeled images can be improved and the labeling cost can be reduced. Our semi-supervised segmentation model includes a segmentation network and a discriminator network. We added feature information generated from the encoder of segmentation network to the discriminator so that it can learn the similarity between predicted mask and ground truth mask. This HRNet-based architecture can maintain a higher resolution for convolutional operations so the prediction of small PE lesion areas can be improved. We used the labeled open-source dataset and the unlabeled National Cheng Kung University Hospital (NCKUH) (IRB number: B-ER-108-380) dataset to train the semi-supervised learning model, and the resulting mean intersection over union (mIOU), dice score, and sensitivity achieved 0.3510, 0.4854, and 0.4253, respectively on the NCKUH dataset. Then, we fine-tuned and tested the model with a small amount of unlabeled PE CTPA images from China Medical University Hospital (CMUH) (IRB number: CMUH110-REC3-173) dataset. Comparing the results of our semi-supervised model with the supervised model, the mIOU, dice score, and sensitivity improved from 0.2344, 0.3325, and 0.3151 to 0.3721, 0.5113, and 0.4967, respectively."
Pin the Memory: Learning to Generalize Semantic Segmentation,"The rise of deep neural networks has led to several breakthroughs for semantic segmentation. In spite of this, a model trained on source domain often fails to work properly in new challenging domains, that is directly concerned with the generalization capability of the model. In this paper, we present a novel memory-guided domain generalization method for semantic segmentation based on meta-learning framework. Especially, our method abstracts the conceptual knowledge of semantic classes into categorical memory which is constant beyond the domains. Upon the meta-learning concept, we repeatedly train memory-guided networks and simulate virtual test to 1) learn how to memorize a domain-agnostic and distinct information of classes and 2) offer an externally settled memory as a class-guidance to reduce the ambiguity of representation in the test data of arbitrary unseen domain. To this end, we also propose memory divergence and feature cohesion losses, which encourage to learn memory reading and update processes for category-aware domain generalization. Extensive experiments for semantic segmentation demonstrate the superior generalization capability of our method over state-of-the-art works on various benchmarks."
Coarse-to-Fine Feature Mining for Video Semantic Segmentation,"The contextual information plays a core role in semantic segmentation. As for video semantic segmentation, the contexts include static contexts and motional contexts, corresponding to static content and moving content in a video clip, respectively. The static contexts are well exploited in image semantic segmentation by learning multi-scale and global/long-range features. The motional contexts are studied in previous video semantic segmentation. However, there is no research about how to simultaneously learn static and motional contexts which are highly correlated and complementary to each other. To address this problem, we propose a Coarse-to-Fine Feature Mining (CFFM) technique to learn a unified presentation of static contexts and motional contexts. This technique consists of two parts: coarse-to-fine feature assembling and cross-frame feature mining. The former operation prepares data for further processing, enabling the subsequent joint learning of static and motional contexts. The latter operation mines useful information/contexts from the sequential frames to enhance the video contexts of the features of the target frame. The enhanced features can be directly applied for the final prediction. Experimental results on popular benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed CFFM performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods for video semantic segmentation. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/GuoleiSun/VSS-CFFM"
L2G: A Simple Local-to-Global Knowledge Transfer Framework for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Mining precise class-aware attention maps, a.k.a, class activation maps, is essential for weakly supervised semantic segmentation. In this paper, we present L2G, a simple online local-to-global knowledge transfer framework for high-quality object attention mining. We observe that classification models can discover object regions with more details when replacing the input image with its local patches. Taking this into account, we first leverage a local classification network to extract attentions from multiple local patches randomly cropped from the input image. Then, we utilize a global network to learn complementary attention knowledge across multiple local attention maps online. Our framework conducts the global network to learn the captured rich object detail knowledge from a global view and thereby produces high-quality attention maps that can be directly used as pseudo annotations for semantic segmentation networks. Experiments show that our method attains 72.1% and 44.2% mIoU scores on the validation set of PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014, respectively, setting new state-of-the-art records. Code is available at https://github.com/PengtaoJiang/L2G."
Domain-Agnostic Prior for Transfer Semantic Segmentation,"Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) is an important topic in the computer vision community. The key difficulty lies in defining a common property between the source and target domains so that the source-domain features can align with the target-domain semantics. In this paper, we present a simple and effective mechanism that regularizes cross-domain representation learning with a domain-agnostic prior (DAP) that constrains the features extracted from source and target domains to align with a domain-agnostic space. In practice, this is easily implemented as an extra loss term that requires a little extra costs. In the standard evaluation protocol of transferring synthesized data to real data, we validate the effectiveness of different types of DAP, especially that borrowed from a text embedding model that shows favorable performance beyond the state-of-the-art UDA approaches in terms of segmentation accuracy. Our research reveals that UDA benefits much from better proxies, possibly from other data modalities."
PP-LiteSeg: A Superior Real-Time Semantic Segmentation Model,"Real-world applications have high demands for semantic segmentation methods. Although semantic segmentation has made remarkable leap-forwards with deep learning, the performance of real-time methods is not satisfactory. In this work, we propose PP-LiteSeg, a novel lightweight model for the real-time semantic segmentation task. Specifically, we present a Flexible and Lightweight Decoder (FLD) to reduce computation overhead of previous decoder. To strengthen feature representations, we propose a Unified Attention Fusion Module (UAFM), which takes advantage of spatial and channel attention to produce a weight and then fuses the input features with the weight. Moreover, a Simple Pyramid Pooling Module (SPPM) is proposed to aggregate global context with low computation cost. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that PP-LiteSeg achieves a superior trade-off between accuracy and speed compared to other methods. On the Cityscapes test set, PP-LiteSeg achieves 72.0% mIoU/273.6 FPS and 77.5% mIoU/102.6 FPS on NVIDIA GTX 1080Ti. Source code and models are available at PaddleSeg: https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleSeg."
Style-Hallucinated Dual Consistency Learning for Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation,"In this paper, we study the task of synthetic-to-real domain generalized semantic segmentation, which aims to learn a model that is robust to unseen real-world scenes using only synthetic data. The large domain shift between synthetic and real-world data, including the limited source environmental variations and the large distribution gap between synthetic and real-world data, significantly hinders the model performance on unseen real-world scenes. In this work, we propose the Style-HAllucinated Dual consistEncy learning (SHADE) framework to handle such domain shift. Specifically, SHADE is constructed based on two consistency constraints, Style Consistency (SC) and Retrospection Consistency (RC). SC enriches the source situations and encourages the model to learn consistent representation across style-diversified samples. RC leverages real-world knowledge to prevent the model from overfitting to synthetic data and thus largely keeps the representation consistent between the synthetic and real-world models. Furthermore, we present a novel style hallucination module (SHM) to generate style-diversified samples that are essential to consistency learning. SHM selects basis styles from the source distribution, enabling the model to dynamically generate diverse and realistic samples during training. Experiments show that our SHADE yields significant improvement and outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 5.05% and 8.35% on the average mIoU of three real-world datasets on single- and multi-source settings, respectively."
Semi-supervised Semantic Segmentation with Error Localization Network,"This paper studies semi-supervised learning of semantic segmentation, which assumes that only a small portion of training images are labeled and the others remain unlabeled. The unlabeled images are usually assigned pseudo labels to be used in training, which however often causes the risk of performance degradation due to the confirmation bias towards errors on the pseudo labels. We present a novel method that resolves this chronic issue of pseudo labeling. At the heart of our method lies error localization network (ELN), an auxiliary module that takes an image and its segmentation prediction as input and identifies pixels whose pseudo labels are likely to be wrong. ELN enables semi-supervised learning to be robust against inaccurate pseudo labels by disregarding label noises during training and can be naturally integrated with self-training and contrastive learning. Moreover, we introduce a new learning strategy for ELN that simulates plausible and diverse segmentation errors during training of ELN to enhance its generalization. Our method is evaluated on PASCAL VOC 2012 and Cityscapes, where it outperforms all existing methods in every evaluation setting."
Region Rebalance for Long-Tailed Semantic Segmentation,"In this paper, we study the problem of class imbalance in semantic segmentation. We first investigate and identify the main challenges of addressing this issue through pixel rebalance. Then a simple and yet effective region rebalance scheme is derived based on our analysis. In our solution, pixel features belonging to the same class are grouped into region features, and a rebalanced region classifier is applied via an auxiliary region rebalance branch during training. To verify the flexibility and effectiveness of our method, we apply the region rebalance module into various semantic segmentation methods, such as Deeplabv3+, OCRNet, and Swin. Our strategy achieves consistent improvement on the challenging ADE20K and COCO-Stuff benchmark. In particular, with the proposed region rebalance scheme, state-of-the-art BEiT receives +0.7% gain in terms of mIoU on the ADE20K val set."
Histogram of Oriented Gradients Meet Deep Learning: A Novel Multi-task Deep Network for Medical Image Semantic Segmentation,"We present our novel deep multi-task learning method for medical image segmentation. Existing multi-task methods demand ground truth annotations for both the primary and auxiliary tasks. Contrary to it, we propose to generate the pseudo-labels of an auxiliary task in an unsupervised manner. To generate the pseudo-labels, we leverage Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOGs), one of the most widely used and powerful hand-crafted features for detection. Together with the ground truth semantic segmentation masks for the primary task and pseudo-labels for the auxiliary task, we learn the parameters of the deep network to minimise the loss of both the primary task and the auxiliary task jointly. We employed our method on two powerful and widely used semantic segmentation networks: UNet and U2Net to train in a multi-task setup. To validate our hypothesis, we performed experiments on two different medical image segmentation data sets. From the extensive quantitative and qualitative results, we observe that our method consistently improves the performance compared to the counter-part method. Moreover, our method is the winner of FetReg Endovis Sub-challenge on Semantic Segmentation organised in conjunction with MICCAI 2021."
DODA: Data-oriented Sim-to-Real Domain Adaptation for 3D Semantic Segmentation,"Deep learning approaches achieve prominent success in 3D semantic segmentation. However, collecting densely annotated real-world 3D datasets is extremely time-consuming and expensive. Training models on synthetic data and generalizing on real-world scenarios becomes an appealing alternative, but unfortunately suffers from notorious domain shifts. In this work, we propose a Data-Oriented Domain Adaptation (DODA) framework to mitigate pattern and context gaps caused by different sensing mechanisms and layout placements across domains. Our DODA encompasses virtual scan simulation to imitate real-world point cloud patterns and tail-aware cuboid mixing to alleviate the interior context gap with a cuboid-based intermediate domain. The first unsupervised sim-to-real adaptation benchmark on 3D indoor semantic segmentation is also built on 3D-FRONT, ScanNet and S3DIS along with 7 popular Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) methods. Our DODA surpasses existing UDA approaches by over 13% on both 3D-FRONT -> ScanNet and 3D-FRONT -> S3DIS. Code is available at https://github.com/CVMI-Lab/DODA."
WildNet: Learning Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation from the Wild,"We present a new domain generalized semantic segmentation network named WildNet, which learns domain-generalized features by leveraging a variety of contents and styles from the wild. In domain generalization, the low generalization ability for unseen target domains is clearly due to overfitting to the source domain. To address this problem, previous works have focused on generalizing the domain by removing or diversifying the styles of the source domain. These alleviated overfitting to the source-style but overlooked overfitting to the source-content. In this paper, we propose to diversify both the content and style of the source domain with the help of the wild. Our main idea is for networks to naturally learn domain-generalized semantic information from the wild. To this end, we diversify styles by augmenting source features to resemble wild styles and enable networks to adapt to a variety of styles. Furthermore, we encourage networks to learn class-discriminant features by providing semantic variations borrowed from the wild to source contents in the feature space. Finally, we regularize networks to capture consistent semantic information even when both the content and style of the source domain are extended to the wild. Extensive experiments on five different datasets validate the effectiveness of our WildNet, and we significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods. The source code and model are available online: https://github.com/suhyeonlee/WildNet."
SPFNet:Subspace Pyramid Fusion Network for Semantic Segmentation,"The encoder-decoder structure has significantly improved performance in many vision tasks by fusing low-level and high-level feature maps. However, this approach can hardly extract sufficient context information for pixel-wise segmentation. In addition, extracting similar low-level features at multiple scales could lead to redundant information. To tackle these issues, we propose Subspace Pyramid Fusion Network (SPFNet). Specifically, we combine pyramidal module and context aggregation module to exploit the impact of multi-scale/global context information. At first, we construct a Subspace Pyramid Fusion Module (SPFM) based on Reduced Pyramid Pooling (RPP). Then, we propose the Efficient Global Context Aggregation (EGCA) module to capture discriminative features by fusing multi-level global context features. Finally, we add decoder-based subpixel convolution to retrieve the high-resolution feature maps, which can help select category localization details. SPFM learns separate RPP for each feature subspace to capture multi-scale feature representations, which is more useful for semantic segmentation. EGCA adopts shuffle attention mechanism to enhance communication across different sub-features. Experimental results on two well-known semantic segmentation datasets, including Camvid and Cityscapes, show that our proposed method is competitive with other state-of-the-art methods."
Dynamic Focus-aware Positional Queries for Semantic Segmentation,"The DETR-like segmentors have underpinned the most recent breakthroughs in semantic segmentation, which end-to-end train a set of queries representing the class prototypes or target segments. Recently, masked attention is proposed to restrict each query to only attend to the foreground regions predicted by the preceding decoder block for easier optimization. Although promising, it relies on the learnable parameterized positional queries which tend to encode the dataset statistics, leading to inaccurate localization for distinct individual queries. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective query design for semantic segmentation termed Dynamic Focus-aware Positional Queries (DFPQ), which dynamically generates positional queries conditioned on the cross-attention scores from the preceding decoder block and the positional encodings for the corresponding image features, simultaneously. Therefore, our DFPQ preserves rich localization information for the target segments and provides accurate and fine-grained positional priors. In addition, we propose to efficiently deal with high-resolution cross-attention by only aggregating the contextual tokens based on the low-resolution cross-attention scores to perform local relation aggregation. Extensive experiments on ADE20K and Cityscapes show that with the two modifications on Mask2former, our framework achieves SOTA performance and outperforms Mask2former by clear margins of 1.1%, 1.9%, and 1.1% single-scale mIoU with ResNet-50, Swin-T, and Swin-B backbones on the ADE20K validation set, respectively. Source code is available at https://github.com/ziplab/FASeg"
Semantic-Aware Domain Generalized Segmentation,"Deep models trained on source domain lack generalization when evaluated on unseen target domains with different data distributions. The problem becomes even more pronounced when we have no access to target domain samples for adaptation. In this paper, we address domain generalized semantic segmentation, where a segmentation model is trained to be domain-invariant without using any target domain data. Existing approaches to tackle this problem standardize data into a unified distribution. We argue that while such a standardization promotes global normalization, the resulting features are not discriminative enough to get clear segmentation boundaries. To enhance separation between categories while simultaneously promoting domain invariance, we propose a framework including two novel modules: Semantic-Aware Normalization (SAN) and Semantic-Aware Whitening (SAW). Specifically, SAN focuses on category-level center alignment between features from different image styles, while SAW enforces distributed alignment for the already center-aligned features. With the help of SAN and SAW, we encourage both intra-category compactness and inter-category separability. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on widely-used datasets (i.e. GTAV, SYNTHIA, Cityscapes, Mapillary and BDDS). Our approach shows significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art on various backbone networks. Code is available at https://github.com/leolyj/SAN-SAW"
On the Road to Online Adaptation for Semantic Image Segmentation,"We propose a new problem formulation and a corresponding evaluation framework to advance research on unsupervised domain adaptation for semantic image segmentation. The overall goal is fostering the development of adaptive learning systems that will continuously learn, without supervision, in ever-changing environments. Typical protocols that study adaptation algorithms for segmentation models are limited to few domains, adaptation happens offline, and human intervention is generally required, at least to annotate data for hyper-parameter tuning. We argue that such constraints are incompatible with algorithms that can continuously adapt to different real-world situations. To address this, we propose a protocol where models need to learn online, from sequences of temporally correlated images, requiring continuous, frame-by-frame adaptation. We accompany this new protocol with a variety of baselines to tackle the proposed formulation, as well as an extensive analysis of their behaviors, which can serve as a starting point for future research."
Texture based Prototypical Network for Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation of Forest Cover: Generalizing for Different Geographical Regions,"Forest plays a vital role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating climate change besides maintaining the world's biodiversity. The existing satellite-based forest monitoring system utilizes supervised learning approaches that are limited to a particular region and depend on manually annotated data to identify forest. This work envisages forest identification as a few-shot semantic segmentation task to achieve generalization across different geographical regions. The proposed few-shot segmentation approach incorporates a texture attention module in the prototypical network to highlight the texture features of the forest. Indeed, the forest exhibits a characteristic texture different from other classes, such as road, water, etc. In this work, the proposed approach is trained for identifying tropical forests of South Asia and adapted to determine the temperate forest of Central Europe with the help of a few (one image for 1-shot) manually annotated support images of the temperate forest. An IoU of 0.62 for forest class (1-way 1-shot) was obtained using the proposed method, which is significantly higher (0.46 for PANet) than the existing few-shot semantic segmentation approach. This result demonstrates that the proposed approach can generalize across geographical regions for forest identification, creating an opportunity to develop a global forest cover identification tool."
Abstract Flow for Temporal Semantic Segmentation on the Permutohedral Lattice,"Semantic segmentation is a core ability required by autonomous agents, as being able to distinguish which parts of the scene belong to which object class is crucial for navigation and interaction with the environment. Approaches which use only one time-step of data cannot distinguish between moving objects nor can they benefit from temporal integration. In this work, we extend a backbone LatticeNet to process temporal point cloud data. Additionally, we take inspiration from optical flow methods and propose a new module called Abstract Flow which allows the network to match parts of the scene with similar abstract features and gather the information temporally. We obtain state-of-the-art results on the SemanticKITTI dataset that contains LiDAR scans from real urban environments. We share the PyTorch implementation of TemporalLatticeNet at https://github.com/AIS-Bonn/temporal_latticenet ."
Exploring Intra- and Inter-Video Relation for Surgical Semantic Scene Segmentation,"Automatic surgical scene segmentation is fundamental for facilitating cognitive intelligence in the modern operating theatre. Previous works rely on conventional aggregation modules (e.g., dilated convolution, convolutional LSTM), which only make use of the local context. In this paper, we propose a novel framework STswinCL that explores the complementary intra- and inter-video relations to boost segmentation performance, by progressively capturing the global context. We firstly develop a hierarchy Transformer to capture intra-video relation that includes richer spatial and temporal cues from neighbor pixels and previous frames. A joint space-time window shift scheme is proposed to efficiently aggregate these two cues into each pixel embedding. Then, we explore inter-video relation via pixel-to-pixel contrastive learning, which well structures the global embedding space. A multi-source contrast training objective is developed to group the pixel embeddings across videos with the ground-truth guidance, which is crucial for learning the global property of the whole data. We extensively validate our approach on two public surgical video benchmarks, including EndoVis18 Challenge and CaDIS dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the promising performance of our method, which consistently exceeds previous state-of-the-art approaches. Code is available at https://github.com/YuemingJin/STswinCL."
SimT: Handling Open-set Noise for Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation,"This paper studies a practical domain adaptive (DA) semantic segmentation problem where only pseudo-labeled target data is accessible through a black-box model. Due to the domain gap and label shift between two domains, pseudo-labeled target data contains mixed closed-set and open-set label noises. In this paper, we propose a simplex noise transition matrix (SimT) to model the mixed noise distributions in DA semantic segmentation and formulate the problem as estimation of SimT. By exploiting computational geometry analysis and properties of segmentation, we design three complementary regularizers, i.e. volume regularization, anchor guidance, convex guarantee, to approximate the true SimT. Specifically, volume regularization minimizes the volume of simplex formed by rows of the non-square SimT, which ensures outputs of segmentation model to fit into the ground truth label distribution. To compensate for the lack of open-set knowledge, anchor guidance and convex guarantee are devised to facilitate the modeling of open-set noise distribution and enhance the discriminative feature learning among closed-set and open-set classes. The estimated SimT is further utilized to correct noise issues in pseudo labels and promote the generalization ability of segmentation model on target domain data. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SimT can be flexibly plugged into existing DA methods to boost the performance.

Rethinking Semantic Segmentation: A Prototype View,"Prevalent semantic segmentation solutions, despite their different network designs (FCN based or attention based) and mask decoding strategies (parametric softmax based or pixel-query based), can be placed in one category, by considering the softmax weights or query vectors as learnable class prototypes. In light of this prototype view, this study uncovers several limitations of such parametric segmentation regime, and proposes a nonparametric alternative based on non-learnable prototypes. Instead of prior methods learning a single weight/query vector for each class in a fully parametric manner, our model represents each class as a set of non-learnable prototypes, relying solely on the mean features of several training pixels within that class. The dense prediction is thus achieved by nonparametric nearest prototype retrieving. This allows our model to directly shape the pixel embedding space, by optimizing the arrangement between embedded pixels and anchored prototypes. It is able to handle arbitrary number of classes with a constant amount of learnable parameters. We empirically show that, with FCN based and attention based segmentation models (i.e., HRNet, Swin, SegFormer) and backbones (i.e., ResNet, HRNet, Swin, MiT), our nonparametric framework yields compelling results over several datasets (i.e., ADE20K, Cityscapes, COCO-Stuff), and performs well in the large-vocabulary situation. We expect this work will provoke a rethink of the current de facto semantic segmentation model design."
RAVIR: A Dataset and Methodology for the Semantic Segmentation and Quantitative Analysis of Retinal Arteries and Veins in Infrared Reflectance Imaging,"The retinal vasculature provides important clues in the diagnosis and monitoring of systemic diseases including hypertension and diabetes. The microvascular system is of primary involvement in such conditions, and the retina is the only anatomical site where the microvasculature can be directly observed. The objective assessment of retinal vessels has long been considered a surrogate biomarker for systemic vascular diseases, and with recent advancements in retinal imaging and computer vision technologies, this topic has become the subject of renewed attention. In this paper, we present a novel dataset, dubbed RAVIR, for the semantic segmentation of Retinal Arteries and Veins in Infrared Reflectance (IR) imaging. It enables the creation of deep learning-based models that distinguish extracted vessel type without extensive post-processing. We propose a novel deep learning-based methodology, denoted as SegRAVIR, for the semantic segmentation of retinal arteries and veins and the quantitative measurement of the widths of segmented vessels. Our extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of SegRAVIR and demonstrate its superior performance in comparison to state-of-the-art models. Additionally, we propose a knowledge distillation framework for the domain adaptation of RAVIR pretrained networks on color images. We demonstrate that our pretraining procedure yields new state-of-the-art benchmarks on the DRIVE, STARE, and CHASE_DB1 datasets. Dataset link: https://ravirdataset.github.io/data/"
DNN-Driven Compressive Offloading for Edge-Assisted Semantic Video Segmentation,"Deep learning has shown impressive performance in semantic segmentation, but it is still unaffordable for resource-constrained mobile devices. While offloading computation tasks is promising, the high traffic demands overwhelm the limited bandwidth. Existing compression algorithms are not fit for semantic segmentation, as the lack of obvious and concentrated regions of interest (RoIs) forces the adoption of uniform compression strategies, leading to low compression ratios or accuracy. This paper introduces STAC, a DNN-driven compression scheme tailored for edge-assisted semantic video segmentation. STAC is the first to exploit DNN's gradients as spatial sensitivity metrics for spatial adaptive compression and achieves superior compression ratio and accuracy. Yet, it is challenging to adapt this content-customized compression to videos. Practical issues include varying spatial sensitivity and huge bandwidth consumption for compression strategy feedback and offloading. We tackle these issues through a spatiotemporal adaptive scheme, which (1) takes partial strategy generation operations offline to reduce communication load, and (2) propagates compression strategies and segmentation results across frames through dense optical flow, and adaptively offloads keyframes to accommodate video content. We implement STAC on a commodity mobile device. Experiments show that STAC can save up to 20.95% of bandwidth without losing accuracy, compared to the state-of-the-art algorithm."
Deep Hierarchical Semantic Segmentation,"Humans are able to recognize structured relations in observation, allowing us to decompose complex scenes into simpler parts and abstract the visual world in multiple levels. However, such hierarchical reasoning ability of human perception remains largely unexplored in current literature of semantic segmentation. Existing work is often aware of flatten labels and predicts target classes exclusively for each pixel. In this paper, we instead address hierarchical semantic segmentation (HSS), which aims at structured, pixel-wise description of visual observation in terms of a class hierarchy. We devise HSSN, a general HSS framework that tackles two critical issues in this task: i) how to efficiently adapt existing hierarchy-agnostic segmentation networks to the HSS setting, and ii) how to leverage the hierarchy information to regularize HSS network learning. To address i), HSSN directly casts HSS as a pixel-wise multi-label classification task, only bringing minimal architecture change to current segmentation models. To solve ii), HSSN first explores inherent properties of the hierarchy as a training objective, which enforces segmentation predictions to obey the hierarchy structure. Further, with hierarchy-induced margin constraints, HSSN reshapes the pixel embedding space, so as to generate well-structured pixel representations and improve segmentation eventually. We conduct experiments on four semantic segmentation datasets (i.e., Mapillary Vistas 2.0, Cityscapes, LIP, and PASCAL-Person-Part), with different class hierarchies, segmentation network architectures and backbones, showing the generalization and superiority of HSSN."
Feature Selective Transformer for Semantic Image Segmentation,"Recently, it has attracted more and more attentions to fuse multi-scale features for semantic image segmentation. Various works were proposed to employ progressive local or global fusion, but the feature fusions are not rich enough for modeling multi-scale context features. In this work, we focus on fusing multi-scale features from Transformer-based backbones for semantic segmentation, and propose a Feature Selective Transformer (FeSeFormer), which aggregates features from all scales (or levels) for each query feature. Specifically, we first propose a Scale-level Feature Selection (SFS) module, which can choose an informative subset from the whole multi-scale feature set for each scale, where those features that are important for the current scale (or level) are selected and the redundant are discarded. Furthermore, we propose a Full-scale Feature Fusion (FFF) module, which can adaptively fuse features of all scales for queries. Based on the proposed SFS and FFF modules, we develop a Feature Selective Transformer (FeSeFormer), and evaluate our FeSeFormer on four challenging semantic segmentation benchmarks, including PASCAL Context, ADE20K, COCO-Stuff 10K, and Cityscapes, outperforming the state-of-the-art."
Uncertainty-aware Contrastive Distillation for Incremental Semantic Segmentation,"A fundamental and challenging problem in deep learning is catastrophic forgetting, i.e. the tendency of neural networks to fail to preserve the knowledge acquired from old tasks when learning new tasks. This problem has been widely investigated in the research community and several Incremental Learning (IL) approaches have been proposed in the past years. While earlier works in computer vision have mostly focused on image classification and object detection, more recently some IL approaches for semantic segmentation have been introduced. These previous works showed that, despite its simplicity, knowledge distillation can be effectively employed to alleviate catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we follow this research direction and, inspired by recent literature on contrastive learning, we propose a novel distillation framework, Uncertainty-aware Contrastive Distillation (\method). In a nutshell, \method~is operated by introducing a novel distillation loss that takes into account all the images in a mini-batch, enforcing similarity between features associated to all the pixels from the same classes, and pulling apart those corresponding to pixels from different classes. In order to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, we contrast features of the new model with features extracted by a frozen model learned at the previous incremental step. Our experimental results demonstrate the advantage of the proposed distillation technique, which can be used in synergy with previous IL approaches, and leads to state-of-art performance on three commonly adopted benchmarks for incremental semantic segmentation. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/ygjwd12345/UCD}."
Semantic Segmentation by Early Region Proxy,"Typical vision backbones manipulate structured features. As a compromise, semantic segmentation has long been modeled as per-point prediction on dense regular grids. In this work, we present a novel and efficient modeling that starts from interpreting the image as a tessellation of learnable regions, each of which has flexible geometrics and carries homogeneous semantics. To model region-wise context, we exploit Transformer to encode regions in a sequence-to-sequence manner by applying multi-layer self-attention on the region embeddings, which serve as proxies of specific regions. Semantic segmentation is now carried out as per-region prediction on top of the encoded region embeddings using a single linear classifier, where a decoder is no longer needed. The proposed RegProxy model discards the common Cartesian feature layout and operates purely at region level. Hence, it exhibits the most competitive performance-efficiency trade-off compared with the conventional dense prediction methods. For example, on ADE20K, the small-sized RegProxy-S/16 outperforms the best CNN model using 25% parameters and 4% computation, while the largest RegProxy-L/16 achieves 52.9mIoU which outperforms the state-of-the-art by 2.1% with fewer resources. Codes and models are available at https://github.com/YiF-Zhang/RegionProxy."
Semantic-guided Disentangled Representation for Unsupervised Cross-modality Medical Image Segmentation,"Disentangled representation is a powerful technique to tackle domain shift problem in medical image analysis in unsupervised domain adaptation setting.However, previous methods only focus on exacting domain-invariant feature and ignore whether exacted feature is meaningful for downstream tasks.We propose a novel framework, called semantic-guided disentangled representation (SGDR), an effective method to exact semantically meaningful feature for segmentation task to improve performance of cross modality medical image segmentation in unsupervised domain adaptation setting. To exact the meaningful domain-invariant features of different modality, we introduce a content discriminator to force the content representation to be embedded to the same space and a feature discriminator to exact the meaningful representation.We also use pixel-level annotations to guide the encoder to learn features that are meaningful for segmentation task.We validated our method on two public datasets and experiment results show that our approach outperforms the state of the art methods on two evaluation metrics by a significant margin."
Depth Estimation vs Classification as Pre-training for Semantic Segmentation,"Training a deep neural network for semantic segmentation is labor intensive, so it is common to pre-train on a different task for which data is abundant, typically image-level classification, and then fine-tune with a small annotated dataset. There is empirical evidence showing that incorporating depth information during training may improve semantic segmentation, but the extent of this effect has yet to be fully characterized. In this paper, we study whether monocular depth estimation can serve as pre-training for semantic segmentation, ideally eliminating the need for manually supervised pre-training. Using common benchmarks such as KITTI, Cityscapes, and NYU-V2, we evaluate pre-training using depth estimation vs. classification, measuring their effects on downstream semantic segmentation. The former edges out the latter by 5.8\% mIoU and 5.2\% pixel accuracy. We analyze the impact of different forms of supervision for depth estimation, training pipelines, and data resolution on semantic fine-tuning. Additionally, we find that other forms of self-supervision are less effective than depth pre-training, including optical flow, despite sharing the same loss, namely the photometric reprojection error."
Self-supervised Semantic Segmentation Grounded in Visual Concepts,"Unsupervised semantic segmentation requires assigning a label to every pixel without any human annotations. Despite recent advances in self-supervised representation learning for individual images, unsupervised semantic segmentation with pixel-level representations is still a challenging task and remains underexplored. In this work, we propose a self-supervised pixel representation learning method for semantic segmentation by using visual concepts (i.e., groups of pixels with semantic meanings, such as parts, objects, and scenes) extracted from images. To guide self-supervised learning, we leverage three types of relationships between pixels and concepts, including the relationships between pixels and local concepts, local and global concepts, as well as the co-occurrence of concepts. We evaluate the learned pixel embeddings and visual concepts on three datasets, including PASCAL VOC 2012, COCO 2017, and DAVIS 2017. Our results show that the proposed method gains consistent and substantial improvements over recent unsupervised semantic segmentation approaches, and also demonstrate that visual concepts can reveal insights into image datasets."
Contrastive learning of Class-agnostic Activation Map for Weakly Supervised Object Localization and Semantic Segmentation,"While class activation map (CAM) generated by image classification network has been widely used for weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) and semantic segmentation (WSSS), such classifiers usually focus on discriminative object regions. In this paper, we propose Contrastive learning for Class-agnostic Activation Map (C^2AM) generation only using unlabeled image data, without the involvement of image-level supervision. The core idea comes from the observation that i) semantic information of foreground objects usually differs from their backgrounds; ii) foreground objects with similar appearance or background with similar color/texture have similar representations in the feature space. We form the positive and negative pairs based on the above relations and force the network to disentangle foreground and background with a class-agnostic activation map using a novel contrastive loss. As the network is guided to discriminate cross-image foreground-background, the class-agnostic activation maps learned by our approach generate more complete object regions. We successfully extracted from C^2AM class-agnostic object bounding boxes for object localization and background cues to refine CAM generated by classification network for semantic segmentation. Extensive experiments on CUB-200-2011, ImageNet-1K, and PASCAL VOC2012 datasets show that both WSOL and WSSS can benefit from the proposed C^2AM."
Multi-scale and Cross-scale Contrastive Learning for Semantic Segmentation,"This work considers supervised contrastive learning for semantic segmentation. We apply contrastive learning to enhance the discriminative power of the multi-scale features extracted by semantic segmentation networks. Our key methodological insight is to leverage samples from the feature spaces emanating from multiple stages of a model's encoder itself requiring neither data augmentation nor online memory banks to obtain a diverse set of samples. To allow for such an extension we introduce an efficient and effective sampling process, that enables applying contrastive losses over the encoder's features at multiple scales. Furthermore, by first mapping the encoder's multi-scale representations to a common feature space, we instantiate a novel form of supervised local-global constraint by introducing cross-scale contrastive learning linking high-resolution local features to low-resolution global features. Combined, our multi-scale and cross-scale contrastive losses boost performance of various models (DeepLabV3, HRNet, OCRNet, UPerNet) with both CNN and Transformer backbones, when evaluated on 4 diverse datasets from natural (Cityscapes, PascalContext, ADE20K) but also surgical (CaDIS) domains. Our code is available at https://github.com/RViMLab/MS_CS_ContrSeg. datasets from natural (Cityscapes, PascalContext, ADE20K) but also surgical (CaDIS) domains."
Revisiting Multi-Scale Feature Fusion for Semantic Segmentation,"It is commonly believed that high internal resolution combined with expensive operations (e.g. atrous convolutions) are necessary for accurate semantic segmentation, resulting in slow speed and large memory usage. In this paper, we question this belief and demonstrate that neither high internal resolution nor atrous convolutions are necessary. Our intuition is that although segmentation is a dense per-pixel prediction task, the semantics of each pixel often depend on both nearby neighbors and far-away context; therefore, a more powerful multi-scale feature fusion network plays a critical role. Following this intuition, we revisit the conventional multi-scale feature space (typically capped at P5) and extend it to a much richer space, up to P9, where the smallest features are only 1/512 of the input size and thus have very large receptive fields. To process such a rich feature space, we leverage the recent BiFPN to fuse the multi-scale features. Based on these insights, we develop a simplified segmentation model, named ESeg, which has neither high internal resolution nor expensive atrous convolutions. Perhaps surprisingly, our simple method can achieve better accuracy with faster speed than prior art across multiple datasets. In real-time settings, ESeg-Lite-S achieves 76.0% mIoU on CityScapes [12] at 189 FPS, outperforming FasterSeg [9] (73.1% mIoU at 170 FPS). Our ESeg-Lite-L runs at 79 FPS and achieves 80.1% mIoU, largely closing the gap between real-time and high-performance segmentation models."
StructToken : Rethinking Semantic Segmentation with Structural Prior,"In previous deep-learning-based methods, semantic segmentation has been regarded as a static or dynamic per-pixel classification task, \textit{i.e.,} classify each pixel representation to a specific category. However, these methods only focus on learning better pixel representations or classification kernels while ignoring the structural information of objects, which is critical to human decision-making mechanism. In this paper, we present a new paradigm for semantic segmentation, named structure-aware extraction. Specifically, it generates the segmentation results via the interactions between a set of learned structure tokens and the image feature, which aims to progressively extract the structural information of each category from the feature. Extensive experiments show that our StructToken outperforms the state-of-the-art on three widely-used benchmarks, including ADE20K, Cityscapes, and COCO-Stuff-10K."
DynamicEarthNet: Daily Multi-Spectral Satellite Dataset for Semantic Change Segmentation,"Earth observation is a fundamental tool for monitoring the evolution of land use in specific areas of interest. Observing and precisely defining change, in this context, requires both time-series data and pixel-wise segmentations. To that end, we propose the DynamicEarthNet dataset that consists of daily, multi-spectral satellite observations of 75 selected areas of interest distributed over the globe with imagery from Planet Labs. These observations are paired with pixel-wise monthly semantic segmentation labels of 7 land use and land cover (LULC) classes. DynamicEarthNet is the first dataset that provides this unique combination of daily measurements and high-quality labels. In our experiments, we compare several established baselines that either utilize the daily observations as additional training data (semi-supervised learning) or multiple observations at once (spatio-temporal learning) as a point of reference for future research. Finally, we propose a new evaluation metric SCS that addresses the specific challenges associated with time-series semantic change segmentation. The data is available at: https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/1650201."
3D Adapted Random Forest Vision (3DARFV) for Untangling Heterogeneous-Fabric Exceeding Deep Learning Semantic Segmentation Efficiency at the Utmost Accuracy,"Planetary exploration depends heavily on 3D image data to characterize the static and dynamic properties of the rock and environment. Analyzing 3D images requires many computations, causing efficiency to suffer lengthy processing time alongside large energy consumption. High-Performance Computing (HPC) provides apparent efficiency at the expense of energy consumption. However, for remote explorations, the conveyed surveillance and the robotized sensing need faster data analysis with ultimate accuracy to make real-time decisions. In such environments, access to HPC and energy is limited. Therefore, we realize that reducing the number of computations to optimal and maintaining the desired accuracy leads to higher efficiency. This paper demonstrates the semantic segmentation capability of a probabilistic decision tree algorithm, 3D Adapted Random Forest Vision (3DARFV), exceeding deep learning algorithm efficiency at the utmost accuracy."
GOSS: Towards Generalized Open-set Semantic Segmentation,"In this paper, we present and study a new image segmentation task, called Generalized Open-set Semantic Segmentation (GOSS). Previously, with the well-known open-set semantic segmentation (OSS), the intelligent agent only detects the unknown regions without further processing, limiting their perception of the environment. It stands to reason that a further analysis of the detected unknown pixels would be beneficial. Therefore, we propose GOSS, which unifies the abilities of two well-defined segmentation tasks, OSS and generic segmentation (GS), in a holistic way. Specifically, GOSS classifies pixels as belonging to known classes, and clusters (or groups) of pixels of unknown class are labelled as such. To evaluate this new expanded task, we further propose a metric which balances the pixel classification and clustering aspects. Moreover, we build benchmark tests on top of existing datasets and propose a simple neural architecture as a baseline, which jointly predicts pixel classification and clustering under open-set settings. Our experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our baseline. We believe our new GOSS task can produce an expressive image understanding for future research. Code will be made available."
CP2: Copy-Paste Contrastive Pretraining for Semantic Segmentation,"Recent advances in self-supervised contrastive learning yield good image-level representation, which favors classification tasks but usually neglects pixel-level detailed information, leading to unsatisfactory transfer performance to dense prediction tasks such as semantic segmentation. In this work, we propose a pixel-wise contrastive learning method called CP2 (Copy-Paste Contrastive Pretraining), which facilitates both image- and pixel-level representation learning and therefore is more suitable for downstream dense prediction tasks. In detail, we copy-paste a random crop from an image (the foreground) onto different background images and pretrain a semantic segmentation model with the objective of 1) distinguishing the foreground pixels from the background pixels, and 2) identifying the composed images that share the same foreground.Experiments show the strong performance of CP2 in downstream semantic segmentation: By finetuning CP2 pretrained models on PASCAL VOC 2012, we obtain 78.6% mIoU with a ResNet-50 and 79.5% with a ViT-S."
Panoptic segmentation with highly imbalanced semantic labels,"We describe here the panoptic segmentation method we devised for our participation in the CoNIC: Colon Nuclei Identification and Counting Challenge at ISBI 2022. Key features of our method are a weighted loss specifically engineered for semantic segmentation of highly imbalanced cell types, and a state-of-the art nuclei instance segmentation model, which we combine in a Hovernet-like architecture."
Drive&Segment: Unsupervised Semantic Segmentation of Urban Scenes via Cross-modal Distillation,"This work investigates learning pixel-wise semantic image segmentation in urban scenes without any manual annotation, just from the raw non-curated data collected by cars which, equipped with cameras and LiDAR sensors, drive around a city. Our contributions are threefold. First, we propose a novel method for cross-modal unsupervised learning of semantic image segmentation by leveraging synchronized LiDAR and image data. The key ingredient of our method is the use of an object proposal module that analyzes the LiDAR point cloud to obtain proposals for spatially consistent objects. Second, we show that these 3D object proposals can be aligned with the input images and reliably clustered into semantically meaningful pseudo-classes. Finally, we develop a cross-modal distillation approach that leverages image data partially annotated with the resulting pseudo-classes to train a transformer-based model for image semantic segmentation. We show the generalization capabilities of our method by testing on four different testing datasets (Cityscapes, Dark Zurich, Nighttime Driving and ACDC) without any finetuning, and demonstrate significant improvements compared to the current state of the art on this problem. See project webpage https://vobecant.github.io/DriveAndSegment/ for the code and more."
Tree Energy Loss: Towards Sparsely Annotated Semantic Segmentation,"Sparsely annotated semantic segmentation (SASS) aims to train a segmentation network with coarse-grained (i.e., point-, scribble-, and block-wise) supervisions, where only a small proportion of pixels are labeled in each image. In this paper, we propose a novel tree energy loss for SASS by providing semantic guidance for unlabeled pixels. The tree energy loss represents images as minimum spanning trees to model both low-level and high-level pair-wise affinities. By sequentially applying these affinities to the network prediction, soft pseudo labels for unlabeled pixels are generated in a coarse-to-fine manner, achieving dynamic online self-training. The tree energy loss is effective and easy to be incorporated into existing frameworks by combining it with a traditional segmentation loss. Compared with previous SASS methods, our method requires no multistage training strategies, alternating optimization procedures, additional supervised data, or time-consuming post-processing while outperforming them in all SASS settings. Code is available at https://github.com/megvii-research/TreeEnergyLoss."
Semantic Segmentation with Active Semi-Supervised Learning,"Using deep learning, we now have the ability to create exceptionally good semantic segmentation systems; however, collecting the prerequisite pixel-wise annotations for training images remains expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, it would be ideal to minimize the number of human annotations needed when creating a new dataset. Here, we address this problem by proposing a novel algorithm that combines active learning and semi-supervised learning. Active learning is an approach for identifying the best unlabeled samples to annotate. While there has been work on active learning for segmentation, most methods require annotating all pixel objects in each image, rather than only the most informative regions. We argue that this is inefficient. Instead, our active learning approach aims to minimize the number of annotations per-image. Our method is enriched with semi-supervised learning, where we use pseudo labels generated with a teacher-student framework to identify image regions that help disambiguate confused classes. We also integrate mechanisms that enable better performance on imbalanced label distributions, which have not been studied previously for active learning in semantic segmentation. In experiments on the CamVid and CityScapes datasets, our method obtains over 95% of the network's performance on the full-training set using less than 17% of the training data, whereas the previous state of the art required 40% of the training data."
Soft-CP: A Credible and Effective Data Augmentation for Semantic Segmentation of Medical Lesions,"The medical datasets are usually faced with the problem of scarcity and data imbalance. Moreover, annotating large datasets for semantic segmentation of medical lesions is domain-knowledge and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a new object-blend method(short in soft-CP) that combines the Copy-Paste augmentation method for semantic segmentation of medical lesions offline, ensuring the correct edge information around the lession to solve the issue above-mentioned. We proved the method's validity with several datasets in different imaging modalities. In our experiments on the KiTS19[2] dataset, Soft-CP outperforms existing medical lesions synthesis approaches. The Soft-CP augementation provides gains of +26.5% DSC in the low data regime(10% of data) and +10.2% DSC in the high data regime(all of data), In offline training data, the ratio of real images to synthetic images is 3:1."
Towards Robust Semantic Segmentation of Accident Scenes via Multi-Source Mixed Sampling and Meta-Learning,"Autonomous vehicles utilize urban scene segmentation to understand the real world like a human and react accordingly. Semantic segmentation of normal scenes has experienced a remarkable rise in accuracy on conventional benchmarks. However, a significant portion of real-life accidents features abnormal scenes, such as those with object deformations, overturns, and unexpected traffic behaviors. Since even small mis-segmentation of driving scenes can lead to serious threats to human lives, the robustness of such models in accident scenarios is an extremely important factor in ensuring safety of intelligent transportation systems.  In this paper, we propose a Multi-source Meta-learning Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (MMUDA) framework, to improve the generalization of segmentation transformers to extreme accident scenes. In MMUDA, we make use of Multi-Domain Mixed Sampling to augment the images of multiple-source domains (normal scenes) with the target data appearances (abnormal scenes). To train our model, we intertwine and study a meta-learning strategy in the multi-source setting for robustifying the segmentation results. We further enhance the segmentation backbone (SegFormer) with a HybridASPP decoder design, featuring large window attention spatial pyramid pooling and strip pooling, to efficiently aggregate long-range contextual dependencies. Our approach achieves a mIoU score of 46.97% on the DADA-seg benchmark, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art model by more than 7.50%. Code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/xinyu-laura/MMUDA."
Learning Self-Supervised Low-Rank Network for Single-Stage Weakly and Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation with limited annotations, such as weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) and semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS), is a challenging task that has attracted much attention recently. Most leading WSSS methods employ a sophisticated multi-stage training strategy to estimate pseudo-labels as precise as possible, but they suffer from high model complexity. In contrast, there exists another research line that trains a single network with image-level labels in one training cycle. However, such a single-stage strategy often performs poorly because of the compounding effect caused by inaccurate pseudo-label estimation. To address this issue, this paper presents a Self-supervised Low-Rank Network (SLRNet) for single-stage WSSS and SSSS. The SLRNet uses cross-view self-supervision, that is, it simultaneously predicts several complementary attentive LR representations from different views of an image to learn precise pseudo-labels. Specifically, we reformulate the LR representation learning as a collective matrix factorization problem and optimize it jointly with the network learning in an end-to-end manner. The resulting LR representation deprecates noisy information while capturing stable semantics across different views, making it robust to the input variations, thereby reducing overfitting to self-supervision errors. The SLRNet can provide a unified single-stage framework for various label-efficient semantic segmentation settings: 1) WSSS with image-level labeled data, 2) SSSS with a few pixel-level labeled data, and 3) SSSS with a few pixel-level labeled data and many image-level labeled data. Extensive experiments on the Pascal VOC 2012, COCO, and L2ID datasets demonstrate that our SLRNet outperforms both state-of-the-art WSSS and SSSS methods with a variety of different settings, proving its good generalizability and efficacy."
Unbiased Subclass Regularization for Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Semi-supervised semantic segmentation learns from small amounts of labelled images and large amounts of unlabelled images, which has witnessed impressive progress with the recent advance of deep neural networks. However, it often suffers from severe class-bias problem while exploring the unlabelled images, largely due to the clear pixel-wise class imbalance in the labelled images. This paper presents an unbiased subclass regularization network (USRN) that alleviates the class imbalance issue by learning class-unbiased segmentation from balanced subclass distributions. We build the balanced subclass distributions by clustering pixels of each original class into multiple subclasses of similar sizes, which provide class-balanced pseudo supervision to regularize the class-biased segmentation. In addition, we design an entropy-based gate mechanism to coordinate learning between the original classes and the clustered subclasses which facilitates subclass regularization effectively by suppressing unconfident subclass predictions. Extensive experiments over multiple public benchmarks show that USRN achieves superior performance as compared with the state-of-the-art."
ESS: Learning Event-based Semantic Segmentation from Still Images,"Retrieving accurate semantic information in challenging high dynamic range (HDR) and high-speed conditions remains an open challenge for image-based algorithms due to severe image degradations. Event cameras promise to address these challenges since they feature a much higher dynamic range and are resilient to motion blur. Nonetheless, semantic segmentation with event cameras is still in its infancy which is chiefly due to the lack of high-quality, labeled datasets. In this work, we introduce ESS (Event-based Semantic Segmentation), which tackles this problem by directly transferring the semantic segmentation task from existing labeled image datasets to unlabeled events via unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). Compared to existing UDA methods, our approach aligns recurrent, motion-invariant event embeddings with image embeddings. For this reason, our method neither requires video data nor per-pixel alignment between images and events and, crucially, does not need to hallucinate motion from still images. Additionally, we introduce DSEC-Semantic, the first large-scale event-based dataset with fine-grained labels. We show that using image labels alone, ESS outperforms existing UDA approaches, and when combined with event labels, it even outperforms state-of-the-art supervised approaches on both DDD17 and DSEC-Semantic. Finally, ESS is general-purpose, which unlocks the vast amount of existing labeled image datasets and paves the way for new and exciting research directions in new fields previously inaccessible for event cameras."
Class-Balanced Pixel-Level Self-Labeling for Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation,"Domain adaptive semantic segmentation aims to learn a model with the supervision of source domain data, and produce satisfactory dense predictions on unlabeled target domain. One popular solution to this challenging task is self-training, which selects high-scoring predictions on target samples as pseudo labels for training. However, the produced pseudo labels often contain much noise because the model is biased to source domain as well as majority categories. To address the above issues, we propose to directly explore the intrinsic pixel distributions of target domain data, instead of heavily relying on the source domain. Specifically, we simultaneously cluster pixels and rectify pseudo labels with the obtained cluster assignments. This process is done in an online fashion so that pseudo labels could co-evolve with the segmentation model without extra training rounds. To overcome the class imbalance problem on long-tailed categories, we employ a distribution alignment technique to enforce the marginal class distribution of cluster assignments to be close to that of pseudo labels. The proposed method, namely Class-balanced Pixel-level Self-Labeling (CPSL), improves the segmentation performance on target domain over state-of-the-arts by a large margin, especially on long-tailed categories."
Regional Semantic Contrast and Aggregation for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Learning semantic segmentation from weakly-labeled (e.g., image tags only) data is challenging since it is hard to infer dense object regions from sparse semantic tags. Despite being broadly studied, most current efforts directly learn from limited semantic annotations carried by individual image or image pairs, and struggle to obtain integral localization maps. Our work alleviates this from a novel perspective, by exploring rich semantic contexts synergistically among abundant weakly-labeled training data for network learning and inference. In particular, we propose regional semantic contrast and aggregation (RCA) . RCA is equipped with a regional memory bank to store massive, diverse object patterns appearing in training data, which acts as strong support for exploration of dataset-level semantic structure. Particularly, we propose i) semantic contrast to drive network learning by contrasting massive categorical object regions, leading to a more holistic object pattern understanding, and ii) semantic aggregation to gather diverse relational contexts in the memory to enrich semantic representations. In this manner, RCA earns a strong capability of fine-grained semantic understanding, and eventually establishes new state-of-the-art results on two popular benchmarks, i.e., PASCAL VOC 2012 and COCO 2014."
Hyperbolic Uncertainty Aware Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation (SS) aims to classify each pixel into one of the pre-defined classes. This task plays an important role in self-driving cars and autonomous drones. In SS, many works have shown that most misclassified pixels are commonly near object boundaries with high uncertainties. However, existing SS loss functions are not tailored to handle these uncertain pixels during training, as these pixels are usually treated equally as confidently classified pixels and cannot be embedded with arbitrary low distortion in Euclidean space, thereby degenerating the performance of SS. To overcome this problem, this paper designs a ""Hyperbolic Uncertainty Loss"" (HyperUL), which dynamically highlights the misclassified and high-uncertainty pixels in Hyperbolic space during training via the hyperbolic distances. The proposed HyperUL is model agnostic and can be easily applied to various neural architectures. After employing HyperUL to three recent SS models, the experimental results on Cityscapes and UAVid datasets reveal that the segmentation performance of existing SS models can be consistently improved."
Scribble-Supervised LiDAR Semantic Segmentation,"Densely annotating LiDAR point clouds remains too expensive and time-consuming to keep up with the ever growing volume of data. While current literature focuses on fully-supervised performance, developing efficient methods that take advantage of realistic weak supervision have yet to be explored. In this paper, we propose using scribbles to annotate LiDAR point clouds and release ScribbleKITTI, the first scribble-annotated dataset for LiDAR semantic segmentation. Furthermore, we present a pipeline to reduce the performance gap that arises when using such weak annotations. Our pipeline comprises of three stand-alone contributions that can be combined with any LiDAR semantic segmentation model to achieve up to 95.7% of the fully-supervised performance while using only 8% labeled points. Our scribble annotations and code are available at github.com/ouenal/scribblekitti."
WegFormer: Transformers for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable progress in weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS), the effective receptive field of CNN is insufficient to capture global context information, leading to sub-optimal results. Inspired by the great success of Transformers in fundamental vision areas, this work for the first time introduces Transformer to build a simple and effective WSSS framework, termed WegFormer. Unlike existing CNN-based methods, WegFormer uses Vision Transformer (ViT) as a classifier to produce high-quality pseudo segmentation masks. To this end, we introduce three tailored components in our Transformer-based framework, which are (1) a Deep Taylor Decomposition (DTD) to generate attention maps, (2) a soft erasing module to smooth the attention maps, and (3) an efficient potential object mining (EPOM) to filter noisy activation in the background. Without any bells and whistles, WegFormer achieves state-of-the-art 70.5% mIoU on the PASCAL VOC dataset, significantly outperforming the previous best method. We hope WegFormer provides a new perspective to tap the potential of Transformer in weakly supervised semantic segmentation. Code will be released."
Unsupervised Semantic Segmentation by Distilling Feature Correspondences,"Unsupervised semantic segmentation aims to discover and localize semantically meaningful categories within image corpora without any form of annotation. To solve this task, algorithms must produce features for every pixel that are both semantically meaningful and compact enough to form distinct clusters. Unlike previous works which achieve this with a single end-to-end framework, we propose to separate feature learning from cluster compactification. Empirically, we show that current unsupervised feature learning frameworks already generate dense features whose correlations are semantically consistent. This observation motivates us to design STEGO (\textbf{S}elf-supervised \textbf{T}ransformer with \textbf{E}nergy-based \textbf{G}raph \textbf{O}ptimization), a novel framework that distills unsupervised features into high-quality discrete semantic labels. At the core of STEGO is a novel contrastive loss function that encourages features to form compact clusters while preserving their relationships across the corpora. STEGO yields a significant improvement over the prior state of the art, on both the CocoStuff (\textbf{+14 mIoU}) and Cityscapes (\textbf{+9 mIoU}) semantic segmentation challenges."
RBC: Rectifying the Biased Context in Continual Semantic Segmentation,"Recent years have witnessed a great development of Convolutional Neural Networks in semantic segmentation, where all classes of training images are simultaneously available. In practice, new images are usually made available in a consecutive manner, leading to a problem called Continual Semantic Segmentation (CSS). Typically, CSS faces the forgetting problem since previous training images are unavailable, and the semantic shift problem of the background class. Considering the semantic segmentation as a context-dependent pixel-level classification task, we explore CSS from a new perspective of context analysis in this paper. We observe that the context of old-class pixels in the new images is much more biased on new classes than that in the old images, which can sharply aggravate the old-class forgetting and new-class overfitting. To tackle the obstacle, we propose a biased-context-rectified CSS framework with a context-rectified image-duplet learning scheme and a biased-context-insensitive consistency loss. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive re-weighting class-balanced learning strategy for the biased class distribution. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in existing CSS scenarios."
Smoothing Matters: Momentum Transformer for Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation,"After the great success of Vision Transformer variants (ViTs) in computer vision, it has also demonstrated great potential in domain adaptive semantic segmentation. Unfortunately, straightforwardly applying local ViTs in domain adaptive semantic segmentation does not bring in expected improvement. We find that the pitfall of local ViTs is due to the severe high-frequency components generated during both the pseudo-label construction and features alignment for target domains. These high-frequency components make the training of local ViTs very unsmooth and hurt their transferability. In this paper, we introduce a low-pass filtering mechanism, momentum network, to smooth the learning dynamics of target domain features and pseudo labels. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic of discrepancy measurement to align the distributions in the source and target domains via dynamic weights to evaluate the importance of the samples. After tackling the above issues, extensive experiments on sim2real benchmarks show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Our codes are available at https://github.com/alpc91/TransDA"
SATS: Self-Attention Transfer for Continual Semantic Segmentation,"Continually learning to segment more and more types of image regions is a desired capability for many intelligent systems. However, such continual semantic segmentation suffers from the same catastrophic forgetting issue as in continual classification learning. While multiple knowledge distillation strategies originally for continual classification have been well adapted to continual semantic segmentation, they only consider transferring old knowledge based on the outputs from one or more layers of deep fully convolutional networks. Different from existing solutions, this study proposes to transfer a new type of information relevant to knowledge, i.e. the relationships between elements (Eg. pixels or small local regions) within each image which can capture both within-class and between-class knowledge. The relationship information can be effectively obtained from the self-attention maps in a Transformer-style segmentation model. Considering that pixels belonging to the same class in each image often share similar visual properties, a class-specific region pooling is applied to provide more efficient relationship information for knowledge transfer. Extensive evaluations on multiple public benchmarks support that the proposed self-attention transfer method can further effectively alleviate the catastrophic forgetting issue, and its flexible combination with one or more widely adopted strategies significantly outperforms state-of-the-art solutions."
TransCAM: Transformer Attention-based CAM Refinement for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) with only image-level supervision is a challenging task. Most existing methods exploit Class Activation Maps (CAM) to generate pixel-level pseudo labels for supervised training. However, due to the local receptive field of Convolution Neural Networks (CNN), CAM applied to CNNs often suffers from partial activation -- highlighting the most discriminative part instead of the entire object area. In order to capture both local features and global representations, the Conformer has been proposed to combine a visual transformer branch with a CNN branch. In this paper, we propose TransCAM, a Conformer-based solution to WSSS that explicitly leverages the attention weights from the transformer branch of the Conformer to refine the CAM generated from the CNN branch. TransCAM is motivated by our observation that attention weights from shallow transformer blocks are able to capture low-level spatial feature similarities while attention weights from deep transformer blocks capture high-level semantic context. Despite its simplicity, TransCAM achieves a new state-of-the-art performance of 69.3% and 69.6% on the respective PASCAL VOC 2012 validation and test sets, showing the effectiveness of transformer attention-based refinement of CAM for WSSS."
CAR: Class-aware Regularizations for Semantic Segmentation,"Recent segmentation methods, such as OCR and CPNet, utilizing ""class level"" information in addition to pixel features, have achieved notable success for boosting the accuracy of existing network modules. However, the extracted class-level information was simply concatenated to pixel features, without explicitly being exploited for better pixel representation learning. Moreover, these approaches learn soft class centers based on coarse mask prediction, which is prone to error accumulation. In this paper, aiming to use class level information more effectively, we propose a universal Class-Aware Regularization (CAR) approach to optimize the intra-class variance and inter-class distance during feature learning, motivated by the fact that humans can recognize an object by itself no matter which other objects it appears with. Three novel loss functions are proposed. The first loss function encourages more compact class representations within each class, the second directly maximizes the distance between different class centers, and the third further pushes the distance between inter-class centers and pixels. Furthermore, the class center in our approach is directly generated from ground truth instead of from the error-prone coarse prediction. Our method can be easily applied to most existing segmentation models during training, including OCR and CPNet, and can largely improve their accuracy at no additional inference overhead. Extensive experiments and ablation studies conducted on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed CAR can boost the accuracy of all baseline models by up to 2.23% mIOU with superior generalization ability. The complete code is available at https://github.com/edwardyehuang/CAR."
ADAS: A Direct Adaptation Strategy for Multi-Target Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation,"In this paper, we present a direct adaptation strategy (ADAS), which aims to directly adapt a single model to multiple target domains in a semantic segmentation task without pretrained domain-specific models. To do so, we design a multi-target domain transfer network (MTDT-Net) that aligns visual attributes across domains by transferring the domain distinctive features through a new target adaptive denormalization (TAD) module. Moreover, we propose a bi-directional adaptive region selection (BARS) that reduces the attribute ambiguity among the class labels by adaptively selecting the regions with consistent feature statistics. We show that our single MTDT-Net can synthesize visually pleasing domain transferred images with complex driving datasets, and BARS effectively filters out the unnecessary region of training images for each target domain. With the collaboration of MTDT-Net and BARS, our ADAS achieves state-of-the-art performance for multi-target domain adaptation (MTDA). To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first MTDA method that directly adapts to multiple domains in semantic segmentation."
Representation Compensation Networks for Continual Semantic Segmentation,"In this work, we study the continual semantic segmentation problem, where the deep neural networks are required to incorporate new classes continually without catastrophic forgetting. We propose to use a structural re-parameterization mechanism, named representation compensation (RC) module, to decouple the representation learning of both old and new knowledge. The RC module consists of two dynamically evolved branches with one frozen and one trainable. Besides, we design a pooled cube knowledge distillation strategy on both spatial and channel dimensions to further enhance the plasticity and stability of the model. We conduct experiments on two challenging continual semantic segmentation scenarios, continual class segmentation and continual domain segmentation. Without any extra computational overhead and parameters during inference, our method outperforms state-of-the-art performance. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/zhangchbin/RCIL}."
Semi-supervision semantic segmentation with uncertainty-guided self cross supervision,"As a powerful way of realizing semi-supervised segmentation, the cross supervision method learns cross consistency based on independent ensemble models using abundant unlabeled images. However, the wrong pseudo labeling information generated by cross supervision would confuse the training process and negatively affect the effectiveness of the segmentation model. Besides, the training process of ensemble models in such methods also multiplies the cost of computation resources and decreases the training efficiency. To solve these problems, we propose a novel cross supervision method, namely uncertainty-guided self cross supervision (USCS). In addition to ensemble models, we first design a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) segmentation model which can generate multiple outputs with shared model and consequently impose consistency over the outputs, saving the cost on parameters and calculations. On the other hand, we employ uncertainty as guided information to encourage the model to focus on the high confident regions of pseudo labels and mitigate the effects of wrong pseudo labeling in self cross supervision, improving the performance of the segmentation model. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while saving 40.5% and 49.1% cost on parameters and calculations."
CEU-Net: Ensemble Semantic Segmentation of Hyperspectral Images Using Clustering,"Most semantic segmentation approaches of Hyperspectral images (HSIs) use and require preprocessing steps in the form of patching to accurately classify diversified land cover in remotely sensed images. These approaches use patching to incorporate the rich neighborhood information in images and exploit the simplicity and segmentability of the most common HSI datasets. In contrast, most landmasses in the world consist of overlapping and diffused classes, making neighborhood information weaker than what is seen in common HSI datasets. To combat this issue and generalize the segmentation models to more complex and diverse HSI datasets, in this work, we propose our novel flagship model: Clustering Ensemble U-Net (CEU-Net). CEU-Net uses the ensemble method to combine spectral information extracted from convolutional neural network (CNN) training on a cluster of landscape pixels. Our CEU-Net model outperforms existing state-of-the-art HSI semantic segmentation methods and gets competitive performance with and without patching when compared to baseline models. We highlight CEU-Net's high performance across Botswana, KSC, and Salinas datasets compared to HybridSN and AeroRIT methods."
CMX: Cross-Modal Fusion for RGB-X Semantic Segmentation with Transformers,"Scene understanding based on image segmentation is a crucial component for autonomous vehicles. Pixel-wise semantic segmentation of RGB images can be advanced by exploiting informative features from the supplementary modality (X-modality). In this work, we propose CMX, a transformer-based cross-modal fusion framework for RGB-X semantic segmentation. To generalize to different sensing modalities encompassing various supplements and uncertainties, we consider that comprehensive cross-modal interactions should be provided. CMX is built with two streams to extract features from RGB images and the X-modality. In each feature extraction stage, we design a Cross-Modal Feature Rectification Module (CM-FRM) to calibrate the feature of the current modality by combining the feature from the other modality, in spatial- and channel-wise dimensions. With rectified feature pairs, we deploy a Feature Fusion Module (FFM) to mix them for the final semantic prediction. FFM is constructed with a cross-attention mechanism, which enables exchange of long-range contexts, enhancing bi-modal features globally. Extensive experiments show that CMX generalizes to diverse multi-modal combinations, achieving state-of-the-art performances on five RGB-Depth benchmarks, as well as RGB-Thermal, RGB-Polarization, and RGB-LiDAR datasets. Besides, to investigate the generalizability to dense-sparse data fusion, we establish an RGB-Event semantic segmentation benchmark based on the EventScape dataset, on which CMX sets the new state-of-the-art. The source code of CMX is publicly available at https://github.com/huaaaliu/RGBX_Semantic_Segmentation."
BEVSegFormer: Bird's Eye View Semantic Segmentation From Arbitrary Camera Rigs,"Semantic segmentation in bird's eye view (BEV) is an important task for autonomous driving. Though this task has attracted a large amount of research efforts, it is still challenging to flexibly cope with arbitrary (single or multiple) camera sensors equipped on the autonomous vehicle. In this paper, we present BEVSegFormer, an effective transformer-based method for BEV semantic segmentation from arbitrary camera rigs. Specifically, our method first encodes image features from arbitrary cameras with a shared backbone. These image features are then enhanced by a deformable transformer-based encoder. Moreover, we introduce a BEV transformer decoder module to parse BEV semantic segmentation results. An efficient multi-camera deformable attention unit is designed to carry out the BEV-to-image view transformation. Finally, the queries are reshaped according the layout of grids in the BEV, and upsampled to produce the semantic segmentation result in a supervised manner. We evaluate the proposed algorithm on the public nuScenes dataset and a self-collected dataset. Experimental results show that our method achieves promising performance on BEV semantic segmentation from arbitrary camera rigs. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of each component via ablation study."
Deep Multi-Branch Aggregation Network for Real-Time Semantic Segmentation in Street Scenes,"Real-time semantic segmentation, which aims to achieve high segmentation accuracy at real-time inference speed, has received substantial attention over the past few years. However, many state-of-the-art real-time semantic segmentation methods tend to sacrifice some spatial details or contextual information for fast inference, thus leading to degradation in segmentation quality. In this paper, we propose a novel Deep Multi-branch Aggregation Network (called DMA-Net) based on the encoder-decoder structure to perform real-time semantic segmentation in street scenes. Specifically, we first adopt ResNet-18 as the encoder to efficiently generate various levels of feature maps from different stages of convolutions. Then, we develop a Multi-branch Aggregation Network (MAN) as the decoder to effectively aggregate different levels of feature maps and capture the multi-scale information. In MAN, a lattice enhanced residual block is designed to enhance feature representations of the network by taking advantage of the lattice structure. Meanwhile, a feature transformation block is introduced to explicitly transform the feature map from the neighboring branch before feature aggregation. Moreover, a global context block is used to exploit the global contextual information. These key components are tightly combined and jointly optimized in a unified network. Extensive experimental results on the challenging Cityscapes and CamVid datasets demonstrate that our proposed DMA-Net respectively obtains 77.0% and 73.6% mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) at the inference speed of 46.7 FPS and 119.8 FPS by only using a single NVIDIA GTX 1080Ti GPU. This shows that DMA-Net provides a good tradeoff between segmentation quality and speed for semantic segmentation in street scenes."
Stage-Aware Feature Alignment Network for Real-Time Semantic Segmentation of Street Scenes,"Over the past few years, deep convolutional neural network-based methods have made great progress in semantic segmentation of street scenes. Some recent methods align feature maps to alleviate the semantic gap between them and achieve high segmentation accuracy. However, they usually adopt the feature alignment modules with the same network configuration in the decoder and thus ignore the different roles of stages of the decoder during feature aggregation, leading to a complex decoder structure. Such a manner greatly affects the inference speed. In this paper, we present a novel Stage-aware Feature Alignment Network (SFANet) based on the encoder-decoder structure for real-time semantic segmentation of street scenes. Specifically, a Stage-aware Feature Alignment module (SFA) is proposed to align and aggregate two adjacent levels of feature maps effectively. In the SFA, by taking into account the unique role of each stage in the decoder, a novel stage-aware Feature Enhancement Block (FEB) is designed to enhance spatial details and contextual information of feature maps from the encoder. In this way, we are able to address the misalignment problem with a very simple and efficient multi-branch decoder structure. Moreover, an auxiliary training strategy is developed to explicitly alleviate the multi-scale object problem without bringing additional computational costs during the inference phase. Experimental results show that the proposed SFANet exhibits a good balance between accuracy and speed for real-time semantic segmentation of street scenes. In particular, based on ResNet-18, SFANet respectively obtains 78.1% and 74.7% mean of class-wise Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) at inference speeds of 37 FPS and 96 FPS on the challenging Cityscapes and CamVid test datasets by using only a single GTX 1080Ti GPU."
Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation Using Unreliable Pseudo-Labels,"The crux of semi-supervised semantic segmentation is to assign adequate pseudo-labels to the pixels of unlabeled images. A common practice is to select the highly confident predictions as the pseudo ground-truth, but it leads to a problem that most pixels may be left unused due to their unreliability. We argue that every pixel matters to the model training, even its prediction is ambiguous. Intuitively, an unreliable prediction may get confused among the top classes (i.e., those with the highest probabilities), however, it should be confident about the pixel not belonging to the remaining classes. Hence, such a pixel can be convincingly treated as a negative sample to those most unlikely categories. Based on this insight, we develop an effective pipeline to make sufficient use of unlabeled data. Concretely, we separate reliable and unreliable pixels via the entropy of predictions, push each unreliable pixel to a category-wise queue that consists of negative samples, and manage to train the model with all candidate pixels. Considering the training evolution, where the prediction becomes more and more accurate, we adaptively adjust the threshold for the reliable-unreliable partition. Experimental results on various benchmarks and training settings demonstrate the superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art alternatives."
Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation using Out-of-Distribution Data,"Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) methods are often built on pixel-level localization maps obtained from a classifier. However, training on class labels only, classifiers suffer from the spurious correlation between foreground and background cues (e.g. train and rail), fundamentally bounding the performance of WSSS. There have been previous endeavors to address this issue with additional supervision. We propose a novel source of information to distinguish foreground from the background: Out-of-Distribution (OoD) data, or images devoid of foreground object classes. In particular, we utilize the hard OoDs that the classifier is likely to make false-positive predictions. These samples typically carry key visual features on the background (e.g. rail) that the classifiers often confuse as foreground (e.g. train), so these cues let classifiers correctly suppress spurious background cues. Acquiring such hard OoDs does not require an extensive amount of annotation efforts; it only incurs a few additional image-level labeling costs on top of the original efforts to collect class labels. We propose a method, W-OoD, for utilizing the hard OoDs. W-OoD achieves state-of-the-art performance on Pascal VOC 2012."
Semantic Segmentation in Art Paintings,"Semantic segmentation is a difficult task even when trained in a supervised manner on photographs. In this paper, we tackle the problem of semantic segmentation of artistic paintings, an even more challenging task because of a much larger diversity in colors, textures, and shapes and because there are no ground truth annotations available for segmentation. We propose an unsupervised method for semantic segmentation of paintings using domain adaptation. Our approach creates a training set of pseudo-paintings in specific artistic styles by using style-transfer on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset, and then applies domain confusion between PASCAL VOC 2012 and real paintings. These two steps build on a new dataset we gathered called DRAM (Diverse Realism in Art Movements) composed of figurative art paintings from four movements, which are highly diverse in pattern, color, and geometry. To segment new paintings, we present a composite multi-domain adaptation method that trains on each sub-domain separately and composes their solutions during inference time. Our method provides better segmentation results not only on the specific artistic movements of DRAM, but also on other, unseen ones. We compare our approach to alternative methods and show applications of semantic segmentation in art paintings. The code and models for our approach are publicly available at: https://github.com/Nadavc220/SemanticSegmentationInArtPaintings."
Self-supervised Image-specific Prototype Exploration for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) based on image-level labels has attracted much attention due to low annotation costs. Existing methods often rely on Class Activation Mapping (CAM) that measures the correlation between image pixels and classifier weight. However, the classifier focuses only on the discriminative regions while ignoring other useful information in each image, resulting in incomplete localization maps. To address this issue, we propose a Self-supervised Image-specific Prototype Exploration (SIPE) that consists of an Image-specific Prototype Exploration (IPE) and a General-Specific Consistency (GSC) loss. Specifically, IPE tailors prototypes for every image to capture complete regions, formed our Image-Specific CAM (IS-CAM), which is realized by two sequential steps. In addition, GSC is proposed to construct the consistency of general CAM and our specific IS-CAM, which further optimizes the feature representation and empowers a self-correction ability of prototype exploration. Extensive experiments are conducted on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 segmentation benchmark and results show our SIPE achieves new state-of-the-art performance using only image-level labels. The code is available at https://github.com/chenqi1126/SIPE."
Multi-class Token Transformer for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"This paper proposes a new transformer-based framework to learn class-specific object localization maps as pseudo labels for weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS). Inspired by the fact that the attended regions of the one-class token in the standard vision transformer can be leveraged to form a class-agnostic localization map, we investigate if the transformer model can also effectively capture class-specific attention for more discriminative object localization by learning multiple class tokens within the transformer. To this end, we propose a Multi-class Token Transformer, termed as MCTformer, which uses multiple class tokens to learn interactions between the class tokens and the patch tokens. The proposed MCTformer can successfully produce class-discriminative object localization maps from class-to-patch attentions corresponding to different class tokens. We also propose to use a patch-level pairwise affinity, which is extracted from the patch-to-patch transformer attention, to further refine the localization maps. Moreover, the proposed framework is shown to fully complement the Class Activation Mapping (CAM) method, leading to remarkably superior WSSS results on the PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets. These results underline the importance of the class token for WSSS."
Adversarial Dual-Student with Differentiable Spatial Warping for Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"A common challenge posed to robust semantic segmentation is the expensive data annotation cost. Existing semi-supervised solutions show great potential for solving this problem. Their key idea is constructing consistency regularization with unsupervised data augmentation from unlabeled data for model training. The perturbations for unlabeled data enable the consistency training loss, which benefits semi-supervised semantic segmentation. However, these perturbations destroy image context and introduce unnatural boundaries, which is harmful for semantic segmentation. Besides, the widely adopted semi-supervised learning framework, i.e. mean-teacher, suffers performance limitation since the student model finally converges to the teacher model. In this paper, first of all, we propose a context friendly differentiable geometric warping to conduct unsupervised data augmentation; secondly, a novel adversarial dual-student framework is proposed to improve the Mean-Teacher from the following two aspects: (1) dual student models are learned independently except for a stabilization constraint to encourage exploiting model diversities; (2) adversarial training scheme is applied to both students and the discriminators are resorted to distinguish reliable pseudo-label of unlabeled data for self-training. Effectiveness is validated via extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC2012 and Cityscapes. Our solution significantly improves the performance and state-of-the-art results are achieved on both datasets. Remarkably, compared with fully supervision, our solution achieves comparable mIoU of 73.4% using only 12.5% annotated data on PASCAL VOC2012. Our codes and models are available at https://github.com/cao-cong/ADS-SemiSeg."
Cross Language Image Matching for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"It has been widely known that CAM (Class Activation Map) usually only activates discriminative object regions and falsely includes lots of object-related backgrounds. As only a fixed set of image-level object labels are available to the WSSS (weakly supervised semantic segmentation) model, it could be very difficult to suppress those diverse background regions consisting of open set objects. In this paper, we propose a novel Cross Language Image Matching (CLIMS) framework, based on the recently introduced Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model, for WSSS. The core idea of our framework is to introduce natural language supervision to activate more complete object regions and suppress closely-related open background regions. In particular, we design object, background region and text label matching losses to guide the model to excite more reasonable object regions for CAM of each category. In addition, we design a co-occurring background suppression loss to prevent the model from activating closely-related background regions, with a predefined set of class-related background text descriptions. These designs enable the proposed CLIMS to generate a more complete and compact activation map for the target objects. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC2012 dataset show that our CLIMS significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods."
Learning Affinity from Attention: End-to-End Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation with Transformers,"Weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) with image-level labels is an important and challenging task. Due to the high training efficiency, end-to-end solutions for WSSS have received increasing attention from the community. However, current methods are mainly based on convolutional neural networks and fail to explore the global information properly, thus usually resulting in incomplete object regions. In this paper, to address the aforementioned problem, we introduce Transformers, which naturally integrate global information, to generate more integral initial pseudo labels for end-to-end WSSS. Motivated by the inherent consistency between the self-attention in Transformers and the semantic affinity, we propose an Affinity from Attention (AFA) module to learn semantic affinity from the multi-head self-attention (MHSA) in Transformers. The learned affinity is then leveraged to refine the initial pseudo labels for segmentation. In addition, to efficiently derive reliable affinity labels for supervising AFA and ensure the local consistency of pseudo labels, we devise a Pixel-Adaptive Refinement module that incorporates low-level image appearance information to refine the pseudo labels. We perform extensive experiments and our method achieves 66.0% and 38.9% mIoU on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 datasets, respectively, significantly outperforming recent end-to-end methods and several multi-stage competitors. Code is available at https://github.com/rulixiang/afa."
Adaptive Path Planning for UAVs for Multi-Resolution Semantic Segmentation,"Efficient data collection methods play a major role in helping us better understand the Earth and its ecosystems. In many applications, the usage of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for monitoring and remote sensing is rapidly gaining momentum due to their high mobility, low cost, and flexible deployment. A key challenge is planning missions to maximize the value of acquired data in large environments given flight time limitations. This is, for example, relevant for monitoring agricultural fields. This paper addresses the problem of adaptive path planning for accurate semantic segmentation of using UAVs. We propose an online planning algorithm which adapts the UAV paths to obtain high-resolution semantic segmentations necessary in areas with fine details as they are detected in incoming images. This enables us to perform close inspections at low altitudes only where required, without wasting energy on exhaustive mapping at maximum image resolution. A key feature of our approach is a new accuracy model for deep learning-based architectures that captures the relationship between UAV altitude and semantic segmentation accuracy. We evaluate our approach on different domains using real-world data, proving the efficacy and generability of our solution."
SegTAD: Precise Temporal Action Detection via Semantic Segmentation,"Temporal action detection (TAD) is an important yet challenging task in video analysis. Most existing works draw inspiration from image object detection and tend to reformulate it as a proposal generation - classification problem. However, there are two caveats with this paradigm. First, proposals are not equipped with annotated labels, which have to be empirically compiled, thus the information in the annotations is not necessarily precisely employed in the model training process. Second, there are large variations in the temporal scale of actions, and neglecting this fact may lead to deficient representation in the video features. To address these issues and precisely model temporal action detection, we formulate the task of temporal action detection in a novel perspective of semantic segmentation. Owing to the 1-dimensional property of TAD, we are able to convert the coarse-grained detection annotations to fine-grained semantic segmentation annotations for free. We take advantage of them to provide precise supervision so as to mitigate the impact induced by the imprecise proposal labels. We propose an end-to-end framework SegTAD composed of a 1D semantic segmentation network (1D-SSN) and a proposal detection network (PDN)."
Bending Reality: Distortion-aware Transformers for Adapting to Panoramic Semantic Segmentation,"Panoramic images with their 360-degree directional view encompass exhaustive information about the surrounding space, providing a rich foundation for scene understanding. To unfold this potential in the form of robust panoramic segmentation models, large quantities of expensive, pixel-wise annotations are crucial for success. Such annotations are available, but predominantly for narrow-angle, pinhole-camera images which, off the shelf, serve as sub-optimal resources for training panoramic models. Distortions and the distinct image-feature distribution in 360-degree panoramas impede the transfer from the annotation-rich pinhole domain and therefore come with a big dent in performance. To get around this domain difference and bring together semantic annotations from pinhole- and 360-degree surround-visuals, we propose to learn object deformations and panoramic image distortions in the Deformable Patch Embedding (DPE) and Deformable MLP (DMLP) components which blend into our Transformer for PAnoramic Semantic Segmentation (Trans4PASS) model. Finally, we tie together shared semantics in pinhole- and panoramic feature embeddings by generating multi-scale prototype features and aligning them in our Mutual Prototypical Adaptation (MPA) for unsupervised domain adaptation. On the indoor Stanford2D3D dataset, our Trans4PASS with MPA maintains comparable performance to fully-supervised state-of-the-arts, cutting the need for over 1,400 labeled panoramas. On the outdoor DensePASS dataset, we break state-of-the-art by 14.39% mIoU and set the new bar at 56.38%. Code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/jamycheung/Trans4PASS."
Conditional Reconstruction for Open-set Semantic Segmentation,"Open set segmentation is a relatively new and unexploredtask, with just a handful of methods proposed to model suchtasks.We propose a novel method called CoReSeg thattackles the issue using class conditional reconstruction ofthe input images according to their pixelwise mask. Ourmethod conditions each input pixel to all known classes,expecting higher errors for pixels of unknown classes. Itwas observed that the proposed method produces better se-mantic consistency in its predictions, resulting in cleanersegmentation maps that better fit object boundaries. CoRe-Seg outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the Vaihin-gen and Potsdam ISPRS datasets, while also being com-petitive on the Houston 2018 IEEE GRSS Data Fusiondataset.

Improving Lidar-Based Semantic Segmentation of Top-View Grid Maps by Learning Features in Complementary Representations,"In this paper we introduce a novel way to predict semantic information from sparse, single-shot LiDAR measurements in the context of autonomous driving. In particular, we fuse learned features from complementary representations. The approach is aimed specifically at improving the semantic segmentation of top-view grid maps. Towards this goal the 3D LiDAR point cloud is projected onto two orthogonal 2D representations. For each representation a tailored deep learning architecture is developed to effectively extract semantic information which are fused by a superordinate deep neural network. The contribution of this work is threefold: (1) We examine different stages within the segmentation network for fusion. (2) We quantify the impact of embedding different features. (3) We use the findings of this survey to design a tailored deep neural network architecture leveraging respective advantages of different representations. Our method is evaluated using the SemanticKITTI dataset which provides a point-wise semantic annotation of more than 23.000 LiDAR measurements."
Continual BatchNorm Adaptation (CBNA) for Semantic Segmentation,"Environment perception in autonomous driving vehicles often heavily relies on deep neural networks (DNNs), which are subject to domain shifts, leading to a significantly decreased performance during DNN deployment. Usually, this problem is addressed by unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) approaches trained either simultaneously on source and target domain datasets or even source-free only on target data in an offline fashion. In this work, we further expand a source-free UDA approach to a continual and therefore online-capable UDA on a single-image basis for semantic segmentation. Accordingly, our method only requires the pre-trained model from the supplier (trained in the source domain) and the current (unlabeled target domain) camera image. Our method Continual BatchNorm Adaptation (CBNA) modifies the source domain statistics in the batch normalization layers, using target domain images in an unsupervised fashion, which yields consistent performance improvements during inference. Thereby, in contrast to existing works, our approach can be applied to improve a DNN continuously on a single-image basis during deployment without access to source data, without algorithmic delay, and nearly without computational overhead. We show the consistent effectiveness of our method across a wide variety of source/target domain settings for semantic segmentation. Code is available at https://github.com/ifnspaml/CBNA."
Class Re-Activation Maps for Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Extracting class activation maps (CAM) is arguably the most standard step of generating pseudo masks for weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS). Yet, we find that the crux of the unsatisfactory pseudo masks is the binary cross-entropy loss (BCE) widely used in CAM. Specifically, due to the sum-over-class pooling nature of BCE, each pixel in CAM may be responsive to multiple classes co-occurring in the same receptive field. As a result, given a class, its hot CAM pixels may wrongly invade the area belonging to other classes, or the non-hot ones may be actually a part of the class. To this end, we introduce an embarrassingly simple yet surprisingly effective method: Reactivating the converged CAM with BCE by using softmax cross-entropy loss (SCE), dubbed \textbf{ReCAM}. Given an image, we use CAM to extract the feature pixels of each single class, and use them with the class label to learn another fully-connected layer (after the backbone) with SCE. Once converged, we extract ReCAM in the same way as in CAM. Thanks to the contrastive nature of SCE, the pixel response is disentangled into different classes and hence less mask ambiguity is expected. The evaluation on both PASCAL VOC and MS~COCO shows that ReCAM not only generates high-quality masks, but also supports plug-and-play in any CAM variant with little overhead."
Embodied Active Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation via Informative Path Planning,"This work presents an embodied agent that can adapt its semantic segmentation network to new indoor environments in a fully autonomous way. Because semantic segmentation networks fail to generalize well to unseen environments, the agent collects images of the new environment which are then used for self-supervised domain adaptation. We formulate this as an informative path planning problem, and present a novel information gain that leverages uncertainty extracted from the semantic model to safely collect relevant data. As domain adaptation progresses, these uncertainties change over time and the rapid learning feedback of our system drives the agent to collect different data. Experiments show that our method adapts to new environments faster and with higher final performance compared to an exploration objective, and can successfully be deployed to real-world environments on physical robots."
Boundary Corrected Multi-scale Fusion Network for Real-time Semantic Segmentation,"Image semantic segmentation aims at the pixel-level classification of images, which has requirements for both accuracy and speed in practical application. Existing semantic segmentation methods mainly rely on the high-resolution input to achieve high accuracy and do not meet the requirements of inference time. Although some methods focus on high-speed scene parsing with lightweight architectures, they can not fully mine semantic features under low computation with relatively low performance. To realize the real-time and high-precision segmentation, we propose a new method named Boundary Corrected Multi-scale Fusion Network, which uses the designed Low-resolution Multi-scale Fusion Module to extract semantic information. Moreover, to deal with boundary errors caused by low-resolution feature map fusion, we further design an additional Boundary Corrected Loss to constrain overly smooth features. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves a state-of-the-art balance of accuracy and speed for the real-time semantic segmentation."
Understanding the Challenges When 3D Semantic Segmentation Faces Class Imbalanced and OOD Data,"3D semantic segmentation (3DSS) is an essential process in the creation of a safe autonomous driving system. However, deep learning models for 3D semantic segmentation often suffer from the class imbalance problem and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. In this study, we explore how the class imbalance problem affects 3DSS performance and whether the model can detect the category prediction correctness, or whether data is ID (in-distribution) or OOD. For these purposes, we conduct two experiments using three representative 3DSS models and five trust scoring methods, and conduct both a confusion and feature analysis of each class. Furthermore, a data augmentation method for the 3D LiDAR dataset is proposed to create a new dataset based on SemanticKITTI and SemanticPOSS, called AugKITTI. We propose the wPre metric and TSD for a more in-depth analysis of the results, and follow are proposals with an insightful discussion. Based on the experimental results, we find that: (1) the classes are not only imbalanced in their data size but also in the basic properties of each semantic category. (2) The intraclass diversity and interclass ambiguity make class learning difficult and greatly limit the models' performance, creating the challenges of semantic and data gaps. (3) The trust scores are unreliable for classes whose features are confused with other classes. For 3DSS models, those misclassified ID classes and OODs may also be given high trust scores, making the 3DSS predictions unreliable, and leading to the challenges in judging 3DSS result trustworthiness. All of these outcomes point to several research directions for improving the performance and reliability of the 3DSS models used for real-world applications."
Simultaneous Semantic and Instance Segmentation for Colon Nuclei Identification and Counting,"We address the problem of automated nuclear segmentation, classification, and quantification from Haematoxylin and Eosin stained histology images, which is of great relevance for several downstream computational pathology applications. In this work, we present a solution framed as a simultaneous semantic and instance segmentation framework. Our solution is part of the Colon Nuclei Identification and Counting (CoNIC) Challenge. We first train a semantic and instance segmentation model separately. Our framework uses as backbone HoverNet and Cascade Mask-RCNN models. We then ensemble the results with a custom Non-Maximum Suppression embedding (NMS). In our framework, the semantic model computes a class prediction for the cells whilst the instance model provides a refined segmentation. We demonstrate, through our experimental results, that our model outperforms the provided baselines by a large margin."
Learning Semantic Segmentation from Multiple Datasets with Label Shifts,"With increasing applications of semantic segmentation, numerous datasets have been proposed in the past few years. Yet labeling remains expensive, thus, it is desirable to jointly train models across aggregations of datasets to enhance data volume and diversity. However, label spaces differ across datasets and may even be in conflict with one another. This paper proposes UniSeg, an effective approach to automatically train models across multiple datasets with differing label spaces, without any manual relabeling efforts. Specifically, we propose two losses that account for conflicting and co-occurring labels to achieve better generalization performance in unseen domains. First, a gradient conflict in training due to mismatched label spaces is identified and a class-independent binary cross-entropy loss is proposed to alleviate such label conflicts. Second, a loss function that considers class-relationships across datasets is proposed for a better multi-dataset training scheme. Extensive quantitative and qualitative analyses on road-scene datasets show that UniSeg improves over multi-dataset baselines, especially on unseen datasets, e.g., achieving more than 8% gain in IoU on KITTI averaged over all the settings."
FedDrive: Generalizing Federated Learning to Semantic Segmentation in Autonomous Driving,"Semantic Segmentation is essential to make self-driving vehicles autonomous, enabling them to understand their surroundings by assigning individual pixels to known categories. However, it operates on sensible data collected from the users' cars; thus, protecting the clients' privacy becomes a primary concern. For similar reasons, Federated Learning has been recently introduced as a new machine learning paradigm aiming to learn a global model while preserving privacy and leveraging data on millions of remote devices. Despite several efforts on this topic, no work has explicitly addressed the challenges of federated learning in semantic segmentation for driving so far. To fill this gap, we propose FedDrive, a new benchmark consisting of three settings and two datasets, incorporating the real-world challenges of statistical heterogeneity and domain generalization. We benchmark state-of-the-art algorithms from the federated learning literature through an in-depth analysis, combining them with style transfer methods to improve their generalization ability. We demonstrate that correctly handling normalization statistics is crucial to deal with the aforementioned challenges. Furthermore, style transfer improves performance when dealing with significant appearance shifts. Official website: https://feddrive.github.io."
TransKD: Transformer Knowledge Distillation for Efficient Semantic Segmentation,"Large pre-trained transformers are on top of contemporary semantic segmentation benchmarks, but come with high computational cost and a lengthy training. To lift this constraint, we look at efficient semantic segmentation from a perspective of comprehensive knowledge distillation and consider to bridge the gap between multi-source knowledge extractions and transformer-specific patch embeddings. We put forward the Transformer-based Knowledge Distillation (TransKD) framework which learns compact student transformers by distilling both feature maps and patch embeddings of large teacher transformers, bypassing the long pre-training process and reducing the FLOPs by >85.0%. Specifically, we propose two fundamental and two optimization modules: (1) Cross Selective Fusion (CSF) enables knowledge transfer between cross-stage features via channel attention and feature map distillation within hierarchical transformers; (2) Patch Embedding Alignment (PEA) performs dimensional transformation within the patchifying process to facilitate the patch embedding distillation; (3) Global-Local Context Mixer (GL-Mixer) extracts both global and local information of a representative embedding; (4) Embedding Assistant (EA) acts as an embedding method to seamlessly bridge teacher and student models with the teacher's number of channels. Experiments on Cityscapes, ACDC, and NYUv2 datasets show that TransKD outperforms state-of-the-art distillation frameworks and rivals the time-consuming pre-training method. Code is available at https://github.com/RuipingL/TransKD."
Meta-RangeSeg: LiDAR Sequence Semantic Segmentation Using Multiple Feature Aggregation,"LiDAR sensor is essential to the perception system in autonomous vehicles and intelligent robots. To fulfill the real-time requirements in real-world applications, it is necessary to efficiently segment the LiDAR scans. Most of previous approaches directly project 3D point cloud onto the 2D spherical range image so that they can make use of the efficient 2D convolutional operations for image segmentation. Although having achieved the encouraging results, the neighborhood information is not well-preserved in the spherical projection. Moreover, the temporal information is not taken into consideration in the single scan segmentation task. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel approach to semantic segmentation for LiDAR sequences named Meta-RangeSeg, where a new range residual image representation is introduced to capture the spatial-temporal information. Specifically, Meta-Kernel is employed to extract the meta features, which reduces the inconsistency between the 2D range image coordinates input and 3D Cartesian coordinates output. An efficient U-Net backbone is used to obtain the multi-scale features. Furthermore, Feature Aggregation Module (FAM) strengthens the role of range channel and aggregates features at different levels. We have conducted extensive experiments for performance evaluation on SemanticKITTI and SemanticPOSS. The promising results show that our proposed Meta-RangeSeg method is more efficient and effective than the existing approaches. Our full implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/songw-zju/Meta-RangeSeg ."
DGSS : Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation using Iterative Style Mining and Latent Representation Alignment,"Semantic segmentation algorithms require access to well-annotated datasets captured under diverse illumination conditions to ensure consistent performance. However, poor visibility conditions at varying illumination conditions result in laborious and error-prone labeling. Alternatively, using synthetic samples to train segmentation algorithms has gained interest with the drawback of domain gap that results in sub-optimal performance. While current state-of-the-art (SoTA) have proposed different mechanisms to bridge the domain gap, they still perform poorly in low illumination conditions with an average performance drop of - 10.7 mIOU. In this paper, we focus upon single source domain generalization to overcome the domain gap and propose a two-step framework wherein we first identify an adversarial style that maximizes the domain gap between stylized and source images. Subsequently, these stylized images are used to categorically align features such that features belonging to the same class are clustered together in latent space, irrespective of domain gap. Furthermore, to increase intra-class variance while training, we propose a style mixing mechanism wherein the same objects from different styles are mixed to construct a new training image. This framework allows us to achieve a domain generalized semantic segmentation algorithm with consistent performance without prior information of the target domain while relying on a single source. Based on extensive experiments, we match SoTA performance on SYNTHIA \to Cityscapes, GTAV \to Cityscapes while setting new SoTA on GTAV \to Dark Zurich and GTAV \to Night Driving benchmarks without retraining."
Active Learning for Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation via Spatial-Structural Diversity Reasoning,"The expensive annotation cost is notoriously known as the main constraint for the development of the point cloud semantic segmentation technique. Active learning methods endeavor to reduce such cost by selecting and labeling only a subset of the point clouds, yet previous attempts ignore the spatial-structural diversity of the selected samples, inducing the model to select clustered candidates with similar shapes in a local area while missing other representative ones in the global environment. In this paper, we propose a new 3D region-based active learning method to tackle this problem. Dubbed SSDR-AL, our method groups the original point clouds into superpoints and incrementally selects the most informative and representative ones for label acquisition. We achieve the selection mechanism via a graph reasoning network that considers both the spatial and structural diversities of superpoints. To deploy SSDR-AL in a more practical scenario, we design a noise-aware iterative labeling strategy to confront the ""noisy annotation"" problem introduced by the previous ""dominant labeling"" strategy in superpoints. Extensive experiments on two point cloud benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of SSDR-AL in the semantic segmentation task. Particularly, SSDR-AL significantly outperforms the baseline method and reduces the annotation cost by up to 63.0% and 24.0% when achieving 90% performance of fully supervised learning, respectively."
RescueNet: A High Resolution UAV Semantic Segmentation Benchmark Dataset for Natural Disaster Damage Assessment,"Due to climate change, we can observe a recent surge of natural disasters all around the world. These disasters are causing disastrous impact on both nature and human lives. Economic losses are getting greater due to the hurricanes. Quick and prompt response of the rescue teams are crucial in saving human lives and reducing economic cost. Deep learning based computer vision techniques can help in scene understanding, and help rescue teams with precise damage assessment. Semantic segmentation, an active research area in computer vision, can put labels to each pixel of an image, and therefore can be a valuable arsenal in the effort of reducing the impacts of hurricanes. Unfortunately, available datasets for natural disaster damage assessment lack detailed annotation of the affected areas, and therefore do not support the deep learning models in total damage assessment. To this end, we introduce the RescueNet, a high resolution post disaster dataset, for semantic segmentation to assess damages after natural disasters. The RescueNet consists of post disaster images collected after Hurricane Michael. The data is collected using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) from several areas impacted by the hurricane. The uniqueness of the RescueNet comes from the fact that this dataset provides high resolution post-disaster images and comprehensive annotation of each image. While most of the existing dataset offer annotation of only part of the scene, like building, road, or river, RescueNet provides pixel level annotation of all the classes including building, road, pool, tree, debris, and so on. We further analyze the usefulness of the dataset by implementing state-of-the-art segmentation models on the RescueNet. The experiments demonstrate that our dataset can be valuable in further improvement of the existing methodologies for natural disaster damage assessment."
Fully Self-Supervised Learning for Semantic Segmentation,"In this work, we present a fully self-supervised framework for semantic segmentation(FS^4). A fully bootstrapped strategy for semantic segmentation, which saves efforts for the huge amount of annotation, is crucial for building customized models from end-to-end for open-world domains. This application is eagerly needed in realistic scenarios. Even though recent self-supervised semantic segmentation methods have gained great progress, these works however heavily depend on the fully-supervised pretrained model and make it impossible a fully self-supervised pipeline. To solve this problem, we proposed a bootstrapped training scheme for semantic segmentation, which fully leveraged the global semantic knowledge for self-supervision with our proposed PGG strategy and CAE module. In particular, we perform pixel clustering and assignments for segmentation supervision. Preventing it from clustering a mess, we proposed 1) a pyramid-global-guided (PGG) training strategy to supervise the learning with pyramid image/patch-level pseudo labels, which are generated by grouping the unsupervised features. The stable global and pyramid semantic pseudo labels can prevent the segmentation from learning too many clutter regions or degrading to one background region; 2) in addition, we proposed context-aware embedding (CAE) module to generate global feature embedding in view of its neighbors close both in space and appearance in a non-trivial way. We evaluate our method on the large-scale COCO-Stuff dataset and achieved 7.19 mIoU improvements on both things and stuff objects"
SLRNet: Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation Via Label Reuse for Human Decomposition Images,"Semantic segmentation is a challenging computer vision task demanding a significant amount of pixel-level annotated data. Producing such data is a time-consuming and costly process, especially for domains with a scarcity of experts, such as medicine or forensic anthropology. While numerous semi-supervised approaches have been developed to make the most from the limited labeled data and ample amount of unlabeled data, domain-specific real-world datasets often have characteristics that both reduce the effectiveness of off-the-shelf state-of-the-art methods and also provide opportunities to create new methods that exploit these characteristics. We propose and evaluate a semi-supervised method that reuses available labels for unlabeled images of a dataset by exploiting existing similarities, while dynamically weighting the impact of these reused labels in the training process. We evaluate our method on a large dataset of human decomposition images and find that our method, while conceptually simple, outperforms state-of-the-art consistency and pseudo-labeling-based methods for the segmentation of this dataset. This paper includes graphic content of human decomposition."
GroupViT: Semantic Segmentation Emerges from Text Supervision,"Grouping and recognition are important components of visual scene understanding, e.g., for object detection and semantic segmentation. With end-to-end deep learning systems, grouping of image regions usually happens implicitly via top-down supervision from pixel-level recognition labels. Instead, in this paper, we propose to bring back the grouping mechanism into deep networks, which allows semantic segments to emerge automatically with only text supervision. We propose a hierarchical Grouping Vision Transformer (GroupViT), which goes beyond the regular grid structure representation and learns to group image regions into progressively larger arbitrary-shaped segments. We train GroupViT jointly with a text encoder on a large-scale image-text dataset via contrastive losses. With only text supervision and without any pixel-level annotations, GroupViT learns to group together semantic regions and successfully transfers to the task of semantic segmentation in a zero-shot manner, i.e., without any further fine-tuning. It achieves a zero-shot accuracy of 52.3% mIoU on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and 22.4% mIoU on PASCAL Context datasets, and performs competitively to state-of-the-art transfer-learning methods requiring greater levels of supervision. We open-source our code at https://github.com/NVlabs/GroupViT ."
PointMatch: A Consistency Training Framework for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation of 3D Point Clouds,"Semantic segmentation of point cloud usually relies on dense annotation that is exhausting and costly, so it attracts wide attention to investigate solutions for the weakly supervised scheme with only sparse points annotated. Existing works start from the given labels and propagate them to highly-related but unlabeled points, with the guidance of data, e.g. intra-point relation. However, it suffers from (i) the inefficient exploitation of data information, and (ii) the strong reliance on labels thus is easily suppressed when given much fewer annotations. Therefore, we propose a novel framework, PointMatch, that stands on both data and label, by applying consistency regularization to sufficiently probe information from data itself and leveraging weak labels as assistance at the same time. By doing so, meaningful information can be learned from both data and label for better representation learning, which also enables the model more robust to the extent of label sparsity. Simple yet effective, the proposed PointMatch achieves the state-of-the-art performance under various weakly-supervised schemes on both ScanNet-v2 and S3DIS datasets, especially on the settings with extremely sparse labels, e.g. surpassing SQN by 21.2% and 17.2% on the 0.01% and 0.1% setting of ScanNet-v2, respectively."
PCSCNet: Fast 3D Semantic Segmentation of LiDAR Point Cloud for Autonomous Car using Point Convolution and Sparse Convolution Network,"The autonomous car must recognize the driving environment quickly for safe driving. As the Light Detection And Range (LiDAR) sensor is widely used in the autonomous car, fast semantic segmentation of LiDAR point cloud, which is the point-wise classification of the point cloud within the sensor framerate, has attracted attention in recognition of the driving environment. Although the voxel and fusion-based semantic segmentation models are the state-of-the-art model in point cloud semantic segmentation recently, their real-time performance suffer from high computational load due to high voxel resolution. In this paper, we propose the fast voxel-based semantic segmentation model using Point Convolution and 3D Sparse Convolution (PCSCNet). The proposed model is designed to outperform at both high and low voxel resolution using point convolution-based feature extraction. Moreover, the proposed model accelerates the feature propagation using 3D sparse convolution after the feature extraction. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art real-time models in semantic segmentation of SemanticKITTI and nuScenes, and achieves the real-time performance in LiDAR point cloud inference."
An Active and Contrastive Learning Framework for Fine-Grained Off-Road Semantic Segmentation,"Off-road semantic segmentation with fine-grained labels is necessary for autonomous vehicles to understand driving scenes, as the coarse-grained road detection can not satisfy off-road vehicles with various mechanical properties. Fine-grained semantic segmentation in off-road scenes usually has no unified category definition due to ambiguous nature environments, and the cost of pixel-wise labeling is extremely high. Furthermore, semantic properties of off-road scenes can be very changeable due to various precipitations, temperature, defoliation, etc. To address these challenges, this research proposes an active and contrastive learning-based method that does not rely on pixel-wise labels, but only on patch-based weak annotations for model learning. There is no need for predefined semantic categories, the contrastive learning-based feature representation and adaptive clustering will discover the category model from scene data. In order to actively adapt to new scenes, a risk evaluation method is proposed to discover and select hard frames with high-risk predictions for supplemental labeling, so as to update the model efficiently. Experiments conducted on our self-developed off-road dataset and DeepScene dataset demonstrate that fine-grained semantic segmentation can be learned with only dozens of weakly labeled frames, and the model can efficiently adapt across scenes by weak supervision, while achieving almost the same level of performance as typical fully supervised baselines."
Detecting and Learning the Unknown in Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation is a crucial component for perception in automated driving. Deep neural networks (DNNs) are commonly used for this task and they are usually trained on a closed set of object classes appearing in a closed operational domain. However, this is in contrast to the open world assumption in automated driving that DNNs are deployed to. Therefore, DNNs necessarily face data that they have never encountered previously, also known as anomalies, which are extremely safety-critical to properly cope with. In this work, we first give an overview about anomalies from an information-theoretic perspective. Next, we review research in detecting semantically unknown objects in semantic segmentation. We demonstrate that training for high entropy responses on anomalous objects outperforms other recent methods, which is in line with our theoretical findings. Moreover, we examine a method to assess the occurrence frequency of anomalies in order to select anomaly types to include into a model's set of semantic categories. We demonstrate that these anomalies can then be learned in an unsupervised fashion, which is particularly suitable in online applications based on deep learning."
Few-shot semantic segmentation via mask aggregation,"Few-shot semantic segmentation aims to recognize novel classes with only very few labelled data. This challenging task requires mining of the relevant relationships between the query image and the support images. Previous works have typically regarded it as a pixel-wise classification problem. Therefore, various models have been designed to explore the correlation of pixels between the query image and the support images. However, they focus only on pixel-wise correspondence and ignore the overall correlation of objects. In this paper, we introduce a mask-based classification method for addressing this problem. The mask aggregation network (MANet), which is a simple mask classification model, is proposed to simultaneously generate a fixed number of masks and their probabilities of being targets. Then, the final segmentation result is obtained by aggregating all the masks according to their locations. Experiments on both the PASCAL-5^i and COCO-20^i datasets show that our method performs comparably to the state-of-the-art pixel-based methods. This competitive performance demonstrates the potential of mask classification as an alternative baseline method in few-shot semantic segmentation. Our source code will be made available at https://github.com/TinyAway/MANet."
COLA: COarse LAbel pre-training for 3D semantic segmentation of sparse LiDAR datasets,"Transfer learning is a proven technique in 2D computer vision to leverage the large amount of data available and achieve high performance with datasets limited in size due to the cost of acquisition or annotation. In 3D, annotation is known to be a costly task; nevertheless, pre-training methods have only recently been investigated. Due to this cost, unsupervised pre-training has been heavily favored. In this work, we tackle the case of real-time 3D semantic segmentation of sparse autonomous driving LiDAR scans. Such datasets have been increasingly released, but each has a unique label set. We propose here an intermediate-level label set called coarse labels, which can easily be used on any existing and future autonomous driving datasets, thus allowing all the data available to be leveraged at once without any additional manual labeling. This way, we have access to a larger dataset, alongside a simple task of semantic segmentation. With it, we introduce a new pre-training task: coarse label pre-training, also called COLA. We thoroughly analyze the impact of COLA on various datasets and architectures and show that it yields a noticeable performance improvement, especially when only a small dataset is available for the finetuning task."
Task-Adaptive Feature Transformer with Semantic Enrichment for Few-Shot Segmentation,"Few-shot learning allows machines to classify novel classes using only a few labeled samples. Recently, few-shot segmentation aiming at semantic segmentation on low sample data has also seen great interest. In this paper, we propose a learnable module that can be placed on top of existing segmentation networks for performing few-shot segmentation. This module, called the task-adaptive feature transformer (TAFT), linearly transforms task-specific high-level features to a set of task agnostic features well-suited to conducting few-shot segmentation. The task-conditioned feature transformation allows an effective utilization of the semantic information in novel classes to generate tight segmentation masks. We also propose a semantic enrichment (SE) module that utilizes a pixel-wise attention module for high-level feature and an auxiliary loss from an auxiliary segmentation network conducting the semantic segmentation for all training classes. Experiments on PASCAL-5^i and COCO-20^i datasets confirm that the added modules successfully extend the capability of existing segmentators to yield highly competitive few-shot segmentation performances."
D2ADA: Dynamic Density-aware Active Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation,"In the field of domain adaptation, a trade-off exists between the model performance and the number of target domain annotations. Active learning, maximizing model performance with few informative labeled data, comes in handy for such a scenario. In this work, we present D2ADA, a general active domain adaptation framework for semantic segmentation. To adapt the model to the target domain with minimum queried labels, we propose acquiring labels of the samples with high probability density in the target domain yet with low probability density in the source domain, complementary to the existing source domain labeled data. To further facilitate labeling efficiency, we design a dynamic scheduling policy to adjust the labeling budgets between domain exploration and model uncertainty over time. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing active learning and domain adaptation baselines on two benchmarks, GTA5 -> Cityscapes and SYNTHIA -> Cityscapes. With less than 5% target domain annotations, our method reaches comparable results with that of full supervision. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/tsunghan-wu/D2ADA."
Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation with Visual Words Learning and Hybrid Pooling,"Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) methods with image-level labels generally train a classification network to generate the Class Activation Maps (CAMs) as the initial coarse segmentation labels. However, current WSSS methods still perform far from satisfactorily because their adopted CAMs 1) typically focus on partial discriminative object regions and 2) usually contain useless background regions. These two problems are attributed to the sole image-level supervision and aggregation of global information when training the classification networks. In this work, we propose the visual words learning module and hybrid pooling approach, and incorporate them in the classification network to mitigate the above problems. In the visual words learning module, we counter the first problem by enforcing the classification network to learn fine-grained visual word labels so that more object extents could be discovered. Specifically, the visual words are learned with a codebook, which could be updated via two proposed strategies, i.e. learning-based strategy and memory-bank strategy. The second drawback of CAMs is alleviated with the proposed hybrid pooling, which incorporates the global average and local discriminative information to simultaneously ensure object completeness and reduce background regions. We evaluated our methods on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 datasets. Without any extra saliency prior, our method achieved 70.6% and 70.7% mIoU on the val and test set of PASCAL VOC dataset, respectively, and 36.2% mIoU on the val set of MS COCO dataset, which significantly surpassed the performance of state-of-the-art WSSS methods."
Semantic Segmentation of Anaemic RBCs Using Multilevel Deep Convolutional Encoder-Decoder Network,"Pixel-level analysis of blood images plays a pivotal role in diagnosing blood-related diseases, especially Anaemia. These analyses mainly rely on an accurate diagnosis of morphological deformities like shape, size, and precise pixel counting. In traditional segmentation approaches, instance or object-based approaches have been adopted that are not feasible for pixel-level analysis. The convolutional neural network (CNN) model required a large dataset with detailed pixel-level information for the semantic segmentation of red blood cells in the deep learning domain. In current research work, we address these problems by proposing a multi-level deep convolutional encoder-decoder network along with two state-of-the-art healthy and Anaemic-RBC datasets. The proposed multi-level CNN model preserved pixel-level semantic information extracted in one layer and then passed to the next layer to choose relevant features. This phenomenon helps to precise pixel-level counting of healthy and anaemic-RBC elements along with morphological analysis. For experimental purposes, we proposed two state-of-the-art RBC datasets, i.e., Healthy-RBCs and Anaemic-RBCs dataset. Each dataset contains 1000 images, ground truth masks, relevant, complete blood count (CBC), and morphology reports for performance evaluation. The proposed model results were evaluated using crossmatch analysis with ground truth mask by finding IoU, individual training, validation, testing accuracies, and global accuracies using a 05-fold training procedure. This model got training, validation, and testing accuracies as 0.9856, 0.9760, and 0.9720 on the Healthy-RBC dataset and 0.9736, 0.9696, and 0.9591 on an Anaemic-RBC dataset. The IoU and BFScore of the proposed model were 0.9311, 0.9138, and 0.9032, 0.8978 on healthy and anaemic datasets, respectively."
Amplitude Spectrum Transformation for Open Compound Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation,"Open compound domain adaptation (OCDA) has emerged as a practical adaptation setting which considers a single labeled source domain against a compound of multi-modal unlabeled target data in order to generalize better on novel unseen domains. We hypothesize that an improved disentanglement of domain-related and task-related factors of dense intermediate layer features can greatly aid OCDA. Prior-arts attempt this indirectly by employing adversarial domain discriminators on the spatial CNN output. However, we find that latent features derived from the Fourier-based amplitude spectrum of deep CNN features hold a more tractable mapping with domain discrimination. Motivated by this, we propose a novel feature space Amplitude Spectrum Transformation (AST). During adaptation, we employ the AST auto-encoder for two purposes. First, carefully mined source-target instance pairs undergo a simulation of cross-domain feature stylization (AST-Sim) at a particular layer by altering the AST-latent. Second, AST operating at a later layer is tasked to normalize (AST-Norm) the domain content by fixing its latent to a mean prototype. Our simplified adaptation technique is not only clustering-free but also free from complex adversarial alignment. We achieve leading performance against the prior arts on the OCDA scene segmentation benchmarks."
Consistency-Regularized Region-Growing Network for Semantic Segmentation of Urban Scenes with Point-Level Annotations,"Deep learning algorithms have obtained great success in semantic segmentation of very high-resolution (VHR) images. Nevertheless, training these models generally requires a large amount of accurate pixel-wise annotations, which is very laborious and time-consuming to collect. To reduce the annotation burden, this paper proposes a consistency-regularized region-growing network (CRGNet) to achieve semantic segmentation of VHR images with point-level annotations. The key idea of CRGNet is to iteratively select unlabeled pixels with high confidence to expand the annotated area from the original sparse points. However, since there may exist some errors and noises in the expanded annotations, directly learning from them may mislead the training of the network. To this end, we further propose the consistency regularization strategy, where a base classifier and an expanded classifier are employed. Specifically, the base classifier is supervised by the original sparse annotations, while the expanded classifier aims to learn from the expanded annotations generated by the base classifier with the region-growing mechanism. The consistency regularization is thereby achieved by minimizing the discrepancy between the predictions from both the base and the expanded classifiers. We find such a simple regularization strategy is yet very useful to control the quality of the region-growing mechanism. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed CRGNet significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods. Codes and pre-trained models are available online (https://github.com/YonghaoXu/CRGNet)."
Random Ferns for Semantic Segmentation of PolSAR Images,"Random Ferns -- as a less known example of Ensemble Learning -- have been successfully applied in many Computer Vision applications ranging from keypoint matching to object detection. This paper extends the Random Fern framework to the semantic segmentation of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar images. By using internal projections that are defined over the space of Hermitian matrices, the proposed classifier can be directly applied to the polarimetric covariance matrices without the need to explicitly compute predefined image features. Furthermore, two distinct optimization strategies are proposed: The first based on pre-selection and grouping of internal binary features before the creation of the classifier; and the second based on iteratively improving the properties of a given Random Fern. Both strategies are able to boost the performance by filtering features that are either redundant or have a low information content and by grouping correlated features to best fulfill the independence assumptions made by the Random Fern classifier. Experiments show that results can be achieved that are similar to a more complex Random Forest model and competitive to a deep learning baseline."
PSSNet: Planarity-sensible Semantic Segmentation of Large-scale Urban Meshes,"We introduce a novel deep learning-based framework to interpret 3D urban scenes represented as textured meshes. Based on the observation that object boundaries typically align with the boundaries of planar regions, our framework achieves semantic segmentation in two steps: planarity-sensible over-segmentation followed by semantic classification. The over-segmentation step generates an initial set of mesh segments that capture the planar and non-planar regions of urban scenes. In the subsequent classification step, we construct a graph that encodes the geometric and photometric features of the segments in its nodes and the multi-scale contextual features in its edges. The final semantic segmentation is obtained by classifying the segments using a graph convolutional network. Experiments and comparisons on two semantic urban mesh benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of boundary quality, mean IoU (intersection over union), and generalization ability. We also introduce several new metrics for evaluating mesh over-segmentation methods dedicated to semantic segmentation, and our proposed over-segmentation approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on all metrics. Our source code is available at \url{https://github.com/WeixiaoGao/PSSNet}."
The devil is in the labels: Semantic segmentation from sentences,"We propose an approach to semantic segmentation that achieves state-of-the-art supervised performance when applied in a zero-shot setting. It thus achieves results equivalent to those of the supervised methods, on each of the major semantic segmentation datasets, without training on those datasets. This is achieved by replacing each class label with a vector-valued embedding of a short paragraph that describes the class. The generality and simplicity of this approach enables merging multiple datasets from different domains, each with varying class labels and semantics. The resulting merged semantic segmentation dataset of over 2 Million images enables training a model that achieves performance equal to that of state-of-the-art supervised methods on 7 benchmark datasets, despite not using any images therefrom. By fine-tuning the model on standard semantic segmentation datasets, we also achieve a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art supervised segmentation on NYUD-V2 and PASCAL-context at 60% and 65% mIoU, respectively. Based on the closeness of language embeddings, our method can even segment unseen labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong generalization to unseen image domains and unseen labels, and that the method enables impressive performance improvements in downstream applications, including depth estimation and instance segmentation."
Characterization of Semantic Segmentation Models on Mobile Platforms for Self-Navigation in Disaster-Struck Zones,"The role of unmanned vehicles for searching and localizing the victims in disaster impacted areas such as earthquake-struck zones is getting more important. Self-navigation on an earthquake zone has a unique challenge of detecting irregularly shaped obstacles such as road cracks, debris on the streets, and water puddles. In this paper, we characterize a number of state-of-the-art FCN models on mobile embedded platforms for self-navigation at these sites containing extremely irregular obstacles. We evaluate the models in terms of accuracy, performance, and energy efficiency. We present a few optimizations for our designed vision system. Lastly, we discuss the trade-offs of these models for a couple of mobile platforms that can each perform self-navigation. To enable vehicles to safely navigate earthquake-struck zones, we compiled a new annotated image database of various earthquake impacted regions that is different than traditional road damage databases. We train our database with a number of state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models in order to identify obstacles unique to earthquake-struck zones. Based on the statistics and tradeoffs, an optimal CNN model is selected for the mobile vehicular platforms, which we apply to both low-power and extremely low-power configurations of our design. To our best knowledge, this is the first study that identifies unique challenges and discusses the accuracy, performance, and energy impact of edge-based self-navigation mobile vehicles for earthquake-struck zones. Our proposed database and trained models are publicly available."
Continual Attentive Fusion for Incremental Learning in Semantic Segmentation,"Over the past years, semantic segmentation, as many other tasks in computer vision, benefited from the progress in deep neural networks, resulting in significantly improved performance. However, deep architectures trained with gradient-based techniques suffer from catastrophic forgetting, which is the tendency to forget previously learned knowledge while learning new tasks. Aiming at devising strategies to counteract this effect, incremental learning approaches have gained popularity over the past years. However, the first incremental learning methods for semantic segmentation appeared only recently. While effective, these approaches do not account for a crucial aspect in pixel-level dense prediction problems, i.e. the role of attention mechanisms. To fill this gap, in this paper we introduce a novel attentive feature distillation approach to mitigate catastrophic forgetting while accounting for semantic spatial- and channel-level dependencies. Furthermore, we propose a {continual attentive fusion} structure, which takes advantage of the attention learned from the new and the old tasks while learning features for the new task. Finally, we also introduce a novel strategy to account for the background class in the distillation loss, thus preventing biased predictions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with an extensive evaluation on Pascal-VOC 2012 and ADE20K, setting a new state of the art."
Dilated Continuous Random Field for Semantic Segmentation,"Mean field approximation methodology has laid the foundation of modern Continuous Random Field (CRF) based solutions for the refinement of semantic segmentation. In this paper, we propose to relax the hard constraint of mean field approximation - minimizing the energy term of each node from probabilistic graphical model, by a global optimization with the proposed dilated sparse convolution module (DSConv). In addition, adaptive global average-pooling and adaptive global max-pooling are implemented as replacements of fully connected layers. In order to integrate DSConv, we design an end-to-end, time-efficient DilatedCRF pipeline. The unary energy term is derived either from pre-softmax and post-softmax features, or the predicted affordance map using a conventional classifier, making it easier to implement DilatedCRF for varieties of classifiers. We also present superior experimental results of proposed approach on the suction dataset comparing to other CRF-based approaches."
Modeling the Background for Incremental and Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Deep neural networks have enabled major progresses in semantic segmentation. However, even the most advanced neural architectures suffer from important limitations. First, they are vulnerable to catastrophic forgetting, i.e. they perform poorly when they are required to incrementally update their model as new classes are available. Second, they rely on large amount of pixel-level annotations to produce accurate segmentation maps. To tackle these issues, we introduce a novel incremental class learning approach for semantic segmentation taking into account a peculiar aspect of this task: since each training step provides annotation only for a subset of all possible classes, pixels of the background class exhibit a semantic shift. Therefore, we revisit the traditional distillation paradigm by designing novel loss terms which explicitly account for the background shift. Additionally, we introduce a novel strategy to initialize classifier's parameters at each step in order to prevent biased predictions toward the background class. Finally, we demonstrate that our approach can be extended to point- and scribble-based weakly supervised segmentation, modeling the partial annotations to create priors for unlabeled pixels. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with an extensive evaluation on the Pascal-VOC, ADE20K, and Cityscapes datasets, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods."
MVP-Net: Multiple View Pointwise Semantic Segmentation of Large-Scale Point Clouds,"Semantic segmentation of 3D point cloud is an essential task for autonomous driving environment perception. The pipeline of most pointwise point cloud semantic segmentation methods includes points sampling, neighbor searching, feature aggregation, and classification. Neighbor searching method like K-nearest neighbors algorithm, KNN, has been widely applied. However, the complexity of KNN is always a bottleneck of efficiency. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end neural architecture, Multiple View Pointwise Net, MVP-Net, to efficiently and directly infer large-scale outdoor point cloud without KNN or any complex pre/postprocessing. Instead, assumption-based space filling curves and multi-rotation of point cloud methods are introduced to point feature aggregation and receptive field expanding. Numerical experiments show that the proposed MVP-Net is 11 times faster than the most efficient pointwise semantic segmentation method RandLA-Net and achieves the same accuracy on the large-scale benchmark SemanticKITTI dataset."
Self Semi Supervised Neural Architecture Search for Semantic Segmentation,"In this paper, we propose a Neural Architecture Search strategy based on self supervision and semi-supervised learning for the task of semantic segmentation. Our approach builds an optimized neural network (NN) model for this task by jointly solving a jigsaw pretext task discovered with self-supervised learning over unlabeled training data, and, exploiting the structure of the unlabeled data with semi-supervised learning. The search of the architecture of the NN model is performed by dynamic routing using a gradient descent algorithm. Experiments on the Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC 2012 datasets demonstrate that the discovered neural network is more efficient than a state-of-the-art hand-crafted NN model with four times less floating operations."
ResiDualGAN: Resize-Residual DualGAN for Cross-Domain Remote Sensing Images Semantic Segmentation,"The performance of a semantic segmentation model for remote sensing (RS) images pretrained on an annotated dataset would greatly decrease when testing on another unannotated dataset because of the domain gap. Adversarial generative methods, e.g., DualGAN, are utilized for unpaired image-to-image translation to minimize the pixel-level domain gap, which is one of the common approaches for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). However, the existing image translation methods are facing two problems when performing RS images translation: 1) ignoring the scale discrepancy between two RS datasets which greatly affects the accuracy performance of scale-invariant objects, 2) ignoring the characteristic of real-to-real translation of RS images which brings an unstable factor for the training of the models. In this paper, ResiDualGAN is proposed for RS images translation, where an in-network resizer module is used for addressing the scale discrepancy of RS datasets, and a residual connection is used for strengthening the stability of real-to-real images translation and improving the performance in cross-domain semantic segmentation tasks. Combined with an output space adaptation method, the proposed method greatly improves the accuracy performance on common benchmarks, which demonstrates the superiority and reliability of ResiDuanGAN. At the end of the paper, a thorough discussion is also conducted to give a reasonable explanation for the improvement of ResiDualGAN. Our source code is available at https://github.com/miemieyanga/ResiDualGAN-DRDG."
Auto-Compressing Subset Pruning for Semantic Image Segmentation,"State-of-the-art semantic segmentation models are characterized by high parameter counts and slow inference times, making them unsuitable for deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address this challenge, we propose \textsc{Auto-Compressing Subset Pruning}, \acosp, as a new online compression method. The core of \acosp consists of learning a channel selection mechanism for individual channels of each convolution in the segmentation model based on an effective temperature annealing schedule. We show a crucial interplay between providing a high-capacity model at the beginning of training and the compression pressure forcing the model to compress concepts into retained channels. We apply \acosp to \segnet and \pspnet architectures and show its success when trained on the \camvid, \city, \voc, and \ade datasets. The results are competitive with existing baselines for compression of segmentation models at low compression ratios and outperform them significantly at high compression ratios, yielding acceptable results even when removing more than 93\% of the parameters. In addition, \acosp is conceptually simple, easy to implement, and can readily be generalized to other data modalities, tasks, and architectures. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/merantix/acosp}."
How Low Can We Go? Pixel Annotation for Semantic Segmentation,"How many labeled pixels are needed to segment an image, without any prior knowledge? We conduct an experiment to answer this question.  In our experiment, an Oracle is using Active Learning to train a network from scratch. The Oracle has access to the entire label map of the image, but the goal is to reveal as little pixel labels to the network as possible. We find that, on average, the Oracle needs to reveal (i.e., annotate) less than 0.1% of the pixels in order to train a network. The network can then label all pixels in the image at an accuracy of more than 98%.  Based on this single-image-annotation experiment, we design an experiment to quickly annotate an entire data set. In the data set level experiment the Oracle trains a new network for each image from scratch. The network can then be used to create pseudo-labels, which are the network predicted labels of the unlabeled pixels, for the entire image. Only then, a data set level network is trained from scratch on all the pseudo-labeled images at once.  We repeat both image level and data set level experiments on two, very different, real-world data sets, and find that it is possible to reach the performance of a fully annotated data set using a fraction of the annotation cost."
Dual-Flattening Transformers through Decomposed Row and Column Queries for Semantic Segmentation,"It is critical to obtain high resolution features with long range dependency for dense prediction tasks such as semantic segmentation. To generate high-resolution output of size H\times W from a low-resolution feature map of size h\times w (hw\ll HW), a naive dense transformer incurs an intractable complexity of \mathcal{O}(hwHW), limiting its application on high-resolution dense prediction. We propose a Dual-Flattening Transformer (DFlatFormer) to enable high-resolution output by reducing complexity to \mathcal{O}(hw(H+W)) that is multiple orders of magnitude smaller than the naive dense transformer. Decomposed queries are presented to retrieve row and column attentions tractably through separate transformers, and their outputs are combined to form a dense feature map at high resolution. To this end, the input sequence fed from an encoder is row-wise and column-wise flattened to align with decomposed queries by preserving their row and column structures, respectively. Row and column transformers also interact with each other to capture their mutual attentions with the spatial crossings between rows and columns. We also propose to perform attentions through efficient grouping and pooling to further reduce the model complexity. Extensive experiments on ADE20K and Cityscapes datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed dual-flattening transformer architecture with higher mIoUs."
Skyline variations allow estimating distance to trees on landscape photos using semantic segmentation,"Approximate distance estimation can be used to determine fundamental landscape properties including complexity and openness. We show that variations in the skyline of landscape photos can be used to estimate distances to trees on the horizon. A methodology based on the variations of the skyline has been developed and used to investigate potential relationships with the distance to skyline objects. The skyline signal, defined by the skyline height expressed in pixels, was extracted for several Land Use/Cover Area frame Survey (LUCAS) landscape photos. Photos were semantically segmented with DeepLabV3+ trained with the Common Objects in Context (COCO) dataset. This provided pixel-level classification of the objects forming the skyline. A Conditional Random Fields (CRF) algorithm was also applied to increase the details of the skyline signal. Three metrics, able to capture the skyline signal variations, were then considered for the analysis. These metrics shows a functional relationship with distance for the class of trees, whose contours have a fractal nature. In particular, regression analysis was performed against 475 ortho-photo based distance measurements, and, in the best case, a R2 score equal to 0.47 was achieved. This is an encouraging result which shows the potential of skyline variation metrics for inferring distance related information."
Towards holistic scene understanding: Semantic segmentation and beyond,"This dissertation addresses visual scene understanding and enhances segmentation performance and generalization, training efficiency of networks, and holistic understanding. First, we investigate semantic segmentation in the context of street scenes and train semantic segmentation networks on combinations of various datasets. In Chapter 2 we design a framework of hierarchical classifiers over a single convolutional backbone, and train it end-to-end on a combination of pixel-labeled datasets, improving generalizability and the number of recognizable semantic concepts. Chapter 3 focuses on enriching semantic segmentation with weak supervision and proposes a weakly-supervised algorithm for training with bounding box-level and image-level supervision instead of only with per-pixel supervision. The memory and computational load challenges that arise from simultaneous training on multiple datasets are addressed in Chapter 4. We propose two methodologies for selecting informative and diverse samples from datasets with weak supervision to reduce our networks' ecological footprint without sacrificing performance. Motivated by memory and computation efficiency requirements, in Chapter 5, we rethink simultaneous training on heterogeneous datasets and propose a universal semantic segmentation framework. This framework achieves consistent increases in performance metrics and semantic knowledgeability by exploiting various scene understanding datasets. Chapter 6 introduces the novel task of part-aware panoptic segmentation, which extends our reasoning towards holistic scene understanding. This task combines scene and parts-level semantics with instance-level object detection. In conclusion, our contributions span over convolutional network architectures, weakly-supervised learning, part and panoptic segmentation, paving the way towards a holistic, rich, and sustainable visual scene understanding."
Neighborhood Spatial Aggregation MC Dropout for Efficient Uncertainty-aware Semantic Segmentation in Point Clouds,"Uncertainty-aware semantic segmentation of the point clouds includes the predictive uncertainty estimation and the uncertainty-guided model optimization. One key challenge in the task is the efficiency of point-wise predictive distribution establishment. The widely-used MC dropout establishes the distribution by computing the standard deviation of samples using multiple stochastic forward propagations, which is time-consuming for tasks based on point clouds containing massive points. Hence, a framework embedded with NSA-MC dropout, a variant of MC dropout, is proposed to establish distributions in just one forward pass. Specifically, the NSA-MC dropout samples the model many times through a space-dependent way, outputting point-wise distribution by aggregating stochastic inference results of neighbors. Based on this, aleatoric and predictive uncertainties acquire from the predictive distribution. The aleatoric uncertainty is integrated into the loss function to penalize noisy points, avoiding the over-fitting of the model to some degree. Besides, the predictive uncertainty quantifies the confidence degree of predictions. Experimental results show that our framework obtains better segmentation results of real-world point clouds and efficiently quantifies the credibility of results. Our NSA-MC dropout is several times faster than MC dropout, and the inference time does not establish a coupling relation with the sampling times. The code will be available if the paper is accepted."
Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation of Remote Sensing Images for Tree Species Classification Based on Explanation Methods,"The collection of a high number of pixel-based labeled training samples for tree species identification is time consuming and costly in operational forestry applications. To address this problem, in this paper we investigate the effectiveness of explanation methods for deep neural networks in performing weakly supervised semantic segmentation using only image-level labels. Specifically, we consider four methods:i) class activation maps (CAM); ii) gradient-based CAM; iii) pixel correlation module; and iv) self-enhancing maps (SEM). We compare these methods with each other using both quantitative and qualitative measures of their segmentation accuracy, as well as their computational requirements. Experimental results obtained on an aerial image archive show that:i) considered explanation techniques are highly relevant for the identification of tree species with weak supervision; and ii) the SEM outperforms the other considered methods. The code for this paper is publicly available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/rs_wsss."
A Deep Learning Approach for Semantic Segmentation of Unbalanced Data in Electron Tomography of Catalytic Materials,"Heterogeneous catalysts possess complex surface and bulk structures, relatively poor intrinsic contrast, and often a sparse distribution of the catalytic nanoparticles (NPs), posing a significant challenge for image segmentation, including the current state-of-the-art deep learning methods. To tackle this problem, we apply a deep learning-based approach for the multi-class semantic segmentation of a γ-Alumina/Pt catalytic material in a class imbalance situation. Specifically, we used the weighted focal loss as a loss function and attached it to the U-Net's fully convolutional network architecture. We assessed the accuracy of our results using Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), recall, precision, and Hausdorff distance (HD) metrics on the overlap between the ground-truth and predicted segmentations. Our adopted U-Net model with the weighted focal loss function achieved an average DSC score of 0.96 \pm 0.003 in the γ-Alumina support material and 0.84 \pm 0.03 in the Pt NPs segmentation tasks. We report an average boundary-overlap error of less than 2 nm at the 90th percentile of HD for γ-Alumina and Pt NPs segmentations. The complex surface morphology of the γ-Alumina and its relation to the Pt NPs were visualized in 3D by the deep learning-assisted automatic segmentation of a large data set of high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) tomography reconstructions."
MuSCLe: A Multi-Strategy Contrastive Learning Framework for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) has gained significant popularity since it relies only on weak labels such as image level annotations rather than pixel level annotations required by supervised semantic segmentation (SSS) methods. Despite drastically reduced annotation costs, typical feature representations learned from WSSS are only representative of some salient parts of objects and less reliable compared to SSS due to the weak guidance during training. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Strategy Contrastive Learning (MuSCLe) framework to obtain enhanced feature representations and improve WSSS performance by exploiting similarity and dissimilarity of contrastive sample pairs at image, region, pixel and object boundary levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and show that MuSCLe outperforms the current state-of-the-art on the widely used PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset."
Continual Coarse-to-Fine Domain Adaptation in Semantic Segmentation,"Deep neural networks are typically trained in a single shot for a specific task and data distribution, but in real world settings both the task and the domain of application can change. The problem becomes even more challenging in dense predictive tasks, such as semantic segmentation, and furthermore most approaches tackle the two problems separately. In this paper we introduce the novel task of coarse-to-fine learning of semantic segmentation architectures in presence of domain shift. We consider subsequent learning stages progressively refining the task at the semantic level; i.e., the finer set of semantic labels at each learning step is hierarchically derived from the coarser set of the previous step. We propose a new approach (CCDA) to tackle this scenario. First, we employ the maximum squares loss to align source and target domains and, at the same time, to balance the gradients between well-classified and harder samples. Second, we introduce a novel coarse-to-fine knowledge distillation constraint to transfer network capabilities acquired on a coarser set of labels to a set of finer labels. Finally, we design a coarse-to-fine weight initialization rule to spread the importance from each coarse class to the respective finer classes. To evaluate our approach, we design two benchmarks where source knowledge is extracted from the GTA5 dataset and it is transferred to either the Cityscapes or the IDD datasets, and we show how it outperforms the main competitors."
Improving Performance of Semantic Segmentation CycleGANs by Noise Injection into the Latent Segmentation Space,"In recent years, semantic segmentation has taken benefit from various works in computer vision. Inspired by the very versatile CycleGAN architecture, we combine semantic segmentation with the concept of cycle consistency to enable a multitask training protocol. However, learning is largely prevented by the so-called steganography effect, which expresses itself as watermarks in the latent segmentation domain, making image reconstruction a too easy task. To combat this, we propose a noise injection, based either on quantization noise or on Gaussian noise addition to avoid this disadvantageous information flow in the cycle architecture. We find that noise injection significantly reduces the generation of watermarks and thus allows the recognition of highly relevant classes such as ""traffic signs"", which are hardly detected by the ERFNet baseline. We report mIoU and PSNR results on the Cityscapes dataset for semantic segmentation and image reconstruction, respectively. The proposed methodology allows to achieve an mIoU improvement on the Cityscapes validation set of 5.7% absolute over the same CycleGAN without noise injection, and still an absolute 4.9% over the ERFNet non-cyclic baseline."
Domain Adaptation in LiDAR Semantic Segmentation via Alternating Skip Connections and Hybrid Learning,"In this paper we address the challenging problem of domain adaptation in LiDAR semantic segmentation. We consider the setting where we have a fully-labeled data set from source domain and a target domain with a few labeled and many unlabeled examples. We propose a domain adaption framework that mitigates the issue of domain shift and produces appealing performance on the target domain. To this end, we develop a GAN-based image-to-image translation engine that has generators with alternating connections, and couple it with a state-of-the-art LiDAR semantic segmentation network. Our framework is hybrid in nature in the sense that our model learning is composed of self-supervision, semi-supervision and unsupervised learning. Extensive experiments on benchmark LiDAR semantic segmentation data sets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in comparison to strong baselines and prior arts."
Self-semantic contour adaptation for cross modality brain tumor segmentation,"Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) between two significantly disparate domains to learn high-level semantic alignment is a crucial yet challenging task.~To this end, in this work, we propose exploiting low-level edge information to facilitate the adaptation as a precursor task, which has a small cross-domain gap, compared with semantic segmentation.~The precise contour then provides spatial information to guide the semantic adaptation. More specifically, we propose a multi-task framework to learn a contouring adaptation network along with a semantic segmentation adaptation network, which takes both magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) slice and its initial edge map as input.~These two networks are jointly trained with source domain labels, and the feature and edge map level adversarial learning is carried out for cross-domain alignment. In addition, self-entropy minimization is incorporated to further enhance segmentation performance. We evaluated our framework on the BraTS2018 database for cross-modality segmentation of brain tumors, showing the validity and superiority of our approach, compared with competing methods."
Pyramid Fusion Transformer for Semantic Segmentation,"The recently proposed MaskFormer gives a refreshed perspective on the task of semantic segmentation: it shifts from the popular pixel-level classification paradigm to a mask-level classification method. In essence, it generates paired probabilities and masks corresponding to category segments and combines them during inference for the segmentation maps. In our study, we find that per-mask classification decoder on top of a single-scale feature is not effective enough to extract reliable probability or mask. To mine for rich semantic information across the feature pyramid, we propose a transformer-based Pyramid Fusion Transformer (PFT) for per-mask approach semantic segmentation with multi-scale features. The proposed transformer decoder performs cross-attention between the learnable queries and each spatial feature from the feature pyramid in parallel and uses cross-scale inter-query attention to exchange complimentary information. We achieve competitive performance on three widely used semantic segmentation datasets. In particular, on ADE20K validation set, our result with Swin-B backbone surpasses that of MaskFormer's with a much larger Swin-L backbone in both single-scale and multi-scale inference, achieving 54.1 mIoU and 55.7 mIoU respectively. Using a Swin-L backbone, we achieve single-scale 56.1 mIoU and multi-scale 57.4 mIoU, obtaining state-of-the-art performance on the dataset. Extensive experiments on three widely used semantic segmentation datasets verify the effectiveness of our proposed method."
Language-driven Semantic Segmentation,"We present LSeg, a novel model for language-driven semantic image segmentation. LSeg uses a text encoder to compute embeddings of descriptive input labels (e.g., ""grass"" or ""building"") together with a transformer-based image encoder that computes dense per-pixel embeddings of the input image. The image encoder is trained with a contrastive objective to align pixel embeddings to the text embedding of the corresponding semantic class. The text embeddings provide a flexible label representation in which semantically similar labels map to similar regions in the embedding space (e.g., ""cat"" and ""furry""). This allows LSeg to generalize to previously unseen categories at test time, without retraining or even requiring a single additional training sample. We demonstrate that our approach achieves highly competitive zero-shot performance compared to existing zero- and few-shot semantic segmentation methods, and even matches the accuracy of traditional segmentation algorithms when a fixed label set is provided. Code and demo are available at https://github.com/isl-org/lang-seg."
FogAdapt: Self-Supervised Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation of Foggy Images,"This paper presents FogAdapt, a novel approach for domain adaptation of semantic segmentation for dense foggy scenes. Although significant research has been directed to reduce the domain shift in semantic segmentation, adaptation to scenes with adverse weather conditions remains an open question. Large variations in the visibility of the scene due to weather conditions, such as fog, smog, and haze, exacerbate the domain shift, thus making unsupervised adaptation in such scenarios challenging. We propose a self-entropy and multi-scale information augmented self-supervised domain adaptation method (FogAdapt) to minimize the domain shift in foggy scenes segmentation. Supported by the empirical evidence that an increase in fog density results in high self-entropy for segmentation probabilities, we introduce a self-entropy based loss function to guide the adaptation method. Furthermore, inferences obtained at different image scales are combined and weighted by the uncertainty to generate scale-invariant pseudo-labels for the target domain. These scale-invariant pseudo-labels are robust to visibility and scale variations. We evaluate the proposed model on real clear-weather scenes to real foggy scenes adaptation and synthetic non-foggy images to real foggy scenes adaptation scenarios. Our experiments demonstrate that FogAdapt significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art in semantic segmentation of foggy images. Specifically, by considering the standard settings compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, FogAdapt gains 3.8% on Foggy Zurich, 6.0% on Foggy Driving-dense, and 3.6% on Foggy Driving in mIoU when adapted from Cityscapes to Foggy Zurich."
CitySurfaces: City-Scale Semantic Segmentation of Sidewalk Materials,"While designing sustainable and resilient urban built environment is increasingly promoted around the world, significant data gaps have made research on pressing sustainability issues challenging to carry out. Pavements are known to have strong economic and environmental impacts; however, most cities lack a spatial catalog of their surfaces due to the cost-prohibitive and time-consuming nature of data collection. Recent advancements in computer vision, together with the availability of street-level images, provide new opportunities for cities to extract large-scale built environment data with lower implementation costs and higher accuracy. In this paper, we propose CitySurfaces, an active learning-based framework that leverages computer vision techniques for classifying sidewalk materials using widely available street-level images. We trained the framework on images from New York City and Boston and the evaluation results show a 90.5% mIoU score. Furthermore, we evaluated the framework using images from six different cities, demonstrating that it can be applied to regions with distinct urban fabrics, even outside the domain of the training data. CitySurfaces can provide researchers and city agencies with a low-cost, accurate, and extensible method to collect sidewalk material data which plays a critical role in addressing major sustainability issues, including climate change and surface water management."
On the Real-World Adversarial Robustness of Real-Time Semantic Segmentation Models for Autonomous Driving,"The existence of real-world adversarial examples (commonly in the form of patches) poses a serious threat for the use of deep learning models in safety-critical computer vision tasks such as visual perception in autonomous driving. This paper presents an extensive evaluation of the robustness of semantic segmentation models when attacked with different types of adversarial patches, including digital, simulated, and physical ones. A novel loss function is proposed to improve the capabilities of attackers in inducing a misclassification of pixels. Also, a novel attack strategy is presented to improve the Expectation Over Transformation method for placing a patch in the scene. Finally, a state-of-the-art method for detecting adversarial patch is first extended to cope with semantic segmentation models, then improved to obtain real-time performance, and eventually evaluated in real-world scenarios. Experimental results reveal that, even though the adversarial effect is visible with both digital and real-world attacks, its impact is often spatially confined to areas of the image around the patch. This opens to further questions about the spatial robustness of real-time semantic segmentation models."
Lawin Transformer: Improving Semantic Segmentation Transformer with Multi-Scale Representations via Large Window Attention,"Multi-scale representations are crucial for semantic segmentation. The community has witnessed the flourish of semantic segmentation convolutional neural networks (CNN) exploiting multi-scale contextual information. Motivated by that the vision transformer (ViT) is powerful in image classification, some semantic segmentation ViTs are recently proposed, most of them attaining impressive results but at a cost of computational economy. In this paper, we succeed in introducing multi-scale representations into semantic segmentation ViT via window attention mechanism and further improves the performance and efficiency. To this end, we introduce large window attention which allows the local window to query a larger area of context window at only a little computation overhead. By regulating the ratio of the context area to the query area, we enable the large window attention to capture the contextual information at multiple scales. Moreover, the framework of spatial pyramid pooling is adopted to collaborate with the large window attention, which presents a novel decoder named large window attention spatial pyramid pooling (LawinASPP) for semantic segmentation ViT. Our resulting ViT, Lawin Transformer, is composed of an efficient hierachical vision transformer (HVT) as encoder and a LawinASPP as decoder. The empirical results demonstrate that Lawin Transformer offers an improved efficiency compared to the existing method. Lawin Transformer further sets new state-of-the-art performance on Cityscapes (84.4\% mIoU), ADE20K (56.2\% mIoU) and COCO-Stuff datasets. The code will be released at https://github.com/yan-hao-tian/lawin."
Attention-based Dual Supervised Decoder for RGBD Semantic Segmentation,"Encoder-decoder models have been widely used in RGBD semantic segmentation, and most of them are designed via a two-stream network. In general, jointly reasoning the color and geometric information from RGBD is beneficial for semantic segmentation. However, most existing approaches fail to comprehensively utilize multimodal information in both the encoder and decoder. In this paper, we propose a novel attention-based dual supervised decoder for RGBD semantic segmentation. In the encoder, we design a simple yet effective attention-based multimodal fusion module to extract and fuse deeply multi-level paired complementary information. To learn more robust deep representations and rich multi-modal information, we introduce a dual-branch decoder to effectively leverage the correlations and complementary cues of different tasks. Extensive experiments on NYUDv2 and SUN-RGBD datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance against the state-of-the-art methods."
Swin UNETR: Swin Transformers for Semantic Segmentation of Brain Tumors in MRI Images,"Semantic segmentation of brain tumors is a fundamental medical image analysis task involving multiple MRI imaging modalities that can assist clinicians in diagnosing the patient and successively studying the progression of the malignant entity. In recent years, Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCNNs) approaches have become the de facto standard for 3D medical image segmentation. The popular ""U-shaped"" network architecture has achieved state-of-the-art performance benchmarks on different 2D and 3D semantic segmentation tasks and across various imaging modalities. However, due to the limited kernel size of convolution layers in FCNNs, their performance of modeling long-range information is sub-optimal, and this can lead to deficiencies in the segmentation of tumors with variable sizes. On the other hand, transformer models have demonstrated excellent capabilities in capturing such long-range information in multiple domains, including natural language processing and computer vision. Inspired by the success of vision transformers and their variants, we propose a novel segmentation model termed Swin UNEt TRansformers (Swin UNETR). Specifically, the task of 3D brain tumor semantic segmentation is reformulated as a sequence to sequence prediction problem wherein multi-modal input data is projected into a 1D sequence of embedding and used as an input to a hierarchical Swin transformer as the encoder. The swin transformer encoder extracts features at five different resolutions by utilizing shifted windows for computing self-attention and is connected to an FCNN-based decoder at each resolution via skip connections. We have participated in BraTS 2021 segmentation challenge, and our proposed model ranks among the top-performing approaches in the validation phase. Code: https://monai.io/research/swin-unetr"
Towards Unsupervised Open World Semantic Segmentation,"For the semantic segmentation of images, state-of-the-art deep neural networks (DNNs) achieve high segmentation accuracy if that task is restricted to a closed set of classes. However, as of now DNNs have limited ability to operate in an open world, where they are tasked to identify pixels belonging to unknown objects and eventually to learn novel classes, incrementally. Humans have the capability to say: I don't know what that is, but I've already seen something like that. Therefore, it is desirable to perform such an incremental learning task in an unsupervised fashion. We introduce a method where unknown objects are clustered based on visual similarity. Those clusters are utilized to define new classes and serve as training data for unsupervised incremental learning. More precisely, the connected components of a predicted semantic segmentation are assessed by a segmentation quality estimate. connected components with a low estimated prediction quality are candidates for a subsequent clustering. Additionally, the component-wise quality assessment allows for obtaining predicted segmentation masks for the image regions potentially containing unknown objects. The respective pixels of such masks are pseudo-labeled and afterwards used for re-training the DNN, i.e., without the use of ground truth generated by humans. In our experiments we demonstrate that, without access to ground truth and even with few data, a DNN's class space can be extended by a novel class, achieving considerable segmentation accuracy."
DIAL: Deep Interactive and Active Learning for Semantic Segmentation in Remote Sensing,"We propose in this article to build up a collaboration between a deep neural network and a human in the loop to swiftly obtain accurate segmentation maps of remote sensing images. In a nutshell, the agent iteratively interacts with the network to correct its initially flawed predictions. Concretely, these interactions are annotations representing the semantic labels. Our methodological contribution is twofold. First, we propose two interactive learning schemes to integrate user inputs into deep neural networks. The first one concatenates the annotations with the other network's inputs. The second one uses the annotations as a sparse ground-truth to retrain the network. Second, we propose an active learning strategy to guide the user towards the most relevant areas to annotate. To this purpose, we compare different state-of-the-art acquisition functions to evaluate the neural network uncertainty such as ConfidNet, entropy or ODIN. Through experiments on three remote sensing datasets, we show the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Notably, we show that active learning based on uncertainty estimation enables to quickly lead the user towards mistakes and that it is thus relevant to guide the user interventions."
Digital Rock Typing DRT Algorithm Formulation with Optimal Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Each grid block in a 3D geological model requires a rock type that represents all physical and chemical properties of that block. The properties that classify rock types are lithology, permeability, and capillary pressure. Scientists and engineers determined these properties using conventional laboratory measurements, which embedded destructive methods to the sample or altered some of its properties (i.e., wettability, permeability, and porosity) because the measurements process includes sample crushing, fluid flow, or fluid saturation. Lately, Digital Rock Physics (DRT) has emerged to quantify these properties from micro-Computerized Tomography (uCT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images. However, the literature did not attempt rock typing in a wholly digital context. We propose performing Digital Rock Typing (DRT) by: (1) integrating the latest DRP advances in a novel process that honors digital rock properties determination, while; (2) digitalizing the latest rock typing approaches in carbonate, and (3) introducing a novel carbonate rock typing process that utilizes computer vision capabilities to provide more insight about the heterogeneous carbonate rock texture."
A Simple Baseline for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation with Pre-trained Vision-language Model,"Recently, open-vocabulary image classification by vision language pre-training has demonstrated incredible achievements, that the model can classify arbitrary categories without seeing additional annotated images of that category. However, it is still unclear how to make the open-vocabulary recognition work well on broader vision problems. This paper targets open-vocabulary semantic segmentation by building it on an off-the-shelf pre-trained vision-language model, i.e., CLIP. However, semantic segmentation and the CLIP model perform on different visual granularity, that semantic segmentation processes on pixels while CLIP performs on images. To remedy the discrepancy in processing granularity, we refuse the use of the prevalent one-stage FCN based framework, and advocate a two-stage semantic segmentation framework, with the first stage extracting generalizable mask proposals and the second stage leveraging an image based CLIP model to perform open-vocabulary classification on the masked image crops which are generated in the first stage. Our experimental results show that this two-stage framework can achieve superior performance than FCN when trained only on COCO Stuff dataset and evaluated on other datasets without fine-tuning. Moreover, this simple framework also surpasses previous state-of-the-arts of zero-shot semantic segmentation by a large margin: +29.5 hIoU on the Pascal VOC 2012 dataset, and +8.9 hIoU on the COCO Stuff dataset. With its simplicity and strong performance, we hope this framework to serve as a baseline to facilitate future research. The code are made publicly available at~\url{https://github.com/MendelXu/zsseg.baseline}."
GuidedMix-Net: Semi-supervised Semantic Segmentation by Using Labeled Images as Reference,"Semi-supervised learning is a challenging problem which aims to construct a model by learning from limited labeled examples. Numerous methods for this task focus on utilizing the predictions of unlabeled instances consistency alone to regularize networks. However, treating labeled and unlabeled data separately often leads to the discarding of mass prior knowledge learned from the labeled examples. %, and failure to mine the feature interaction between the labeled and unlabeled image pairs. In this paper, we propose a novel method for semi-supervised semantic segmentation named GuidedMix-Net, by leveraging labeled information to guide the learning of unlabeled instances. Specifically, GuidedMix-Net employs three operations: 1) interpolation of similar labeled-unlabeled image pairs; 2) transfer of mutual information; 3) generalization of pseudo masks. It enables segmentation models can learning the higher-quality pseudo masks of unlabeled data by transfer the knowledge from labeled samples to unlabeled data. Along with supervised learning for labeled data, the prediction of unlabeled data is jointly learned with the generated pseudo masks from the mixed data. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012, and Cityscapes demonstrate the effectiveness of our GuidedMix-Net, which achieves competitive segmentation accuracy and significantly improves the mIoU by +7\% compared to previous approaches."
Temporally Constrained Neural Networks (TCNN): A framework for semi-supervised video semantic segmentation,"A major obstacle to building models for effective semantic segmentation, and particularly video semantic segmentation, is a lack of large and well annotated datasets. This bottleneck is particularly prohibitive in highly specialized and regulated fields such as medicine and surgery, where video semantic segmentation could have important applications but data and expert annotations are scarce. In these settings, temporal clues and anatomical constraints could be leveraged during training to improve performance. Here, we present Temporally Constrained Neural Networks (TCNN), a semi-supervised framework used for video semantic segmentation of surgical videos. In this work, we show that autoencoder networks can be used to efficiently provide both spatial and temporal supervisory signals to train deep learning models. We test our method on a newly introduced video dataset of laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedures, Endoscapes, and an adaptation of a public dataset of cataract surgeries, CaDIS. We demonstrate that lower-dimensional representations of predicted masks can be leveraged to provide a consistent improvement on both sparsely labeled datasets with no additional computational cost at inference time. Further, the TCNN framework is model-agnostic and can be used in conjunction with other model design choices with minimal additional complexity."
MSeg: A Composite Dataset for Multi-domain Semantic Segmentation,"We present MSeg, a composite dataset that unifies semantic segmentation datasets from different domains. A naive merge of the constituent datasets yields poor performance due to inconsistent taxonomies and annotation practices. We reconcile the taxonomies and bring the pixel-level annotations into alignment by relabeling more than 220,000 object masks in more than 80,000 images, requiring more than 1.34 years of collective annotator effort. The resulting composite dataset enables training a single semantic segmentation model that functions effectively across domains and generalizes to datasets that were not seen during training. We adopt zero-shot cross-dataset transfer as a benchmark to systematically evaluate a model's robustness and show that MSeg training yields substantially more robust models in comparison to training on individual datasets or naive mixing of datasets without the presented contributions. A model trained on MSeg ranks first on the WildDash-v1 leaderboard for robust semantic segmentation, with no exposure to WildDash data during training. We evaluate our models in the 2020 Robust Vision Challenge (RVC) as an extreme generalization experiment. MSeg training sets include only three of the seven datasets in the RVC; more importantly, the evaluation taxonomy of RVC is different and more detailed. Surprisingly, our model shows competitive performance and ranks second. To evaluate how close we are to the grand aim of robust, efficient, and complete scene understanding, we go beyond semantic segmentation by training instance segmentation and panoptic segmentation models using our dataset. Moreover, we also evaluate various engineering design decisions and metrics, including resolution and computational efficiency. Although our models are far from this grand aim, our comprehensive evaluation is crucial for progress. We share all the models and code with the community."
Meta-Learned Feature Critics for Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation,"How to handle domain shifts when recognizing or segmenting visual data across domains has been studied by learning and vision communities. In this paper, we address domain generalized semantic segmentation, in which the segmentation model is trained on multiple source domains and is expected to generalize to unseen data domains. We propose a novel meta-learning scheme with feature disentanglement ability, which derives domain-invariant features for semantic segmentation with domain generalization guarantees. In particular, we introduce a class-specific feature critic module in our framework, enforcing the disentangled visual features with domain generalization guarantees. Finally, our quantitative results on benchmark datasets confirm the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed model, performing favorably against state-of-the-art domain adaptation and generalization methods in segmentation."
Multi-Scale Feature Fusion: Learning Better Semantic Segmentation for Road Pothole Detection,"This paper presents a novel pothole detection approach based on single-modal semantic segmentation. It first extracts visual features from input images using a convolutional neural network. A channel attention module then reweighs the channel features to enhance the consistency of different feature maps. Subsequently, we employ an atrous spatial pyramid pooling module (comprising of atrous convolutions in series, with progressive rates of dilation) to integrate the spatial context information. This helps better distinguish between potholes and undamaged road areas. Finally, the feature maps in the adjacent layers are fused using our proposed multi-scale feature fusion module. This further reduces the semantic gap between different feature channel layers. Extensive experiments were carried out on the Pothole-600 dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The quantitative comparisons suggest that our method achieves the state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance on both RGB images and transformed disparity images, outperforming three SoTA single-modal semantic segmentation networks."
Realtime Global Attention Network for Semantic Segmentation,"In this paper, we proposed an end-to-end realtime global attention neural network (RGANet) for the challenging task of semantic segmentation. Different from the encoding strategy deployed by self-attention paradigms, the proposed global attention module encodes global attention via depth-wise convolution and affine transformations. The integration of these global attention modules into a hierarchy architecture maintains high inferential performance. In addition, an improved evaluation metric, namely MGRID, is proposed to alleviate the negative effect of non-convex, widely scattered ground-truth areas. Results from extensive experiments on state-of-the-art architectures for semantic segmentation manifest the leading performance of proposed approaches for robotic monocular visual perception."
SeMask: Semantically Masked Transformers for Semantic Segmentation,"Finetuning a pretrained backbone in the encoder part of an image transformer network has been the traditional approach for the semantic segmentation task. However, such an approach leaves out the semantic context that an image provides during the encoding stage. This paper argues that incorporating semantic information of the image into pretrained hierarchical transformer-based backbones while finetuning improves the performance considerably. To achieve this, we propose SeMask, a simple and effective framework that incorporates semantic information into the encoder with the help of a semantic attention operation. In addition, we use a lightweight semantic decoder during training to provide supervision to the intermediate semantic prior maps at every stage. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating semantic priors enhances the performance of the established hierarchical encoders with a slight increase in the number of FLOPs. We provide empirical proof by integrating SeMask into Swin Transformer and Mix Transformer backbones as our encoder paired with different decoders. Our framework achieves a new state-of-the-art of 58.25% mIoU on the ADE20K dataset and improvements of over 3% in the mIoU metric on the Cityscapes dataset. The code and checkpoints are publicly available at https://github.com/Picsart-AI-Research/SeMask-Segmentation ."
TagLab: A human-centric AI system for interactive semantic segmentation,"Fully automatic semantic segmentation of highly specific semantic classes and complex shapes may not meet the accuracy standards demanded by scientists. In such cases, human-centered AI solutions, able to assist operators while preserving human control over complex tasks, are a good trade-off to speed up image labeling while maintaining high accuracy levels. TagLab is an open-source AI-assisted software for annotating large orthoimages which takes advantage of different degrees of automation; it speeds up image annotation from scratch through assisted tools, creates custom fully automatic semantic segmentation models, and, finally, allows the quick edits of automatic predictions. Since the orthoimages analysis applies to several scientific disciplines, TagLab has been designed with a flexible labeling pipeline. We report our results in two different scenarios, marine ecology, and architectural heritage."
Distribution-aware Margin Calibration for Semantic Segmentation in Images,"The Jaccard index, also known as Intersection-over-Union (IoU), is one of the most critical evaluation metrics in image semantic segmentation. However, direct optimization of IoU score is very difficult because the learning objective is neither differentiable nor decomposable. Although some algorithms have been proposed to optimize its surrogates, there is no guarantee provided for the generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a margin calibration method, which can be directly used as a learning objective, for an improved generalization of IoU over the data-distribution, underpinned by a rigid lower bound. This scheme theoretically ensures a better segmentation performance in terms of IoU score. We evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed margin calibration method on seven image datasets, showing substantial improvements in IoU score over other learning objectives using deep segmentation models."
Generalized Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation: All You Need is Fine-Tuning,"Generalized few-shot semantic segmentation was introduced to move beyond only evaluating few-shot segmentation models on novel classes to include testing their ability to remember base classes. While the current state-of-the-art approach is based on meta-learning, it performs poorly and saturates in learning after observing only a few shots. We propose the first fine-tuning solution, and demonstrate that it addresses the saturation problem while achieving state-of-the-art results on two datasets, PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i. We also show that it outperforms existing methods, whether fine-tuning multiple final layers or only the final layer. Finally, we present a triplet loss regularization that shows how to redistribute the balance of performance between novel and base categories so that there is a smaller gap between them."
Anomaly Discovery in Semantic Segmentation via Distillation Comparison Networks,"This paper aims to address the problem of anomaly discovery in semantic segmentation. Our key observation is that semantic classification plays a critical role in existing approaches, while the incorrectly classified pixels are easily regarded as anomalies. Such a phenomenon frequently appears and is rarely discussed, which significantly reduces the performance of anomaly discovery. To this end, we propose a novel Distillation Comparison Network (DiCNet). It comprises of a teacher branch which is a semantic segmentation network that removed the semantic classification head, and a student branch that is distilled from the teacher branch through a distribution distillation. We show that the distillation guarantees the semantic features of the two branches hold consistency in the known classes, while reflect inconsistency in the unknown class. Therefore, we leverage the semantic feature discrepancy between the two branches to discover the anomalies. DiCNet abandons the semantic classification head in the inference process, and hence significantly alleviates the issue caused by incorrect semantic classification. Extensive experimental results on StreetHazards dataset and BDD-Anomaly dataset are conducted to verify the superior performance of DiCNet. In particular, DiCNet obtains a 6.3% improvement in AUPR and a 5.2% improvement in FPR95 on StreetHazards dataset, achieves a 4.2% improvement in AUPR and a 6.8% improvement in FPR95 on BDD-Anomaly dataset. Codes are available at https://github.com/zhouhuan-hust/DiCNet."
Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation via Alternative Self-Dual Teaching,"Current weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) frameworks usually contain the separated mask-refinement model and the main semantic region mining model. These approaches would contain redundant feature extraction backbones and biased learning objectives, making them computational complex yet sub-optimal to addressing the WSSS task. To solve this problem, this paper establishes a compact learning framework that embeds the classification and mask-refinement components into a unified deep model. With the shared feature extraction backbone, our model is able to facilitate knowledge sharing between the two components while preserving a low computational complexity. To encourage high-quality knowledge interaction, we propose a novel alternative self-dual teaching (ASDT) mechanism. Unlike the conventional distillation strategy, the knowledge of the two teacher branches in our model is alternatively distilled to the student branch by a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM), which generates PW wave-like selection signal to guide the knowledge distillation process. In this way, the student branch can help prevent the model from falling into local minimum solutions caused by the imperfect knowledge provided of either teacher branch. Comprehensive experiments on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and COCO-Stuff 10K demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed alternative self-dual teaching mechanism as well as the new state-of-the-art performance of our approach."
Activation Modulation and Recalibration Scheme for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Image-level weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) is a fundamental yet challenging computer vision task facilitating scene understanding and automatic driving. Most existing methods resort to classification-based Class Activation Maps (CAMs) to play as the initial pseudo labels, which tend to focus on the discriminative image regions and lack customized characteristics for the segmentation task. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel activation modulation and recalibration (AMR) scheme, which leverages a spotlight branch and a compensation branch to obtain weighted CAMs that can provide recalibration supervision and task-specific concepts. Specifically, an attention modulation module (AMM) is employed to rearrange the distribution of feature importance from the channel-spatial sequential perspective, which helps to explicitly model channel-wise interdependencies and spatial encodings to adaptively modulate segmentation-oriented activation responses. Furthermore, we introduce a cross pseudo supervision for dual branches, which can be regarded as a semantic similar regularization to mutually refine two branches. Extensive experiments show that AMR establishes a new state-of-the-art performance on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset, surpassing not only current methods trained with the image-level of supervision but also some methods relying on stronger supervision, such as saliency label. Experiments also reveal that our scheme is plug-and-play and can be incorporated with other approaches to boost their performance."
Self-Ensembling GAN for Cross-Domain Semantic Segmentation,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) have greatly contributed to the performance gains in semantic segmentation. Nevertheless, training DNNs generally requires large amounts of pixel-level labeled data, which is expensive and time-consuming to collect in practice. To mitigate the annotation burden, this paper proposes a self-ensembling generative adversarial network (SE-GAN) exploiting cross-domain data for semantic segmentation. In SE-GAN, a teacher network and a student network constitute a self-ensembling model for generating semantic segmentation maps, which together with a discriminator, forms a GAN. Despite its simplicity, we find SE-GAN can significantly boost the performance of adversarial training and enhance the stability of the model, the latter of which is a common barrier shared by most adversarial training-based methods. We theoretically analyze SE-GAN and provide an \mathcal O(1/\sqrt{N}) generalization bound (N is the training sample size), which suggests controlling the discriminator's hypothesis complexity to enhance the generalizability. Accordingly, we choose a simple network as the discriminator. Extensive and systematic experiments in two standard settings demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches. The source code of our model is available online (https://github.com/YonghaoXu/SE-GAN)."
M-FasterSeg: An Efficient Semantic Segmentation Network Based on Neural Architecture Search,"Image semantic segmentation technology is one of the key technologies for intelligent systems to understand natural scenes. As one of the important research directions in the field of visual intelligence, this technology has broad application scenarios in the fields of mobile robots, drones, smart driving, and smart security. However, in the actual application of mobile robots, problems such as inaccurate segmentation semantic label prediction and loss of edge information of segmented objects and background may occur. This paper proposes an improved structure of a semantic segmentation network based on a deep learning network that combines self-attention neural network and neural network architecture search methods. First, a neural network search method NAS (Neural Architecture Search) is used to find a semantic segmentation network with multiple resolution branches. In the search process, combine the self-attention network structure module to adjust the searched neural network structure, and then combine the semantic segmentation network searched by different branches to form a fast semantic segmentation network structure, and input the picture into the network structure to get the final forecast result. The experimental results on the Cityscapes dataset show that the accuracy of the algorithm is 69.8%, and the segmentation speed is 48/s. It achieves a good balance between real-time and accuracy, can optimize edge segmentation, and has a better performance in complex scenes. Good robustness is suitable for practical application."
Decoupling Zero-Shot Semantic Segmentation,"Zero-shot semantic segmentation (ZS3) aims to segment the novel categories that have not been seen in the training. Existing works formulate ZS3 as a pixel-level zeroshot classification problem, and transfer semantic knowledge from seen classes to unseen ones with the help of language models pre-trained only with texts. While simple, the pixel-level ZS3 formulation shows the limited capability to integrate vision-language models that are often pre-trained with image-text pairs and currently demonstrate great potential for vision tasks. Inspired by the observation that humans often perform segment-level semantic labeling, we propose to decouple the ZS3 into two sub-tasks: 1) a classagnostic grouping task to group the pixels into segments. 2) a zero-shot classification task on segments. The former task does not involve category information and can be directly transferred to group pixels for unseen classes. The latter task performs at segment-level and provides a natural way to leverage large-scale vision-language models pre-trained with image-text pairs (e.g. CLIP) for ZS3. Based on the decoupling formulation, we propose a simple and effective zero-shot semantic segmentation model, called ZegFormer, which outperforms the previous methods on ZS3 standard benchmarks by large margins, e.g., 22 points on the PASCAL VOC and 3 points on the COCO-Stuff in terms of mIoU for unseen classes. Code will be released at https://github.com/dingjiansw101/ZegFormer."
n-CPS: Generalising Cross Pseudo Supervision to n Networks for Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"We present n-CPS - a generalisation of the recent state-of-the-art cross pseudo supervision (CPS) approach for the task of semi-supervised semantic segmentation. In n-CPS, there are n simultaneously trained subnetworks that learn from each other through one-hot encoding perturbation and consistency regularisation. We also show that ensembling techniques applied to subnetworks outputs can significantly improve the performance. To the best of our knowledge, n-CPS paired with CutMix outperforms CPS and sets the new state-of-the-art for Pascal VOC 2012 with (1/16, 1/8, 1/4, and 1/2 supervised regimes) and Cityscapes (1/16 supervised)."
Uncertainty Estimation via Response Scaling for Pseudo-mask Noise Mitigation in Weakly-supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) segments objects without a heavy burden of dense annotation. While as a price, generated pseudo-masks exist obvious noisy pixels, which result in sub-optimal segmentation models trained over these pseudo-masks. But rare studies notice or work on this problem, even these noisy pixels are inevitable after their improvements on pseudo-mask. So we try to improve WSSS in the aspect of noise mitigation. And we observe that many noisy pixels are of high confidence, especially when the response range is too wide or narrow, presenting an uncertain status. Thus, in this paper, we simulate noisy variations of response by scaling the prediction map multiple times for uncertainty estimation. The uncertainty is then used to weight the segmentation loss to mitigate noisy supervision signals. We call this method URN, abbreviated from Uncertainty estimation via Response scaling for Noise mitigation. Experiments validate the benefits of URN, and our method achieves state-of-the-art results at 71.2% and 41.5% on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 respectively, without extra models like saliency detection. Code is available at https://github.com/XMed-Lab/URN."
E-CRF: Embedded Conditional Random Field for Boundary-caused Class Weights Confusion in Semantic Segmentation,"Modern semantic segmentation methods devote much effect to adjusting image feature representations to improve the segmentation performance in various ways, such as architecture design, attention mechnism, etc. However, almost all those methods neglect the particularity of class weights (in the classification layer) in segmentation models. In this paper, we notice that the class weights of categories that tend to share many adjacent boundary pixels lack discrimination, thereby limiting the performance. We call this issue Boundary-caused Class Weights Confusion (BCWC). We try to focus on this problem and propose a novel method named Embedded Conditional Random Field (E-CRF) to alleviate it. E-CRF innovatively fuses the CRF into the CNN network as an organic whole for more effective end-to-end optimization. The reasons are two folds. It utilizes CRF to guide the message passing between pixels in high-level features to purify the feature representation of boundary pixels, with the help of inner pixels belonging to the same object. More importantly, it enables optimizing class weights from both scale and direction during backpropagation. We make detailed theoretical analysis to prove it. Besides, superpixel is integrated into E-CRF and served as an auxiliary to exploit the local object prior for more reliable message passing. Finally, our proposed method yields impressive results on ADE20K, Cityscapes, and Pascal Context datasets."
CPRAL: Collaborative Panoptic-Regional Active Learning for Semantic Segmentation,"Acquiring the most representative examples via active learning (AL) can benefit many data-dependent computer vision tasks by minimizing efforts of image-level or pixel-wise annotations. In this paper, we propose a novel Collaborative Panoptic-Regional Active Learning framework (CPRAL) to address the semantic segmentation task. For a small batch of images initially sampled with pixel-wise annotations, we employ panoptic information to initially select unlabeled samples. Considering the class imbalance in the segmentation dataset, we import a Regional Gaussian Attention module (RGA) to achieve semantics-biased selection. The subset is highlighted by vote entropy and then attended by Gaussian kernels to maximize the biased regions. We also propose a Contextual Labels Extension (CLE) to boost regional annotations with contextual attention guidance. With the collaboration of semantics-agnostic panoptic matching and regionbiased selection and extension, our CPRAL can strike a balance between labeling efforts and performance and compromise the semantics distribution. We perform extensive experiments on Cityscapes and BDD10K datasets and show that CPRAL outperforms the cutting-edge methods with impressive results and less labeling proportion."
On Adversarial Robustness of Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation,"Recent research efforts on 3D point cloud semantic segmentation (PCSS) have achieved outstanding performance by adopting neural networks. However, the robustness of these complex models have not been systematically analyzed. Given that PCSS has been applied in many safety-critical applications like autonomous driving, it is important to fill this knowledge gap, especially, how these models are affected under adversarial samples. As such, we present a comparative study of PCSS robustness. First, we formally define the attacker's objective under performance degradation and object hiding. Then, we develop new attack by whether to bound the norm. We evaluate different attack options on two datasets and three PCSS models. We found all the models are vulnerable and attacking point color is more effective. With this study, we call the attention of the research community to develop new approaches to harden PCSS models."
Exploring Pixel-level Self-supervision for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Existing studies in weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) have utilized class activation maps (CAMs) to localize the class objects. However, since a classification loss is insufficient for providing precise object regions, CAMs tend to be biased towards discriminative patterns (i.e., sparseness) and do not provide precise object boundary information (i.e., impreciseness). To resolve these limitations, we propose a novel framework (composed of MainNet and SupportNet.) that derives pixel-level self-supervision from given image-level supervision. In our framework, with the help of the proposed Regional Contrastive Module (RCM) and Multi-scale Attentive Module (MAM), MainNet is trained by self-supervision from the SupportNet. The RCM extracts two forms of self-supervision from SupportNet: (1) class region masks generated from the CAMs and (2) class-wise prototypes obtained from the features according to the class region masks. Then, every pixel-wise feature of the MainNet is trained by the prototype in a contrastive manner, sharpening the resulting CAMs. The MAM utilizes CAMs inferred at multiple scales from the SupportNet as self-supervision to guide the MainNet. Based on the dissimilarity between the multi-scale CAMs from MainNet and SupportNet, CAMs from the MainNet are trained to expand to the less-discriminative regions. The proposed method shows state-of-the-art WSSS performance both on the train and validation sets on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset. For reproducibility, code will be available publicly soon."
Hidden Path Selection Network for Semantic Segmentation of Remote Sensing Images,"Targeting at depicting land covers with pixel-wise semantic categories, semantic segmentation in remote sensing images needs to portray diverse distributions over vast geographical locations, which is difficult to be achieved by the homogeneous pixel-wise forward paths in the architectures of existing deep models. Although several algorithms have been designed to select pixel-wise adaptive forward paths for natural image analysis, it still lacks theoretical supports on how to obtain optimal selections. In this paper, we provide mathematical analyses in terms of the parameter optimization, which guides us to design a method called Hidden Path Selection Network (HPS-Net). With the help of hidden variables derived from an extra mini-branch, HPS-Net is able to tackle the inherent problem about inaccessible global optimums by adjusting the direct relationships between feature maps and pixel-wise path selections in existing algorithms, which we call hidden path selection. For the better training and evaluation, we further refine and expand the 5-class Gaofen Image Dataset (GID-5) to a new one with 15 land-cover categories, i.e., GID-15. The experimental results on both GID-5 and GID-15 demonstrate that the proposed modules can stably improve the performance of different deep structures, which validates the proposed mathematical analyses."
Style Mixing and Patchwise Prototypical Matching for One-Shot Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation,"In this paper, we tackle the problem of one-shot unsupervised domain adaptation (OSUDA) for semantic segmentation where the segmentors only see one unlabeled target image during training. In this case, traditional unsupervised domain adaptation models usually fail since they cannot adapt to the target domain with over-fitting to one (or few) target samples. To address this problem, existing OSUDA methods usually integrate a style-transfer module to perform domain randomization based on the unlabeled target sample, with which multiple domains around the target sample can be explored during training. However, such a style-transfer module relies on an additional set of images as style reference for pre-training and also increases the memory demand for domain adaptation. Here we propose a new OSUDA method that can effectively relieve such computational burden. Specifically, we integrate several style-mixing layers into the segmentor which play the role of style-transfer module to stylize the source images without introducing any learned parameters. Moreover, we propose a patchwise prototypical matching (PPM) method to weighted consider the importance of source pixels during the supervised training to relieve the negative adaptation. Experimental results show that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance on two commonly used benchmarks for domain adaptive semantic segmentation under the one-shot setting and is more efficient than all comparison approaches."
A Unified Architecture of Semantic Segmentation and Hierarchical Generative Adversarial Networks for Expression Manipulation,"Editing facial expressions by only changing what we want is a long-standing research problem in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for image manipulation. Most of the existing methods that rely only on a global generator usually suffer from changing unwanted attributes along with the target attributes. Recently, hierarchical networks that consist of both a global network dealing with the whole image and multiple local networks focusing on local parts are showing success. However, these methods extract local regions by bounding boxes centred around the sparse facial key points which are non-differentiable, inaccurate and unrealistic. Hence, the solution becomes sub-optimal, introduces unwanted artefacts degrading the overall quality of the synthetic images. Moreover, a recent study has shown strong correlation between facial attributes and local semantic regions. To exploit this relationship, we designed a unified architecture of semantic segmentation and hierarchical GANs. A unique advantage of our framework is that on forward pass the semantic segmentation network conditions the generative model, and on backward pass gradients from hierarchical GANs are propagated to the semantic segmentation network, which makes our framework an end-to-end differentiable architecture. This allows both architectures to benefit from each other. To demonstrate its advantages, we evaluate our method on two challenging facial expression translation benchmarks, AffectNet and RaFD, and a semantic segmentation benchmark, CelebAMask-HQ across two popular architectures, BiSeNet and UNet. Our extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on both face semantic segmentation and face expression manipulation tasks validate the effectiveness of our work over existing state-of-the-art methods."
Fully Attentional Network for Semantic Segmentation,"Recent non-local self-attention methods have proven to be effective in capturing long-range dependencies for semantic segmentation. These methods usually form a similarity map of RC*C (by compressing spatial dimensions) or RHW*HW (by compressing channels) to describe the feature relations along either channel or spatial dimensions, where C is the number of channels, H and W are the spatial dimensions of the input feature map. However, such practices tend to condense feature dependencies along the other dimensions,hence causing attention missing, which might lead to inferior results for small/thin categories or inconsistent segmentation inside large objects. To address this problem, we propose anew approach, namely Fully Attentional Network (FLANet),to encode both spatial and channel attentions in a single similarity map while maintaining high computational efficiency. Specifically, for each channel map, our FLANet can harvest feature responses from all other channel maps, and the associated spatial positions as well, through a novel fully attentional module. Our new method has achieved state-of-the-art performance on three challenging semantic segmentation datasets,i.e., 83.6%, 46.99%, and 88.5% on the Cityscapes test set,the ADE20K validation set, and the PASCAL VOC test set,respectively."
Scalable 3D Semantic Segmentation for Gun Detection in CT Scans,"With the increased availability of 3D data, the need for solutions processing those also increased rapidly. However, adding dimension to already reliably accurate 2D approaches leads to immense memory consumption and higher computational complexity. These issues cause current hardware to reach its limitations, with most methods forced to reduce the input resolution drastically. Our main contribution is a novel deep 3D semantic segmentation method for gun detection in baggage CT scans that enables fast training and low video memory consumption for high-resolution voxelized volumes. We introduce a moving pyramid approach that utilizes multiple forward passes at inference time for segmenting an instance."
A Contrastive Distillation Approach for Incremental Semantic Segmentation in Aerial Images,"Incremental learning represents a crucial task in aerial image processing, especially given the limited availability of large-scale annotated datasets. A major issue concerning current deep neural architectures is known as catastrophic forgetting, namely the inability to faithfully maintain past knowledge once a new set of data is provided for retraining. Over the years, several techniques have been proposed to mitigate this problem for image classification and object detection. However, only recently the focus has shifted towards more complex downstream tasks such as instance or semantic segmentation. Starting from incremental-class learning for semantic segmentation tasks, our goal is to adapt this strategy to the aerial domain, exploiting a peculiar feature that differentiates it from natural images, namely the orientation. In addition to the standard knowledge distillation approach, we propose a contrastive regularization, where any given input is compared with its augmented version (i.e. flipping and rotations) in order to minimize the difference between the segmentation features produced by both inputs. We show the effectiveness of our solution on the Potsdam dataset, outperforming the incremental baseline in every test. Code available at: https://github.com/edornd/contrastive-distillation."
Hybrid guiding: A multi-resolution refinement approach for semantic segmentation of gigapixel histopathological images,"Histopathological cancer diagnostics has become more complex, and the increasing number of biopsies is a challenge for most pathology laboratories. Thus, development of automatic methods for evaluation of histopathological cancer sections would be of value. In this study, we used 624 whole slide images (WSIs) of breast cancer from a Norwegian cohort. We propose a cascaded convolutional neural network design, called H2G-Net, for semantic segmentation of gigapixel histopathological images. The design involves a detection stage using a patch-wise method, and a refinement stage using a convolutional autoencoder. To validate the design, we conducted an ablation study to assess the impact of selected components in the pipeline on tumour segmentation. Guiding segmentation, using hierarchical sampling and deep heatmap refinement, proved to be beneficial when segmenting the histopathological images. We found a significant improvement when using a refinement network for postprocessing the generated tumour segmentation heatmaps. The overall best design achieved a Dice score of 0.933 on an independent test set of 90 WSIs. The design outperformed single-resolution approaches, such as cluster-guided, patch-wise high-resolution classification using MobileNetV2 (0.872) and a low-resolution U-Net (0.874). In addition, segmentation on a representative x400 WSI took ~58 seconds, using only the CPU. The findings demonstrate the potential of utilizing a refinement network to improve patch-wise predictions. The solution is efficient and does not require overlapping patch inference or ensembling. Furthermore, we showed that deep neural networks can be trained using a random sampling scheme that balances on multiple different labels simultaneously, without the need of storing patches on disk. Future work should involve more efficient patch generation and sampling, as well as improved clustering."
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Semantic Image Segmentation: a Comprehensive Survey,"Semantic segmentation plays a fundamental role in a broad variety of computer vision applications, providing key information for the global understanding of an image. Yet, the state-of-the-art models rely on large amount of annotated samples, which are more expensive to obtain than in tasks such as image classification. Since unlabelled data is instead significantly cheaper to obtain, it is not surprising that Unsupervised Domain Adaptation reached a broad success within the semantic segmentation community.  This survey is an effort to summarize five years of this incredibly rapidly growing field, which embraces the importance of semantic segmentation itself and a critical need of adapting segmentation models to new environments. We present the most important semantic segmentation methods; we provide a comprehensive survey on domain adaptation techniques for semantic segmentation; we unveil newer trends such as multi-domain learning, domain generalization, test-time adaptation or source-free domain adaptation; we conclude this survey by describing datasets and benchmarks most widely used in semantic segmentation research. We hope that this survey will provide researchers across academia and industry with a comprehensive reference guide and will help them in fostering new research directions in the field."
Semantic Segmentation In-the-Wild Without Seeing Any Segmentation Examples,"Semantic segmentation is a key computer vision task that has been actively researched for decades. In recent years, supervised methods have reached unprecedented accuracy, however they require many pixel-level annotations for every new class category which is very time-consuming and expensive. Additionally, the ability of current semantic segmentation networks to handle a large number of categories is limited. That means that images containing rare class categories are unlikely to be well segmented by current methods. In this paper we propose a novel approach for creating semantic segmentation masks for every object, without the need for training segmentation networks or seeing any segmentation masks. Our method takes as input the image-level labels of the class categories present in the image; they can be obtained automatically or manually. We utilize a vision-language embedding model (specifically CLIP) to create a rough segmentation map for each class, using model interpretability methods. We refine the maps using a test-time augmentation technique. The output of this stage provides pixel-level pseudo-labels, instead of the manual pixel-level labels required by supervised methods. Given the pseudo-labels, we utilize single-image segmentation techniques to obtain high-quality output segmentation masks. Our method is shown quantitatively and qualitatively to outperform methods that use a similar amount of supervision. Our results are particularly remarkable for images containing rare categories."
Label-Efficient Semantic Segmentation with Diffusion Models,"Denoising diffusion probabilistic models have recently received much research attention since they outperform alternative approaches, such as GANs, and currently provide state-of-the-art generative performance. The superior performance of diffusion models has made them an appealing tool in several applications, including inpainting, super-resolution, and semantic editing. In this paper, we demonstrate that diffusion models can also serve as an instrument for semantic segmentation, especially in the setup when labeled data is scarce. In particular, for several pretrained diffusion models, we investigate the intermediate activations from the networks that perform the Markov step of the reverse diffusion process. We show that these activations effectively capture the semantic information from an input image and appear to be excellent pixel-level representations for the segmentation problem. Based on these observations, we describe a simple segmentation method, which can work even if only a few training images are provided. Our approach significantly outperforms the existing alternatives on several datasets for the same amount of human supervision."
GETAM: Gradient-weighted Element-wise Transformer Attention Map for Weakly-supervised Semantic segmentation,"Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) is challenging, particularly when image-level labels are used to supervise pixel level prediction. To bridge their gap, a Class Activation Map (CAM) is usually generated to provide pixel level pseudo labels. CAMs in Convolutional Neural Networks suffer from partial activation ie, only the most discriminative regions are activated. Transformer based methods, on the other hand, are highly effective at exploring global context with long range dependency modeling, potentially alleviating the ""partial activation"" issue. In this paper, we propose the first transformer based WSSS approach, and introduce the Gradient weighted Element wise Transformer Attention Map (GETAM). GETAM shows fine scale activation for all feature map elements, revealing different parts of the object across transformer layers. Further, we propose an activation aware label completion module to generate high quality pseudo labels. Finally, we incorporate our methods into an end to end framework for WSSS using double backward propagation. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC and COCO demonstrate that our results beat the state-of-the-art end-to-end approaches by a significant margin, and outperform most multi-stage methods.m most multi-stage methods."
Unsupervised Adaptation of Semantic Segmentation Models without Source Data,"We consider the novel problem of unsupervised domain adaptation of source models, without access to the source data for semantic segmentation. Unsupervised domain adaptation aims to adapt a model learned on the labeled source data, to a new unlabeled target dataset. Existing methods assume that the source data is available along with the target data during adaptation. However, in practical scenarios, we may only have access to the source model and the unlabeled target data, but not the labeled source, due to reasons such as privacy, storage, etc. In this work, we propose a self-training approach to extract the knowledge from the source model. To compensate for the distribution shift from source to target, we first update only the normalization parameters of the network with the unlabeled target data. Then we employ confidence-filtered pseudo labeling and enforce consistencies against certain transformations. Despite being very simple and intuitive, our framework is able to achieve significant performance gains compared to directly applying the source model on the target data as reflected in our extensive experiments and ablation studies. In fact, the performance is just a few points away from the recent state-of-the-art methods which use source data for adaptation. We further demonstrate the generalisability of the proposed approach for fully test-time adaptation setting, where we do not need any target training data and adapt only during test-time."
Novel Class Discovery in Semantic Segmentation,"We introduce a new setting of Novel Class Discovery in Semantic Segmentation (NCDSS), which aims at segmenting unlabeled images containing new classes given prior knowledge from a labeled set of disjoint classes. In contrast to existing approaches that look at novel class discovery in image classification, we focus on the more challenging semantic segmentation. In NCDSS, we need to distinguish the objects and background, and to handle the existence of multiple classes within an image, which increases the difficulty in using the unlabeled data. To tackle this new setting, we leverage the labeled base data and a saliency model to coarsely cluster novel classes for model training in our basic framework. Additionally, we propose the Entropy-based Uncertainty Modeling and Self-training (EUMS) framework to overcome noisy pseudo-labels, further improving the model performance on the novel classes. Our EUMS utilizes an entropy ranking technique and a dynamic reassignment to distill clean labels, thereby making full use of the noisy data via self-supervised learning. We build the NCDSS benchmark on the PASCAL-5^i dataset and COCO-20^i dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate the feasibility of the basic framework (achieving an average mIoU of 49.81% on PASCAL-5^i) and the effectiveness of EUMS framework (outperforming the basic framework by 9.28% mIoU on PASCAL-5^i)."
Incremental Learning in Semantic Segmentation from Image Labels,"Although existing semantic segmentation approaches achieve impressive results, they still struggle to update their models incrementally as new categories are uncovered. Furthermore, pixel-by-pixel annotations are expensive and time-consuming. This paper proposes a novel framework for Weakly Incremental Learning for Semantic Segmentation, that aims at learning to segment new classes from cheap and largely available image-level labels. As opposed to existing approaches, that need to generate pseudo-labels offline, we use an auxiliary classifier, trained with image-level labels and regularized by the segmentation model, to obtain pseudo-supervision online and update the model incrementally. We cope with the inherent noise in the process by using soft-labels generated by the auxiliary classifier. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the Pascal VOC and COCO datasets, outperforming offline weakly-supervised methods and obtaining results comparable with incremental learning methods with full supervision. Code can be found at https://github.com/fcdl94/WILSON."
Semantic Segmentation of Legal Documents via Rhetorical Roles,"Legal documents are unstructured, use legal jargon, and have considerable length, making them difficult to process automatically via conventional text processing techniques. A legal document processing system would benefit substantially if the documents could be segmented into coherent information units. This paper proposes a new corpus of legal documents annotated (with the help of legal experts) with a set of 13 semantically coherent units labels (referred to as Rhetorical Roles), e.g., facts, arguments, statute, issue, precedent, ruling, and ratio. We perform a thorough analysis of the corpus and the annotations. For automatically segmenting the legal documents, we experiment with the task of rhetorical role prediction: given a document, predict the text segments corresponding to various roles. Using the created corpus, we experiment extensively with various deep learning-based baseline models for the task. Further, we develop a multitask learning (MTL) based deep model with document rhetorical role label shift as an auxiliary task for segmenting a legal document. The proposed model shows superior performance over the existing models. We also experiment with model performance in the case of domain transfer and model distillation techniques to see the model performance in limited data conditions."
Localized Feature Aggregation Module for Semantic Segmentation,"We propose a new information aggregation method which called Localized Feature Aggregation Module based on the similarity between the feature maps of an encoder and a decoder. The proposed method recovers positional information by emphasizing the similarity between decoder's feature maps with superior semantic information and encoder's feature maps with superior positional information. The proposed method can learn positional information more efficiently than conventional concatenation in the U-net and attention U-net. Additionally, the proposed method also uses localized attention range to reduce the computational cost. Two innovations contributed to improve the segmentation accuracy with lower computational cost. By experiments on the Drosophila cell image dataset and COVID-19 image dataset, we confirmed that our method outperformed conventional methods."
TransFGU: A Top-down Approach to Fine-Grained Unsupervised Semantic Segmentation,"Unsupervised semantic segmentation aims to obtain high-level semantic representation on low-level visual features without manual annotations. Most existing methods are bottom-up approaches that try to group pixels into regions based on their visual cues or certain predefined rules. As a result, it is difficult for these bottom-up approaches to generate fine-grained semantic segmentation when coming to complicated scenes with multiple objects and some objects sharing similar visual appearance. In contrast, we propose the first top-down unsupervised semantic segmentation framework for fine-grained segmentation in extremely complicated scenarios. Specifically, we first obtain rich high-level structured semantic concept information from large-scale vision data in a self-supervised learning manner, and use such information as a prior to discover potential semantic categories presented in target datasets. Secondly, the discovered high-level semantic categories are mapped to low-level pixel features by calculating the class activate map (CAM) with respect to certain discovered semantic representation. Lastly, the obtained CAMs serve as pseudo labels to train the segmentation module and produce the final semantic segmentation. Experimental results on multiple semantic segmentation benchmarks show that our top-down unsupervised segmentation is robust to both object-centric and scene-centric datasets under different semantic granularity levels, and outperforms all the current state-of-the-art bottom-up methods. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/damo-cv/TransFGU}."
"""Just Drive"": Colour Bias Mitigation for Semantic Segmentation in the Context of Urban Driving","Biases can filter into AI technology without our knowledge. Oftentimes, seminal deep learning networks champion increased accuracy above all else. In this paper, we attempt to alleviate biases encountered by semantic segmentation models in urban driving scenes, via an iteratively trained unlearning algorithm. Convolutional neural networks have been shown to rely on colour and texture rather than geometry. This raises issues when safety-critical applications, such as self-driving cars, encounter images with covariate shift at test time - induced by variations such as lighting changes or seasonality. Conceptual proof of bias unlearning has been shown on simple datasets such as MNIST. However, the strategy has never been applied to the safety-critical domain of pixel-wise semantic segmentation of highly variable training data - such as urban scenes. Trained models for both the baseline and bias unlearning scheme have been tested for performance on colour-manipulated validation sets showing a disparity of up to 85.50% in mIoU from the original RGB images - confirming segmentation networks strongly depend on the colour information in the training data to make their classification. The bias unlearning scheme shows improvements of handling this covariate shift of up to 61% in the best observed case - and performs consistently better at classifying the ""human"" and ""vehicle"" classes compared to the baseline model."
Reference-guided Pseudo-Label Generation for Medical Semantic Segmentation,"Producing densely annotated data is a difficult and tedious task for medical imaging applications. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach to generate supervision for semi-supervised semantic segmentation. We argue that visually similar regions between labeled and unlabeled images likely contain the same semantics and therefore should share their label. Following this thought, we use a small number of labeled images as reference material and match pixels in an unlabeled image to the semantics of the best fitting pixel in a reference set. This way, we avoid pitfalls such as confirmation bias, common in purely prediction-based pseudo-labeling. Since our method does not require any architectural changes or accompanying networks, one can easily insert it into existing frameworks. We achieve the same performance as a standard fully supervised model on X-ray anatomy segmentation, albeit 95% fewer labeled images. Aside from an in-depth analysis of different aspects of our proposed method, we further demonstrate the effectiveness of our reference-guided learning paradigm by comparing our approach against existing methods for retinal fluid segmentation with competitive performance as we improve upon recent work by up to 15% mean IoU."
Multiple Fusion Adaptation: A Strong Framework for Unsupervised Semantic Segmentation Adaptation,"This paper challenges the cross-domain semantic segmentation task, aiming to improve the segmentation accuracy on the unlabeled target domain without incurring additional annotation. Using the pseudo-label-based unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) pipeline, we propose a novel and effective Multiple Fusion Adaptation (MFA) method. MFA basically considers three parallel information fusion strategies, i.e., the cross-model fusion, temporal fusion and a novel online-offline pseudo label fusion. Specifically, the online-offline pseudo label fusion encourages the adaptive training to pay additional attention to difficult regions that are easily ignored by offline pseudo labels, therefore retaining more informative details. While the other two fusion strategies may look standard, MFA pays significant efforts to raise the efficiency and effectiveness for integration, and succeeds in injecting all the three strategies into a unified framework. Experiments on two widely used benchmarks, i.e., GTA5-to-Cityscapes and SYNTHIA-to-Cityscapes, show that our method significantly improves the semantic segmentation adaptation, and sets up new state of the art (58.2% and 62.5% mIoU, respectively). The code will be available at https://github.com/KaiiZhang/MFA."
ARTSeg: Employing Attention for Thermal images Semantic Segmentation,"The research advancements have made the neural network algorithms deployed in the autonomous vehicle to perceive the surrounding. The standard exteroceptive sensors that are utilized for the perception of the environment are cameras and Lidar. Therefore, the neural network algorithms developed using these exteroceptive sensors have provided the necessary solution for the autonomous vehicle's perception. One major drawback of these exteroceptive sensors is their operability in adverse weather conditions, for instance, low illumination and night conditions. The useability and affordability of thermal cameras in the sensor suite of the autonomous vehicle provide the necessary improvement in the autonomous vehicle's perception in adverse weather conditions. The semantics of the environment benefits the robust perception, which can be achieved by segmenting different objects in the scene. In this work, we have employed the thermal camera for semantic segmentation. We have designed an attention-based Recurrent Convolution Network (RCNN) encoder-decoder architecture named ARTSeg for thermal semantic segmentation. The main contribution of this work is the design of encoder-decoder architecture, which employ units of RCNN for each encoder and decoder block. Furthermore, additive attention is employed in the decoder module to retain high-resolution features and improve the localization of features. The efficacy of the proposed method is evaluated on the available public dataset, showing better performance with other state-of-the-art methods in mean intersection over union (IoU)."
Zero-Shot Semantic Segmentation via Spatial and Multi-Scale Aware Visual Class Embedding,"Fully supervised semantic segmentation technologies bring a paradigm shift in scene understanding. However, the burden of expensive labeling cost remains as a challenge. To solve the cost problem, recent studies proposed language model based zero-shot semantic segmentation (L-ZSSS) approaches. In this paper, we address L-ZSSS has a limitation in generalization which is a virtue of zero-shot learning. Tackling the limitation, we propose a language-model-free zero-shot semantic segmentation framework, Spatial and Multi-scale aware Visual Class Embedding Network (SM-VCENet). Furthermore, leveraging vision-oriented class embedding SM-VCENet enriches visual information of the class embedding by multi-scale attention and spatial attention. We also propose a novel benchmark (PASCAL2COCO) for zero-shot semantic segmentation, which provides generalization evaluation by domain adaptation and contains visually challenging samples. In experiments, our SM-VCENet outperforms zero-shot semantic segmentation state-of-the-art by a relative margin in PASCAL-5i benchmark and shows generalization-robustness in PASCAL2COCO benchmark."
DAFormer: Improving Network Architectures and Training Strategies for Domain-Adaptive Semantic Segmentation,"As acquiring pixel-wise annotations of real-world images for semantic segmentation is a costly process, a model can instead be trained with more accessible synthetic data and adapted to real images without requiring their annotations. This process is studied in unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). Even though a large number of methods propose new adaptation strategies, they are mostly based on outdated network architectures. As the influence of recent network architectures has not been systematically studied, we first benchmark different network architectures for UDA and newly reveal the potential of Transformers for UDA semantic segmentation. Based on the findings, we propose a novel UDA method, DAFormer. The network architecture of DAFormer consists of a Transformer encoder and a multi-level context-aware feature fusion decoder. It is enabled by three simple but crucial training strategies to stabilize the training and to avoid overfitting to the source domain: While (1) Rare Class Sampling on the source domain improves the quality of the pseudo-labels by mitigating the confirmation bias of self-training toward common classes, (2) a Thing-Class ImageNet Feature Distance and (3) a learning rate warmup promote feature transfer from ImageNet pretraining. DAFormer represents a major advance in UDA. It improves the state of the art by 10.8 mIoU for GTA-to-Cityscapes and 5.4 mIoU for Synthia-to-Cityscapes and enables learning even difficult classes such as train, bus, and truck well. The implementation is available at https://github.com/lhoyer/DAFormer."
Anomaly-Aware Semantic Segmentation by Leveraging Synthetic-Unknown Data,"Anomaly awareness is an essential capability for safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. While recent progress of robotics and computer vision has enabled anomaly detection for image classification, anomaly detection on semantic segmentation is less explored. Conventional anomaly-aware systems assuming other existing classes as out-of-distribution (pseudo-unknown) classes for training a model will result in two drawbacks. (1) Unknown classes, which applications need to cope with, might not actually exist during training time. (2) Model performance would strongly rely on the class selection. Observing this, we propose a novel Synthetic-Unknown Data Generation, intending to tackle the anomaly-aware semantic segmentation task. We design a new Masked Gradient Update (MGU) module to generate auxiliary data along the boundary of in-distribution data points. In addition, we modify the traditional cross-entropy loss to emphasize the border data points. We reach the state-of-the-art performance on two anomaly segmentation datasets. Ablation studies also demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed modules."
Data Augmented 3D Semantic Scene Completion with 2D Segmentation Priors,"Semantic scene completion (SSC) is a challenging Computer Vision task with many practical applications, from robotics to assistive computing. Its goal is to infer the 3D geometry in a field of view of a scene and the semantic labels of voxels, including occluded regions. In this work, we present SPAwN, a novel lightweight multimodal 3D deep CNN that seamlessly fuses structural data from the depth component of RGB-D images with semantic priors from a bimodal 2D segmentation network. A crucial difficulty in this field is the lack of fully labeled real-world 3D datasets which are large enough to train the current data-hungry deep 3D CNNs. In 2D computer vision tasks, many data augmentation strategies have been proposed to improve the generalization ability of CNNs. However those approaches cannot be directly applied to the RGB-D input and output volume of SSC solutions. In this paper, we introduce the use of a 3D data augmentation strategy that can be applied to multimodal SSC networks. We validate our contributions with a comprehensive and reproducible ablation study. Our solution consistently surpasses previous works with a similar level of complexity."
Efficient Self-Ensemble for Semantic Segmentation,"Ensemble of predictions is known to perform better than individual predictions taken separately. However, for tasks that require heavy computational resources, e.g. semantic segmentation, creating an ensemble of learners that needs to be trained separately is hardly tractable. In this work, we propose to leverage the performance boost offered by ensemble methods to enhance the semantic segmentation, while avoiding the traditional heavy training cost of the ensemble. Our self-ensemble approach takes advantage of the multi-scale features set produced by feature pyramid network methods to feed independent decoders, thus creating an ensemble within a single model. Similar to the ensemble, the final prediction is the aggregation of the prediction made by each learner. In contrast to previous works, our model can be trained end-to-end, alleviating the traditional cumbersome multi-stage training of ensembles. Our self-ensemble approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art on the benchmark datasets Pascal Context and COCO-Stuff-10K for semantic segmentation and is competitive on ADE20K and Cityscapes. Code is publicly available at github.com/WalBouss/SenFormer."
NeSF: Neural Semantic Fields for Generalizable Semantic Segmentation of 3D Scenes,"We present NeSF, a method for producing 3D semantic fields from posed RGB images alone. In place of classical 3D representations, our method builds on recent work in implicit neural scene representations wherein 3D structure is captured by point-wise functions. We leverage this methodology to recover 3D density fields upon which we then train a 3D semantic segmentation model supervised by posed 2D semantic maps. Despite being trained on 2D signals alone, our method is able to generate 3D-consistent semantic maps from novel camera poses and can be queried at arbitrary 3D points. Notably, NeSF is compatible with any method producing a density field, and its accuracy improves as the quality of the density field improves. Our empirical analysis demonstrates comparable quality to competitive 2D and 3D semantic segmentation baselines on complex, realistically rendered synthetic scenes. Our method is the first to offer truly dense 3D scene segmentations requiring only 2D supervision for training, and does not require any semantic input for inference on novel scenes. We encourage the readers to visit the project website."
Towards Fewer Annotations: Active Learning via Region Impurity and Prediction Uncertainty for Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation,"Self-training has greatly facilitated domain adaptive semantic segmentation, which iteratively generates pseudo labels on unlabeled target data and retrains the network. However, realistic segmentation datasets are highly imbalanced, pseudo labels are typically biased to the majority classes and basically noisy, leading to an error-prone and suboptimal model. In this paper, we propose a simple region-based active learning approach for semantic segmentation under a domain shift, aiming to automatically query a small partition of image regions to be labeled while maximizing segmentation performance. Our algorithm, Region Impurity and Prediction Uncertainty (RIPU), introduces a new acquisition strategy characterizing the spatial adjacency of image regions along with the prediction confidence. We show that the proposed region-based selection strategy makes more efficient use of a limited budget than image-based or point-based counterparts. Further, we enforce local prediction consistency between a pixel and its nearest neighbors on a source image. Alongside, we develop a negative learning loss to make the features more discriminative. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method only requires very few annotations to almost reach the supervised performance and substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/BIT-DA/RIPU."
Perturbed and Strict Mean Teachers for Semi-supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Consistency learning using input image, feature, or network perturbations has shown remarkable results in semi-supervised semantic segmentation, but this approach can be seriously affected by inaccurate predictions of unlabelled training images. There are two consequences of these inaccurate predictions: 1) the training based on the ""strict"" cross-entropy (CE) loss can easily overfit prediction mistakes, leading to confirmation bias; and 2) the perturbations applied to these inaccurate predictions will use potentially erroneous predictions as training signals, degrading consistency learning. In this paper, we address the prediction accuracy problem of consistency learning methods with novel extensions of the mean-teacher (MT) model, which include a new auxiliary teacher, and the replacement of MT's mean square error (MSE) by a stricter confidence-weighted cross-entropy (Conf-CE) loss. The accurate prediction by this model allows us to use a challenging combination of network, input data and feature perturbations to improve the consistency learning generalisation, where the feature perturbations consist of a new adversarial perturbation. Results on public benchmarks show that our approach achieves remarkable improvements over the previous SOTA methods in the field. Our code is available at https://github.com/yyliu01/PS-MT."
Towards an Efficient Semantic Segmentation Method of ID Cards for Verification Systems,"Removing the background in ID Card images is a real challenge for remote verification systems because many of the re-digitalised images present cluttered backgrounds, poor illumination conditions, distortion and occlusions. The background in ID Card images confuses the classifiers and the text extraction. Due to the lack of available images for research, this field represents an open problem in computer vision today. This work proposes a method for removing the background using semantic segmentation of ID Cards. In the end, images captured in the wild from the real operation, using a manually labelled dataset consisting of 45,007 images, with five types of ID Cards from three countries (Chile, Argentina and Mexico), including typical presentation attack scenarios, were used. This method can help to improve the following stages in a regular identity verification or document tampering detection system. Two Deep Learning approaches were explored, based on MobileUNet and DenseNet10. The best results were obtained using MobileUNet, with 6.5 million parameters. A Chilean ID Card's mean Intersection Over Union (IoU) was 0.9926 on a private test dataset of 4,988 images. The best results for the fused multi-country dataset of ID Card images from Chile, Argentina and Mexico reached an IoU of 0.9911. The proposed methods are lightweight enough to be used in real-time operation on mobile devices."
SPCL: A New Framework for Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation via Semantic Prototype-based Contrastive Learning,"Although there is significant progress in supervised semantic segmentation, it remains challenging to deploy the segmentation models to unseen domains due to domain biases. Domain adaptation can help in this regard by transferring knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Previous methods typically attempt to perform the adaptation on global features, however, the local semantic affiliations accounting for each pixel in the feature space are often ignored, resulting in less discriminability. To solve this issue, we propose a novel semantic prototype-based contrastive learning framework for fine-grained class alignment. Specifically, the semantic prototypes provide supervisory signals for per-pixel discriminative representation learning and each pixel of source and target domains in the feature space is required to reflect the content of the corresponding semantic prototype. In this way, our framework is able to explicitly make intra-class pixel representations closer and inter-class pixel representations further apart to improve the robustness of the segmentation model as well as alleviate the domain shift problem. Our method is easy to implement and attains superior results compared to state-of-the-art approaches, as is demonstrated with a number of experiments.

APANet: Adaptive Prototypes Alignment Network for Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation,"Few-shot semantic segmentation aims to segment novel-class objects in a given query image with only a few labeled support images. Most advanced solutions exploit a metric learning framework that performs segmentation through matching each query feature to a learned class-specific prototype. However, this framework suffers from biased classification due to incomplete feature comparisons. To address this issue, we present an adaptive prototype representation by introducing class-specific and class-agnostic prototypes and thus construct complete sample pairs for learning semantic alignment with query features. The complementary features learning manner effectively enriches feature comparison and helps yield an unbiased segmentation model in the few-shot setting. It is implemented with a two-branch end-to-end network (i.e., a class-specific branch and a class-agnostic branch), which generates prototypes and then combines query features to perform comparisons. In addition, the proposed class-agnostic branch is simple yet effective. In practice, it can adaptively generate multiple class-agnostic prototypes for query images and learn feature alignment in a self-contrastive manner. Extensive experiments on PASCAL-5^i and COCO-20^i demonstrate the superiority of our method. At no expense of inference efficiency, our model achieves state-of-the-art results in both 1-shot and 5-shot settings for semantic segmentation."
ATLANTIS: A Benchmark for Semantic Segmentation of Waterbody Images,"Vision-based semantic segmentation of waterbodies and nearby related objects provides important information for managing water resources and handling flooding emergency. However, the lack of large-scale labeled training and testing datasets for water-related categories prevents researchers from studying water-related issues in the computer vision field. To tackle this problem, we present ATLANTIS, a new benchmark for semantic segmentation of waterbodies and related objects. ATLANTIS consists of 5,195 images of waterbodies, as well as high quality pixel-level manual annotations of 56 classes of objects, including 17 classes of man-made objects, 18 classes of natural objects and 21 general classes. We analyze ATLANTIS in detail and evaluate several state-of-the-art semantic segmentation networks on our benchmark. In addition, a novel deep neural network, AQUANet, is developed for waterbody semantic segmentation by processing the aquatic and non-aquatic regions in two different paths. AQUANet also incorporates low-level feature modulation and cross-path modulation for enhancing feature representation. Experimental results show that the proposed AQUANet outperforms other state-of-the-art semantic segmentation networks on ATLANTIS. We claim that ATLANTIS is the largest waterbody image dataset for semantic segmentation providing a wide range of water and water-related classes and it will benefit researchers of both computer vision and water resources engineering."
Improving Semantic Image Segmentation via Label Fusion in Semantically Textured Meshes,"Models for semantic segmentation require a large amount of hand-labeled training data which is costly and time-consuming to produce. For this purpose, we present a label fusion framework that is capable of improving semantic pixel labels of video sequences in an unsupervised manner. We make use of a 3D mesh representation of the environment and fuse the predictions of different frames into a consistent representation using semantic mesh textures. Rendering the semantic mesh using the original intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters yields a set of improved semantic segmentation images. Due to our optimized CUDA implementation, we are able to exploit the entire c-dimensional probability distribution of annotations over c classes in an uncertainty-aware manner. We evaluate our method on the Scannet dataset where we improve annotations produced by the state-of-the-art segmentation network ESANet from 52.05 \% to 58.25 \% pixel accuracy. We publish the source code of our framework online to foster future research in this area (\url{https://github.com/fferflo/semantic-meshes}). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publicly available label fusion framework for semantic image segmentation based on meshes with semantic textures."
Exploring Segment-level Semantics for Online Phase Recognition from Surgical Videos,"Automatic surgical phase recognition plays a vital role in robot-assisted surgeries. Existing methods ignored a pivotal problem that surgical phases should be classified by learning segment-level semantics instead of solely relying on frame-wise information. This paper presents a segment-attentive hierarchical consistency network (SAHC) for surgical phase recognition from videos. The key idea is to extract hierarchical high-level semantic-consistent segments and use them to refine the erroneous predictions caused by ambiguous frames. To achieve it, we design a temporal hierarchical network to generate hierarchical high-level segments. Then, we introduce a hierarchical segment-frame attention module to capture relations between the low-level frames and high-level segments. By regularizing the predictions of frames and their corresponding segments via a consistency loss, the network can generate semantic-consistent segments and then rectify the misclassified predictions caused by ambiguous low-level frames. We validate SAHC on two public surgical video datasets, i.e., the M2CAI16 challenge dataset and the Cholec80 dataset. Experimental results show that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-arts and ablation studies prove the effectiveness of our proposed modules. Our code has been released at: https://github.com/xmed-lab/SAHC."
Bi-Mix: Bidirectional Mixing for Domain Adaptive Nighttime Semantic Segmentation,"In autonomous driving, learning a segmentation model that can adapt to various environmental conditions is crucial. In particular, copying with severe illumination changes is an impelling need, as models trained on daylight data will perform poorly at nighttime. In this paper, we study the problem of Domain Adaptive Nighttime Semantic Segmentation (DANSS), which aims to learn a discriminative nighttime model with a labeled daytime dataset and an unlabeled dataset, including coarsely aligned day-night image pairs. To this end, we propose a novel Bidirectional Mixing (Bi-Mix) framework for DANSS, which can contribute to both image translation and segmentation adaptation processes. Specifically, in the image translation stage, Bi-Mix leverages the knowledge of day-night image pairs to improve the quality of nighttime image relighting. On the other hand, in the segmentation adaptation stage, Bi-Mix effectively bridges the distribution gap between day and night domains for adapting the model to the night domain. In both processes, Bi-Mix simply operates by mixing two samples without extra hyper-parameters, thus it is easy to implement. Extensive experiments on Dark Zurich and Nighttime Driving datasets demonstrate the advantage of the proposed Bi-Mix and show that our approach obtains state-of-the-art performance in DANSS. Our code is available at https://github.com/ygjwd12345/BiMix."
Rethink Dilated Convolution for Real-time Semantic Segmentation,"Recent advances in semantic segmentation generally adapt an ImageNet pretrained backbone with a special context module after it to quickly increase the field-of-view. Although successful, the backbone, in which most of the computation lies, does not have a large enough field-of-view to make the best decisions. Some recent advances tackle this problem by rapidly downsampling the resolution in the backbone while also having one or more parallel branches with higher resolutions. We take a different approach by designing a ResNeXt inspired block structure that uses two parallel 3x3 convolutional layers with different dilation rates to increase the field-of-view while also preserving the local details. By repeating this block structure in the backbone, we do not need to append any special context module after it. In addition, we propose a lightweight decoder that restores local information better than common alternatives. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, our model RegSeg achieves state-of-the-art results on real-time Cityscapes and CamVid datasets. Using a T4 GPU with mixed precision, RegSeg achieves 78.3 mIOU on Cityscapes test set at 30 FPS, and 80.9 mIOU on CamVid test set at 70 FPS, both without ImageNet pretraining."
Edge-preserving Domain Adaptation for semantic segmentation of Medical Images,"Domain Adaptation is a technique to address the lack of massive amounts of labeled data in unseen environments. Unsupervised domain adaptation is proposed to adapt a model to new modalities using solely labeled source data and unlabeled target domain data. Though many image-spaces domain adaptation methods have been proposed to capture pixel-level domain-shift, such techniques may fail to maintain high-level semantic information for the segmentation task. For the case of biomedical images, fine details such as blood vessels can be lost during the image transformation operations between domains. In this work, we propose a model that adapts between domains using cycle-consistent loss while maintaining edge details of the original images by enforcing an edge-based loss during the adaptation process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm by comparing it to other approaches on two eye fundus vessels segmentation datasets. We achieve 1.1 to 9.2 increment in DICE score compared to the SOTA and ~5.2 increments compared to a vanilla CycleGAN implementation."
Dynamically pruning segformer for efficient semantic segmentation,"As one of the successful Transformer-based models in computer vision tasks, SegFormer demonstrates superior performance in semantic segmentation. Nevertheless, the high computational cost greatly challenges the deployment of SegFormer on edge devices. In this paper, we seek to design a lightweight SegFormer for efficient semantic segmentation. Based on the observation that neurons in SegFormer layers exhibit large variances across different images, we propose a dynamic gated linear layer, which prunes the most uninformative set of neurons based on the input instance. To improve the dynamically pruned SegFormer, we also introduce two-stage knowledge distillation to transfer the knowledge within the original teacher to the pruned student network. Experimental results show that our method can significantly reduce the computation overhead of SegFormer without an apparent performance drop. For instance, we can achieve 36.9% mIoU with only 3.3G FLOPs on ADE20K, saving more than 60% computation with the drop of only 0.5% in mIoU"
Automatic Semantic Segmentation of the Lumbar Spine: Clinical Applicability in a Multi-parametric and Multi-centre Study on Magnetic Resonance Images,"One of the major difficulties in medical image segmentation is the high variability of these images, which is caused by their origin (multi-centre), the acquisition protocols (multi-parametric), as well as the variability of human anatomy, the severity of the illness, the effect of age and gender, among others. The problem addressed in this work is the automatic semantic segmentation of lumbar spine Magnetic Resonance images using convolutional neural networks. The purpose is to assign a class label to each pixel of an image. Classes were defined by radiologists and correspond to different structural elements like vertebrae, intervertebral discs, nerves, blood vessels, and other tissues. The proposed network topologies are variants of the U-Net architecture. Several complementary blocks were used to define the variants: Three types of convolutional blocks, spatial attention models, deep supervision and multilevel feature extractor. This document describes the topologies and analyses the results of the neural network designs that obtained the most accurate segmentations. Several of the proposed designs outperform the standard U-Net used as baseline, especially when used in ensembles where the output of multiple neural networks is combined according to different strategies."
Robust deep learning-based semantic organ segmentation in hyperspectral images,"Semantic image segmentation is an important prerequisite for context-awareness and autonomous robotics in surgery. The state of the art has focused on conventional RGB video data acquired during minimally invasive surgery, but full-scene semantic segmentation based on spectral imaging data and obtained during open surgery has received almost no attention to date. To address this gap in the literature, we are investigating the following research questions based on hyperspectral imaging (HSI) data of pigs acquired in an open surgery setting: (1) What is an adequate representation of HSI data for neural network-based fully automated organ segmentation, especially with respect to the spatial granularity of the data (pixels vs. superpixels vs. patches vs. full images)? (2) Is there a benefit of using HSI data compared to other modalities, namely RGB data and processed HSI data (e.g. tissue parameters like oxygenation), when performing semantic organ segmentation? According to a comprehensive validation study based on 506 HSI images from 20 pigs, annotated with a total of 19 classes, deep learning-based segmentation performance increases, consistently across modalities, with the spatial context of the input data. Unprocessed HSI data offers an advantage over RGB data or processed data from the camera provider, with the advantage increasing with decreasing size of the input to the neural network. Maximum performance (HSI applied to whole images) yielded a mean DSC of 0.90 ((standard deviation (SD)) 0.04), which is in the range of the inter-rater variability (DSC of 0.89 ((standard deviation (SD)) 0.07)). We conclude that HSI could become a powerful image modality for fully-automatic surgical scene understanding with many advantages over traditional imaging, including the ability to recover additional functional tissue information.

Dual Prototypical Contrastive Learning for Few-shot Semantic Segmentation,"We address the problem of few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS), which aims to segment novel class objects in a target image with a few annotated samples. Though recent advances have been made by incorporating prototype-based metric learning, existing methods still show limited performance under extreme intra-class object variations and semantically similar inter-class objects due to their poor feature representation. To tackle this problem, we propose a dual prototypical contrastive learning approach tailored to the FSS task to capture the representative semanticfeatures effectively. The main idea is to encourage the prototypes more discriminative by increasing inter-class distance while reducing intra-class distance in prototype feature space. To this end, we first present a class-specific contrastive loss with a dynamic prototype dictionary that stores the class-aware prototypes during training, thus enabling the same class prototypes similar and the different class prototypes to be dissimilar. Furthermore, we introduce a class-agnostic contrastive loss to enhance the generalization ability to unseen classes by compressing the feature distribution of semantic class within each episode. We demonstrate that the proposed dual prototypical contrastive learning approach outperforms state-of-the-art FSS methods on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i datasets. The code is available at:https://github.com/kwonjunn01/DPCL1."
Temporal Fusion Based Mutli-scale Semantic Segmentation for Detecting Concealed Baggage Threats,"Detection of illegal and threatening items in baggage is one of the utmost security concern nowadays. Even for experienced security personnel, manual detection is a time-consuming and stressful task. Many academics have created automated frameworks for detecting suspicious and contraband data from X-ray scans of luggage. However, to our knowledge, no framework exists that utilizes temporal baggage X-ray imagery to effectively screen highly concealed and occluded objects which are barely visible even to the naked eye. To address this, we present a novel temporal fusion driven multi-scale residual fashioned encoder-decoder that takes series of consecutive scans as input and fuses them to generate distinct feature representations of the suspicious and non-suspicious baggage content, leading towards a more accurate extraction of the contraband data. The proposed methodology has been thoroughly tested using the publicly accessible GDXray dataset, which is the only dataset containing temporally linked grayscale X-ray scans showcasing extremely concealed contraband data. The proposed framework outperforms its competitors on the GDXray dataset on various metrics."
HS3: Learning with Proper Task Complexity in Hierarchically Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"While deeply supervised networks are common in recent literature, they typically impose the same learning objective on all transitional layers despite their varying representation powers.  In this paper, we propose Hierarchically Supervised Semantic Segmentation (HS3), a training scheme that supervises intermediate layers in a segmentation network to learn meaningful representations by varying task complexity. To enforce a consistent performance vs. complexity trade-off throughout the network, we derive various sets of class clusters to supervise each transitional layer of the network. Furthermore, we devise a fusion framework, HS3-Fuse, to aggregate the hierarchical features generated by these layers, which can provide rich semantic contexts and further enhance the final segmentation. Extensive experiments show that our proposed HS3 scheme considerably outperforms vanilla deep supervision with no added inference cost. Our proposed HS3-Fuse framework further improves segmentation predictions and achieves state-of-the-art results on two large segmentation benchmarks: NYUD-v2 and Cityscapes."
Continual Adaptation of Semantic Segmentation using Complementary 2D-3D Data Representations,"Semantic segmentation networks are usually pre-trained once and not updated during deployment. As a consequence, misclassifications commonly occur if the distribution of the training data deviates from the one encountered during the robot's operation. We propose to mitigate this problem by adapting the neural network to the robot's environment during deployment, without any need for external supervision. Leveraging complementary data representations, we generate a supervision signal, by probabilistically accumulating consecutive 2D semantic predictions in a volumetric 3D map. We then train the network on renderings of the accumulated semantic map, effectively resolving ambiguities and enforcing multi-view consistency through the 3D representation. In contrast to scene adaptation methods, we aim to retain the previously-learned knowledge, and therefore employ a continual learning experience replay strategy to adapt the network. Through extensive experimental evaluation, we show successful adaptation to real-world indoor scenes both on the ScanNet dataset and on in-house data recorded with an RGB-D sensor. Our method increases the segmentation accuracy on average by 9.9% compared to the fixed pre-trained neural network, while retaining knowledge from the pre-training dataset."
A Pixel-Level Meta-Learner for Weakly Supervised Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation,"Few-shot semantic segmentation addresses the learning task in which only few images with ground truth pixel-level labels are available for the novel classes of interest. One is typically required to collect a large mount of data (i.e., base classes) with such ground truth information, followed by meta-learning strategies to address the above learning task. When only image-level semantic labels can be observed during both training and testing, it is considered as an even more challenging task of weakly supervised few-shot semantic segmentation. To address this problem, we propose a novel meta-learning framework, which predicts pseudo pixel-level segmentation masks from a limited amount of data and their semantic labels. More importantly, our learning scheme further exploits the produced pixel-level information for query image inputs with segmentation guarantees. Thus, our proposed learning model can be viewed as a pixel-level meta-learner. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we show that our model achieves satisfactory performances under fully supervised settings, yet performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods under weakly supervised settings."
Multi-Scale High-Resolution Vision Transformer for Semantic Segmentation,"Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged with superior performance on computer vision tasks compared to convolutional neural network (CNN)-based models. However, ViTs are mainly designed for image classification that generate single-scale low-resolution representations, which makes dense prediction tasks such as semantic segmentation challenging for ViTs. Therefore, we propose HRViT, which enhances ViTs to learn semantically-rich and spatially-precise multi-scale representations by integrating high-resolution multi-branch architectures with ViTs. We balance the model performance and efficiency of HRViT by various branch-block co-optimization techniques. Specifically, we explore heterogeneous branch designs, reduce the redundancy in linear layers, and augment the attention block with enhanced expressiveness. Those approaches enabled HRViT to push the Pareto frontier of performance and efficiency on semantic segmentation to a new level, as our evaluation results on ADE20K and Cityscapes show. HRViT achieves 50.20% mIoU on ADE20K and 83.16% mIoU on Cityscapes, surpassing state-of-the-art MiT and CSWin backbones with an average of +1.78 mIoU improvement, 28% parameter saving, and 21% FLOPs reduction, demonstrating the potential of HRViT as a strong vision backbone for semantic segmentation."
Redundancy Reduction in Semantic Segmentation of 3D Brain Tumor MRIs,"Another year of the multimodal brain tumor segmentation challenge (BraTS) 2021 provides an even larger dataset to facilitate collaboration and research of brain tumor segmentation methods, which are necessary for disease analysis and treatment planning. A large dataset size of BraTS 2021 and the advent of modern GPUs provide a better opportunity for deep-learning based approaches to learn tumor representation from the data. In this work, we maintained an encoder-decoder based segmentation network, but focused on a modification of network training process that minimizes redundancy under perturbations. Given a set trained networks, we further introduce a confidence based ensembling techniques to further improve the performance. We evaluated the method on BraTS 2021 validation board, and achieved 0.8600, 0.8868 and 0.9265 average dice for enhanced tumor core, tumor core and whole tumor, respectively. Our team (NVAUTO) submission was the top performing in terms of ET and TC scores and within top 10 performing teams in terms of WT scores."
Learning Debiased and Disentangled Representations for Semantic Segmentation,"Deep neural networks are susceptible to learn biased models with entangled feature representations, which may lead to subpar performances on various downstream tasks. This is particularly true for under-represented classes, where a lack of diversity in the data exacerbates the tendency. This limitation has been addressed mostly in classification tasks, but there is little study on additional challenges that may appear in more complex dense prediction problems including semantic segmentation. To this end, we propose a model-agnostic and stochastic training scheme for semantic segmentation, which facilitates the learning of debiased and disentangled representations. For each class, we first extract class-specific information from the highly entangled feature map. Then, information related to a randomly sampled class is suppressed by a feature selection process in the feature space. By randomly eliminating certain class information in each training iteration, we effectively reduce feature dependencies among classes, and the model is able to learn more debiased and disentangled feature representations. Models trained with our approach demonstrate strong results on multiple semantic segmentation benchmarks, with especially notable performance gains on under-represented classes."
DRBANET: A Lightweight Dual-Resolution Network for Semantic Segmentation with Boundary Auxiliary,"Due to the powerful ability to encode image details and semantics, many lightweight dual-resolution networks have been proposed in recent years. However, most of them ignore the benefit of boundary information. This paper introduces a lightweight dual-resolution network, called DRBANet, aiming to refine semantic segmentation results with the aid of boundary information. DRBANet adopts dual parallel architecture, including: high resolution branch (HRB) and low resolution branch (LRB). Specifically, HRB mainly consists of a set of Efficient Inverted Bottleneck Modules (EIBMs), which learn feature representations with larger receptive fields. LRB is composed of a series of EIBMs and an Extremely Lightweight Pyramid Pooling Module (ELPPM), where ELPPM is utilized to capture multi-scale context through hierarchical residual connections. Finally, a boundary supervision head is designed to capture object boundaries in HRB. Extensive experiments on Cityscapes and CamVid datasets demonstrate that our method achieves promising trade-off between segmentation accuracy and running efficiency."
Smart(Sampling)Augment: Optimal and Efficient Data Augmentation for Semantic Segmentation,"Data augmentation methods enrich datasets with augmented data to improve the performance of neural networks. Recently, automated data augmentation methods have emerged, which automatically design augmentation strategies. Existing work focuses on image classification and object detection, whereas we provide the first study on semantic image segmentation and introduce two new approaches: \textit{SmartAugment} and \textit{SmartSamplingAugment}. SmartAugment uses Bayesian Optimization to search over a rich space of augmentation strategies and achieves a new state-of-the-art performance in all semantic segmentation tasks we consider. SmartSamplingAugment, a simple parameter-free approach with a fixed augmentation strategy competes in performance with the existing resource-intensive approaches and outperforms cheap state-of-the-art data augmentation methods. Further, we analyze the impact, interaction, and importance of data augmentation hyperparameters and perform ablation studies, which confirm our design choices behind SmartAugment and SmartSamplingAugment. Lastly, we will provide our source code for reproducibility and to facilitate further research."
Deep Deterministic Uncertainty for Semantic Segmentation,"We extend Deep Deterministic Uncertainty (DDU), a method for uncertainty estimation using feature space densities, to semantic segmentation. DDU enables quantifying and disentangling epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty in a single forward pass through the model. We study the similarity of feature representations of pixels at different locations for the same class and conclude that it is feasible to apply DDU location independently, which leads to a significant reduction in memory consumption compared to pixel dependent DDU. Using the DeepLab-v3+ architecture on Pascal VOC 2012, we show that DDU improves upon MC Dropout and Deep Ensembles while being significantly faster to compute."
AI-Powered Semantic Segmentation and Fluid Volume Calculation of Lung CT images in Covid-19 Patients,"COVID-19 pandemic is a deadly disease spreading very fast. People with the confronted immune system are susceptible to many health conditions. A highly significant condition is pneumonia, which is found to be the cause of death in the majority of patients. The main purpose of this study is to find the volume of GGO and consolidation of a covid-19 patient so that the physicians can prioritize the patients. Here we used transfer learning techniques for segmentation of lung CTs with the latest libraries and techniques which reduces training time and increases the accuracy of the AI Model. This system is trained with DeepLabV3+ network architecture and model Resnet50 with Imagenet weights. We used different augmentation techniques like Gaussian Noise, Horizontal shift, color variation, etc to get to the result. Intersection over Union(IoU) is used as the performance metrics. The IoU of lung masks is predicted as 99.78% and that of infected masks is as 89.01%. Our work effectively measures the volume of infected region by calculating the volume of infected and lung mask region of the patients."
Boundary Guided Context Aggregation for Semantic Segmentation,"The recent studies on semantic segmentation are starting to notice the significance of the boundary information, where most approaches see boundaries as the supplement of semantic details. However, simply combing boundaries and the mainstream features cannot ensure a holistic improvement of semantics modeling. In contrast to the previous studies, we exploit boundary as a significant guidance for context aggregation to promote the overall semantic understanding of an image. To this end, we propose a Boundary guided Context Aggregation Network (BCANet), where a Multi-Scale Boundary extractor (MSB) borrowing the backbone features at multiple scales is specifically designed for accurate boundary detection. Based on which, a Boundary guided Context Aggregation module (BCA) improved from Non-local network is further proposed to capture long-range dependencies between the pixels in the boundary regions and the ones inside the objects. By aggregating the context information along the boundaries, the inner pixels of the same category achieve mutual gains and therefore the intra-class consistency is enhanced. We conduct extensive experiments on the Cityscapes and ADE20K databases, and comparable results are achieved with the state-of-the-art methods, clearly demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed one."
Inferring the Class Conditional Response Map for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Image-level weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) relies on class activation maps (CAMs) for pseudo labels generation. As CAMs only highlight the most discriminative regions of objects, the generated pseudo labels are usually unsatisfactory to serve directly as supervision. To solve this, most existing approaches follow a multi-training pipeline to refine CAMs for better pseudo-labels, which includes: 1) re-training the classification model to generate CAMs; 2) post-processing CAMs to obtain pseudo labels; and 3) training a semantic segmentation model with the obtained pseudo labels. However, this multi-training pipeline requires complicated adjustment and additional time. To address this, we propose a class-conditional inference strategy and an activation aware mask refinement loss function to generate better pseudo labels without re-training the classifier. The class conditional inference-time approach is presented to separately and iteratively reveal the classification network's hidden object activation to generate more complete response maps. Further, our activation aware mask refinement loss function introduces a novel way to exploit saliency maps during segmentation training and refine the foreground object masks without suppressing background objects. Our method achieves superior WSSS results without requiring re-training of the classifier."
Denoised Non-Local Neural Network for Semantic Segmentation,"The non-local network has become a widely used technique for semantic segmentation, which computes an attention map to measure the relationships of each pixel pair. However, most of the current popular non-local models tend to ignore the phenomenon that the calculated attention map appears to be very noisy, containing inter-class and intra-class inconsistencies, which lowers the accuracy and reliability of the non-local methods. In this paper, we figuratively denote these inconsistencies as attention noises and explore the solutions to denoise them. Specifically, we inventively propose a Denoised Non-Local Network (Denoised NL), which consists of two primary modules, i.e., the Global Rectifying (GR) block and the Local Retention (LR) block, to eliminate the inter-class and intra-class noises respectively. First, GR adopts the class-level predictions to capture a binary map to distinguish whether the selected two pixels belong to the same category. Second, LR captures the ignored local dependencies and further uses them to rectify the unwanted hollows in the attention map. The experimental results on two challenging semantic segmentation datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our model. Without any external training data, our proposed Denoised NL can achieve the state-of-the-art performance of 83.5\% and 46.69\% mIoU on Cityscapes and ADE20K, respectively."
Semantic Segmentation for Urban-Scene Images,"Urban-scene Image segmentation is an important and trending topic in computer vision with wide use cases like autonomous driving [1]. Starting with the breakthrough work of Long et al. [2] that introduces Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs), the development of novel architectures and practical uses of neural networks in semantic segmentation has been expedited in the recent 5 years. Aside from seeking solutions in general model design for information shrinkage due to pooling, urban-scene image itself has intrinsic features like positional patterns [3]. Our project seeks an advanced and integrated solution that specifically targets urban-scene image semantic segmentation among the most novel approaches in the current field. We re-implement the cutting edge model DeepLabv3+ [4] with ResNet-101 [5] backbone as our strong baseline model. Based upon DeepLabv3+, we incorporate HANet [3] to account for the vertical spatial priors in urban-scene image tasks. To boost up model efficiency and performance, we further explore the Atrous Spatial Pooling (ASP) layer in DeepLabv3+ and infuse a computational efficient variation called ""Waterfall"" Atrous Spatial Pooling (WASP) [6] architecture in our model. We find that our two-step integrated model improves the mean Intersection-Over-Union (mIoU) score gradually from the baseline model. In particular, HANet successfully identifies height-driven patterns and improves per-class IoU of common class labels in urban scenario like fence and bus. We also demonstrate the improvement of model efficiency with help of WASP in terms of computational times during training and parameter reduction from the original ASPP module."
AuxAdapt: Stable and Efficient Test-Time Adaptation for Temporally Consistent Video Semantic Segmentation,"In video segmentation, generating temporally consistent results across frames is as important as achieving frame-wise accuracy. Existing methods rely either on optical flow regularization or fine-tuning with test data to attain temporal consistency. However, optical flow is not always avail-able and reliable. Besides, it is expensive to compute. Fine-tuning the original model in test time is cost sensitive.  This paper presents an efficient, intuitive, and unsupervised online adaptation method, AuxAdapt, for improving the temporal consistency of most neural network models. It does not require optical flow and only takes one pass of the video. Since inconsistency mainly arises from the model's uncertainty in its output, we propose an adaptation scheme where the model learns from its own segmentation decisions as it streams a video, which allows producing more confident and temporally consistent labeling for similarly-looking pixels across frames. For stability and efficiency, we leverage a small auxiliary segmentation network (AuxNet) to assist with this adaptation. More specifically, AuxNet readjusts the decision of the original segmentation network (Main-Net) by adding its own estimations to that of MainNet. At every frame, only AuxNet is updated via back-propagation while keeping MainNet fixed. We extensively evaluate our test-time adaptation approach on standard video benchmarks, including Cityscapes, CamVid, and KITTI. The results demonstrate that our approach provides label-wise accurate, temporally consistent, and computationally efficient adaptation (5+ folds overhead reduction comparing to state-of-the-art test-time adaptation methods)."
MaskSplit: Self-supervised Meta-learning for Few-shot Semantic Segmentation,"Just like other few-shot learning problems, few-shot segmentation aims to minimize the need for manual annotation, which is particularly costly in segmentation tasks. Even though the few-shot setting reduces this cost for novel test classes, there is still a need to annotate the training data. To alleviate this need, we propose a self-supervised training approach for learning few-shot segmentation models. We first use unsupervised saliency estimation to obtain pseudo-masks on images. We then train a simple prototype based model over different splits of pseudo masks and augmentations of images. Our extensive experiments show that the proposed approach achieves promising results, highlighting the potential of self-supervised training. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work that addresses unsupervised few-shot segmentation problem on natural images."
Multi-Domain Incremental Learning for Semantic Segmentation,"Recent efforts in multi-domain learning for semantic segmentation attempt to learn multiple geographical datasets in a universal, joint model. A simple fine-tuning experiment performed sequentially on three popular road scene segmentation datasets demonstrates that existing segmentation frameworks fail at incrementally learning on a series of visually disparate geographical domains. When learning a new domain, the model catastrophically forgets previously learned knowledge. In this work, we pose the problem of multi-domain incremental learning for semantic segmentation. Given a model trained on a particular geographical domain, the goal is to (i) incrementally learn a new geographical domain, (ii) while retaining performance on the old domain, (iii) given that the previous domain's dataset is not accessible. We propose a dynamic architecture that assigns universally shared, domain-invariant parameters to capture homogeneous semantic features present in all domains, while dedicated domain-specific parameters learn the statistics of each domain. Our novel optimization strategy helps achieve a good balance between retention of old knowledge (stability) and acquiring new knowledge (plasticity). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed solution on domain incremental settings pertaining to real-world driving scenes from roads of Germany (Cityscapes), the United States (BDD100k), and India (IDD)."
Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation of Vessel Images using Leaking Perturbations,"Semantic segmentation based on deep learning methods can attain appealing accuracy provided large amounts of annotated samples. However, it remains a challenging task when only limited labelled data are available, which is especially common in medical imaging. In this paper, we propose to use Leaking GAN, a GAN-based semi-supervised architecture for retina vessel semantic segmentation. Our key idea is to pollute the discriminator by leaking information from the generator. This leads to more moderate generations that benefit the training of GAN. As a result, the unlabelled examples can be better utilized to boost the learning of the discriminator, which eventually leads to stronger classification performance. In addition, to overcome the variations in medical images, the mean-teacher mechanism is utilized as an auxiliary regularization of the discriminator. Further, we modify the focal loss to fit it as the consistency objective for mean-teacher regularizer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the Leaking GAN framework achieves competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods when evaluated on benchmark datasets including DRIVE, STARE and CHASE\_DB1, using as few as 8 labelled images in the semi-supervised setting. It also outperforms existing algorithms on cross-domain segmentation tasks."
Few-shot Semantic Segmentation with Self-supervision from Pseudo-classes,"Despite the success of deep learning methods for semantic segmentation, few-shot semantic segmentation remains a challenging task due to the limited training data and the generalisation requirement for unseen classes. While recent progress has been particularly encouraging, we discover that existing methods tend to have poor performance in terms of meanIoU when query images contain other semantic classes besides the target class. To address this issue, we propose a novel self-supervised task that generates random pseudo-classes in the background of the query images, providing extra training data that would otherwise be unavailable when predicting individual target classes. To that end, we adopted superpixel segmentation for generating the pseudo-classes. With this extra supervision, we improved the meanIoU performance of the state-of-the-art method by 2.5% and 5.1% on the one-shot tasks, as well as 6.7% and 4.4% on the five-shot tasks, on the PASCAL-5i and COCO benchmarks, respectively."
Reimagine BiSeNet for Real-Time Domain Adaptation in Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation models have reached remarkable performance across various tasks. However, this performance is achieved with extremely large models, using powerful computational resources and without considering training and inference time. Real-world applications, on the other hand, necessitate models with minimal memory demands, efficient inference speed, and executable with low-resources embedded devices, such as self-driving vehicles. In this paper, we look at the challenge of real-time semantic segmentation across domains, and we train a model to act appropriately on real-world data even though it was trained on a synthetic realm. We employ a new lightweight and shallow discriminator that was specifically created for this purpose. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to present a real-time adversarial approach for assessing the domain adaption problem in semantic segmentation. We tested our framework in the two standard protocol: GTA5 to Cityscapes and SYNTHIA to Cityscapes. Code is available at: https://github.com/taveraantonio/RTDA."
Pixel-by-Pixel Cross-Domain Alignment for Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation,"In this paper we consider the task of semantic segmentation in autonomous driving applications. Specifically, we consider the cross-domain few-shot setting where training can use only few real-world annotated images and many annotated synthetic images. In this context, aligning the domains is made more challenging by the pixel-wise class imbalance that is intrinsic in the segmentation and that leads to ignoring the underrepresented classes and overfitting the well represented ones. We address this problem with a novel framework called Pixel-By-Pixel Cross-Domain Alignment (PixDA). We propose a novel pixel-by-pixel domain adversarial loss following three criteria: (i) align the source and the target domain for each pixel, (ii) avoid negative transfer on the correctly represented pixels, and (iii) regularize the training of infrequent classes to avoid overfitting. The pixel-wise adversarial training is assisted by a novel sample selection procedure, that handles the imbalance between source and target data, and a knowledge distillation strategy, that avoids overfitting towards the few target images. We demonstrate on standard synthetic-to-real benchmarks that PixDA outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in (1-5)-shot settings."
Learning 3D Semantic Segmentation with only 2D Image Supervision,"With the recent growth of urban mapping and autonomous driving efforts, there has been an explosion of raw 3D data collected from terrestrial platforms with lidar scanners and color cameras. However, due to high labeling costs, ground-truth 3D semantic segmentation annotations are limited in both quantity and geographic diversity, while also being difficult to transfer across sensors. In contrast, large image collections with ground-truth semantic segmentations are readily available for diverse sets of scenes. In this paper, we investigate how to use only those labeled 2D image collections to supervise training 3D semantic segmentation models. Our approach is to train a 3D model from pseudo-labels derived from 2D semantic image segmentations using multiview fusion. We address several novel issues with this approach, including how to select trusted pseudo-labels, how to sample 3D scenes with rare object categories, and how to decouple input features from 2D images from pseudo-labels during training. The proposed network architecture, 2D3DNet, achieves significantly better performance (+6.2-11.4 mIoU) than baselines during experiments on a new urban dataset with lidar and images captured in 20 cities across 5 continents."
Transfer beyond the Field of View: Dense Panoramic Semantic Segmentation via Unsupervised Domain Adaptation,"Autonomous vehicles clearly benefit from the expanded Field of View (FoV) of 360-degree sensors, but modern semantic segmentation approaches rely heavily on annotated training data which is rarely available for panoramic images. We look at this problem from the perspective of domain adaptation and bring panoramic semantic segmentation to a setting, where labelled training data originates from a different distribution of conventional pinhole camera images. To achieve this, we formalize the task of unsupervised domain adaptation for panoramic semantic segmentation and collect DensePASS - a novel densely annotated dataset for panoramic segmentation under cross-domain conditions, specifically built to study the Pinhole-to-Panoramic domain shift and accompanied with pinhole camera training examples obtained from Cityscapes. DensePASS covers both, labelled- and unlabelled 360-degree images, with the labelled data comprising 19 classes which explicitly fit the categories available in the source (i.e. pinhole) domain. Since data-driven models are especially susceptible to changes in data distribution, we introduce P2PDA - a generic framework for Pinhole-to-Panoramic semantic segmentation which addresses the challenge of domain divergence with different variants of attention-augmented domain adaptation modules, enabling the transfer in output-, feature-, and feature confidence spaces. P2PDA intertwines uncertainty-aware adaptation using confidence values regulated on-the-fly through attention heads with discrepant predictions. Our framework facilitates context exchange when learning domain correspondences and dramatically improves the adaptation performance of accuracy- and efficiency-focused models. Comprehensive experiments verify that our framework clearly surpasses unsupervised domain adaptation- and specialized panoramic segmentation approaches."
2020 CATARACTS Semantic Segmentation Challenge,"Surgical scene segmentation is essential for anatomy and instrument localization which can be further used to assess tissue-instrument interactions during a surgical procedure. In 2017, the Challenge on Automatic Tool Annotation for cataRACT Surgery (CATARACTS) released 50 cataract surgery videos accompanied by instrument usage annotations. These annotations included frame-level instrument presence information. In 2020, we released pixel-wise semantic annotations for anatomy and instruments for 4670 images sampled from 25 videos of the CATARACTS training set. The 2020 CATARACTS Semantic Segmentation Challenge, which was a sub-challenge of the 2020 MICCAI Endoscopic Vision (EndoVis) Challenge, presented three sub-tasks to assess participating solutions on anatomical structure and instrument segmentation. Their performance was assessed on a hidden test set of 531 images from 10 videos of the CATARACTS test set."
Exploiting Inter-pixel Correlations in Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation,"""Self-training"" has become a dominant method for semantic segmentation via unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). It creates a set of pseudo labels for the target domain to give explicit supervision. However, the pseudo labels are noisy, sparse and do not provide any information about inter-pixel correlations. We regard inter-pixel correlation quite important because semantic segmentation is a task of predicting highly structured pixel-level outputs. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a method of transferring the inter-pixel correlations from the source domain to the target domain via a self-attention module. The module takes the prediction of the segmentation network as an input and creates a self-attended prediction that correlates similar pixels. The module is trained only on the source domain to learn the domain-invariant inter-pixel correlations, then later, it is used to train the segmentation network on the target domain. The network learns not only from the pseudo labels but also by following the output of the self-attention module which provides additional knowledge about the inter-pixel correlations. Through extensive experiments, we show that our method significantly improves the performance on two standard UDA benchmarks and also can be combined with recent state-of-the-art method to achieve better performance."
OSS-Net: Memory Efficient High Resolution Semantic Segmentation of 3D Medical Data,"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the current state-of-the-art meta-algorithm for volumetric segmentation of medical data, for example, to localize COVID-19 infected tissue on computer tomography scans or the detection of tumour volumes in magnetic resonance imaging. A key limitation of 3D CNNs on voxelised data is that the memory consumption grows cubically with the training data resolution. Occupancy networks (O-Nets) are an alternative for which the data is represented continuously in a function space and 3D shapes are learned as a continuous decision boundary. While O-Nets are significantly more memory efficient than 3D CNNs, they are limited to simple shapes, are relatively slow at inference, and have not yet been adapted for 3D semantic segmentation of medical data. Here, we propose Occupancy Networks for Semantic Segmentation (OSS-Nets) to accurately and memory-efficiently segment 3D medical data. We build upon the original O-Net with modifications for increased expressiveness leading to improved segmentation performance comparable to 3D CNNs, as well as modifications for faster inference. We leverage local observations to represent complex shapes and prior encoder predictions to expedite inference. We showcase OSS-Net's performance on 3D brain tumour and liver segmentation against a function space baseline (O-Net), a performance baseline (3D residual U-Net), and an efficiency baseline (2D residual U-Net). OSS-Net yields segmentation results similar to the performance baseline and superior to the function space and efficiency baselines. In terms of memory efficiency, OSS-Net consumes comparable amounts of memory as the function space baseline, somewhat more memory than the efficiency baseline and significantly less than the performance baseline. As such, OSS-Net enables memory-efficient and accurate 3D semantic segmentation that can scale to high resolutions."
Semi-supervised Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation,"Deep learning approaches for semantic segmentation rely primarily on supervised learning approaches and require substantial efforts in producing pixel-level annotations. Further, such approaches may perform poorly when applied to unseen image domains. To cope with these limitations, both unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) with full source supervision but without target supervision and semi-supervised learning (SSL) with partial supervision have been proposed. While such methods are effective at aligning different feature distributions, there is still a need to efficiently exploit unlabeled data to address the performance gap with respect to fully-supervised methods. In this paper we address semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) for semantic segmentation, where a large amount of labeled source data as well as a small amount of labeled target data are available. We propose a novel and effective two-step semi-supervised dual-domain adaptation (SSDDA) approach to address both cross- and intra-domain gaps in semantic segmentation. The proposed framework is comprised of two mixing modules. First, we conduct a cross-domain adaptation via an image-level mixing strategy, which learns to align the distribution shift of features between the source data and target data. Second, intra-domain adaptation is achieved using a separate student-teacher network which is built to generate category-level data augmentation by mixing unlabeled target data in a way that respects predicted object boundaries. We demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two common synthetic-to-real semantic segmentation benchmarks. An extensive ablation study is provided to further validate the effectiveness of our approach."
FEANet: Feature-Enhanced Attention Network for RGB-Thermal Real-time Semantic Segmentation,"The RGB-Thermal (RGB-T) information for semantic segmentation has been extensively explored in recent years. However, most existing RGB-T semantic segmentation usually compromises spatial resolution to achieve real-time inference speed, which leads to poor performance. To better extract detail spatial information, we propose a two-stage Feature-Enhanced Attention Network (FEANet) for the RGB-T semantic segmentation task. Specifically, we introduce a Feature-Enhanced Attention Module (FEAM) to excavate and enhance multi-level features from both the channel and spatial views. Benefited from the proposed FEAM module, our FEANet can preserve the spatial information and shift more attention to high-resolution features from the fused RGB-T images. Extensive experiments on the urban scene dataset demonstrate that our FEANet outperforms other state-of-the-art (SOTA) RGB-T methods in terms of objective metrics and subjective visual comparison (+2.6% in global mAcc and +0.8% in global mIoU). For the 480 x 640 RGB-T test images, our FEANet can run with a real-time speed on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti card."
LoveDA: A Remote Sensing Land-Cover Dataset for Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation,"Deep learning approaches have shown promising results in remote sensing high spatial resolution (HSR) land-cover mapping. However, urban and rural scenes can show completely different geographical landscapes, and the inadequate generalizability of these algorithms hinders city-level or national-level mapping. Most of the existing HSR land-cover datasets mainly promote the research of learning semantic representation, thereby ignoring the model transferability. In this paper, we introduce the Land-cOVEr Domain Adaptive semantic segmentation (LoveDA) dataset to advance semantic and transferable learning. The LoveDA dataset contains 5987 HSR images with 166768 annotated objects from three different cities. Compared to the existing datasets, the LoveDA dataset encompasses two domains (urban and rural), which brings considerable challenges due to the: 1) multi-scale objects; 2) complex background samples; and 3) inconsistent class distributions. The LoveDA dataset is suitable for both land-cover semantic segmentation and unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) tasks. Accordingly, we benchmarked the LoveDA dataset on eleven semantic segmentation methods and eight UDA methods. Some exploratory studies including multi-scale architectures and strategies, additional background supervision, and pseudo-label analysis were also carried out to address these challenges. The code and data are available at https://github.com/Junjue-Wang/LoveDA."
"Performance, Successes and Limitations of Deep Learning Semantic Segmentation of Multiple Defects in Transmission Electron Micrographs","In this work, we perform semantic segmentation of multiple defect types in electron microscopy images of irradiated FeCrAl alloys using a deep learning Mask Regional Convolutional Neural Network (Mask R-CNN) model. We conduct an in-depth analysis of key model performance statistics, with a focus on quantities such as predicted distributions of defect shapes, defect sizes, and defect areal densities relevant to informing modeling and understanding of irradiated Fe-based materials properties. To better understand the performance and present limitations of the model, we provide examples of useful evaluation tests which include a suite of random splits, and dataset size-dependent and domain-targeted cross validation tests. Overall, we find that the current model is a fast, effective tool for automatically characterizing and quantifying multiple defect types in microscopy images, with a level of accuracy on par with human domain expert labelers. More specifically, the model can achieve average defect identification F1 scores as high as 0.8, and, based on random cross validation, have low overall average (+/- standard deviation) defect size and density percentage errors of 7.3 (+/- 3.8)% and 12.7 (+/- 5.3)%, respectively. Further, our model predicts the expected material hardening to within 10-20 MPa (about 10% of total hardening), which is about the same error level as experiments. Our targeted evaluation tests also suggest the best path toward improving future models is not expanding existing databases with more labeled images but instead data additions that target weak points of the model domain, such as images from different microscopes, imaging conditions, irradiation environments, and alloy types. Finally, we discuss the first phase of an effort to provide an easy-to-use, open-source object detection tool to the broader community for identifying defects in new images."
Guided Point Contrastive Learning for Semi-supervised Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation,"Rapid progress in 3D semantic segmentation is inseparable from the advances of deep network models, which highly rely on large-scale annotated data for training. To address the high cost and challenges of 3D point-level labeling, we present a method for semi-supervised point cloud semantic segmentation to adopt unlabeled point clouds in training to boost the model performance. Inspired by the recent contrastive loss in self-supervised tasks, we propose the guided point contrastive loss to enhance the feature representation and model generalization ability in semi-supervised setting. Semantic predictions on unlabeled point clouds serve as pseudo-label guidance in our loss to avoid negative pairs in the same category. Also, we design the confidence guidance to ensure high-quality feature learning. Besides, a category-balanced sampling strategy is proposed to collect positive and negative samples to mitigate the class imbalance problem. Extensive experiments on three datasets (ScanNet V2, S3DIS, and SemanticKITTI) show the effectiveness of our semi-supervised method to improve the prediction quality with unlabeled data."
Multi-Layer Pseudo-Supervision for Histopathology Tissue Semantic Segmentation using Patch-level Classification Labels,"Tissue-level semantic segmentation is a vital step in computational pathology. Fully-supervised models have already achieved outstanding performance with dense pixel-level annotations. However, drawing such labels on the giga-pixel whole slide images is extremely expensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we use only patch-level classification labels to achieve tissue semantic segmentation on histopathology images, finally reducing the annotation efforts. We proposed a two-step model including a classification and a segmentation phases. In the classification phase, we proposed a CAM-based model to generate pseudo masks by patch-level labels. In the segmentation phase, we achieved tissue semantic segmentation by our proposed Multi-Layer Pseudo-Supervision. Several technical novelties have been proposed to reduce the information gap between pixel-level and patch-level annotations. As a part of this paper, we introduced a new weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) dataset for lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD-HistoSeg). We conducted several experiments to evaluate our proposed model on two datasets. Our proposed model outperforms two state-of-the-art WSSS approaches. Note that we can achieve comparable quantitative and qualitative results with the fully-supervised model, with only around a 2\% gap for MIoU and FwIoU. By comparing with manual labeling, our model can greatly save the annotation time from hours to minutes. The source code is available at: \url{https://github.com/ChuHan89/WSSS-Tissue}."
Active Learning for Improved Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation in Satellite Images,"Remote sensing data is crucial for applications ranging from monitoring forest fires and deforestation to tracking urbanization. Most of these tasks require dense pixel-level annotations for the model to parse visual information from limited labeled data available for these satellite images. Due to the dearth of high-quality labeled training data in this domain, there is a need to focus on semi-supervised techniques. These techniques generate pseudo-labels from a small set of labeled examples which are used to augment the labeled training set. This makes it necessary to have a highly representative and diverse labeled training set. Therefore, we propose to use an active learning-based sampling strategy to select a highly representative set of labeled training data. We demonstrate our proposed method's effectiveness on two existing semantic segmentation datasets containing satellite images: UC Merced Land Use Classification Dataset and DeepGlobe Land Cover Classification Dataset. We report a 27% improvement in mIoU with as little as 2% labeled data using active learning sampling strategies over randomly sampling the small set of labeled training data."
Beyond Classification: Directly Training Spiking Neural Networks for Semantic Segmentation,"Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have recently emerged as the low-power alternative to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) because of their sparse, asynchronous, and binary event-driven processing. Due to their energy efficiency, SNNs have a high possibility of being deployed for real-world, resource-constrained systems such as autonomous vehicles and drones. However, owing to their non-differentiable and complex neuronal dynamics, most previous SNN optimization methods have been limited to image recognition. In this paper, we explore the SNN applications beyond classification and present semantic segmentation networks configured with spiking neurons. Specifically, we first investigate two representative SNN optimization techniques for recognition tasks (i.e., ANN-SNN conversion and surrogate gradient learning) on semantic segmentation datasets. We observe that, when converted from ANNs, SNNs suffer from high latency and low performance due to the spatial variance of features. Therefore, we directly train networks with surrogate gradient learning, resulting in lower latency and higher performance than ANN-SNN conversion. Moreover, we redesign two fundamental ANN segmentation architectures (i.e., Fully Convolutional Networks and DeepLab) for the SNN domain. We conduct experiments on two public semantic segmentation benchmarks including the PASCAL VOC2012 dataset and the DDD17 event-based dataset. In addition to showing the feasibility of SNNs for semantic segmentation, we show that SNNs can be more robust and energy-efficient compared to their ANN counterparts in this domain."
Domain Adaptation on Semantic Segmentation with Separate Affine Transformation in Batch Normalization,"In recent years, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for semantic segmentation has brought many researchers'attention. Many of them take an approach to design a complex system so as to better align the gap between source and target domain. Instead, we focus on the very basic structure of the deep neural network, Batch Normalization, and propose to replace the Sharing Affine Transformation with our proposed Separate Affine Transformation (SEAT). The proposed SEAT is simple, easily implemented and easy to integrate into existing adversarial learning based UDA methods. Also, to further improve the adaptation quality, we introduce multi level adaptation by adding the lower-level features to the higher-level ones before feeding them to the discriminator, without adding extra discriminator like others. Experiments show that the proposed methods is less complex without losing performance accuracy when compared with other UDA methods."
Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation by Pixel-to-Prototype Contrast,"Though image-level weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) has achieved great progress with Class Activation Maps (CAMs) as the cornerstone, the large supervision gap between classification and segmentation still hampers the model to generate more complete and precise pseudo masks for segmentation. In this study, we propose weakly-supervised pixel-to-prototype contrast that can provide pixel-level supervisory signals to narrow the gap. Guided by two intuitive priors, our method is executed across different views and within per single view of an image, aiming to impose cross-view feature semantic consistency regularization and facilitate intra(inter)-class compactness(dispersion) of the feature space. Our method can be seamlessly incorporated into existing WSSS models without any changes to the base networks and does not incur any extra inference burden. Extensive experiments manifest that our method consistently improves two strong baselines by large margins, demonstrating the effectiveness. Specifically, built on top of SEAM, we improve the initial seed mIoU on PASCAL VOC 2012 from 55.4% to 61.5%. Moreover, armed with our method, we increase the segmentation mIoU of EPS from 70.8% to 73.6%, achieving new state-of-the-art."
Plugging Self-Supervised Monocular Depth into Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation,"Although recent semantic segmentation methods have made remarkable progress, they still rely on large amounts of annotated training data, which are often infeasible to collect in the autonomous driving scenario. Previous works usually tackle this issue with Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA), which entails training a network on synthetic images and applying the model to real ones while minimizing the discrepancy between the two domains. Yet, these techniques do not consider additional information that may be obtained from other tasks. Differently, we propose to exploit self-supervised monocular depth estimation to improve UDA for semantic segmentation. On one hand, we deploy depth to realize a plug-in component which can inject complementary geometric cues into any existing UDA method. We further rely on depth to generate a large and varied set of samples to Self-Train the final model. Our whole proposal allows for achieving state-of-the-art performance (58.8 mIoU) in the GTA5->CS benchmark benchmark. Code is available at https://github.com/CVLAB-Unibo/d4-dbst."
Reducing Information Bottleneck for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Weakly supervised semantic segmentation produces pixel-level localization from class labels; however, a classifier trained on such labels is likely to focus on a small discriminative region of the target object. We interpret this phenomenon using the information bottleneck principle: the final layer of a deep neural network, activated by the sigmoid or softmax activation functions, causes an information bottleneck, and as a result, only a subset of the task-relevant information is passed on to the output. We first support this argument through a simulated toy experiment and then propose a method to reduce the information bottleneck by removing the last activation function. In addition, we introduce a new pooling method that further encourages the transmission of information from non-discriminative regions to the classification. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that this simple modification significantly improves the quality of localization maps on both the PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 datasets, exhibiting a new state-of-the-art performance for weakly supervised semantic segmentation. The code is available at: https://github.com/jbeomlee93/RIB."
Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation without Source Data,"Domain adaptive semantic segmentation is recognized as a promising technique to alleviate the domain shift between the labeled source domain and the unlabeled target domain in many real-world applications, such as automatic pilot. However, large amounts of source domain data often introduce significant costs in storage and training, and sometimes the source data is inaccessible due to privacy policies. To address these problems, we investigate domain adaptive semantic segmentation without source data, which assumes that the model is pre-trained on the source domain, and then adapting to the target domain without accessing source data anymore. Since there is no supervision from the source domain data, many self-training methods tend to fall into the ``winner-takes-all'' dilemma, where the {\it majority} classes totally dominate the segmentation networks and the networks fail to classify the {\it minority} classes. Consequently, we propose an effective framework for this challenging problem with two components: positive learning and negative learning. In positive learning, we select the class-balanced pseudo-labeled pixels with intra-class threshold, while in negative learning, for each pixel, we investigate which category the pixel does not belong to with the proposed heuristic complementary label selection. Notably, our framework can be easily implemented and incorporated with other methods to further enhance the performance. Extensive experiments on two widely-used synthetic-to-real benchmarks demonstrate our claims and the effectiveness of our framework, which outperforms the baseline with a large margin. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/fumyou13/LDBE}."
"Exploring Content Based Image Retrieval for Highly Imbalanced Melanoma Data using Style Transfer, Semantic Image Segmentation and Ensemble Learning","Lesion images are frequently taken in open-set settings. Because of this, the image data generated is extremely varied in nature.It is difficult for a convolutional neural network to find proper features and generalise well, as a result content based image retrieval (CBIR) system for lesion images are difficult to build. This paper explores this domain and proposes multiple similarity measures which uses Style Loss and Dice Coefficient via a novel similarity measure called I1-Score. Out of the CBIR similarity measures proposed, pure style loss approach achieves a remarkable accuracy increase over traditional approaches like Euclidean Distance and Cosine Similarity. The I1-Scores using style loss performed better than traditional approaches by a small margin, whereas, I1-Scores with dice-coefficient faired very poorly. The model used is trained using ensemble learning for better generalization."
Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation by Learning Label Uncertainty,"Since the rise of deep learning, many computer vision tasks have seen significant advancements. However, the downside of deep learning is that it is very data-hungry. Especially for segmentation problems, training a deep neural net requires dense supervision in the form of pixel-perfect image labels, which are very costly. In this paper, we present a new loss function to train a segmentation network with only a small subset of pixel-perfect labels, but take the advantage of weakly-annotated training samples in the form of cheap bounding-box labels. Unlike recent works which make use of box-to-mask proposal generators, our loss trains the network to learn a label uncertainty within the bounding-box, which can be leveraged to perform online bootstrapping (i.e. transforming the boxes to segmentation masks), while training the network. We evaluated our method on binary segmentation tasks, as well as a multi-class segmentation task (CityScapes vehicles and persons). We trained each task on a dataset comprised of only 18% pixel-perfect and 82% bounding-box labels, and compared the results to a baseline model trained on a completely pixel-perfect dataset. For the binary segmentation tasks, our method achieves an IoU score which is ~98.33% as good as our baseline model, while for the multi-class task, our method is 97.12% as good as our baseline model (77.5 vs. 79.8 mIoU)."
Satellite Image Semantic Segmentation,"In this paper, we propose a method for the automatic semantic segmentation of satellite images into six classes (sparse forest, dense forest, moor, herbaceous formation, building, and road). We rely on Swin Transformer architecture and build the dataset from IGN open data. We report quantitative and qualitative segmentation results on this dataset and discuss strengths and limitations. The dataset and the trained model are made publicly available."
Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation via Adaptive Equalization Learning,"Due to the limited and even imbalanced data, semi-supervised semantic segmentation tends to have poor performance on some certain categories, e.g., tailed categories in Cityscapes dataset which exhibits a long-tailed label distribution. Existing approaches almost all neglect this problem, and treat categories equally. Some popular approaches such as consistency regularization or pseudo-labeling may even harm the learning of under-performing categories, that the predictions or pseudo labels of these categories could be too inaccurate to guide the learning on the unlabeled data. In this paper, we look into this problem, and propose a novel framework for semi-supervised semantic segmentation, named adaptive equalization learning (AEL). AEL adaptively balances the training of well and badly performed categories, with a confidence bank to dynamically track category-wise performance during training. The confidence bank is leveraged as an indicator to tilt training towards under-performing categories, instantiated in three strategies: 1) adaptive Copy-Paste and CutMix data augmentation approaches which give more chance for under-performing categories to be copied or cut; 2) an adaptive data sampling approach to encourage pixels from under-performing category to be sampled; 3) a simple yet effective re-weighting method to alleviate the training noise raised by pseudo-labeling. Experimentally, AEL outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on the Cityscapes and Pascal VOC benchmarks under various data partition protocols. Code is available at https://github.com/hzhupku/SemiSeg-AEL"
Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation via Regional Contrastive Consistency Regularization,"Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for semantic segmentation has been well-studied in recent years. However, most existing works largely neglect the local regional consistency across different domains and are less robust to changes in outdoor environments. In this paper, we propose a novel and fully end-to-end trainable approach, called regional contrastive consistency regularization (RCCR) for domain adaptive semantic segmentation. Our core idea is to pull the similar regional features extracted from the same location of different images, i.e., the original image and augmented image, to be closer, and meanwhile push the features from the different locations of the two images to be separated. We innovatively propose a region-wise contrastive loss with two sampling strategies to realize effective regional consistency. Besides, we present momentum projection heads, where the teacher projection head is the exponential moving average of the student. Finally, a memory bank mechanism is designed to learn more robust and stable region-wise features under varying environments. Extensive experiments on two common UDA benchmarks, i.e., GTAV to Cityscapes and SYNTHIA to Cityscapes, demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods."
Colour augmentation for improved semi-supervised semantic segmentation,"Consistency regularization describes a class of approaches that have yielded state-of-the-art results for semi-supervised classification. While semi-supervised semantic segmentation proved to be more challenging, a number of successful approaches have been recently proposed. Recent work explored the challenges involved in using consistency regularization for segmentation problems. In their self-supervised work Chen et al. found that colour augmentation prevents a classification network from using image colour statistics as a short-cut for self-supervised learning via instance discrimination. Drawing inspiration from this we find that a similar problem impedes semi-supervised semantic segmentation and offer colour augmentation as a solution, improving semi-supervised semantic segmentation performance on challenging photographic imagery."
"Discover, Hallucinate, and Adapt: Open Compound Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation","Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for semantic segmentation has been attracting attention recently, as it could be beneficial for various label-scarce real-world scenarios (e.g., robot control, autonomous driving, medical imaging, etc.). Despite the significant progress in this field, current works mainly focus on a single-source single-target setting, which cannot handle more practical settings of multiple targets or even unseen targets. In this paper, we investigate open compound domain adaptation (OCDA), which deals with mixed and novel situations at the same time, for semantic segmentation. We present a novel framework based on three main design principles: discover, hallucinate, and adapt. The scheme first clusters compound target data based on style, discovering multiple latent domains (discover). Then, it hallucinates multiple latent target domains in source by using image-translation (hallucinate). This step ensures the latent domains in the source and the target to be paired. Finally, target-to-source alignment is learned separately between domains (adapt). In high-level, our solution replaces a hard OCDA problem with much easier multiple UDA problems. We evaluate our solution on standard benchmark GTA to C-driving, and achieved new state-of-the-art results."
Maximize the Exploration of Congeneric Semantics for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"With the increase in the number of image data and the lack of corresponding labels, weakly supervised learning has drawn a lot of attention recently in computer vision tasks, especially in the fine-grained semantic segmentation problem. To alleviate human efforts from expensive pixel-by-pixel annotations, our method focuses on weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) with image-level tags, which are much easier to obtain. As a huge gap exists between pixel-level segmentation and image-level labels, how to reflect the image-level semantic information on each pixel is an important question. To explore the congeneric semantic regions from the same class to the maximum, we construct the patch-level graph neural network (P-GNN) based on the self-detected patches from different images that contain the same class labels. Patches can frame the objects as much as possible and include as little background as possible. The graph network that is established with patches as the nodes can maximize the mutual learning of similar objects. We regard the embedding vectors of patches as nodes, and use transformer-based complementary learning module to construct weighted edges according to the embedding similarity between different nodes. Moreover, to better supplement semantic information, we propose soft-complementary loss functions matched with the whole network structure. We conduct experiments on the popular PASCAL VOC 2012 benchmarks, and our model yields state-of-the-art performance."
InfoSeg: Unsupervised Semantic Image Segmentation with Mutual Information Maximization,"We propose a novel method for unsupervised semantic image segmentation based on mutual information maximization between local and global high-level image features. The core idea of our work is to leverage recent progress in self-supervised image representation learning. Representation learning methods compute a single high-level feature capturing an entire image. In contrast, we compute multiple high-level features, each capturing image segments of one particular semantic class. To this end, we propose a novel two-step learning procedure comprising a segmentation and a mutual information maximization step. In the first step, we segment images based on local and global features. In the second step, we maximize the mutual information between local features and high-level features of their respective class. For training, we provide solely unlabeled images and start from random network initialization. For quantitative and qualitative evaluation, we use established benchmarks, and COCO-Persons, whereby we introduce the latter in this paper as a challenging novel benchmark. InfoSeg significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art, e.g., we achieve a relative increase of 26% in the Pixel Accuracy metric on the COCO-Stuff dataset."
Shallow Features Guide Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation at Class Boundaries,"Although deep neural networks have achieved remarkable results for the task of semantic segmentation, they usually fail to generalize towards new domains, especially when performing synthetic-to-real adaptation. Such domain shift is particularly noticeable along class boundaries, invalidating one of the main goals of semantic segmentation that consists in obtaining sharp segmentation masks. In this work, we specifically address this core problem in the context of Unsupervised Domain Adaptation and present a novel low-level adaptation strategy that allows us to obtain sharp predictions. Moreover, inspired by recent self-training techniques, we introduce an effective data augmentation that alleviates the noise typically present at semantic boundaries when employing pseudo-labels for self-training. Our contributions can be easily integrated into other popular adaptation frameworks, and extensive experiments show that they effectively improve performance along class boundaries."
MetaPix: Domain Transfer for Semantic Segmentation by Meta Pixel Weighting,"Training a deep neural model for semantic segmentation requires collecting a large amount of pixel-level labeled data. To alleviate the data scarcity problem presented in the real world, one could utilize synthetic data whose label is easy to obtain. Previous work has shown that the performance of a semantic segmentation model can be improved by training jointly with real and synthetic examples with a proper weighting on the synthetic data. Such weighting was learned by a heuristic to maximize the similarity between synthetic and real examples. In our work, we instead learn a pixel-level weighting of the synthetic data by meta-learning, i.e., the learning of weighting should only be minimizing the loss on the target task. We achieve this by gradient-on-gradient technique to propagate the target loss back into the parameters of the weighting model. The experiments show that our method with only one single meta module can outperform a complicated combination of an adversarial feature alignment, a reconstruction loss, plus a hierarchical heuristic weighting at pixel, region and image levels."
Weak-shot Semantic Segmentation by Transferring Semantic Affinity and Boundary,"Weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) with image-level labels has been widely studied to relieve the annotation burden of the traditional segmentation task. In this paper, we show that existing fully-annotated base categories can help segment objects of novel categories with only image-level labels, even if base categories and novel categories have no overlap. We refer to this task as weak-shot semantic segmentation, which could also be treated as WSSS with auxiliary fully-annotated categories. Recent advanced WSSS methods usually obtain class activation maps (CAMs) and refine them by affinity propagation. Based on the observation that semantic affinity and boundary are class-agnostic, we propose a method under the WSSS framework to transfer semantic affinity and boundary from base to novel categories. As a result, we find that pixel-level annotation of base categories can facilitate affinity learning and propagation, leading to higher-quality CAMs of novel categories. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset prove that our method significantly outperforms WSSS baselines on novel categories."
A new weakly supervised approach for ALS point cloud semantic segmentation,"While there are novel point cloud semantic segmentation schemes that continuously surpass state-of-the-art results, the success of learning an effective model usually rely on the availability of abundant labeled data. However, data annotation is a time-consuming and labor-intensive task, particularly for large-scale airborne laser scanning (ALS) point clouds involving multiple classes in urban areas. Thus, how to attain promising results while largely reducing labeling works become an essential issue. In this study, we propose a deep-learning based weakly supervised framework for semantic segmentation of ALS point clouds, exploiting potential information from unlabeled data subject to incomplete and sparse labels. Entropy regularization is introduced to penalize the class overlap in predictive probability. Additionally, a consistency constraint by minimizing the discrepancy distance between instant and ensemble predictions is designed to improve the robustness of predictions. Finally, we propose an online soft pseudo-labeling strategy to create extra supervisory sources in an efficient and nonpaprametric way. Extensive experimental analysis using three benchmark datasets demonstrates that in case of sparse point annotations, our proposed method significantly boosts the classification performance without compromising the computational efficiency. It outperforms current weakly supervised methods and achieves a comparable result against full supervision competitors. For the ISPRS 3D Labeling Vaihingen data, by using only 0.1% of labels, our method achieves an overall accuracy of 83.0% and an average F1 score of 70.0%, which have increased by 6.9% and 12.8% respectively, compared to model trained by sparse label information only."
Transferability Estimation for Semantic Segmentation Task,"Transferability estimation is a fundamental problem in transfer learning to predict how good the performance is when transferring a source model (or source task) to a target task. With the guidance of transferability score, we can efficiently select the highly transferable source models without performing the real transfer in practice. Recent analytical transferability metrics are mainly designed for image classification problem, and currently there is no specific investigation for the transferability estimation of semantic segmentation task, which is an essential problem in autonomous driving, medical image analysis, etc. Consequently, we further extend the recent analytical transferability metric OTCE (Optimal Transport based Conditional Entropy) score to the semantic segmentation task. The challenge in applying the OTCE score is the high dimensional segmentation output, which is difficult to find the optimal coupling between so many pixels under an acceptable computation cost. Thus we propose to randomly sample N pixels for computing OTCE score and take the expectation over K repetitions as the final transferability score. Experimental evaluation on Cityscapes, BDD100K and GTA5 datasets demonstrates that the OTCE score highly correlates with the transfer performance."
Semantic Dense Reconstruction with Consistent Scene Segments,"In this paper, a method for dense semantic 3D scene reconstruction from an RGB-D sequence is proposed to solve high-level scene understanding tasks. First, each RGB-D pair is consistently segmented into 2D semantic maps based on a camera tracking backbone that propagates objects' labels with high probabilities from full scans to corresponding ones of partial views. Then a dense 3D mesh model of an unknown environment is incrementally generated from the input RGB-D sequence. Benefiting from 2D consistent semantic segments and the 3D model, a novel semantic projection block (SP-Block) is proposed to extract deep feature volumes from 2D segments of different views. Moreover, the semantic volumes are fused into deep volumes from a point cloud encoder to make the final semantic segmentation. Extensive experimental evaluations on public datasets show that our system achieves accurate 3D dense reconstruction and state-of-the-art semantic prediction performances simultaneously."
Spark in the Dark: Evaluating Encoder-Decoder Pairs for COVID-19 CT's Semantic Segmentation,"With the COVID-19 global pandemic, computerassisted diagnoses of medical images have gained a lot of attention, and robust methods of Semantic Segmentation of Computed Tomography (CT) turned highly desirable. Semantic Segmentation of CT is one of many research fields of automatic detection of Covid-19 and was widely explored since the Covid19 outbreak. In the robotic field, Semantic Segmentation of organs and CTs are widely used in robots developed for surgery tasks. As new methods and new datasets are proposed quickly, it becomes apparent the necessity of providing an extensive evaluation of those methods. To provide a standardized comparison of different architectures across multiple recently proposed datasets, we propose in this paper an extensive benchmark of multiple encoders and decoders with a total of 120 architectures evaluated in five datasets, with each dataset being validated through a five-fold cross-validation strategy, totaling 3.000 experiments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest evaluation in number of encoders, decoders, and datasets proposed in the field of Covid-19 CT segmentation."
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation in Semantic Segmentation Based on Pixel Alignment and Self-Training,"This paper proposes an unsupervised cross-modality domain adaptation approach based on pixel alignment and self-training. Pixel alignment transfers ceT1 scans to hrT2 modality, helping to reduce domain shift in the training segmentation model. Self-training adapts the decision boundary of the segmentation network to fit the distribution of hrT2 scans. Experiment results show that PAST has outperformed the non-UDA baseline significantly, and it received rank-2 on CrossMoDA validation phase Leaderboard with a mean Dice score of 0.8395."
WEDGE: Web-Image Assisted Domain Generalization for Semantic Segmentation,"Domain generalization for semantic segmentation is highly demanded in real applications, where a trained model is expected to work well in previously unseen domains. One challenge lies in the lack of data which could cover the diverse distributions of the possible unseen domains for training. In this paper, we propose a WEb-image assisted Domain GEneralization (WEDGE) scheme, which is the first to exploit the diversity of web-crawled images for generalizable semantic segmentation. To explore and exploit the real-world data distributions, we collect web-crawled images which present large diversity in terms of weather conditions, sites, lighting, camera styles, etc. We also present a method which injects styles of the web-crawled images into training images on-the-fly during training, which enables the network to experience images of diverse styles with reliable labels for effective training. Moreover, we use the web-crawled images with their predicted pseudo labels for training to further enhance the capability of the network. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method clearly outperforms existing domain generalization techniques."
Comparison of atlas-based and neural-network-based semantic segmentation for DENSE MRI images,"Two segmentation methods, one atlas-based and one neural-network-based, were compared to see how well they can each automatically segment the brain stem and cerebellum in Displacement Encoding with Stimulated Echoes Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DENSE-MRI) data. The segmentation is a pre-requisite for estimating the average displacements in these regions, which have recently been proposed as biomarkers in the diagnosis of Chiari Malformation type I (CMI). In numerical experiments, the segmentations of both methods were similar to manual segmentations provided by trained experts. It was found that, overall, the neural-network-based method alone produced more accurate segmentations than the atlas-based method did alone, but that a combination of the two methods -- in which the atlas-based method is used for the segmentation of the brain stem and the neural-network is used for the segmentation of the cerebellum -- may be the most successful."
PFENet++: Boosting Few-shot Semantic Segmentation with the Noise-filtered Context-aware Prior Mask,"In this work, we revisit the prior mask guidance proposed in ""Prior Guided Feature Enrichment Network for Few-Shot Segmentation"". The prior mask serves as an indicator that highlights the region of interests of unseen categories, and it is effective in achieving better performance on different frameworks of recent studies.  However, the current method directly takes the maximum element-to-element correspondence between the query and support features to indicate the probability of belonging to the target class, thus the broader contextual information is seldom exploited during the prior mask generation. To address this issue, first, we propose the Context-aware Prior Mask (CAPM) that leverages additional nearby semantic cues for better locating the objects in query images. Second, since the maximum correlation value is vulnerable to noisy features, we take one step further by incorporating a lightweight Noise Suppression Module (NSM) to screen out the unnecessary responses, yielding high-quality masks for providing the prior knowledge.  Both two contributions are experimentally shown to have substantial practical merit, and the new model named PFENet++ significantly outperforms the baseline PFENet as well as all other competitors on three challenging benchmarks PASCAL-5^i, COCO-20^i and FSS-1000.  The new state-of-the-art performance is achieved without compromising the efficiency, manifesting the potential for being a new strong baseline in few-shot semantic segmentation.  Our code will be available at https://github.com/dvlab-research/PFENet++."
ReCal-Net: Joint Region-Channel-Wise Calibrated Network for Semantic Segmentation in Cataract Surgery Videos,"Semantic segmentation in surgical videos is a prerequisite for a broad range of applications towards improving surgical outcomes and surgical video analysis. However, semantic segmentation in surgical videos involves many challenges. In particular, in cataract surgery, various features of the relevant objects such as blunt edges, color and context variation, reflection, transparency, and motion blur pose a challenge for semantic segmentation. In this paper, we propose a novel convolutional module termed as \textit{ReCal} module, which can calibrate the feature maps by employing region intra-and-inter-dependencies and channel-region cross-dependencies. This calibration strategy can effectively enhance semantic representation by correlating different representations of the same semantic label, considering a multi-angle local view centering around each pixel. Thus the proposed module can deal with distant visual characteristics of unique objects as well as cross-similarities in the visual characteristics of different objects. Moreover, we propose a novel network architecture based on the proposed module termed as ReCal-Net. Experimental results confirm the superiority of ReCal-Net compared to rival state-of-the-art approaches for all relevant objects in cataract surgery. Moreover, ablation studies reveal the effectiveness of the ReCal module in boosting semantic segmentation accuracy."
GSIP: Green Semantic Segmentation of Large-Scale Indoor Point Clouds,"An efficient solution to semantic segmentation of large-scale indoor scene point clouds is proposed in this work. It is named GSIP (Green Segmentation of Indoor Point clouds) and its performance is evaluated on a representative large-scale benchmark -- the Stanford 3D Indoor Segmentation (S3DIS) dataset. GSIP has two novel components: 1) a room-style data pre-processing method that selects a proper subset of points for further processing, and 2) a new feature extractor which is extended from PointHop. For the former, sampled points of each room form an input unit. For the latter, the weaknesses of PointHop's feature extraction when extending it to large-scale point clouds are identified and fixed with a simpler processing pipeline. As compared with PointNet, which is a pioneering deep-learning-based solution, GSIP is green since it has significantly lower computational complexity and a much smaller model size. Furthermore, experiments show that GSIP outperforms PointNet in segmentation performance for the S3DIS dataset."
Fast Point Voxel Convolution Neural Network with Selective Feature Fusion for Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation,"We present a novel lightweight convolutional neural network for point cloud analysis. In contrast to many current CNNs which increase receptive field by downsampling point cloud, our method directly operates on the entire point sets without sampling and achieves good performances efficiently. Our network consists of point voxel convolution (PVC) layer as building block. Each layer has two parallel branches, namely the voxel branch and the point branch. For the voxel branch specifically, we aggregate local features on non-empty voxel centers to reduce geometric information loss caused by voxelization, then apply volumetric convolutions to enhance local neighborhood geometry encoding. For the point branch, we use Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to extract fine-detailed point-wise features. Outputs from these two branches are adaptively fused via a feature selection module. Moreover, we supervise the output from every PVC layer to learn different levels of semantic information. The final prediction is made by averaging all intermediate predictions. We demonstrate empirically that our method is able to achieve comparable results while being fast and memory efficient. We evaluate our method on popular point cloud datasets for object classification and semantic segmentation tasks."
SPNet: Multi-Shell Kernel Convolution for Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation,"Feature encoding is essential for point cloud analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel point convolution operator named Shell Point Convolution (SPConv) for shape encoding and local context learning. Specifically, SPConv splits 3D neighborhood space into shells, aggregates local features on manually designed kernel points, and performs convolution on the shells. Moreover, SPConv incorporates a simple yet effective attention module that enhances local feature aggregation. Based upon SPConv, a deep neural network named SPNet is constructed to process large-scale point clouds. Poisson disk sampling and feature propagation are incorporated in SPNet for better efficiency and accuracy. We provided details of the shell design and conducted extensive experiments on challenging large-scale point cloud datasets. Experimental results show that SPConv is effective in local shape encoding, and our SPNet is able to achieve top-ranking performances in semantic segmentation tasks."
Semantic Segmentation-assisted Scene Completion for LiDAR Point Clouds,"Outdoor scene completion is a challenging issue in 3D scene understanding, which plays an important role in intelligent robotics and autonomous driving. Due to the sparsity of LiDAR acquisition, it is far more complex for 3D scene completion and semantic segmentation. Since semantic features can provide constraints and semantic priors for completion tasks, the relationship between them is worth exploring. Therefore, we propose an end-to-end semantic segmentation-assisted scene completion network, including a 2D completion branch and a 3D semantic segmentation branch. Specifically, the network takes a raw point cloud as input, and merges the features from the segmentation branch into the completion branch hierarchically to provide semantic information. By adopting BEV representation and 3D sparse convolution, we can benefit from the lower operand while maintaining effective expression. Besides, the decoder of the segmentation branch is used as an auxiliary, which can be discarded in the inference stage to save computational consumption. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance on SemanticKITTI dataset with low latency. Code and models will be released at https://github.com/jokester-zzz/SSA-SC."
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation with Semantic Consistency across Heterogeneous Modalities for MRI Prostate Lesion Segmentation,"Any novel medical imaging modality that differs from previous protocols e.g. in the number of imaging channels, introduces a new domain that is heterogeneous from previous ones. This common medical imaging scenario is rarely considered in the domain adaptation literature, which handles shifts across domains of the same dimensionality. In our work we rely on stochastic generative modeling to translate across two heterogeneous domains at pixel space and introduce two new loss functions that promote semantic consistency. Firstly, we introduce a semantic cycle-consistency loss in the source domain to ensure that the translation preserves the semantics. Secondly, we introduce a pseudo-labelling loss, where we translate target data to source, label them by a source-domain network, and use the generated pseudo-labels to supervise the target-domain network. Our results show that this allows us to extract systematically better representations for the target domain. In particular, we address the challenge of enhancing performance on VERDICT-MRI, an advanced diffusion-weighted imaging technique, by exploiting labeled mp-MRI data. When compared to several unsupervised domain adaptation approaches, our approach yields substantial improvements, that consistently carry over to the semi-supervised and supervised learning settings."
Beyond Semantic to Instance Segmentation: Weakly-Supervised Instance Segmentation via Semantic Knowledge Transfer and Self-Refinement,"Weakly-supervised instance segmentation (WSIS) has been considered as a more challenging task than weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS). Compared to WSSS, WSIS requires instance-wise localization, which is difficult to extract from image-level labels. To tackle the problem, most WSIS approaches use off-the-shelf proposal techniques that require pre-training with instance or object level labels, deviating the fundamental definition of the fully-image-level supervised setting. In this paper, we propose a novel approach including two innovative components. First, we propose a semantic knowledge transfer to obtain pseudo instance labels by transferring the knowledge of WSSS to WSIS while eliminating the need for the off-the-shelf proposals. Second, we propose a self-refinement method to refine the pseudo instance labels in a self-supervised scheme and to use the refined labels for training in an online manner. Here, we discover an erroneous phenomenon, semantic drift, that occurred by the missing instances in pseudo instance labels categorized as background class. This semantic drift occurs confusion between background and instance in training and consequently degrades the segmentation performance. We term this problem as semantic drift problem and show that our proposed self-refinement method eliminates the semantic drift problem. The extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, and we achieve a considerable performance without off-the-shelf proposal techniques. The code is available at https://github.com/clovaai/BESTIE."
RSI-Net: Two-Stream Deep Neural Network for Remote Sensing Imagesbased Semantic Segmentation,"For semantic segmentation of remote sensing images (RSI), trade-off between representation power and location accuracy is quite important. How to get the trade-off effectively is an open question,where current approaches of utilizing very deep models result in complex models with large memory consumption. In contrast to previous work that utilizes dilated convolutions or deep models, we propose a novel two-stream deep neural network for semantic segmentation of RSI (RSI-Net) to obtain improved performance through modeling and propagating spatial contextual structure effectively and a decoding scheme with image-level and graph-level combination. The first component explicitly models correlations between adjacent land covers and conduct flexible convolution on arbitrarily irregular image regions by using graph convolutional network, while densely connected atrous convolution network (DenseAtrousCNet) with multi-scale atrous convolution can expand the receptive fields and obtain image global information. Extensive experiments are implemented on the Vaihingen, Potsdam and Gaofen RSI datasets, where the comparison results demonstrate the superior performance of RSI-Net in terms of overall accuracy (91.83%, 93.31% and 93.67% on three datasets, respectively), F1 score (90.3%, 91.49% and 89.35% on three datasets, respectively) and kappa coefficient (89.46%, 90.46% and 90.37% on three datasets, respectively) when compared with six state-of-the-art RSI semantic segmentation methods."
UNetFormer: A UNet-like Transformer for Efficient Semantic Segmentation of Remote Sensing Urban Scene Imagery,"Semantic segmentation of remotely sensed urban scene images is required in a wide range of practical applications, such as land cover mapping, urban change detection, environmental protection, and economic assessment.Driven by rapid developments in deep learning technologies, the convolutional neural network (CNN) has dominated semantic segmentation for many years. CNN adopts hierarchical feature representation, demonstrating strong capabilities for local information extraction. However, the local property of the convolution layer limits the network from capturing the global context. Recently, as a hot topic in the domain of computer vision, Transformer has demonstrated its great potential in global information modelling, boosting many vision-related tasks such as image classification, object detection, and particularly semantic segmentation. In this paper, we propose a Transformer-based decoder and construct a UNet-like Transformer (UNetFormer) for real-time urban scene segmentation. For efficient segmentation, the UNetFormer selects the lightweight ResNet18 as the encoder and develops an efficient global-local attention mechanism to model both global and local information in the decoder. Extensive experiments reveal that our method not only runs faster but also produces higher accuracy compared with state-of-the-art lightweight models. Specifically, the proposed UNetFormer achieved 67.8% and 52.4% mIoU on the UAVid and LoveDA datasets, respectively, while the inference speed can achieve up to 322.4 FPS with a 512x512 input on a single NVIDIA GTX 3090 GPU. In further exploration, the proposed Transformer-based decoder combined with a Swin Transformer encoder also achieves the state-of-the-art result (91.3% F1 and 84.1% mIoU) on the Vaihingen dataset. The source code will be freely available at https://github.com/WangLibo1995/GeoSeg."
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation via Low-level Edge Information Transfer,"Unsupervised domain adaptation for semantic segmentation aims to make models trained on synthetic data (source domain) adapt to real images (target domain). Previous feature-level adversarial learning methods only consider adapting models on the high-level semantic features. However, the large domain gap between source and target domains in the high-level semantic features makes accurate adaptation difficult. In this paper, we present the first attempt at explicitly using low-level edge information, which has a small inter-domain gap, to guide the transfer of semantic information. To this end, a semantic-edge domain adaptation architecture is proposed, which uses an independent edge stream to process edge information, thereby generating high-quality semantic boundaries over the target domain. Then, an edge consistency loss is presented to align target semantic predictions with produced semantic boundaries. Moreover, we further propose two entropy reweighting methods for semantic adversarial learning and self-supervised learning, respectively, which can further enhance the adaptation performance of our architecture. Comprehensive experiments on two UDA benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our architecture compared with state-of-the-art methods."
Automated risk classification of colon biopsies based on semantic segmentation of histopathology images,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) can potentially support histopathologists in the diagnosis of a broad spectrum of cancer types. In colorectal cancer (CRC), AI can alleviate the laborious task of characterization and reporting on resected biopsies, including polyps, the numbers of which are increasing as a result of CRC population screening programs, ongoing in many countries all around the globe. Here, we present an approach to address two major challenges in automated assessment of CRC histopathology whole-slide images. First, we present an AI-based method to segment multiple tissue compartments in the H\&E-stained whole-slide image, which provides a different, more perceptible picture of tissue morphology and composition. We test and compare a panel of state-of-the-art loss functions available for segmentation models, and provide indications about their use in histopathology image segmentation, based on the analysis of a) a multi-centric cohort of CRC cases from five medical centers in the Netherlands and Germany, and b) two publicly available datasets on segmentation in CRC. Second, we use the best performing AI model as the basis for a computer-aided diagnosis system (CAD) that classifies colon biopsies into four main categories that are relevant pathologically. We report the performance of this system on an independent cohort of more than 1,000 patients. The results show the potential of such an AI-based system to assist pathologists in diagnosis of CRC in the context of population screening. We have made the segmentation model available for research use on https://grand-challenge.org/algorithms/colon-tissue-segmentation/."
Context-aware Padding for Semantic Segmentation,"Zero padding is widely used in convolutional neural networks to prevent the size of feature maps diminishing too fast. However, it has been claimed to disturb the statistics at the border. As an alternative, we propose a context-aware (CA) padding approach to extend the image. We reformulate the padding problem as an image extrapolation problem and illustrate the effects on the semantic segmentation task. Using context-aware padding, the ResNet-based segmentation model achieves higher mean Intersection-Over-Union than the traditional zero padding on the Cityscapes and the dataset of DeepGlobe satellite imaging challenge. Furthermore, our padding does not bring noticeable overhead during training and testing."
Evaluating the Impact of Semantic Segmentation and Pose Estimation on Dense Semantic SLAM,"Recent Semantic SLAM methods combine classical geometry-based estimation with deep learning-based object detection or semantic segmentation. In this paper we evaluate the quality of semantic maps generated by state-of-the-art class- and instance-aware dense semantic SLAM algorithms whose codes are publicly available and explore the impacts both semantic segmentation and pose estimation have on the quality of semantic maps. We obtain these results by providing algorithms with ground-truth pose and/or semantic segmentation data available from simulated environments. We establish that semantic segmentation is the largest source of error through our experiments, dropping mAP and OMQ performance by up to 74.3% and 71.3% respectively."
Border-SegGCN: Improving Semantic Segmentation by Refining the Border Outline using Graph Convolutional Network,"We present Border-SegGCN, a novel architecture to improve semantic segmentation by refining the border outline using graph convolutional networks (GCN). The semantic segmentation network such as Unet or DeepLabV3+ is used as a base network to have pre-segmented output. This output is converted into a graphical structure and fed into the GCN to improve the border pixel prediction of the pre-segmented output. We explored and studied the factors such as border thickness, number of edges for a node, and the number of features to be fed into the GCN by performing experiments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the Border-SegGCN on the CamVid and Carla dataset, achieving a test set performance of 81.96% without any post-processing on CamVid dataset. It is higher than the reported state of the art mIoU achieved on CamVid dataset by 0.404%"
DeepPyram: Enabling Pyramid View and Deformable Pyramid Reception for Semantic Segmentation in Cataract Surgery Videos,"Semantic segmentation in cataract surgery has a wide range of applications contributing to surgical outcome enhancement and clinical risk reduction. However, the varying issues in segmenting the different relevant instances make the designation of a unique network quite challenging. This paper proposes a semantic segmentation network termed as DeepPyram that can achieve superior performance in segmenting relevant objects in cataract surgery videos with varying issues. This superiority mainly originates from three modules: (i) Pyramid View Fusion, which provides a varying-angle global view of the surrounding region centering at each pixel position in the input convolutional feature map; (ii) Deformable Pyramid Reception, which enables a wide deformable receptive field that can adapt to geometric transformations in the object of interest; and (iii) Pyramid Loss that adaptively supervises multi-scale semantic feature maps. These modules can effectively boost semantic segmentation performance, especially in the case of transparency, deformability, scalability, and blunt edges in objects. The proposed approach is evaluated using four datasets of cataract surgery for objects with different contextual features and compared with thirteen state-of-the-art segmentation networks. The experimental results confirm that DeepPyram outperforms the rival approaches without imposing additional trainable parameters. Our comprehensive ablation study further proves the effectiveness of the proposed modules."
TACS: Taxonomy Adaptive Cross-Domain Semantic Segmentation,"Traditional domain adaptive semantic segmentation addresses the task of adapting a model to a novel target domain under limited or no additional supervision. While tackling the input domain gap, the standard domain adaptation settings assume no domain change in the output space. In semantic prediction tasks, different datasets are often labeled according to different semantic taxonomies. In many real-world settings, the target domain task requires a different taxonomy than the one imposed by the source domain. We therefore introduce the more general taxonomy adaptive cross-domain semantic segmentation (TACS) problem, allowing for inconsistent taxonomies between the two domains. We further propose an approach that jointly addresses the image-level and label-level domain adaptation. On the label-level, we employ a bilateral mixed sampling strategy to augment the target domain, and a relabelling method to unify and align the label spaces. We address the image-level domain gap by proposing an uncertainty-rectified contrastive learning method, leading to more domain-invariant and class-discriminative features. We extensively evaluate the effectiveness of our framework under different TACS settings: open taxonomy, coarse-to-fine taxonomy, and implicitly-overlapping taxonomy. Our approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin, while being capable of adapting to target taxonomies. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/ETHRuiGong/TADA."
FIDNet: LiDAR Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation with Fully Interpolation Decoding,"Projecting the point cloud on the 2D spherical range image transforms the LiDAR semantic segmentation to a 2D segmentation task on the range image. However, the LiDAR range image is still naturally different from the regular 2D RGB image; for example, each position on the range image encodes the unique geometry information. In this paper, we propose a new projection-based LiDAR semantic segmentation pipeline that consists of a novel network structure and an efficient post-processing step. In our network structure, we design a FID (fully interpolation decoding) module that directly upsamples the multi-resolution feature maps using bilinear interpolation. Inspired by the 3D distance interpolation used in PointNet++, we argue this FID module is a 2D version distance interpolation on (θ, φ) space. As a parameter-free decoding module, the FID largely reduces the model complexity by maintaining good performance. Besides the network structure, we empirically find that our model predictions have clear boundaries between different semantic classes. This makes us rethink whether the widely used K-nearest-neighbor post-processing is still necessary for our pipeline. Then, we realize the many-to-one mapping causes the blurring effect that some points are mapped into the same pixel and share the same label. Therefore, we propose to process those occluded points by assigning the nearest predicted label to them. This NLA (nearest label assignment) post-processing step shows a better performance than KNN with faster inference speed in the ablation study. On the SemanticKITTI dataset, our pipeline achieves the best performance among all projection-based methods with 64 \times 2048 resolution and all point-wise solutions. With a ResNet-34 as the backbone, both the training and testing of our model can be finished on a single RTX 2080 Ti with 11G memory. The code is released."
Graph Attention Layer Evolves Semantic Segmentation for Road Pothole Detection: A Benchmark and Algorithms,"Existing road pothole detection approaches can be classified as computer vision-based or machine learning-based. The former approaches typically employ 2-D image analysis/understanding or 3-D point cloud modeling and segmentation algorithms to detect road potholes from vision sensor data. The latter approaches generally address road pothole detection using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in an end-to-end manner. However, road potholes are not necessarily ubiquitous and it is challenging to prepare a large well-annotated dataset for CNN training. In this regard, while computer vision-based methods were the mainstream research trend in the past decade, machine learning-based methods were merely discussed. Recently, we published the first stereo vision-based road pothole detection dataset and a novel disparity transformation algorithm, whereby the damaged and undamaged road areas can be highly distinguished. However, there are no benchmarks currently available for state-of-the-art (SoTA) CNNs trained using either disparity images or transformed disparity images. Therefore, in this paper, we first discuss the SoTA CNNs designed for semantic segmentation and evaluate their performance for road pothole detection with extensive experiments. Additionally, inspired by graph neural network (GNN), we propose a novel CNN layer, referred to as graph attention layer (GAL), which can be easily deployed in any existing CNN to optimize image feature representations for semantic segmentation. Our experiments compare GAL-DeepLabv3+, our best-performing implementation, with nine SoTA CNNs on three modalities of training data: RGB images, disparity images, and transformed disparity images. The experimental results suggest that our proposed GAL-DeepLabv3+ achieves the best overall pothole detection accuracy on all training data modalities."
Sparse Spatial Attention Network for Semantic Segmentation,"The spatial attention mechanism captures long-range dependencies by aggregating global contextual information to each query location, which is beneficial for semantic segmentation. In this paper, we present a sparse spatial attention network (SSANet) to improve the efficiency of the spatial attention mechanism without sacrificing the performance. Specifically, a sparse non-local (SNL) block is proposed to sample a subset of key and value elements for each query element to capture long-range relations adaptively and generate a sparse affinity matrix to aggregate contextual information efficiently. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms other context aggregation methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Cityscapes, PASCAL Context and ADE20K datasets."
Weakly supervised semantic segmentation of tomographic images in the diagnosis of stroke,"This paper presents an automatic algorithm for the segmentation of areas affected by an acute stroke on the non-contrast computed tomography brain images. The proposed algorithm is designed for learning in a weakly supervised scenario when some images are labeled accurately, and some images are labeled inaccurately. Wrong labels appear as a result of inaccuracy made by a radiologist in the process of manual annotation of computed tomography images. We propose methods for solving the segmentation problem in the case of inaccurately labeled training data. We use the U-Net neural network architecture with several modifications. Experiments on real computed tomography scans show that the proposed methods increase the segmentation accuracy."
Access Control Using Spatially Invariant Permutation of Feature Maps for Semantic Segmentation Models,"In this paper, we propose an access control method that uses the spatially invariant permutation of feature maps with a secret key for protecting semantic segmentation models. Segmentation models are trained and tested by permuting selected feature maps with a secret key. The proposed method allows rightful users with the correct key not only to access a model to full capacity but also to degrade the performance for unauthorized users. Conventional access control methods have focused only on image classification tasks, and these methods have never been applied to semantic segmentation tasks. In an experiment, the protected models were demonstrated to allow rightful users to obtain almost the same performance as that of non-protected models but also to be robust against access by unauthorized users without a key. In addition, a conventional method with block-wise transformations was also verified to have degraded performance under semantic segmentation models."
Semantic Segmentation on VSPW Dataset through Aggregation of Transformer Models,"Semantic segmentation is an important task in computer vision, from which some important usage scenarios are derived, such as autonomous driving, scene parsing, etc. Due to the emphasis on the task of video semantic segmentation, we participated in this competition. In this report, we briefly introduce the solutions of team 'BetterThing' for the ICCV2021 - Video Scene Parsing in the Wild Challenge. Transformer is used as the backbone for extracting video frame features, and the final result is the aggregation of the output of two Transformer models, SWIN and VOLO. This solution achieves 57.3% mIoU, which is ranked 3rd place in the Video Scene Parsing in the Wild Challenge."
FBSNet: A Fast Bilateral Symmetrical Network for Real-Time Semantic Segmentation,"Real-time semantic segmentation, which can be visually understood as the pixel-level classification task on the input image, currently has broad application prospects, especially in the fast-developing fields of autonomous driving and drone navigation. However, the huge burden of calculation together with redundant parameters are still the obstacles to its technological development. In this paper, we propose a Fast Bilateral Symmetrical Network (FBSNet) to alleviate the above challenges. Specifically, FBSNet employs a symmetrical encoder-decoder structure with two branches, semantic information branch and spatial detail branch. The Semantic Information Branch (SIB) is the main branch with semantic architecture to acquire the contextual information of the input image and meanwhile acquire sufficient receptive field. While the Spatial Detail Branch (SDB) is a shallow and simple network used to establish local dependencies of each pixel for preserving details, which is essential for restoring the original resolution during the decoding phase. Meanwhile, a Feature Aggregation Module (FAM) is designed to effectively combine the output of these two branches. Experimental results of Cityscapes and CamVid show that the proposed FBSNet can strike a good balance between accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, it obtains 70.9\% and 68.9\% mIoU along with the inference speed of 90 fps and 120 fps on these two test datasets, respectively, with only 0.62 million parameters on a single RTX 2080Ti GPU. The code is available at https://github.com/IVIPLab/FBSNet."
Contrastive Multiview Coding with Electro-optics for SAR Semantic Segmentation,"In the training of deep learning models, how the model parameters are initialized greatly affects the model performance, sample efficiency, and convergence speed. Representation learning for model initialization has recently been actively studied in the remote sensing field. In particular, the appearance characteristics of the imagery obtained using the a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensor are quite different from those of general electro-optical (EO) images, and thus representation learning is even more important in remote sensing domain. Motivated from contrastive multiview coding, we propose multi-modal representation learning for SAR semantic segmentation. Unlike previous studies, our method jointly uses EO imagery, SAR imagery, and a label mask. Several experiments show that our approach is superior to the existing methods in model performance, sample efficiency, and convergence speed."
Seminar Learning for Click-Level Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Annotation burden has become one of the biggest barriers to semantic segmentation. Approaches based on click-level annotations have therefore attracted increasing attention due to their superior trade-off between supervision and annotation cost. In this paper, we propose seminar learning, a new learning paradigm for semantic segmentation with click-level supervision. The fundamental rationale of seminar learning is to leverage the knowledge from different networks to compensate for insufficient information provided in click-level annotations. Mimicking a seminar, our seminar learning involves a teacher-student and a student-student module, where a student can learn from both skillful teachers and other students. The teacher-student module uses a teacher network based on the exponential moving average to guide the training of the student network. In the student-student module, heterogeneous pseudo-labels are proposed to bridge the transfer of knowledge among students to enhance each other's performance. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of seminar learning, which achieves the new state-of-the-art performance of 72.51% (mIOU), surpassing previous methods by a large margin of up to 16.88% on the Pascal VOC 2012 dataset."
Robust Interactive Semantic Segmentation of Pathology Images with Minimal User Input,"From the simple measurement of tissue attributes in pathology workflow to designing an explainable diagnostic/prognostic AI tool, access to accurate semantic segmentation of tissue regions in histology images is a prerequisite. However, delineating different tissue regions manually is a laborious, time-consuming and costly task that requires expert knowledge. On the other hand, the state-of-the-art automatic deep learning models for semantic segmentation require lots of annotated training data and there are only a limited number of tissue region annotated images publicly available. To obviate this issue in computational pathology projects and collect large-scale region annotations efficiently, we propose an efficient interactive segmentation network that requires minimum input from the user to accurately annotate different tissue types in the histology image. The user is only required to draw a simple squiggle inside each region of interest so it will be used as the guiding signal for the model. To deal with the complex appearance and amorph geometry of different tissue regions we introduce several automatic and minimalistic guiding signal generation techniques that help the model to become robust against the variation in the user input. By experimenting on a dataset of breast cancer images, we show that not only does our proposed method speed up the interactive annotation process, it can also outperform the existing automatic and interactive region segmentation models."
Pseudo-mask Matters in Weakly-supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Most weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) methods follow the pipeline that generates pseudo-masks initially and trains the segmentation model with the pseudo-masks in fully supervised manner after. However, we find some matters related to the pseudo-masks, including high quality pseudo-masks generation from class activation maps (CAMs), and training with noisy pseudo-mask supervision. For these matters, we propose the following designs to push the performance to new state-of-art: (i) Coefficient of Variation Smoothing to smooth the CAMs adaptively; (ii) Proportional Pseudo-mask Generation to project the expanded CAMs to pseudo-mask based on a new metric indicating the importance of each class on each location, instead of the scores trained from binary classifiers. (iii) Pretended Under-Fitting strategy to suppress the influence of noise in pseudo-mask; (iv) Cyclic Pseudo-mask to boost the pseudo-masks during training of fully supervised semantic segmentation (FSSS). Experiments based on our methods achieve new state-of-art results on two changeling weakly supervised semantic segmentation datasets, pushing the mIoU to 70.0% and 40.2% on PAS-CAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 respectively. Codes including segmentation framework are released at https://github.com/Eli-YiLi/PMM"
Improving Semi-Supervised and Domain-Adaptive Semantic Segmentation with Self-Supervised Depth Estimation,"Training deep networks for semantic segmentation requires large amounts of labeled training data, which presents a major challenge in practice, as labeling segmentation masks is a highly labor-intensive process. To address this issue, we present a framework for semi-supervised and domain-adaptive semantic segmentation, which is enhanced by self-supervised monocular depth estimation (SDE) trained only on unlabeled image sequences.  In particular, we utilize SDE as an auxiliary task comprehensively across the entire learning framework: First, we automatically select the most useful samples to be annotated for semantic segmentation based on the correlation of sample diversity and difficulty between SDE and semantic segmentation. Second, we implement a strong data augmentation by mixing images and labels using the geometry of the scene. Third, we transfer knowledge from features learned during SDE to semantic segmentation by means of transfer and multi-task learning. And fourth, we exploit additional labeled synthetic data with Cross-Domain DepthMix and Matching Geometry Sampling to align synthetic and real data.  We validate the proposed model on the Cityscapes dataset, where all four contributions demonstrate significant performance gains, and achieve state-of-the-art results for semi-supervised semantic segmentation as well as for semi-supervised domain adaptation. In particular, with only 1/30 of the Cityscapes labels, our method achieves 92% of the fully-supervised baseline performance and even 97% when exploiting additional data from GTA. The source code is available at https://github.com/lhoyer/improving_segmentation_with_selfsupervised_depth."
SIGN: Spatial-information Incorporated Generative Network for Generalized Zero-shot Semantic Segmentation,"Unlike conventional zero-shot classification, zero-shot semantic segmentation predicts a class label at the pixel level instead of the image level. When solving zero-shot semantic segmentation problems, the need for pixel-level prediction with surrounding context motivates us to incorporate spatial information using positional encoding. We improve standard positional encoding by introducing the concept of Relative Positional Encoding, which integrates spatial information at the feature level and can handle arbitrary image sizes. Furthermore, while self-training is widely used in zero-shot semantic segmentation to generate pseudo-labels, we propose a new knowledge-distillation-inspired self-training strategy, namely Annealed Self-Training, which can automatically assign different importance to pseudo-labels to improve performance. We systematically study the proposed Relative Positional Encoding and Annealed Self-Training in a comprehensive experimental evaluation, and our empirical results confirm the effectiveness of our method on three benchmark datasets."
ISNet: Integrate Image-Level and Semantic-Level Context for Semantic Segmentation,"Co-occurrent visual pattern makes aggregating contextual information a common paradigm to enhance the pixel representation for semantic image segmentation. The existing approaches focus on modeling the context from the perspective of the whole image, i.e., aggregating the image-level contextual information. Despite impressive, these methods weaken the significance of the pixel representations of the same category, i.e., the semantic-level contextual information. To address this, this paper proposes to augment the pixel representations by aggregating the image-level and semantic-level contextual information, respectively. First, an image-level context module is designed to capture the contextual information for each pixel in the whole image. Second, we aggregate the representations of the same category for each pixel where the category regions are learned under the supervision of the ground-truth segmentation. Third, we compute the similarities between each pixel representation and the image-level contextual information, the semantic-level contextual information, respectively. At last, a pixel representation is augmented by weighted aggregating both the image-level contextual information and the semantic-level contextual information with the similarities as the weights. Integrating the image-level and semantic-level context allows this paper to report state-of-the-art accuracy on four benchmarks, i.e., ADE20K, LIP, COCOStuff and Cityscapes."
Evaluating Transformer-based Semantic Segmentation Networks for Pathological Image Segmentation,"Histopathology has played an essential role in cancer diagnosis. With the rapid advances in convolutional neural networks (CNN). Various CNN-based automated pathological image segmentation approaches have been developed in computer-assisted pathological image analysis. In the past few years, Transformer neural networks (Transformer) have shown the unique merit of capturing the global long-distance dependencies across the entire image as a new deep learning paradigm. Such merit is appealing for exploring spatially heterogeneous pathological images. However, there have been very few, if any, studies that have systematically evaluated the current Transformer-based approaches in pathological image segmentation. To assess the performance of Transformer segmentation models on whole slide images (WSI), we quantitatively evaluated six prevalent transformer-based models on tumor segmentation, using the widely used PAIP liver histopathological dataset. For a more comprehensive analysis, we also compare the transformer-based models with six major traditional CNN-based models. The results show that the Transformer-based models exhibit a general superior performance over the CNN-based models. In particular, Segmenter, Swin-Transformer and TransUNet-all transformer-based-came out as the best performers among the twelve evaluated models."
Mining Contextual Information Beyond Image for Semantic Segmentation,"This paper studies the context aggregation problem in semantic image segmentation. The existing researches focus on improving the pixel representations by aggregating the contextual information within individual images. Though impressive, these methods neglect the significance of the representations of the pixels of the corresponding class beyond the input image. To address this, this paper proposes to mine the contextual information beyond individual images to further augment the pixel representations. We first set up a feature memory module, which is updated dynamically during training, to store the dataset-level representations of various categories. Then, we learn class probability distribution of each pixel representation under the supervision of the ground-truth segmentation. At last, the representation of each pixel is augmented by aggregating the dataset-level representations based on the corresponding class probability distribution. Furthermore, by utilizing the stored dataset-level representations, we also propose a representation consistent learning strategy to make the classification head better address intra-class compactness and inter-class dispersion. The proposed method could be effortlessly incorporated into existing segmentation frameworks (e.g., FCN, PSPNet, OCRNet and DeepLabV3) and brings consistent performance improvements. Mining contextual information beyond image allows us to report state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks: ADE20K, LIP, Cityscapes and COCO-Stuff."
An Underwater Image Semantic Segmentation Method Focusing on Boundaries and a Real Underwater Scene Semantic Segmentation Dataset,"With the development of underwater object grabbing technology, underwater object recognition and segmentation of high accuracy has become a challenge. The existing underwater object detection technology can only give the general position of an object, unable to give more detailed information such as the outline of the object, which seriously affects the grabbing efficiency. To address this problem, we label and establish the first underwater semantic segmentation dataset of real scene(DUT-USEG:DUT Underwater Segmentation Dataset). The DUT- USEG dataset includes 6617 images, 1487 of which have semantic segmentation and instance segmentation annotations, and the remaining 5130 images have object detection box annotations. Based on this dataset, we propose a semi-supervised underwater semantic segmentation network focusing on the boundaries(US-Net: Underwater Segmentation Network). By designing a pseudo label generator and a boundary detection subnetwork, this network realizes the fine learning of boundaries between underwater objects and background, and improves the segmentation effect of boundary areas. Experiments show that the proposed method improves by 6.7% in three categories of holothurian, echinus, starfish in DUT-USEG dataset, and achieves state-of-the-art results. The DUT- USEG dataset will be released at https://github.com/baxiyi/DUT-USEG."
Improving the Reliability of Semantic Segmentation of Medical Images by Uncertainty Modeling with Bayesian Deep Networks and Curriculum Learning,In this paper we propose a novel method which leverages the uncertainty measures provided by Bayesian deep networks through curriculum learning so that the uncertainty estimates are fed back to the system to resample the training data more densely in areas where uncertainty is high. We show in the concrete setting of a semantic segmentation task (iPS cell colony segmentation) that the proposed system is able to increase significantly the reliability of the model.
ChessMix: Spatial Context Data Augmentation for Remote Sensing Semantic Segmentation,"Labeling semantic segmentation datasets is a costly and laborious process if compared with tasks like image classification and object detection. This is especially true for remote sensing applications that not only work with extremely high spatial resolution data but also commonly require the knowledge of experts of the area to perform the manual labeling. Data augmentation techniques help to improve deep learning models under the circumstance of few and imbalanced labeled samples. In this work, we propose a novel data augmentation method focused on exploring the spatial context of remote sensing semantic segmentation. This method, ChessMix, creates new synthetic images from the existing training set by mixing transformed mini-patches across the dataset in a chessboard-like grid. ChessMix prioritizes patches with more examples of the rarest classes to alleviate the imbalance problems. The results in three diverse well-known remote sensing datasets show that this is a promising approach that helps to improve the networks' performance, working especially well in datasets with few available data. The results also show that ChessMix is capable of improving the segmentation of objects with few labeled pixels when compared to the most common data augmentation methods widely used."
Generalize then Adapt: Source-Free Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation,"Unsupervised domain adaptation (DA) has gained substantial interest in semantic segmentation. However, almost all prior arts assume concurrent access to both labeled source and unlabeled target, making them unsuitable for scenarios demanding source-free adaptation. In this work, we enable source-free DA by partitioning the task into two: a) source-only domain generalization and b) source-free target adaptation. Towards the former, we provide theoretical insights to develop a multi-head framework trained with a virtually extended multi-source dataset, aiming to balance generalization and specificity. Towards the latter, we utilize the multi-head framework to extract reliable target pseudo-labels for self-training. Additionally, we introduce a novel conditional prior-enforcing auto-encoder that discourages spatial irregularities, thereby enhancing the pseudo-label quality. Experiments on the standard GTA5-to-Cityscapes and SYNTHIA-to-Cityscapes benchmarks show our superiority even against the non-source-free prior-arts. Further, we show our compatibility with online adaptation enabling deployment in a sequentially changing environment."
Multi-domain semantic segmentation with overlapping labels,"Deep supervised models have an unprecedented capacity to absorb large quantities of training data. Hence, training on many datasets becomes a method of choice towards graceful degradation in unusual scenes. Unfortunately, different datasets often use incompatible labels. For instance, the Cityscapes road class subsumes all driving surfaces, while Vistas defines separate classes for road markings, manholes etc. We address this challenge by proposing a principled method for seamless learning on datasets with overlapping classes based on partial labels and probabilistic loss. Our method achieves competitive within-dataset and cross-dataset generalization, as well as ability to learn visual concepts which are not separately labeled in any of the training datasets. Experiments reveal competitive or state-of-the-art performance on two multi-domain dataset collections and on the WildDash 2 benchmark."
Semantic Scene Segmentation for Robotics Applications,"Semantic scene segmentation plays a critical role in a wide range of robotics applications, e.g., autonomous navigation. These applications are accompanied by specific computational restrictions, e.g., operation on low-power GPUs, at sufficient speed, and also for high-resolution input. Existing state-of-the-art segmentation models provide evaluation results under different setups and mainly considering high-power GPUs. In this paper, we investigate the behavior of the most successful semantic scene segmentation models, in terms of deployment (inference) speed, under various setups (GPUs, input sizes, etc.) in the context of robotics applications. The target of this work is to provide a comparative study of current state-of-the-art segmentation models so as to select the most compliant with the robotics applications requirements."
ShapeConv: Shape-aware Convolutional Layer for Indoor RGB-D Semantic Segmentation,"RGB-D semantic segmentation has attracted increasing attention over the past few years. Existing methods mostly employ homogeneous convolution operators to consume the RGB and depth features, ignoring their intrinsic differences. In fact, the RGB values capture the photometric appearance properties in the projected image space, while the depth feature encodes both the shape of a local geometry as well as the base (whereabout) of it in a larger context. Compared with the base, the shape probably is more inherent and has a stronger connection to the semantics, and thus is more critical for segmentation accuracy. Inspired by this observation, we introduce a Shape-aware Convolutional layer (ShapeConv) for processing the depth feature, where the depth feature is firstly decomposed into a shape-component and a base-component, next two learnable weights are introduced to cooperate with them independently, and finally a convolution is applied on the re-weighted combination of these two components. ShapeConv is model-agnostic and can be easily integrated into most CNNs to replace vanilla convolutional layers for semantic segmentation. Extensive experiments on three challenging indoor RGB-D semantic segmentation benchmarks, i.e., NYU-Dv2(-13,-40), SUN RGB-D, and SID, demonstrate the effectiveness of our ShapeConv when employing it over five popular architectures. Moreover, the performance of CNNs with ShapeConv is boosted without introducing any computation and memory increase in the inference phase. The reason is that the learnt weights for balancing the importance between the shape and base components in ShapeConv become constants in the inference phase, and thus can be fused into the following convolution, resulting in a network that is identical to one with vanilla convolutional layers."
SegMix: Co-occurrence Driven Mixup for Semantic Segmentation and Adversarial Robustness,"In this paper, we present a strategy for training convolutional neural networks to effectively resolve interference arising from competing hypotheses relating to inter-categorical information throughout the network. The premise is based on the notion of feature binding, which is defined as the process by which activations spread across space and layers in the network are successfully integrated to arrive at a correct inference decision. In our work, this is accomplished for the task of dense image labelling by blending images based on (i) categorical clustering or (ii) the co-occurrence likelihood of categories. We then train a feature binding network which simultaneously segments and separates the blended images. Subsequent feature denoising to suppress noisy activations reveals additional desirable properties and high degrees of successful predictions. Through this process, we reveal a general mechanism, distinct from any prior methods, for boosting the performance of the base segmentation and saliency network while simultaneously increasing robustness to adversarial attacks."
Self-Regulation for Semantic Segmentation,"In this paper, we seek reasons for the two major failure cases in Semantic Segmentation (SS): 1) missing small objects or minor object parts, and 2) mislabeling minor parts of large objects as wrong classes. We have an interesting finding that Failure-1 is due to the underuse of detailed features and Failure-2 is due to the underuse of visual contexts. To help the model learn a better trade-off, we introduce several Self-Regulation (SR) losses for training SS neural networks. By ""self"", we mean that the losses are from the model per se without using any additional data or supervision. By applying the SR losses, the deep layer features are regulated by the shallow ones to preserve more details; meanwhile, shallow layer classification logits are regulated by the deep ones to capture more semantics. We conduct extensive experiments on both weakly and fully supervised SS tasks, and the results show that our approach consistently surpasses the baselines. We also validate that SR losses are easy to implement in various state-of-the-art SS models, e.g., SPGNet and OCRNet, incurring little computational overhead during training and none for testing."
Trans4Trans: Efficient Transformer for Transparent Object and Semantic Scene Segmentation in Real-World Navigation Assistance,"Transparent objects, such as glass walls and doors, constitute architectural obstacles hindering the mobility of people with low vision or blindness. For instance, the open space behind glass doors is inaccessible, unless it is correctly perceived and interacted with. However, traditional assistive technologies rarely cover the segmentation of these safety-critical transparent objects. In this paper, we build a wearable system with a novel dual-head Transformer for Transparency (Trans4Trans) perception model, which can segment general- and transparent objects. The two dense segmentation results are further combined with depth information in the system to help users navigate safely and assist them to negotiate transparent obstacles. We propose a lightweight Transformer Parsing Module (TPM) to perform multi-scale feature interpretation in the transformer-based decoder. Benefiting from TPM, the double decoders can perform joint learning from corresponding datasets to pursue robustness, meanwhile maintain efficiency on a portable GPU, with negligible calculation increase. The entire Trans4Trans model is constructed in a symmetrical encoder-decoder architecture, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the test sets of Stanford2D3D and Trans10K-v2 datasets, obtaining mIoU of 45.13% and 75.14%, respectively. Through a user study and various pre-tests conducted in indoor and outdoor scenes, the usability and reliability of our assistive system have been extensively verified. Meanwhile, the Tran4Trans model has outstanding performances on driving scene datasets. On Cityscapes, ACDC, and DADA-seg datasets corresponding to common environments, adverse weather, and traffic accident scenarios, mIoU scores of 81.5%, 76.3%, and 39.2% are obtained, demonstrating its high efficiency and robustness for real-world transportation applications."
Pixel Contrastive-Consistent Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"We present a novel semi-supervised semantic segmentation method which jointly achieves two desiderata of segmentation model regularities: the label-space consistency property between image augmentations and the feature-space contrastive property among different pixels. We leverage the pixel-level L2 loss and the pixel contrastive loss for the two purposes respectively. To address the computational efficiency issue and the false negative noise issue involved in the pixel contrastive loss, we further introduce and investigate several negative sampling techniques. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method (PC2Seg) with the DeepLab-v3+ architecture, in several challenging semi-supervised settings derived from the VOC, Cityscapes, and COCO datasets."
Indoor Scene Generation from a Collection of Semantic-Segmented Depth Images,"We present a method for creating 3D indoor scenes with a generative model learned from a collection of semantic-segmented depth images captured from different unknown scenes. Given a room with a specified size, our method automatically generates 3D objects in a room from a randomly sampled latent code. Different from existing methods that represent an indoor scene with the type, location, and other properties of objects in the room and learn the scene layout from a collection of complete 3D indoor scenes, our method models each indoor scene as a 3D semantic scene volume and learns a volumetric generative adversarial network (GAN) from a collection of 2.5D partial observations of 3D scenes. To this end, we apply a differentiable projection layer to project the generated 3D semantic scene volumes into semantic-segmented depth images and design a new multiple-view discriminator for learning the complete 3D scene volume from 2.5D semantic-segmented depth images. Compared to existing methods, our method not only efficiently reduces the workload of modeling and acquiring 3D scenes for training, but also produces better object shapes and their detailed layouts in the scene. We evaluate our method with different indoor scene datasets and demonstrate the advantages of our method. We also extend our method for generating 3D indoor scenes from semantic-segmented depth images inferred from RGB images of real scenes."
FSNet: A Failure Detection Framework for Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation is an important task that helps autonomous vehicles understand their surroundings and navigate safely. During deployment, even the most mature segmentation models are vulnerable to various external factors that can degrade the segmentation performance with potentially catastrophic consequences for the vehicle and its surroundings. To address this issue, we propose a failure detection framework to identify pixel-level misclassification. We do so by exploiting internal features of the segmentation model and training it simultaneously with a failure detection network. During deployment, the failure detector can flag areas in the image where the segmentation model have failed to segment correctly. We evaluate the proposed approach against state-of-the-art methods and achieve 12.30%, 9.46%, and 9.65% performance improvement in the AUPR-Error metric for Cityscapes, BDD100K, and Mapillary semantic segmentation datasets."
GP-S3Net: Graph-based Panoptic Sparse Semantic Segmentation Network,"Panoptic segmentation as an integrated task of both static environmental understanding and dynamic object identification, has recently begun to receive broad research interest. In this paper, we propose a new computationally efficient LiDAR based panoptic segmentation framework, called GP-S3Net. GP-S3Net is a proposal-free approach in which no object proposals are needed to identify the objects in contrast to conventional two-stage panoptic systems, where a detection network is incorporated for capturing instance information. Our new design consists of a novel instance-level network to process the semantic results by constructing a graph convolutional network to identify objects (foreground), which later on are fused with the background classes. Through the fine-grained clusters of the foreground objects from the semantic segmentation backbone, over-segmentation priors are generated and subsequently processed by 3D sparse convolution to embed each cluster. Each cluster is treated as a node in the graph and its corresponding embedding is used as its node feature. Then a GCNN predicts whether edges exist between each cluster pair. We utilize the instance label to generate ground truth edge labels for each constructed graph in order to supervise the learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GP-S3Net outperforms the current state-of-the-art approaches, by a significant margin across available datasets such as, nuScenes and SemanticPOSS, ranking first on the competitive public SemanticKITTI leaderboard upon publication."
Multi-Anchor Active Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation,"Unsupervised domain adaption has proven to be an effective approach for alleviating the intensive workload of manual annotation by aligning the synthetic source-domain data and the real-world target-domain samples. Unfortunately, mapping the target-domain distribution to the source-domain unconditionally may distort the essential structural information of the target-domain data. To this end, we firstly propose to introduce a novel multi-anchor based active learning strategy to assist domain adaptation regarding the semantic segmentation task. By innovatively adopting multiple anchors instead of a single centroid, the source domain can be better characterized as a multimodal distribution, thus more representative and complimentary samples are selected from the target domain. With little workload to manually annotate these active samples, the distortion of the target-domain distribution can be effectively alleviated, resulting in a large performance gain. The multi-anchor strategy is additionally employed to model the target-distribution. By regularizing the latent representation of the target samples compact around multiple anchors through a novel soft alignment loss, more precise segmentation can be achieved. Extensive experiments are conducted on public datasets to demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods significantly, along with thorough ablation study to verify the effectiveness of each component."
An Evaluation of RGB and LiDAR Fusion for Semantic Segmentation,"LiDARs and cameras are the two main sensors that are planned to be included in many announced autonomous vehicles prototypes. Each of the two provides a unique form of data from a different perspective to the surrounding environment. In this paper, we explore and attempt to answer the question: is there an added benefit by fusing those two forms of data for the purpose of semantic segmentation within the context of autonomous driving? We also attempt to show at which level does said fusion prove to be the most useful. We evaluated our algorithms on the publicly available SemanticKITTI dataset. All fusion models show improvements over the base model, with the mid-level fusion showing the highest improvement of 2.7% in terms of mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) metric."
LIF-Seg: LiDAR and Camera Image Fusion for 3D LiDAR Semantic Segmentation,"Camera and 3D LiDAR sensors have become indispensable devices in modern autonomous driving vehicles, where the camera provides the fine-grained texture, color information in 2D space and LiDAR captures more precise and farther-away distance measurements of the surrounding environments. The complementary information from these two sensors makes the two-modality fusion be a desired option. However, two major issues of the fusion between camera and LiDAR hinder its performance, \ie, how to effectively fuse these two modalities and how to precisely align them (suffering from the weak spatiotemporal synchronization problem). In this paper, we propose a coarse-to-fine LiDAR and camera fusion-based network (termed as LIF-Seg) for LiDAR segmentation. For the first issue, unlike these previous works fusing the point cloud and image information in a one-to-one manner, the proposed method fully utilizes the contextual information of images and introduces a simple but effective early-fusion strategy. Second, due to the weak spatiotemporal synchronization problem, an offset rectification approach is designed to align these two-modality features. The cooperation of these two components leads to the success of the effective camera-LiDAR fusion. Experimental results on the nuScenes dataset show the superiority of the proposed LIF-Seg over existing methods with a large margin. Ablation studies and analyses demonstrate that our proposed LIF-Seg can effectively tackle the weak spatiotemporal synchronization problem."
Instance Segmentation in 3D Scenes using Semantic Superpoint Tree Networks,"Instance segmentation in 3D scenes is fundamental in many applications of scene understanding. It is yet challenging due to the compound factors of data irregularity and uncertainty in the numbers of instances. State-of-the-art methods largely rely on a general pipeline that first learns point-wise features discriminative at semantic and instance levels, followed by a separate step of point grouping for proposing object instances. While promising, they have the shortcomings that (1) the second step is not supervised by the main objective of instance segmentation, and (2) their point-wise feature learning and grouping are less effective to deal with data irregularities, possibly resulting in fragmented segmentations. To address these issues, we propose in this work an end-to-end solution of Semantic Superpoint Tree Network (SSTNet) for proposing object instances from scene points. Key in SSTNet is an intermediate, semantic superpoint tree (SST), which is constructed based on the learned semantic features of superpoints, and which will be traversed and split at intermediate tree nodes for proposals of object instances. We also design in SSTNet a refinement module, termed CliqueNet, to prune superpoints that may be wrongly grouped into instance proposals. Experiments on the benchmarks of ScanNet and S3DIS show the efficacy of our proposed method. At the time of submission, SSTNet ranks top on the ScanNet (V2) leaderboard, with 2% higher of mAP than the second best method. The source code in PyTorch is available at https://github.com/Gorilla-Lab-SCUT/SSTNet."
Flying Guide Dog: Walkable Path Discovery for the Visually Impaired Utilizing Drones and Transformer-based Semantic Segmentation,"Lacking the ability to sense ambient environments effectively, blind and visually impaired people (BVIP) face difficulty in walking outdoors, especially in urban areas. Therefore, tools for assisting BVIP are of great importance. In this paper, we propose a novel ""flying guide dog"" prototype for BVIP assistance using drone and street view semantic segmentation. Based on the walkable areas extracted from the segmentation prediction, the drone can adjust its movement automatically and thus lead the user to walk along the walkable path. By recognizing the color of pedestrian traffic lights, our prototype can help the user to cross a street safely. Furthermore, we introduce a new dataset named Pedestrian and Vehicle Traffic Lights (PVTL), which is dedicated to traffic light recognition. The result of our user study in real-world scenarios shows that our prototype is effective and easy to use, providing new insight into BVIP assistance."
Multi-Target Adversarial Frameworks for Domain Adaptation in Semantic Segmentation,"In this work, we address the task of unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for semantic segmentation in presence of multiple target domains: The objective is to train a single model that can handle all these domains at test time. Such a multi-target adaptation is crucial for a variety of scenarios that real-world autonomous systems must handle. It is a challenging setup since one faces not only the domain gap between the labeled source set and the unlabeled target set, but also the distribution shifts existing within the latter among the different target domains. To this end, we introduce two adversarial frameworks: (i) multi-discriminator, which explicitly aligns each target domain to its counterparts, and (ii) multi-target knowledge transfer, which learns a target-agnostic model thanks to a multi-teacher/single-student distillation mechanism.The evaluation is done on four newly-proposed multi-target benchmarks for UDA in semantic segmentation. In all tested scenarios, our approaches consistently outperform baselines, setting competitive standards for the novel task."
The Marine Debris Dataset for Forward-Looking Sonar Semantic Segmentation,"Accurate detection and segmentation of marine debris is important for keeping the water bodies clean. This paper presents a novel dataset for marine debris segmentation collected using a Forward Looking Sonar (FLS). The dataset consists of 1868 FLS images captured using ARIS Explorer 3000 sensor. The objects used to produce this dataset contain typical house-hold marine debris and distractor marine objects (tires, hooks, valves,etc), divided in 11 classes plus a background class. Performance of state of the art semantic segmentation architectures with a variety of encoders have been analyzed on this dataset and presented as baseline results. Since the images are grayscale, no pretrained weights have been used. Comparisons are made using Intersection over Union (IoU). The best performing model is Unet with ResNet34 backbone at 0.7481 mIoU. The dataset is available at https://github.com/mvaldenegro/marine-debris-fls-datasets/"
Exploiting a Joint Embedding Space for Generalized Zero-Shot Semantic Segmentation,"We address the problem of generalized zero-shot semantic segmentation (GZS3) predicting pixel-wise semantic labels for seen and unseen classes. Most GZS3 methods adopt a generative approach that synthesizes visual features of unseen classes from corresponding semantic ones (e.g., word2vec) to train novel classifiers for both seen and unseen classes. Although generative methods show decent performance, they have two limitations: (1) the visual features are biased towards seen classes; (2) the classifier should be retrained whenever novel unseen classes appear. We propose a discriminative approach to address these limitations in a unified framework. To this end, we leverage visual and semantic encoders to learn a joint embedding space, where the semantic encoder transforms semantic features to semantic prototypes that act as centers for visual features of corresponding classes. Specifically, we introduce boundary-aware regression (BAR) and semantic consistency (SC) losses to learn discriminative features. Our approach to exploiting the joint embedding space, together with BAR and SC terms, alleviates the seen bias problem. At test time, we avoid the retraining process by exploiting semantic prototypes as a nearest-neighbor (NN) classifier. To further alleviate the bias problem, we also propose an inference technique, dubbed Apollonius calibration (AC), that modulates the decision boundary of the NN classifier to the Apollonius circle adaptively. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, achieving a new state of the art on standard benchmarks."
DensePASS: Dense Panoramic Semantic Segmentation via Unsupervised Domain Adaptation with Attention-Augmented Context Exchange,"Intelligent vehicles clearly benefit from the expanded Field of View (FoV) of the 360-degree sensors, but the vast majority of available semantic segmentation training images are captured with pinhole cameras. In this work, we look at this problem through the lens of domain adaptation and bring panoramic semantic segmentation to a setting, where labelled training data originates from a different distribution of conventional pinhole camera images. First, we formalize the task of unsupervised domain adaptation for panoramic semantic segmentation, where a network trained on labelled examples from the source domain of pinhole camera data is deployed in a different target domain of panoramic images, for which no labels are available. To validate this idea, we collect and publicly release DensePASS - a novel densely annotated dataset for panoramic segmentation under cross-domain conditions, specifically built to study the Pinhole-to-Panoramic transfer and accompanied with pinhole camera training examples obtained from Cityscapes. DensePASS covers both, labelled- and unlabelled 360-degree images, with the labelled data comprising 19 classes which explicitly fit the categories available in the source domain (i.e. pinhole) data. To meet the challenge of domain shift, we leverage the current progress of attention-based mechanisms and build a generic framework for cross-domain panoramic semantic segmentation based on different variants of attention-augmented domain adaptation modules. Our framework facilitates information exchange at local- and global levels when learning the domain correspondences and improves the domain adaptation performance of two standard segmentation networks by 6.05% and 11.26% in Mean IoU."
Dual Path Learning for Domain Adaptation of Semantic Segmentation,"Domain adaptation for semantic segmentation enables to alleviate the need for large-scale pixel-wise annotations. Recently, self-supervised learning (SSL) with a combination of image-to-image translation shows great effectiveness in adaptive segmentation. The most common practice is to perform SSL along with image translation to well align a single domain (the source or target). However, in this single-domain paradigm, unavoidable visual inconsistency raised by image translation may affect subsequent learning. In this paper, based on the observation that domain adaptation frameworks performed in the source and target domain are almost complementary in terms of image translation and SSL, we propose a novel dual path learning (DPL) framework to alleviate visual inconsistency. Concretely, DPL contains two complementary and interactive single-domain adaptation pipelines aligned in source and target domain respectively. The inference of DPL is extremely simple, only one segmentation model in the target domain is employed. Novel technologies such as dual path image translation and dual path adaptive segmentation are proposed to make two paths promote each other in an interactive manner. Experiments on GTA5\rightarrowCityscapes and SYNTHIA\rightarrowCityscapes scenarios demonstrate the superiority of our DPL model over the state-of-the-art methods. The code and models are available at: \url{https://github.com/royee182/DPL}"
Generative Zero-Shot Learning for Semantic Segmentation of 3D Point Clouds,"While there has been a number of studies on Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) for 2D images, its application to 3D data is still recent and scarce, with just a few methods limited to classification. We present the first generative approach for both ZSL and Generalized ZSL (GZSL) on 3D data, that can handle both classification and, for the first time, semantic segmentation. We show that it reaches or outperforms the state of the art on ModelNet40 classification for both inductive ZSL and inductive GZSL. For semantic segmentation, we created three benchmarks for evaluating this new ZSL task, using S3DIS, ScanNet and SemanticKITTI. Our experiments show that our method outperforms strong baselines, which we additionally propose for this task."
Evaluating the Robustness of Semantic Segmentation for Autonomous Driving against Real-World Adversarial Patch Attacks,"Deep learning and convolutional neural networks allow achieving impressive performance in computer vision tasks, such as object detection and semantic segmentation (SS). However, recent studies have shown evident weaknesses of such models against adversarial perturbations. In a real-world scenario instead, like autonomous driving, more attention should be devoted to real-world adversarial examples (RWAEs), which are physical objects (e.g., billboards and printable patches) optimized to be adversarial to the entire perception pipeline. This paper presents an in-depth evaluation of the robustness of popular SS models by testing the effects of both digital and real-world adversarial patches. These patches are crafted with powerful attacks enriched with a novel loss function. Firstly, an investigation on the Cityscapes dataset is conducted by extending the Expectation Over Transformation (EOT) paradigm to cope with SS. Then, a novel attack optimization, called scene-specific attack, is proposed. Such an attack leverages the CARLA driving simulator to improve the transferability of the proposed EOT-based attack to a real 3D environment. Finally, a printed physical billboard containing an adversarial patch was tested in an outdoor driving scenario to assess the feasibility of the studied attacks in the real world. Exhaustive experiments revealed that the proposed attack formulations outperform previous work to craft both digital and real-world adversarial patches for SS. At the same time, the experimental results showed how these attacks are notably less effective in the real world, hence questioning the practical relevance of adversarial attacks to SS models for autonomous/assisted driving."
Effective semantic segmentation in Cataract Surgery: What matters most?,"Our work proposes neural network design choices that set the state-of-the-art on a challenging public benchmark on cataract surgery, CaDIS. Our methodology achieves strong performance across three semantic segmentation tasks with increasingly granular surgical tool class sets by effectively handling class imbalance, an inherent challenge in any surgical video. We consider and evaluate two conceptually simple data oversampling methods as well as different loss functions. We show significant performance gains across network architectures and tasks especially on the rarest tool classes, thereby presenting an approach for achieving high performance when imbalanced granular datasets are considered. Our code and trained models are available at https://github.com/RViMLab/MICCAI2021_Cataract_semantic_segmentation and qualitative results on unseen surgical video can be found at https://youtu.be/twVIPUj1WZM."
Memory-based Semantic Segmentation for Off-road Unstructured Natural Environments,"With the availability of many datasets tailored for autonomous driving in real-world urban scenes, semantic segmentation for urban driving scenes achieves significant progress. However, semantic segmentation for off-road, unstructured environments is not widely studied. Directly applying existing segmentation networks often results in performance degradation as they cannot overcome intrinsic problems in such environments, such as illumination changes. In this paper, a built-in memory module for semantic segmentation is proposed to overcome these problems. The memory module stores significant representations of training images as memory items. In addition to the encoder embedding like items together, the proposed memory module is specifically designed to cluster together instances of the same class even when there are significant variances in embedded features. Therefore, it makes segmentation networks better deal with unexpected illumination changes. A triplet loss is used in training to minimize redundancy in storing discriminative representations of the memory module. The proposed memory module is general so that it can be adopted in a variety of networks. We conduct experiments on the Robot Unstructured Ground Driving (RUGD) dataset and RELLIS dataset, which are collected from off-road, unstructured natural environments. Experimental results show that the proposed memory module improves the performance of existing segmentation networks and contributes to capturing unclear objects over various off-road, unstructured natural scenes with equivalent computational cost and network parameters. As the proposed method can be integrated into compact networks, it presents a viable approach for resource-limited small autonomous platforms."
LabOR: Labeling Only if Required for Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation,"Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) for semantic segmentation has been actively studied to mitigate the domain gap between label-rich source data and unlabeled target data. Despite these efforts, UDA still has a long way to go to reach the fully supervised performance. To this end, we propose a Labeling Only if Required strategy, LabOR, where we introduce a human-in-the-loop approach to adaptively give scarce labels to points that a UDA model is uncertain about. In order to find the uncertain points, we generate an inconsistency mask using the proposed adaptive pixel selector and we label these segment-based regions to achieve near supervised performance with only a small fraction (about 2.2%) ground truth points, which we call ""Segment based Pixel-Labeling (SPL)"". To further reduce the efforts of the human annotator, we also propose ""Point-based Pixel-Labeling (PPL)"", which finds the most representative points for labeling within the generated inconsistency mask. This reduces efforts from 2.2% segment label to 40 points label while minimizing performance degradation. Through extensive experimentation, we show the advantages of this new framework for domain adaptive semantic segmentation while minimizing human labor costs."
A Real-Time Online Learning Framework for Joint 3D Reconstruction and Semantic Segmentation of Indoor Scenes,"This paper presents a real-time online vision framework to jointly recover an indoor scene's 3D structure and semantic label. Given noisy depth maps, a camera trajectory, and 2D semantic labels at train time, the proposed deep neural network based approach learns to fuse the depth over frames with suitable semantic labels in the scene space. Our approach exploits the joint volumetric representation of the depth and semantics in the scene feature space to solve this task. For a compelling online fusion of the semantic labels and geometry in real-time, we introduce an efficient vortex pooling block while dropping the use of routing network in online depth fusion to preserve high-frequency surface details. We show that the context information provided by the semantics of the scene helps the depth fusion network learn noise-resistant features. Not only that, it helps overcome the shortcomings of the current online depth fusion method in dealing with thin object structures, thickening artifacts, and false surfaces. Experimental evaluation on the Replica dataset shows that our approach can perform depth fusion at 37 and 10 frames per second with an average reconstruction F-score of 88% and 91%, respectively, depending on the depth map resolution. Moreover, our model shows an average IoU score of 0.515 on the ScanNet 3D semantic benchmark leaderboard."
Deep Metric Learning for Open World Semantic Segmentation,"Classical close-set semantic segmentation networks have limited ability to detect out-of-distribution (OOD) objects, which is important for safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. Incrementally learning these OOD objects with few annotations is an ideal way to enlarge the knowledge base of the deep learning models. In this paper, we propose an open world semantic segmentation system that includes two modules: (1) an open-set semantic segmentation module to detect both in-distribution and OOD objects. (2) an incremental few-shot learning module to gradually incorporate those OOD objects into its existing knowledge base. This open world semantic segmentation system behaves like a human being, which is able to identify OOD objects and gradually learn them with corresponding supervision. We adopt the Deep Metric Learning Network (DMLNet) with contrastive clustering to implement open-set semantic segmentation. Compared to other open-set semantic segmentation methods, our DMLNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on three challenging open-set semantic segmentation datasets without using additional data or generative models. On this basis, two incremental few-shot learning methods are further proposed to progressively improve the DMLNet with the annotations of OOD objects."
AASeg: Attention Aware Network for Real Time Semantic Segmentation,"In this paper, we present a new network named Attention Aware Network (AASeg) for real time semantic image segmentation. Our network incorporates spatial and channel information using Spatial Attention (SA) and Channel Attention (CA) modules respectively. It also uses dense local multi-scale context information using Multi Scale Context (MSC) module. The feature maps are concatenated individually to produce the final segmentation map. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using a comprehensive analysis, quantitative experimental results and ablation study using Cityscapes, ADE20K and Camvid datasets. Our network performs better than most previous architectures with a 74.4\% Mean IOU on Cityscapes test dataset while running at 202.7 FPS."
Complementary Patch for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) based on image-level labels has been greatly advanced by exploiting the outputs of Class Activation Map (CAM) to generate the pseudo labels for semantic segmentation. However, CAM merely discovers seeds from a small number of regions, which may be insufficient to serve as pseudo masks for semantic segmentation. In this paper, we formulate the expansion of object regions in CAM as an increase in information. From the perspective of information theory, we propose a novel Complementary Patch (CP) Representation and prove that the information of the sum of the CAMs by a pair of input images with complementary hidden (patched) parts, namely CP Pair, is greater than or equal to the information of the baseline CAM. Therefore, a CAM with more information related to object seeds can be obtained by narrowing down the gap between the sum of CAMs generated by the CP Pair and the original CAM. We propose a CP Network (CPN) implemented by a triplet network and three regularization functions. To further improve the quality of the CAMs, we propose a Pixel-Region Correlation Module (PRCM) to augment the contextual information by using object-region relations between the feature maps and the CAMs. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC 2012 datasets show that our proposed method achieves a new state-of-the-art in WSSS, validating the effectiveness of our CP Representation and CPN."
Boundary-aware Graph Reasoning for Semantic Segmentation,"In this paper, we propose a Boundary-aware Graph Reasoning (BGR) module to learn long-range contextual features for semantic segmentation. Rather than directly construct the graph based on the backbone features, our BGR module explores a reasonable way to combine segmentation erroneous regions with the graph construction scenario. Motivated by the fact that most hard-to-segment pixels broadly distribute on boundary regions, our BGR module uses the boundary score map as prior knowledge to intensify the graph node connections and thereby guide the graph reasoning focus on boundary regions. In addition, we employ an efficient graph convolution implementation to reduce the computational cost, which benefits the integration of our BGR module into current segmentation backbones. Extensive experiments on three challenging segmentation benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed BGR module for semantic segmentation."
RECALL: Replay-based Continual Learning in Semantic Segmentation,"Deep networks allow to obtain outstanding results in semantic segmentation, however they need to be trained in a single shot with a large amount of data. Continual learning settings where new classes are learned in incremental steps and previous training data is no longer available are challenging due to the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon. Existing approaches typically fail when several incremental steps are performed or in presence of a distribution shift of the background class. We tackle these issues by recreating no longer available data for the old classes and outlining a content inpainting scheme on the background class. We propose two sources for replay data. The first resorts to a generative adversarial network to sample from the class space of past learning steps. The second relies on web-crawled data to retrieve images containing examples of old classes from online databases. In both scenarios no samples of past steps are stored, thus avoiding privacy concerns. Replay data are then blended with new samples during the incremental steps. Our approach, RECALL, outperforms state-of-the-art methods."
An EM Framework for Online Incremental Learning of Semantic Segmentation,"Incremental learning of semantic segmentation has emerged as a promising strategy for visual scene interpretation in the open- world setting. However, it remains challenging to acquire novel classes in an online fashion for the segmentation task, mainly due to its continuously-evolving semantic label space, partial pixelwise ground-truth annotations, and constrained data availability. To ad- dress this, we propose an incremental learning strategy that can fast adapt deep segmentation models without catastrophic forgetting, using a streaming input data with pixel annotations on the novel classes only. To this end, we develop a uni ed learning strategy based on the Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework, which integrates an iterative relabeling strategy that lls in the missing labels and a rehearsal-based incremental learning step that balances the stability-plasticity of the model. Moreover, our EM algorithm adopts an adaptive sampling method to select informative train- ing data and a class-balancing training strategy in the incremental model updates, both improving the e cacy of model learning. We validate our approach on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and ADE20K datasets, and the results demonstrate its superior performance over the existing incremental methods."
Context-Aware Mixup for Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation,"Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to adapt a model of the labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Existing UDA-based semantic segmentation approaches always reduce the domain shifts in pixel level, feature level, and output level. However, almost all of them largely neglect the contextual dependency, which is generally shared across different domains, leading to less-desired performance. In this paper, we propose a novel Context-Aware Mixup (CAMix) framework for domain adaptive semantic segmentation, which exploits this important clue of context-dependency as explicit prior knowledge in a fully end-to-end trainable manner for enhancing the adaptability toward the target domain. Firstly, we present a contextual mask generation strategy by leveraging the accumulated spatial distributions and prior contextual relationships. The generated contextual mask is critical in this work and will guide the context-aware domain mixup on three different levels. Besides, provided the context knowledge, we introduce a significance-reweighted consistency loss to penalize the inconsistency between the mixed student prediction and the mixed teacher prediction, which alleviates the negative transfer of the adaptation, e.g., early performance degradation. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of our method against the state-of-the-art approaches on widely-used UDA benchmarks."
Semantic Segmentation and Object Detection Towards Instance Segmentation: Breast Tumor Identification,"Breast cancer is one of the factors that cause the increase of mortality of women. The most widely used method for diagnosing this geological disease i.e. breast cancer is the ultrasound scan. Several key features such as the smoothness and the texture of the tumor captured through ultrasound scans encode the abnormality of the breast tumors (malignant from benign). However, ultrasound scans are often noisy and include irrelevant parts of the breast that may bias the segmentation of eventual tumors. In this paper, we are going to extract the region of interest ( i.e, bounding boxes of the tumors) and feed-forward them to one semantic segmentation encoder-decoder structure based on its classification (i.e, malignant or benign). the whole process aims to build an instance-based segmenter from a semantic segmenter and an object detector."
BiMaL: Bijective Maximum Likelihood Approach to Domain Adaptation in Semantic Scene Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation aims to predict pixel-level labels. It has become a popular task in various computer vision applications. While fully supervised segmentation methods have achieved high accuracy on large-scale vision datasets, they are unable to generalize on a new test environment or a new domain well. In this work, we first introduce a new Un-aligned Domain Score to measure the efficiency of a learned model on a new target domain in unsupervised manner. Then, we present the new Bijective Maximum Likelihood(BiMaL) loss that is a generalized form of the Adversarial Entropy Minimization without any assumption about pixel independence. We have evaluated the proposed BiMaL on two domains. The proposed BiMaL approach consistently outperforms the SOTA methods on empirical experiments on ""SYNTHIA to Cityscapes"", ""GTA5 to Cityscapes"", and ""SYNTHIA to Vistas""."
Simpler is Better: Few-shot Semantic Segmentation with Classifier Weight Transformer,"A few-shot semantic segmentation model is typically composed of a CNN encoder, a CNN decoder and a simple classifier (separating foreground and background pixels). Most existing methods meta-learn all three model components for fast adaptation to a new class. However, given that as few as a single support set image is available, effective model adaption of all three components to the new class is extremely challenging. In this work we propose to simplify the meta-learning task by focusing solely on the simplest component, the classifier, whilst leaving the encoder and decoder to pre-training. We hypothesize that if we pre-train an off-the-shelf segmentation model over a set of diverse training classes with sufficient annotations, the encoder and decoder can capture rich discriminative features applicable for any unseen classes, rendering the subsequent meta-learning stage unnecessary. For the classifier meta-learning, we introduce a Classifier Weight Transformer (CWT) designed to dynamically adapt the supportset trained classifier's weights to each query image in an inductive way. Extensive experiments on two standard benchmarks show that despite its simplicity, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art alternatives, often by a large margin.Code is available on https://github.com/zhiheLu/CWT-for-FSS."
Learning Meta-class Memory for Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation,"Currently, the state-of-the-art methods treat few-shot semantic segmentation task as a conditional foreground-background segmentation problem, assuming each class is independent. In this paper, we introduce the concept of meta-class, which is the meta information (e.g. certain middle-level features) shareable among all classes. To explicitly learn meta-class representations in few-shot segmentation task, we propose a novel Meta-class Memory based few-shot segmentation method (MM-Net), where we introduce a set of learnable memory embeddings to memorize the meta-class information during the base class training and transfer to novel classes during the inference stage. Moreover, for the k-shot scenario, we propose a novel image quality measurement module to select images from the set of support images. A high-quality class prototype could be obtained with the weighted sum of support image features based on the quality measure. Experiments on both PASCAL-5^i and COCO dataset shows that our proposed method is able to achieve state-of-the-art results in both 1-shot and 5-shot settings. Particularly, our proposed MM-Net achieves 37.5\% mIoU on the COCO dataset in 1-shot setting, which is 5.1\% higher than the previous state-of-the-art."
Attention-based fusion of semantic boundary and non-boundary information to improve semantic segmentation,"This paper introduces a method for image semantic segmentation grounded on a novel fusion scheme, which takes place inside a deep convolutional neural network. The main goal of our proposal is to explore object boundary information to improve the overall segmentation performance. Unlike previous works that combine boundary and segmentation features, or those that use boundary information to regularize semantic segmentation, we instead propose a novel approach that embodies boundary information onto segmentation. For that, our semantic segmentation method uses two streams, which are combined through an attention gate, forming an end-to-end Y-model. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work to show that boundary detection can improve semantic segmentation when fused through a semantic fusion gate (attention model). We performed an extensive evaluation of our method over public data sets. We found competitive results on all data sets after comparing our proposed model with other twelve state-of-the-art segmenters, considering the same training conditions. Our proposed model achieved the best mIoU on the CityScapes, CamVid, and Pascal Context data sets, and the second best on Mapillary Vistas."
Global and Local Texture Randomization for Synthetic-to-Real Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation is a crucial image understanding task, where each pixel of image is categorized into a corresponding label. Since the pixel-wise labeling for ground-truth is tedious and labor intensive, in practical applications, many works exploit the synthetic images to train the model for real-word image semantic segmentation, i.e., Synthetic-to-Real Semantic Segmentation (SRSS). However, Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained on the source synthetic data may not generalize well to the target real-world data. In this work, we propose two simple yet effective texture randomization mechanisms, Global Texture Randomization (GTR) and Local Texture Randomization (LTR), for Domain Generalization based SRSS. GTR is proposed to randomize the texture of source images into diverse unreal texture styles. It aims to alleviate the reliance of the network on texture while promoting the learning of the domain-invariant cues. In addition, we find the texture difference is not always occurred in entire image and may only appear in some local areas. Therefore, we further propose a LTR mechanism to generate diverse local regions for partially stylizing the source images. Finally, we implement a regularization of Consistency between GTR and LTR (CGL) aiming to harmonize the two proposed mechanisms during training. Extensive experiments on five publicly available datasets (i.e., GTA5, SYNTHIA, Cityscapes, BDDS and Mapillary) with various SRSS settings (i.e., GTA5/SYNTHIA to Cityscapes/BDDS/Mapillary) demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to the state-of-the-art methods for domain generalization based SRSS."
Boosting Few-shot Semantic Segmentation with Transformers,"Due to the fact that fully supervised semantic segmentation methods require sufficient fully-labeled data to work well and can not generalize to unseen classes, few-shot segmentation has attracted lots of research attention. Previous arts extract features from support and query images, which are processed jointly before making predictions on query images. The whole process is based on convolutional neural networks (CNN), leading to the problem that only local information is used. In this paper, we propose a TRansformer-based Few-shot Semantic segmentation method (TRFS). Specifically, our model consists of two modules: Global Enhancement Module (GEM) and Local Enhancement Module (LEM). GEM adopts transformer blocks to exploit global information, while LEM utilizes conventional convolutions to exploit local information, across query and support features. Both GEM and LEM are complementary, helping to learn better feature representations for segmenting query images. Extensive experiments on PASCAL-5i and COCO datasets show that our approach achieves new state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating its effectiveness."
Adaptive Path Planning for UAV-based Multi-Resolution Semantic Segmentation,"In this paper, we address the problem of adaptive path planning for accurate semantic segmentation of terrain using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The usage of UAVs for terrain monitoring and remote sensing is rapidly gaining momentum due to their high mobility, low cost, and flexible deployment. However, a key challenge is planning missions to maximize the value of acquired data in large environments given flight time limitations. To address this, we propose an online planning algorithm which adapts the UAV paths to obtain high-resolution semantic segmentations necessary in areas on the terrain with fine details as they are detected in incoming images. This enables us to perform close inspections at low altitudes only where required, without wasting energy on exhaustive mapping at maximum resolution. A key feature of our approach is a new accuracy model for deep learning-based architectures that captures the relationship between UAV altitude and semantic segmentation accuracy. We evaluate our approach on the application of crop/weed segmentation in precision agriculture using real-world field data."
Specialize and Fuse: Pyramidal Output Representation for Semantic Segmentation,"We present a novel pyramidal output representation to ensure parsimony with our ""specialize and fuse"" process for semantic segmentation. A pyramidal ""output"" representation consists of coarse-to-fine levels, where each level is ""specialize"" in a different class distribution (e.g., more stuff than things classes at coarser levels). Two types of pyramidal outputs (i.e., unity and semantic pyramid) are ""fused"" into the final semantic output, where the unity pyramid indicates unity-cells (i.e., all pixels in such cell share the same semantic label). The process ensures parsimony by predicting a relatively small number of labels for unity-cells (e.g., a large cell of grass) to build the final semantic output. In addition to the ""output"" representation, we design a coarse-to-fine contextual module to aggregate the ""features"" representation from different levels. We validate the effectiveness of each key module in our method through comprehensive ablation studies. Finally, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on three widely-used semantic segmentation datasets -- ADE20K, COCO-Stuff, and Pascal-Context."
Triggering Failures: Out-Of-Distribution detection by learning from local adversarial attacks in Semantic Segmentation,"In this paper, we tackle the detection of out-of-distribution (OOD) objects in semantic segmentation. By analyzing the literature, we found that current methods are either accurate or fast but not both which limits their usability in real world applications. To get the best of both aspects, we propose to mitigate the common shortcomings by following four design principles: decoupling the OOD detection from the segmentation task, observing the entire segmentation network instead of just its output, generating training data for the OOD detector by leveraging blind spots in the segmentation network and focusing the generated data on localized regions in the image to simulate OOD objects. Our main contribution is a new OOD detection architecture called ObsNet associated with a dedicated training scheme based on Local Adversarial Attacks (LAA). We validate the soundness of our approach across numerous ablation studies. We also show it obtains top performances both in speed and accuracy when compared to ten recent methods of the literature on three different datasets."
Adaptive Affinity Loss and Erroneous Pseudo-Label Refinement for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation has been continuously investigated in the last ten years, and majority of the established technologies are based on supervised models. In recent years, image-level weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS), including single- and multi-stage process, has attracted large attention due to data labeling efficiency. In this paper, we propose to embed affinity learning of multi-stage approaches in a single-stage model. To be specific, we introduce an adaptive affinity loss to thoroughly learn the local pairwise affinity. As such, a deep neural network is used to deliver comprehensive semantic information in the training phase, whilst improving the performance of the final prediction module. On the other hand, considering the existence of errors in the pseudo labels, we propose a novel label reassign loss to mitigate over-fitting. Extensive experiments are conducted on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach that outperforms other standard single-stage methods and achieves comparable performance against several multi-stage methods."
Dynamic Feature Regularized Loss for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"We focus on tackling weakly supervised semantic segmentation with scribble-level annotation. The regularized loss has been proven to be an effective solution for this task. However, most existing regularized losses only leverage static shallow features (color, spatial information) to compute the regularized kernel, which limits its final performance since such static shallow features fail to describe pair-wise pixel relationship in complicated cases. In this paper, we propose a new regularized loss which utilizes both shallow and deep features that are dynamically updated in order to aggregate sufficient information to represent the relationship of different pixels. Moreover, in order to provide accurate deep features, we adopt vision transformer as the backbone and design a feature consistency head to train the pair-wise feature relationship. Unlike most approaches that adopt multi-stage training strategy with many bells and whistles, our approach can be directly trained in an end-to-end manner, in which the feature consistency head and our regularized loss can benefit from each other. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves new state-of-the-art performances, outperforming other approaches by a significant margin with more than 6\% mIoU increase."
Boundary Knowledge Translation based Reference Semantic Segmentation,"Given a reference object of an unknown type in an image, human observers can effortlessly find the objects of the same category in another image and precisely tell their visual boundaries. Such visual cognition capability of humans seems absent from the current research spectrum of computer vision. Existing segmentation networks, for example, rely on a humongous amount of labeled data, which is laborious and costly to collect and annotate; besides, the performance of segmentation networks tend to downgrade as the number of the category increases. In this paper, we introduce a novel Reference semantic segmentation Network (Ref-Net) to conduct visual boundary knowledge translation. Ref-Net contains a Reference Segmentation Module (RSM) and a Boundary Knowledge Translation Module (BKTM). Inspired by the human recognition mechanism, RSM is devised only to segment the same category objects based on the features of the reference objects. BKTM, on the other hand, introduces two boundary discriminator branches to conduct inner and outer boundary segmentation of the target objectin an adversarial manner, and translate the annotated boundary knowledge of open-source datasets into the segmentation network. Exhaustive experiments demonstrate that, with tens of finely-grained annotated samples as guidance, Ref-Net achieves results on par with fully supervised methods on six datasets."
Robust Semantic Segmentation with Superpixel-Mix,"Along with predictive performance and runtime speed, reliability is a key requirement for real-world semantic segmentation. Reliability encompasses robustness, predictive uncertainty and reduced bias. To improve reliability, we introduce Superpixel-mix, a new superpixel-based data augmentation method with teacher-student consistency training. Unlike other mixing-based augmentation techniques, mixing superpixels between images is aware of object boundaries, while yielding consistent gains in segmentation accuracy. Our proposed technique achieves state-of-the-art results in semi-supervised semantic segmentation on the Cityscapes dataset. Moreover, Superpixel-mix improves the reliability of semantic segmentation by reducing network uncertainty and bias, as confirmed by competitive results under strong distributions shift (adverse weather, image corruptions) and when facing out-of-distribution data."
CSC-Unet: A Novel Convolutional Sparse Coding Strategy based Neural Network for Semantic Segmentation,"It is a challenging task to accurately perform semantic segmentation due to the complexity of real picture scenes. Many semantic segmentation methods based on traditional deep learning insufficiently captured the semantic and appearance information of images, which put limit on their generality and robustness for various application scenes. In this paper, we proposed a novel strategy that reformulated the popularly-used convolution operation to multi-layer convolutional sparse coding block to ease the aforementioned deficiency. This strategy can be possibly used to significantly improve the segmentation performance of any semantic segmentation model that involves convolutional operations. To prove the effectiveness of our idea, we chose the widely-used U-Net model for the demonstration purpose, and we designed CSC-Unet model series based on U-Net. Through extensive analysis and experiments, we provided credible evidence showing that the multi-layer convolutional sparse coding block enables semantic segmentation model to converge faster, can extract finer semantic and appearance information of images, and improve the ability to recover spatial detail information. The best CSC-Unet model significantly outperforms the results of the original U-Net on three public datasets with different scenarios, i.e., 87.14% vs. 84.71% on DeepCrack dataset, 68.91% vs. 67.09% on Nuclei dataset, and 53.68% vs. 48.82% on CamVid dataset, respectively."
Sparse-to-dense Feature Matching: Intra and Inter domain Cross-modal Learning in Domain Adaptation for 3D Semantic Segmentation,"Domain adaptation is critical for success when confronting with the lack of annotations in a new domain. As the huge time consumption of labeling process on 3D point cloud, domain adaptation for 3D semantic segmentation is of great expectation. With the rise of multi-modal datasets, large amount of 2D images are accessible besides 3D point clouds. In light of this, we propose to further leverage 2D data for 3D domain adaptation by intra and inter domain cross modal learning. As for intra-domain cross modal learning, most existing works sample the dense 2D pixel-wise features into the same size with sparse 3D point-wise features, resulting in the abandon of numerous useful 2D features. To address this problem, we propose Dynamic sparse-to-dense Cross Modal Learning (DsCML) to increase the sufficiency of multi-modality information interaction for domain adaptation. For inter-domain cross modal learning, we further advance Cross Modal Adversarial Learning (CMAL) on 2D and 3D data which contains different semantic content aiming to promote high-level modal complementarity. We evaluate our model under various multi-modality domain adaptation settings including day-to-night, country-to-country and dataset-to-dataset, brings large improvements over both uni-modal and multi-modal domain adaptation methods on all settings."
SemSegMap- 3D Segment-Based Semantic Localization,"Localization is an essential task for mobile autonomous robotic systems that want to use pre-existing maps or create new ones in the context of SLAM. Today, many robotic platforms are equipped with high-accuracy 3D LiDAR sensors, which allow a geometric mapping, and cameras able to provide semantic cues of the environment. Segment-based mapping and localization have been applied with great success to 3D point-cloud data, while semantic understanding has been shown to improve localization performance in vision based systems. In this paper we combine both modalities in SemSegMap, extending SegMap into a segment based mapping framework able to also leverage color and semantic data from the environment to improve localization accuracy and robustness. In particular, we present new segmentation and descriptor extraction processes. The segmentation process benefits from additional distance information from color and semantic class consistency resulting in more repeatable segments and more overlap after re-visiting a place. For the descriptor, a tight fusion approach in a deep-learned descriptor extraction network is performed leading to a higher descriptiveness for landmark matching. We demonstrate the advantages of this fusion on multiple simulated and real-world datasets and compare its performance to various baselines. We show that we are able to find 50.9% more high-accuracy prior-less global localizations compared to SegMap on challenging datasets using very compact maps while also providing accurate full 6 DoF pose estimates in real-time."
Dynamic Neural Representational Decoders for High-Resolution Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation requires per-pixel prediction for a given image. Typically, the output resolution of a segmentation network is severely reduced due to the downsampling operations in the CNN backbone. Most previous methods employ upsampling decoders to recover the spatial resolution. Various decoders were designed in the literature. Here, we propose a novel decoder, termed dynamic neural representational decoder (NRD), which is simple yet significantly more efficient. As each location on the encoder's output corresponds to a local patch of the semantic labels, in this work, we represent these local patches of labels with compact neural networks. This neural representation enables our decoder to leverage the smoothness prior in the semantic label space, and thus makes our decoder more efficient. Furthermore, these neural representations are dynamically generated and conditioned on the outputs of the encoder networks. The desired semantic labels can be efficiently decoded from the neural representations, resulting in high-resolution semantic segmentation predictions. We empirically show that our proposed decoder can outperform the decoder in DeeplabV3+ with only 30% computational complexity, and achieve competitive performance with the methods using dilated encoders with only 15% computation. Experiments on the Cityscapes, ADE20K, and PASCAL Context datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method."
ADeLA: Automatic Dense Labeling with Attention for Viewpoint Adaptation in Semantic Segmentation,"We describe an unsupervised domain adaptation method for image content shift caused by viewpoint changes for a semantic segmentation task. Most existing methods perform domain alignment in a shared space and assume that the mapping from the aligned space to the output is transferable. However, the novel content induced by viewpoint changes may nullify such a space for effective alignments, thus resulting in negative adaptation. Our method works without aligning any statistics of the images between the two domains. Instead, it utilizes a view transformation network trained only on color images to hallucinate the semantic images for the target. Despite the lack of supervision, the view transformation network can still generalize to semantic images thanks to the inductive bias introduced by the attention mechanism. Furthermore, to resolve ambiguities in converting the semantic images to semantic labels, we treat the view transformation network as a functional representation of an unknown mapping implied by the color images and propose functional label hallucination to generate pseudo-labels in the target domain. Our method surpasses baselines built on state-of-the-art correspondence estimation and view synthesis methods. Moreover, it outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation methods that utilize self-training and adversarial domain alignment. Our code and dataset will be made publicly available."
A Unified Efficient Pyramid Transformer for Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation is a challenging problem due to difficulties in modeling context in complex scenes and class confusions along boundaries. Most literature either focuses on context modeling or boundary refinement, which is less generalizable in open-world scenarios. In this work, we advocate a unified framework(UN-EPT) to segment objects by considering both context information and boundary artifacts. We first adapt a sparse sampling strategy to incorporate the transformer-based attention mechanism for efficient context modeling. In addition, a separate spatial branch is introduced to capture image details for boundary refinement. The whole model can be trained in an end-to-end manner. We demonstrate promising performance on three popular benchmarks for semantic segmentation with low memory footprint. Code will be released soon."
Personalized Image Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation models trained on public datasets have achieved great success in recent years. However, these models didn't consider the personalization issue of segmentation though it is important in practice. In this paper, we address the problem of personalized image segmentation. The objective is to generate more accurate segmentation results on unlabeled personalized images by investigating the data's personalized traits. To open up future research in this area, we collect a large dataset containing various users' personalized images called PIS (Personalized Image Semantic Segmentation). We also survey some recent researches related to this problem and report their performance on our dataset. Furthermore, by observing the correlation among a user's personalized images, we propose a baseline method that incorporates the inter-image context when segmenting certain images. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms the existing methods on the proposed dataset. The code and the PIS dataset will be made publicly available."
VMNet: Voxel-Mesh Network for Geodesic-Aware 3D Semantic Segmentation,"In recent years, sparse voxel-based methods have become the state-of-the-arts for 3D semantic segmentation of indoor scenes, thanks to the powerful 3D CNNs. Nevertheless, being oblivious to the underlying geometry, voxel-based methods suffer from ambiguous features on spatially close objects and struggle with handling complex and irregular geometries due to the lack of geodesic information. In view of this, we present Voxel-Mesh Network (VMNet), a novel 3D deep architecture that operates on the voxel and mesh representations leveraging both the Euclidean and geodesic information. Intuitively, the Euclidean information extracted from voxels can offer contextual cues representing interactions between nearby objects, while the geodesic information extracted from meshes can help separate objects that are spatially close but have disconnected surfaces. To incorporate such information from the two domains, we design an intra-domain attentive module for effective feature aggregation and an inter-domain attentive module for adaptive feature fusion. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of VMNet: specifically, on the challenging ScanNet dataset for large-scale segmentation of indoor scenes, it outperforms the state-of-the-art SparseConvNet and MinkowskiNet (74.6% vs 72.5% and 73.6% in mIoU) with a simpler network structure (17M vs 30M and 38M parameters). Code release: https://github.com/hzykent/VMNet"
CI-Net: Contextual Information for Joint Semantic Segmentation and Depth Estimation,"Monocular depth estimation and semantic segmentation are two fundamental goals of scene understanding. Due to the advantages of task interaction, many works study the joint task learning algorithm. However, most existing methods fail to fully leverage the semantic labels, ignoring the provided context structures and only using them to supervise the prediction of segmentation split, which limit the performance of both tasks. In this paper, we propose a network injected with contextual information (CI-Net) to solve the problem. Specifically, we introduce self-attention block in the encoder to generate attention map. With supervision from the ideal attention map created by semantic label, the network is embedded with contextual information so that it could understand scene better and utilize correlated features to make accurate prediction. Besides, a feature sharing module is constructed to make the task-specific features deeply fused and a consistency loss is devised to make the features mutually guided. We evaluate the proposed CI-Net on the NYU-Depth-v2 and SUN-RGBD datasets. The experimental results validate that our proposed CI-Net could effectively improve the accuracy of semantic segmentation and depth estimation."
Segmentation in Style: Unsupervised Semantic Image Segmentation with Stylegan and CLIP,"We introduce a method that allows to automatically segment images into semantically meaningful regions without human supervision. Derived regions are consistent across different images and coincide with human-defined semantic classes on some datasets. In cases where semantic regions might be hard for human to define and consistently label, our method is still able to find meaningful and consistent semantic classes. In our work, we use pretrained StyleGAN2 generative model: clustering in the feature space of the generative model allows to discover semantic classes. Once classes are discovered, a synthetic dataset with generated images and corresponding segmentation masks can be created. After that a segmentation model is trained on the synthetic dataset and is able to generalize to real images. Additionally, by using CLIP we are able to use prompts defined in a natural language to discover some desired semantic classes. We test our method on publicly available datasets and show state-of-the-art results."
Leveraging Auxiliary Tasks with Affinity Learning for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation is a challenging task in the absence of densely labelled data. Only relying on class activation maps (CAM) with image-level labels provides deficient segmentation supervision. Prior works thus consider pre-trained models to produce coarse saliency maps to guide the generation of pseudo segmentation labels. However, the commonly used off-line heuristic generation process cannot fully exploit the benefits of these coarse saliency maps. Motivated by the significant inter-task correlation, we propose a novel weakly supervised multi-task framework termed as AuxSegNet, to leverage saliency detection and multi-label image classification as auxiliary tasks to improve the primary task of semantic segmentation using only image-level ground-truth labels. Inspired by their similar structured semantics, we also propose to learn a cross-task global pixel-level affinity map from the saliency and segmentation representations. The learned cross-task affinity can be used to refine saliency predictions and propagate CAM maps to provide improved pseudo labels for both tasks. The mutual boost between pseudo label updating and cross-task affinity learning enables iterative improvements on segmentation performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed auxiliary learning network structure and the cross-task affinity learning method. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art weakly supervised segmentation performance on the challenging PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO benchmarks."
ReDAL: Region-based and Diversity-aware Active Learning for Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation,"Despite the success of deep learning on supervised point cloud semantic segmentation, obtaining large-scale point-by-point manual annotations is still a significant challenge. To reduce the huge annotation burden, we propose a Region-based and Diversity-aware Active Learning (ReDAL), a general framework for many deep learning approaches, aiming to automatically select only informative and diverse sub-scene regions for label acquisition. Observing that only a small portion of annotated regions are sufficient for 3D scene understanding with deep learning, we use softmax entropy, color discontinuity, and structural complexity to measure the information of sub-scene regions. A diversity-aware selection algorithm is also developed to avoid redundant annotations resulting from selecting informative but similar regions in a querying batch. Extensive experiments show that our method highly outperforms previous active learning strategies, and we achieve the performance of 90% fully supervised learning, while less than 15% and 5% annotations are required on S3DIS and SemanticKITTI datasets, respectively. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/tsunghan-wu/ReDAL."
Semantic Attention and Scale Complementary Network for Instance Segmentation in Remote Sensing Images,"In this paper, we focus on the challenging multicategory instance segmentation problem in remote sensing images (RSIs), which aims at predicting the categories of all instances and localizing them with pixel-level masks. Although many landmark frameworks have demonstrated promising performance in instance segmentation, the complexity in the background and scale variability instances still remain challenging for instance segmentation of RSIs. To address the above problems, we propose an end-to-end multi-category instance segmentation model, namely Semantic Attention and Scale Complementary Network, which mainly consists of a Semantic Attention (SEA) module and a Scale Complementary Mask Branch (SCMB). The SEA module contains a simple fully convolutional semantic segmentation branch with extra supervision to strengthen the activation of interest instances on the feature map and reduce the background noise's interference. To handle the under-segmentation of geospatial instances with large varying scales, we design the SCMB that extends the original single mask branch to trident mask branches and introduces complementary mask supervision at different scales to sufficiently leverage the multi-scale information. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method on the iSAID dataset and the NWPU Instance Segmentation dataset and achieve promising performance."
Re-distributing Biased Pseudo Labels for Semi-supervised Semantic Segmentation: A Baseline Investigation,"While self-training has advanced semi-supervised semantic segmentation, it severely suffers from the long-tailed class distribution on real-world semantic segmentation datasets that make the pseudo-labeled data bias toward majority classes. In this paper, we present a simple and yet effective Distribution Alignment and Random Sampling (DARS) method to produce unbiased pseudo labels that match the true class distribution estimated from the labeled data. Besides, we also contribute a progressive data augmentation and labeling strategy to facilitate model training with pseudo-labeled data. Experiments on both Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC 2012 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Albeit simple, our method performs favorably in comparison with state-of-the-art approaches. Code will be available at https://github.com/CVMI-Lab/DARS."
Dense Supervision Propagation for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation on 3D Point Clouds,"Semantic segmentation on 3D point clouds is an important task for 3D scene understanding. While dense labeling on 3D data is expensive and time-consuming, only a few works address weakly supervised semantic point cloud segmentation methods to relieve the labeling cost by learning from simpler and cheaper labels. Meanwhile, there are still huge performance gaps between existing weakly supervised methods and state-of-the-art fully supervised methods. In this paper, we train a semantic point cloud segmentation network with only a small portion of points being labeled. We argue that we can better utilize the limited supervision information as we densely propagate the supervision signal from the labeled points to other points within and across the input samples. Specifically, we propose a cross-sample feature reallocating module to transfer similar features and therefore re-route the gradients across two samples with common classes and an intra-sample feature redistribution module to propagate supervision signals on unlabeled points across and within point cloud samples. We conduct extensive experiments on public datasets S3DIS and ScanNet. Our weakly supervised method with only 10\% and 1\% of labels can produce compatible results with the fully supervised counterpart."
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Video Semantic Segmentation,"Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for semantic segmentation has gained immense popularity since it can transfer knowledge from simulation to real (Sim2Real) by largely cutting out the laborious per pixel labeling efforts at real. In this work, we present a new video extension of this task, namely Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Video Semantic Segmentation. As it became easy to obtain large-scale video labels through simulation, we believe attempting to maximize Sim2Real knowledge transferability is one of the promising directions for resolving the fundamental data-hungry issue in the video. To tackle this new problem, we present a novel two-phase adaptation scheme. In the first step, we exhaustively distill source domain knowledge using supervised loss functions. Simultaneously, video adversarial training (VAT) is employed to align the features from source to target utilizing video context. In the second step, we apply video self-training (VST), focusing only on the target data. To construct robust pseudo labels, we exploit the temporal information in the video, which has been rarely explored in the previous image-based self-training approaches. We set strong baseline scores on 'VIPER to CityscapeVPS' adaptation scenario. We show that our proposals significantly outperform previous image-based UDA methods both on image-level (mIoU) and video-level (VPQ) evaluation metrics."
AUGCO: Augmentation Consistency-guided Self-training for Source-free Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation,"Most modern approaches for domain adaptive semantic segmentation rely on continued access to source data during adaptation, which may be infeasible due to computational or privacy constraints. We focus on source-free domain adaptation for semantic segmentation, wherein a source model must adapt itself to a new target domain given only unlabeled target data. We propose Augmentation Consistency-guided Self-training (AUGCO), a source-free adaptation algorithm that uses the model's pixel-level predictive consistency across diverse, automatically generated views of each target image along with model confidence to identify reliable pixel predictions, and selectively self-trains on those. AUGCO achieves state-of-the-art results for source-free adaptation on 3 standard benchmarks for semantic segmentation, all within a simple to implement and fast to converge method."
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation in LiDAR Semantic Segmentation with Self-Supervision and Gated Adapters,"In this paper, we focus on a less explored, but more realistic and complex problem of domain adaptation in LiDAR semantic segmentation. There is a significant drop in performance of an existing segmentation model when training (source domain) and testing (target domain) data originate from different LiDAR sensors. To overcome this shortcoming, we propose an unsupervised domain adaptation framework that leverages unlabeled target domain data for self-supervision, coupled with an unpaired mask transfer strategy to mitigate the impact of domain shifts. Furthermore, we introduce the gated adapter module with a small number of parameters into the network to account for target domain-specific information. Experiments adapting from both real-to-real and synthetic-to-real LiDAR semantic segmentation benchmarks demonstrate the significant improvement over prior arts."
DSP: Dual Soft-Paste for Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation,"Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for semantic segmentation aims to adapt a segmentation model trained on the labeled source domain to the unlabeled target domain. Existing methods try to learn domain invariant features while suffering from large domain gaps that make it difficult to correctly align discrepant features, especially in the initial training phase. To address this issue, we propose a novel Dual Soft-Paste (DSP) method in this paper. Specifically, DSP selects some classes from a source domain image using a long-tail class first sampling strategy and softly pastes the corresponding image patch on both the source and target training images with a fusion weight. Technically, we adopt the mean teacher framework for domain adaptation, where the pasted source and target images go through the student network while the original target image goes through the teacher network. Output-level alignment is carried out by aligning the probability maps of the target fused image from both networks using a weighted cross-entropy loss. In addition, feature-level alignment is carried out by aligning the feature maps of the source and target images from student network using a weighted maximum mean discrepancy loss. DSP facilitates the model learning domain-invariant features from the intermediate domains, leading to faster convergence and better performance. Experiments on two challenging benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DSP over state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/GaoLii/DSP}."
Protecting Semantic Segmentation Models by Using Block-wise Image Encryption with Secret Key from Unauthorized Access,"Since production-level trained deep neural networks (DNNs) are of a great business value, protecting such DNN models against copyright infringement and unauthorized access is in a rising demand. However, conventional model protection methods focused only the image classification task, and these protection methods were never applied to semantic segmentation although it has an increasing number of applications. In this paper, we propose to protect semantic segmentation models from unauthorized access by utilizing block-wise transformation with a secret key for the first time. Protected models are trained by using transformed images. Experiment results show that the proposed protection method allows rightful users with the correct key to access the model to full capacity and deteriorate the performance for unauthorized users. However, protected models slightly drop the segmentation performance compared to non-protected models."
Double Similarity Distillation for Semantic Image Segmentation,"The balance between high accuracy and high speed has always been a challenging task in semantic image segmentation. Compact segmentation networks are more widely used in the case of limited resources, while their performances are constrained. In this paper, motivated by the residual learning and global aggregation, we propose a simple yet general and effective knowledge distillation framework called double similarity distillation (DSD) to improve the classification accuracy of all existing compact networks by capturing the similarity knowledge in pixel and category dimensions, respectively. Specifically, we propose a pixel-wise similarity distillation (PSD) module that utilizes residual attention maps to capture more detailed spatial dependencies across multiple layers. Compared with exiting methods, the PSD module greatly reduces the amount of calculation and is easy to expand. Furthermore, considering the differences in characteristics between semantic segmentation task and other computer vision tasks, we propose a category-wise similarity distillation (CSD) module, which can help the compact segmentation network strengthen the global category correlation by constructing the correlation matrix. Combining these two modules, DSD framework has no extra parameters and only a minimal increase in FLOPs. Extensive experiments on four challenging datasets, including Cityscapes, CamVid, ADE20K, and Pascal VOC 2012, show that DSD outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, proving its effectiveness and generality. The code and models will be publicly available."
Woodscape Fisheye Semantic Segmentation for Autonomous Driving -- CVPR 2021 OmniCV Workshop Challenge,"We present the WoodScape fisheye semantic segmentation challenge for autonomous driving which was held as part of the CVPR 2021 Workshop on Omnidirectional Computer Vision (OmniCV). This challenge is one of the first opportunities for the research community to evaluate the semantic segmentation techniques targeted for fisheye camera perception. Due to strong radial distortion standard models don't generalize well to fisheye images and hence the deformations in the visual appearance of objects and entities needs to be encoded implicitly or as explicit knowledge. This challenge served as a medium to investigate the challenges and new methodologies to handle the complexities with perception on fisheye images. The challenge was hosted on CodaLab and used the recently released WoodScape dataset comprising of 10k samples. In this paper, we provide a summary of the competition which attracted the participation of 71 global teams and a total of 395 submissions. The top teams recorded significantly improved mean IoU and accuracy scores over the baseline PSPNet with ResNet-50 backbone. We summarize the methods of winning algorithms and analyze the failure cases. We conclude by providing future directions for the research."
Synthesis in Style: Semantic Segmentation of Historical Documents using Synthetic Data,"One of the most pressing problems in the automated analysis of historical documents is the availability of annotated training data. The problem is that labeling samples is a time-consuming task because it requires human expertise and thus, cannot be automated well. In this work, we propose a novel method to construct synthetic labeled datasets for historical documents where no annotations are available. We train a StyleGAN model to synthesize document images that capture the core features of the original documents. While originally, the StyleGAN architecture was not intended to produce labels, it indirectly learns the underlying semantics to generate realistic images. Using our approach, we can extract the semantic information from the intermediate feature maps and use it to generate ground truth labels. To investigate if our synthetic dataset can be used to segment the text in historical documents, we use it to train multiple supervised segmentation models and evaluate their performance. We also train these models on another dataset created by a state-of-the-art synthesis approach to show that the models trained on our dataset achieve better results while requiring even less human annotation effort."
Per-Pixel Classification is Not All You Need for Semantic Segmentation,"Modern approaches typically formulate semantic segmentation as a per-pixel classification task, while instance-level segmentation is handled with an alternative mask classification. Our key insight: mask classification is sufficiently general to solve both semantic- and instance-level segmentation tasks in a unified manner using the exact same model, loss, and training procedure. Following this observation, we propose MaskFormer, a simple mask classification model which predicts a set of binary masks, each associated with a single global class label prediction. Overall, the proposed mask classification-based method simplifies the landscape of effective approaches to semantic and panoptic segmentation tasks and shows excellent empirical results. In particular, we observe that MaskFormer outperforms per-pixel classification baselines when the number of classes is large. Our mask classification-based method outperforms both current state-of-the-art semantic (55.6 mIoU on ADE20K) and panoptic segmentation (52.7 PQ on COCO) models."
Transfer Learning from Synthetic to Real LiDAR Point Cloud for Semantic Segmentation,"Knowledge transfer from synthetic to real data has been widely studied to mitigate data annotation constraints in various computer vision tasks such as semantic segmentation. However, the study focused on 2D images and its counterpart in 3D point clouds segmentation lags far behind due to the lack of large-scale synthetic datasets and effective transfer methods. We address this issue by collecting SynLiDAR, a large-scale synthetic LiDAR dataset that contains point-wise annotated point clouds with accurate geometric shapes and comprehensive semantic classes. SynLiDAR was collected from multiple virtual environments with rich scenes and layouts which consists of over 19 billion points of 32 semantic classes. In addition, we design PCT, a novel point cloud translator that effectively mitigates the gap between synthetic and real point clouds. Specifically, we decompose the synthetic-to-real gap into an appearance component and a sparsity component and handle them separately which improves the point cloud translation greatly. We conducted extensive experiments over three transfer learning setups including data augmentation, semi-supervised domain adaptation and unsupervised domain adaptation. Extensive experiments show that SynLiDAR provides a high-quality data source for studying 3D transfer and the proposed PCT achieves superior point cloud translation consistently across the three setups.

End-to-end Trainable Deep Neural Network for Robotic Grasp Detection and Semantic Segmentation from RGB,"In this work, we introduce a novel, end-to-end trainable CNN-based architecture to deliver high quality results for grasp detection suitable for a parallel-plate gripper, and semantic segmentation. Utilizing this, we propose a novel refinement module that takes advantage of previously calculated grasp detection and semantic segmentation and further increases grasp detection accuracy. Our proposed network delivers state-of-the-art accuracy on two popular grasp dataset, namely Cornell and Jacquard. As additional contribution, we provide a novel dataset extension for the OCID dataset, making it possible to evaluate grasp detection in highly challenging scenes. Using this dataset, we show that semantic segmentation can additionally be used to assign grasp candidates to object classes, which can be used to pick specific objects in the scene."
Semantic Segmentation on Multiple Visual Domains,"Semantic segmentation models only perform well on the domain they are trained on and datasets for training are scarce and often have a small label-spaces, because the pixel level annotations required are expensive to make. Thus training models on multiple existing domains is desired to increase the output label-space. Current research shows that there is potential to improve accuracy across datasets by using multi-domain training, but this has not yet been successfully extended to datasets of three different non-overlapping domains without manual labelling. In this paper a method for this is proposed for the datasets Cityscapes, SUIM and SUN RGB-D, by creating a label-space that spans all classes of the datasets. Duplicate classes are merged and discrepant granularity is solved by keeping classes separate. Results show that accuracy of the multi-domain model has higher accuracy than all baseline models together, if hardware performance is equalized, as resources are not limitless, showing that models benefit from additional data even from domains that have nothing in common."
Superpoint-guided Semi-supervised Semantic Segmentation of 3D Point Clouds,"3D point cloud semantic segmentation is a challenging topic in the computer vision field. Most of the existing methods in literature require a large amount of fully labeled training data, but it is extremely time-consuming to obtain these training data by manually labeling massive point clouds. Addressing this problem, we propose a superpoint-guided semi-supervised segmentation network for 3D point clouds, which jointly utilizes a small portion of labeled scene point clouds and a large number of unlabeled point clouds for network training. The proposed network is iteratively updated with its predicted pseudo labels, where a superpoint generation module is introduced for extracting superpoints from 3D point clouds, and a pseudo-label optimization module is explored for automatically assigning pseudo labels to the unlabeled points under the constraint of the extracted superpoints. Additionally, there are some 3D points without pseudo-label supervision. We propose an edge prediction module to constrain features of edge points. A superpoint feature aggregation module and a superpoint feature consistency loss function are introduced to smooth superpoint features. Extensive experimental results on two 3D public datasets demonstrate that our method can achieve better performance than several state-of-the-art point cloud segmentation networks and several popular semi-supervised segmentation methods with few labeled scenes."
Hierarchical Semantic Segmentation using Psychometric Learning,"Assigning meaning to parts of image data is the goal of semantic image segmentation. Machine learning methods, specifically supervised learning is commonly used in a variety of tasks formulated as semantic segmentation. One of the major challenges in the supervised learning approaches is expressing and collecting the rich knowledge that experts have with respect to the meaning present in the image data. Towards this, typically a fixed set of labels is specified and experts are tasked with annotating the pixels, patches or segments in the images with the given labels. In general, however, the set of classes does not fully capture the rich semantic information present in the images. For example, in medical imaging such as histology images, the different parts of cells could be grouped and sub-grouped based on the expertise of the pathologist.  To achieve such a precise semantic representation of the concepts in the image, we need access to the full depth of knowledge of the annotator. In this work, we develop a novel approach to collect segmentation annotations from experts based on psychometric testing. Our method consists of the psychometric testing procedure, active query selection, query enhancement, and a deep metric learning model to achieve a patch-level image embedding that allows for semantic segmentation of images. We show the merits of our method with evaluation on the synthetically generated image, aerial image and histology image."
HIDA: Towards Holistic Indoor Understanding for the Visually Impaired via Semantic Instance Segmentation with a Wearable Solid-State LiDAR Sensor,"Independently exploring unknown spaces or finding objects in an indoor environment is a daily but challenging task for visually impaired people. However, common 2D assistive systems lack depth relationships between various objects, resulting in difficulty to obtain accurate spatial layout and relative positions of objects. To tackle these issues, we propose HIDA, a lightweight assistive system based on 3D point cloud instance segmentation with a solid-state LiDAR sensor, for holistic indoor detection and avoidance. Our entire system consists of three hardware components, two interactive functions~(obstacle avoidance and object finding) and a voice user interface. Based on voice guidance, the point cloud from the most recent state of the changing indoor environment is captured through an on-site scanning performed by the user. In addition, we design a point cloud segmentation model with dual lightweight decoders for semantic and offset predictions, which satisfies the efficiency of the whole system. After the 3D instance segmentation, we post-process the segmented point cloud by removing outliers and projecting all points onto a top-view 2D map representation. The system integrates the information above and interacts with users intuitively by acoustic feedback. The proposed 3D instance segmentation model has achieved state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet v2 dataset. Comprehensive field tests with various tasks in a user study verify the usability and effectiveness of our system for assisting visually impaired people in holistic indoor understanding, obstacle avoidance and object search."
GA-NET: Global Attention Network for Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation,"How to learn long-range dependencies from 3D point clouds is a challenging problem in 3D point cloud analysis. Addressing this problem, we propose a global attention network for point cloud semantic segmentation, named as GA-Net, consisting of a point-independent global attention module and a point-dependent global attention module for obtaining contextual information of 3D point clouds in this paper. The point-independent global attention module simply shares a global attention map for all 3D points. In the point-dependent global attention module, for each point, a novel random cross attention block using only two randomly sampled subsets is exploited to learn the contextual information of all the points. Additionally, we design a novel point-adaptive aggregation block to replace linear skip connection for aggregating more discriminate features. Extensive experimental results on three 3D public datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in most cases."
WeClick: Weakly-Supervised Video Semantic Segmentation with Click Annotations,"Compared with tedious per-pixel mask annotating, it is much easier to annotate data by clicks, which costs only several seconds for an image. However, applying clicks to learn video semantic segmentation model has not been explored before. In this work, we propose an effective weakly-supervised video semantic segmentation pipeline with click annotations, called WeClick, for saving laborious annotating effort by segmenting an instance of the semantic class with only a single click. Since detailed semantic information is not captured by clicks, directly training with click labels leads to poor segmentation predictions. To mitigate this problem, we design a novel memory flow knowledge distillation strategy to exploit temporal information (named memory flow) in abundant unlabeled video frames, by distilling the neighboring predictions to the target frame via estimated motion. Moreover, we adopt vanilla knowledge distillation for model compression. In this case, WeClick learns compact video semantic segmentation models with the low-cost click annotations during the training phase yet achieves real-time and accurate models during the inference period. Experimental results on Cityscapes and Camvid show that WeClick outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, increases performance by 10.24% mIoU than baseline, and achieves real-time execution."
Semantic Segmentation Alternative Technique: Segmentation Domain Generation,"Detecting objects of interest in images was always a compelling task to automate. In recent years this task was more and more explored using deep learning techniques, mostly using region-based convolutional networks. In this project we propose an alternative semantic segmentation technique making use of Generative Adversarial Networks. We consider semantic segmentation to be a domain transfer problem. Thus, we train a feed forward network (FFNN) to receive as input a seed real image and generate as output its segmentation mask."
Learning Semantic Segmentation of Large-Scale Point Clouds with Random Sampling,"We study the problem of efficient semantic segmentation of large-scale 3D point clouds. By relying on expensive sampling techniques or computationally heavy pre/post-processing steps, most existing approaches are only able to be trained and operate over small-scale point clouds. In this paper, we introduce RandLA-Net, an efficient and lightweight neural architecture to directly infer per-point semantics for large-scale point clouds. The key to our approach is to use random point sampling instead of more complex point selection approaches. Although remarkably computation and memory efficient, random sampling can discard key features by chance. To overcome this, we introduce a novel local feature aggregation module to progressively increase the receptive field for each 3D point, thereby effectively preserving geometric details. Comparative experiments show that our RandLA-Net can process 1 million points in a single pass up to 200x faster than existing approaches. Moreover, extensive experiments on five large-scale point cloud datasets, including Semantic3D, SemanticKITTI, Toronto3D, NPM3D and S3DIS, demonstrate the state-of-the-art semantic segmentation performance of our RandLA-Net."
Similarity-Aware Fusion Network for 3D Semantic Segmentation,"In this paper, we propose a similarity-aware fusion network (SAFNet) to adaptively fuse 2D images and 3D point clouds for 3D semantic segmentation. Existing fusion-based methods achieve remarkable performances by integrating information from multiple modalities. However, they heavily rely on the correspondence between 2D pixels and 3D points by projection and can only perform the information fusion in a fixed manner, and thus their performances cannot be easily migrated to a more realistic scenario where the collected data often lack strict pair-wise features for prediction. To address this, we employ a late fusion strategy where we first learn the geometric and contextual similarities between the input and back-projected (from 2D pixels) point clouds and utilize them to guide the fusion of two modalities to further exploit complementary information. Specifically, we employ a geometric similarity module (GSM) to directly compare the spatial coordinate distributions of pair-wise 3D neighborhoods, and a contextual similarity module (CSM) to aggregate and compare spatial contextual information of corresponding central points. The two proposed modules can effectively measure how much image features can help predictions, enabling the network to adaptively adjust the contributions of two modalities to the final prediction of each point. Experimental results on the ScanNetV2 benchmark demonstrate that SAFNet significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art fusion-based approaches across various data integrity."
Deep Semantic Segmentation at the Edge for Autonomous Navigation in Vineyard Rows,"Precision agriculture is a fast-growing field that aims at introducing affordable and effective automation into agricultural processes. Nowadays, algorithmic solutions for navigation in vineyards require expensive sensors and high computational workloads that preclude large-scale applicability of autonomous robotic platforms in real business case scenarios. From this perspective, our novel proposed control leverages the latest advancement in machine perception and edge AI techniques to achieve highly affordable and reliable navigation inside vineyard rows with low computational and power consumption. Indeed, using a custom-trained segmentation network and a low-range RGB-D camera, we are able to take advantage of the semantic information of the environment to produce smooth trajectories and stable control in different vineyards scenarios. Moreover, the segmentation maps generated by the control algorithm itself could be directly exploited as filters for a vegetative assessment of the crop status. Extensive experimentations and evaluations against real-world data and simulated environments demonstrated the effectiveness and intrinsic robustness of our methodology."
Aerial Map-Based Navigation Using Semantic Segmentation and Pattern Matching,"This paper proposes a novel approach to map-based navigation system for unmanned aircraft. The proposed system attempts label-to-label matching, not image-to-image matching, between aerial images and a map database. The ground objects can be labelled by deep learning approaches and the configuration of the objects is used to find the corresponding location in the map database. The use of the deep learning technique as a tool for extracting high-level features reduces the image-based localization problem to a pattern matching problem. This paper proposes a pattern matching algorithm that does not require altitude information or a camera model to estimate the absolute horizontal position. The feasibility analysis with simulated images shows the proposed map-based navigation can be realized with the proposed pattern matching algorithm and it is able to provide positions given the labelled objects."
Language-Level Semantics Conditioned 3D Point Cloud Segmentation,"In this work, a language-level Semantics Conditioned framework for 3D Point cloud segmentation, called SeCondPoint, is proposed, where language-level semantics are introduced to condition the modeling of point feature distribution as well as the pseudo-feature generation, and a feature-geometry-based mixup approach is further proposed to facilitate the distribution learning. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt in literature to introduce language-level semantics to the 3D point cloud segmentation task. Since a large number of point features could be generated from the learned distribution thanks to the semantics conditioned modeling, any existing segmentation network could be embedded into the proposed framework to boost its performance. In addition, the proposed framework has the inherent advantage of dealing with novel classes, which seems an impossible feat for the current segmentation networks. Extensive experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate that three typical segmentation networks could achieve significant improvements over their original performances after enhancement by the proposed framework in the conventional 3D segmentation task. Two benchmarks are also introduced for a newly introduced zero-shot 3D segmentation task, and the results also validate the proposed framework."
MASS: Multi-Attentional Semantic Segmentation of LiDAR Data for Dense Top-View Understanding,"At the heart of all automated driving systems is the ability to sense the surroundings, e.g., through semantic segmentation of LiDAR sequences, which experienced a remarkable progress due to the release of large datasets such as SemanticKITTI and nuScenes-LidarSeg. While most previous works focus on sparse segmentation of the LiDAR input, dense output masks provide self-driving cars with almost complete environment information. In this paper, we introduce MASS - a Multi-Attentional Semantic Segmentation model specifically built for dense top-view understanding of the driving scenes. Our framework operates on pillar- and occupancy features and comprises three attention-based building blocks: (1) a keypoint-driven graph attention, (2) an LSTM-based attention computed from a vector embedding of the spatial input, and (3) a pillar-based attention, resulting in a dense 360-degree segmentation mask. With extensive experiments on both, SemanticKITTI and nuScenes-LidarSeg, we quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, outperforming the state of the art by 19.0% on SemanticKITTI and reaching 30.4% in mIoU on nuScenes-LidarSeg, where MASS is the first work addressing the dense segmentation task. Furthermore, our multi-attention model is shown to be very effective for 3D object detection validated on the KITTI-3D dataset, showcasing its high generalizability to other tasks related to 3D vision."
Single-Step Adversarial Training for Semantic Segmentation,"Even though deep neural networks succeed on many different tasks including semantic segmentation, they lack on robustness against adversarial examples. To counteract this exploit, often adversarial training is used. However, it is known that adversarial training with weak adversarial attacks (e.g. using the Fast Gradient Method) does not improve the robustness against stronger attacks. Recent research shows that it is possible to increase the robustness of such single-step methods by choosing an appropriate step size during the training. Finding such a step size, without increasing the computational effort of single-step adversarial training, is still an open challenge. In this work we address the computationally particularly demanding task of semantic segmentation and propose a new step size control algorithm that increases the robustness of single-step adversarial training. The proposed algorithm does not increase the computational effort of single-step adversarial training considerably and also simplifies training, because it is free of meta-parameter. We show that the robustness of our approach can compete with multi-step adversarial training on two popular benchmarks for semantic segmentation."
Semantic Segmentation of Periocular Near-Infra-Red Eye Images Under Alcohol Effects,"This paper proposes a new framework to detect, segment, and estimate the localization of the eyes from a periocular Near-Infra-Red iris image under alcohol consumption. The purpose of the system is to measure the fitness for duty. Fitness systems allow us to determine whether a person is physically or psychologically able to perform their tasks. Our framework is based on an object detector trained from scratch to detect both eyes from a single image. Then, two efficient networks were used for semantic segmentation; a Criss-Cross attention network and DenseNet10, with only 122,514 and 210,732 parameters, respectively. These networks can find the pupil, iris, and sclera. In the end, the binary output eye mask is used for pupil and iris diameter estimation with high precision. Five state-of-the-art algorithms were used for this purpose. A mixed proposal reached the best results. A second contribution is establishing an alcohol behavior curve to detect the alcohol presence utilizing a stream of images captured from an iris instance. Also, a manually labeled database with more than 20k images was created. Our best method obtains a mean Intersection-over-Union of 94.54% with DenseNet10 with only 210,732 parameters and an error of only 1-pixel on average."
Looking Outside the Window: Wide-Context Transformer for the Semantic Segmentation of High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images,"Long-range contextual information is crucial for the semantic segmentation of High-Resolution (HR) Remote Sensing Images (RSIs). However, image cropping operations, commonly used for training neural networks, limit the perception of long-range contexts in large RSIs. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Wide-Context Network (WiCoNet) for the semantic segmentation of HR RSIs. Apart from extracting local features with a conventional CNN, the WiCoNet has an extra context branch to aggregate information from a larger image area. Moreover, we introduce a Context Transformer to embed contextual information from the context branch and selectively project it onto the local features. The Context Transformer extends the Vision Transformer, an emerging kind of neural network, to model the dual-branch semantic correlations. It overcomes the locality limitation of CNNs and enables the WiCoNet to see the bigger picture before segmenting the land-cover/land-use (LCLU) classes. Ablation studies and comparative experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In addition, we present a new Beijing Land-Use (BLU) dataset. This is a large-scale HR satellite dataset with high-quality and fine-grained reference labels, which can facilitate future studies in this field."
IMENet: Joint 3D Semantic Scene Completion and 2D Semantic Segmentation through Iterative Mutual Enhancement,"3D semantic scene completion and 2D semantic segmentation are two tightly correlated tasks that are both essential for indoor scene understanding, because they predict the same semantic classes, using positively correlated high-level features. Current methods use 2D features extracted from early-fused RGB-D images for 2D segmentation to improve 3D scene completion. We argue that this sequential scheme does not ensure these two tasks fully benefit each other, and present an Iterative Mutual Enhancement Network (IMENet) to solve them jointly, which interactively refines the two tasks at the late prediction stage. Specifically, two refinement modules are developed under a unified framework for the two tasks. The first is a 2D Deformable Context Pyramid (DCP) module, which receives the projection from the current 3D predictions to refine the 2D predictions. In turn, a 3D Deformable Depth Attention (DDA) module is proposed to leverage the reprojected results from 2D predictions to update the coarse 3D predictions. This iterative fusion happens to the stable high-level features of both tasks at a late stage. Extensive experiments on NYU and NYUCAD datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed iterative late fusion scheme, and our approach outperforms the state of the art on both 3D semantic scene completion and 2D semantic segmentation."
Tackling Catastrophic Forgetting and Background Shift in Continual Semantic Segmentation,"Deep learning approaches are nowadays ubiquitously used to tackle computer vision tasks such as semantic segmentation, requiring large datasets and substantial computational power. Continual learning for semantic segmentation (CSS) is an emerging trend that consists in updating an old model by sequentially adding new classes. However, continual learning methods are usually prone to catastrophic forgetting. This issue is further aggravated in CSS where, at each step, old classes from previous iterations are collapsed into the background. In this paper, we propose Local POD, a multi-scale pooling distillation scheme that preserves long- and short-range spatial relationships at feature level. Furthermore, we design an entropy-based pseudo-labelling of the background w.r.t. classes predicted by the old model to deal with background shift and avoid catastrophic forgetting of the old classes. Finally, we introduce a novel rehearsal method that is particularly suited for segmentation. Our approach, called PLOP, significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in existing CSS scenarios, as well as in newly proposed challenging benchmarks."
Perception-Aware Multi-Sensor Fusion for 3D LiDAR Semantic Segmentation,"3D LiDAR (light detection and ranging) semantic segmentation is important in scene understanding for many applications, such as auto-driving and robotics. For example, for autonomous cars equipped with RGB cameras and LiDAR, it is crucial to fuse complementary information from different sensors for robust and accurate segmentation. Existing fusion-based methods, however, may not achieve promising performance due to the vast difference between the two modalities. In this work, we investigate a collaborative fusion scheme called perception-aware multi-sensor fusion (PMF) to exploit perceptual information from two modalities, namely, appearance information from RGB images and spatio-depth information from point clouds. To this end, we first project point clouds to the camera coordinates to provide spatio-depth information for RGB images. Then, we propose a two-stream network to extract features from the two modalities, separately, and fuse the features by effective residual-based fusion modules. Moreover, we propose additional perception-aware losses to measure the perceptual difference between the two modalities. Extensive experiments on two benchmark data sets show the superiority of our method. For example, on nuScenes, our PMF outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 0.8 in mIoU."
Predicting Depth from Semantic Segmentation using Game Engine Dataset,"Depth perception is fundamental for robots to understand the surrounding environment. As the view of cognitive neuroscience, visual depth perception methods are divided into three categories, namely binocular, active, and pictorial. The first two categories have been studied for decades in detail. However, research for the exploration of the third category is still in its infancy and has got momentum by the advent of deep learning methods in recent years. In cognitive neuroscience, it is known that pictorial depth perception mechanisms are dependent on the perception of seen objects. Inspired by this fact, in this thesis, we investigated the relation of perception of objects and depth estimation convolutional neural networks. For this purpose, we developed new network structures based on a simple depth estimation network that only used a single image at its input. Our proposed structures use both an image and a semantic label of the image as their input. We used semantic labels as the output of object perception. The obtained results of performance comparison between the developed network and original network showed that our novel structures can improve the performance of depth estimation by 52\% of relative error of distance in the examined cases. Most of the experimental studies were carried out on synthetic datasets that were generated by game engines to isolate the performance comparison from the effect of inaccurate depth and semantic labels of non-synthetic datasets. It is shown that particular synthetic datasets may be used for training of depth networks in cases that an appropriate dataset is not available. Furthermore, we showed that in these cases, usage of semantic labels improves the robustness of the network against domain shift from synthetic training data to non-synthetic test data."
Striking the Right Balance: Recall Loss for Semantic Segmentation,"Class imbalance is a fundamental problem in computer vision applications such as semantic segmentation. Specifically, uneven class distributions in a training dataset often result in unsatisfactory performance on under-represented classes. Many works have proposed to weight the standard cross entropy loss function with pre-computed weights based on class statistics, such as the number of samples and class margins. There are two major drawbacks to these methods: 1) constantly up-weighting minority classes can introduce excessive false positives in semantic segmentation; 2) a minority class is not necessarily a hard class. The consequence is low precision due to excessive false positives. In this regard, we propose a hard-class mining loss by reshaping the vanilla cross entropy loss such that it weights the loss for each class dynamically based on instantaneous recall performance. We show that the novel recall loss changes gradually between the standard cross entropy loss and the inverse frequency weighted loss. Recall loss also leads to improved mean accuracy while offering competitive mean Intersection over Union (IoU) performance. On Synthia dataset, recall loss achieves 9\% relative improvement on mean accuracy with competitive mean IoU using DeepLab-ResNet18 compared to the cross entropy loss. Code available at https://github.com/PotatoTian/recall-semseg."
Semi-supervised Semantic Segmentation with Directional Context-aware Consistency,"Semantic segmentation has made tremendous progress in recent years. However, satisfying performance highly depends on a large number of pixel-level annotations. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on the semi-supervised segmentation problem where only a small set of labeled data is provided with a much larger collection of totally unlabeled images. Nevertheless, due to the limited annotations, models may overly rely on the contexts available in the training data, which causes poor generalization to the scenes unseen before. A preferred high-level representation should capture the contextual information while not losing self-awareness. Therefore, we propose to maintain the context-aware consistency between features of the same identity but with different contexts, making the representations robust to the varying environments. Moreover, we present the Directional Contrastive Loss (DC Loss) to accomplish the consistency in a pixel-to-pixel manner, only requiring the feature with lower quality to be aligned towards its counterpart. In addition, to avoid the false-negative samples and filter the uncertain positive samples, we put forward two sampling strategies. Extensive experiments show that our simple yet effective method surpasses current state-of-the-art methods by a large margin and also generalizes well with extra image-level annotations."
Transformer Meets Convolution: A Bilateral Awareness Network for Semantic Segmentation of Very Fine Resolution Urban Scene Images,"Semantic segmentation from very fine resolution (VFR) urban scene images plays a significant role in several application scenarios including autonomous driving, land cover classification, and urban planning, etc. However, the tremendous details contained in the VFR image, especially the considerable variations in scale and appearance of objects, severely limit the potential of the existing deep learning approaches. Addressing such issues represents a promising research field in the remote sensing community, which paves the way for scene-level landscape pattern analysis and decision making. In this paper, we propose a Bilateral Awareness Network which contains a dependency path and a texture path to fully capture the long-range relationships and fine-grained details in VFR images. Specifically, the dependency path is conducted based on the ResT, a novel Transformer backbone with memory-efficient multi-head self-attention, while the texture path is built on the stacked convolution operation. Besides, using the linear attention mechanism, a feature aggregation module is designed to effectively fuse the dependency features and texture features. Extensive experiments conducted on the three large-scale urban scene image segmentation datasets, i.e., ISPRS Vaihingen dataset, ISPRS Potsdam dataset, and UAVid dataset, demonstrate the effectiveness of our BANet. Specifically, a 64.6% mIoU is achieved on the UAVid dataset. Code is available at https://github.com/WangLibo1995/GeoSeg."
Exploiting Negative Learning for Implicit Pseudo Label Rectification in Source-Free Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation,"It is desirable to transfer the knowledge stored in a well-trained source model onto non-annotated target domain in the absence of source data. However, state-of-the-art methods for source free domain adaptation (SFDA) are subject to strict limits: 1) access to internal specifications of source models is a must; and 2) pseudo labels should be clean during self-training, making critical tasks relying on semantic segmentation unreliable. Aiming at these pitfalls, this study develops a domain adaptive solution to semantic segmentation with pseudo label rectification (namely \textit{PR-SFDA}), which operates in two phases: 1) \textit{Confidence-regularized unsupervised learning}: Maximum squares loss applies to regularize the target model to ensure the confidence in prediction; and 2) \textit{Noise-aware pseudo label learning}: Negative learning enables tolerance to noisy pseudo labels in training, meanwhile positive learning achieves fast convergence. Extensive experiments have been performed on domain adaptive semantic segmentation benchmark, \textit{GTA5 \to Cityscapes}. Overall, \textit{PR-SFDA} achieves a performance of 49.0 mIoU, which is very close to that of the state-of-the-art counterparts. Note that the latter demand accesses to the source model's internal specifications, whereas the \textit{PR-SFDA} solution needs none as a sharp contrast."
"Source Data-Free Cross-Domain Semantic Segmentation: Align, Teach and Propagate","Benefiting from considerable pixel-level annotations collected from a specific situation (source), the trained semantic segmentation model performs quite well but fails in a new situation (target). To mitigate the domain gap, previous cross-domain semantic segmentation methods always assume the co-existence of source data and target data during domain alignment. However, accessing source data in the real scenario may raise privacy concerns and violate intellectual property. To tackle this problem, we focus on an interesting and challenging cross-domain semantic segmentation task where only the trained source model is provided to the target domain. Specifically, we propose a unified framework called \textbf{ATP}, which consists of three schemes, i.e., feature \textbf{A}lignment, bidirectional \textbf{T}eaching, and information \textbf{P}ropagation. First, considering explicit alignment is infeasible due to no source data, we devise a curriculum-style entropy minimization objective to implicitly align the target features with unseen source features via the provided source model. Second, besides positive pseudo labels in vanilla self-training, we introduce negative pseudo labels to this field and develop a bidirectional self-training strategy to enhance the representation learning in the target domain. It is the first work to use negative pseudo labels during self-training for domain adaptation. Finally, the information propagation scheme is employed to further reduce the intra-domain discrepancy within the target domain via pseudo-semi-supervised learning, which is the first step by providing a simple and effective post-process for the domain adaptation field. Furthermore, we also extend the proposed to the more challenging black-box source-model scenario where only the source model's prediction is available."
SSUL: Semantic Segmentation with Unknown Label for Exemplar-based Class-Incremental Learning,"This paper introduces a solid state-of-the-art baseline for a class-incremental semantic segmentation (CISS) problem. While the recent CISS algorithms utilize variants of the knowledge distillation (KD) technique to tackle the problem, they failed to fully address the critical challenges in CISS causing the catastrophic forgetting; the semantic drift of the background class and the multi-label prediction issue. To better address these challenges, we propose a new method, dubbed SSUL-M (Semantic Segmentation with Unknown Label with Memory), by carefully combining techniques tailored for semantic segmentation. Specifically, we claim three main contributions. (1) defining unknown classes within the background class to help to learn future classes (help plasticity), (2) freezing backbone network and past classifiers with binary cross-entropy loss and pseudo-labeling to overcome catastrophic forgetting (help stability), and (3) utilizing tiny exemplar memory for the first time in CISS to improve both plasticity and stability. The extensively conducted experiments show the effectiveness of our method, achieving significantly better performance than the recent state-of-the-art baselines on the standard benchmark datasets. Furthermore, we justify our contributions with thorough ablation analyses and discuss different natures of the CISS problem compared to the traditional class-incremental learning targeting classification. The official code is available at https://github.com/clovaai/SSUL."
Global and Local Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning for Semantic Segmentation of HR Remote Sensing Images,"Supervised learning for semantic segmentation requires a large number of labeled samples, which is difficult to obtain in the field of remote sensing. Self-supervised learning (SSL), can be used to solve such problems by pre-training a general model with a large number of unlabeled images and then fine-tuning it on a downstream task with very few labeled samples. Contrastive learning is a typical method of SSL that can learn general invariant features. However, most existing contrastive learning methods are designed for classification tasks to obtain an image-level representation, which may be suboptimal for semantic segmentation tasks requiring pixel-level discrimination. Therefore, we propose a global style and local matching contrastive learning network (GLCNet) for remote sensing image semantic segmentation. Specifically, 1) the global style contrastive learning module is used to better learn an image-level representation, as we consider that style features can better represent the overall image features. 2) The local features matching contrastive learning module is designed to learn representations of local regions, which is beneficial for semantic segmentation. The experimental results show that our method mostly outperforms SOTA self-supervised methods and the ImageNet pre-training method. Specifically, with 1\% annotation from the original dataset, our approach improves Kappa by 6\% on the ISPRS Potsdam dataset relative to the existing baseline. Moreover, our method outperforms supervised learning methods when there are some differences between the datasets of upstream tasks and downstream tasks. Since SSL could directly learn the essential characteristics of data from unlabeled data, which is easy to obtain in the remote sensing field, this may be of great significance for tasks such as global mapping. The source code is available at https://github.com/GeoX-Lab/G-RSIM."
Towards Single Stage Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"The costly process of obtaining semantic segmentation labels has driven research towards weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) methods, using only image-level, point, or box labels. The lack of dense scene representation requires methods to increase complexity to obtain additional semantic information about the scene, often done through multiple stages of training and refinement. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models leverage image-level labels to produce class activation maps (CAMs) which go through multiple stages of refinement before they are thresholded to make pseudo-masks for supervision. The multi-stage approach is computationally expensive, and dependency on image-level labels for CAMs generation lacks generalizability to more complex scenes. In contrary, our method offers a single-stage approach generalizable to arbitrary dataset, that is trainable from scratch, without any dependency on pre-trained backbones, classification, or separate refinement tasks. We utilize point annotations to generate reliable, on-the-fly pseudo-masks through refined and filtered features. While our method requires point annotations that are only slightly more expensive than image-level annotations, we are to demonstrate SOTA performance on benchmark datasets (PascalVOC 2012), as well as significantly outperform other SOTA WSSS methods on recent real-world datasets (CRAID, CityPersons, IAD)."
Virtual Temporal Samples for Recurrent Neural Networks: applied to semantic segmentation in agriculture,"This paper explores the potential for performing temporal semantic segmentation in the context of agricultural robotics without temporally labelled data. We achieve this by proposing to generate virtual temporal samples from labelled still images. By exploiting the relatively static scene and assuming that the robot (camera) moves we are able to generate virtually labelled temporal sequences with no extra annotation effort. Normally, to train a recurrent neural network (RNN), labelled samples from a video (temporal) sequence are required which is laborious and has stymied work in this direction. By generating virtual temporal samples, we demonstrate that it is possible to train a lightweight RNN to perform semantic segmentation on two challenging agricultural datasets. Our results show that by training a temporal semantic segmenter using virtual samples we can increase the performance by an absolute amount of 4.6 and 4.9 on sweet pepper and sugar beet datasets, respectively. This indicates that our virtual data augmentation technique is able to accurately classify agricultural images temporally without the use of complicated synthetic data generation techniques nor with the overhead of labelling large amounts of temporal sequences."
Generating Data Augmentation samples for Semantic Segmentation of Salt Bodies in a Synthetic Seismic Image Dataset,"Nowadays, subsurface salt body localization and delineation, also called semantic segmentation of salt bodies, are among the most challenging geophysicist tasks. Thus, identifying large salt bodies is notoriously tricky and is crucial for identifying hydrocarbon reservoirs and drill path planning. This work proposes a Data Augmentation method based on training two generative models to augment the number of samples in a seismic image dataset for the semantic segmentation of salt bodies. Our method uses deep learning models to generate pairs of seismic image patches and their respective salt masks for the Data Augmentation. The first model is a Variational Autoencoder and is responsible for generating patches of salt body masks. The second is a Conditional Normalizing Flow model, which receives the generated masks as inputs and generates the associated seismic image patches. We evaluate the proposed method by comparing the performance of ten distinct state-of-the-art models for semantic segmentation, trained with and without the generated augmentations, in a dataset from two synthetic seismic images. The proposed methodology yields an average improvement of 8.57% in the IoU metric across all compared models. The best result is achieved by a DeeplabV3+ model variant, which presents an IoU score of 95.17% when trained with our augmentations. Additionally, our proposal outperformed six selected data augmentation methods, and the most significant improvement in the comparison, of 9.77%, is achieved by composing our DA with augmentations from an elastic transformation. At last, we show that the proposed method is adaptable for a larger context size by achieving results comparable to the obtained on the smaller context size."
Revisiting consistency for semi-supervised semantic segmentation,"Semi-supervised learning an attractive technique in practical deployments of deep models since it relaxes the dependence on labeled data. It is especially important in the scope of dense prediction because pixel-level annotation requires significant effort. This paper considers semi-supervised algorithms that enforce consistent predictions over perturbed unlabeled inputs. We study the advantages of perturbing only one of the two model instances and preventing the backward pass through the unperturbed instance. We also propose a competitive perturbation model as a composition of geometric warp and photometric jittering. We experiment with efficient models due to their importance for real-time and low-power applications. Our experiments show clear advantages of (1) one-way consistency, (2) perturbing only the student branch, and (3) strong photometric and geometric perturbations. Our perturbation model outperforms recent work and most of the contribution comes from photometric component. Experiments with additional data from the large coarsely annotated subset of Cityscapes suggest that semi-supervised training can outperform supervised training with the coarse labels."
Conterfactual Generative Zero-Shot Semantic Segmentation,"zero-shot learning is an essential part of computer vision. As a classical downstream task, zero-shot semantic segmentation has been studied because of its applicant value. One of the popular zero-shot semantic segmentation methods is based on the generative model Most new proposed works added structures on the same architecture to enhance this model. However, we found that, from the view of causal inference, the result of the original model has been influenced by spurious statistical relationships. Thus the performance of the prediction shows severe bias. In this work, we consider counterfactual methods to avoid the confounder in the original model. Based on this method, we proposed a new framework for zero-shot semantic segmentation. Our model is compared with baseline models on two real-world datasets, Pascal-VOC and Pascal-Context. The experiment results show proposed models can surpass previous confounded models and can still make use of additional structures to improve the performance. We also design a simple structure based on Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) in this work."
KRADA: Known-region-aware Domain Alignment for Open-set Domain Adaptation in Semantic Segmentation,"In semantic segmentation, we aim to train a pixel-level classifier to assign category labels to all pixels in an image, where labeled training images and unlabeled test images are from the same distribution and share the same label set. However, in an open world, the unlabeled test images probably contain unknown categories and have different distributions from the labeled images. Hence, in this paper, we consider a new, more realistic, and more challenging problem setting where the pixel-level classifier has to be trained with labeled images and unlabeled open-world images -- we name it open-set domain adaptation segmentation (OSDAS). In OSDAS, the trained classifier is expected to identify unknown-class pixels and classify known-class pixels well. To solve OSDAS, we first investigate which distribution that unknown-class pixels obey. Then, motivated by the goodness-of-fit test, we use statistical measurements to show how a pixel fits the distribution of an unknown class and select highly-fitted pixels to form the unknown region in each test image. Eventually, we propose an end-to-end learning framework, known-region-aware domain alignment (KRADA), to distinguish unknown classes while aligning the distributions of known classes in labeled and unlabeled open-world images. The effectiveness of KRADA has been verified on two synthetic tasks and one COVID-19 segmentation task."
SemSegLoss: A python package of loss functions for semantic segmentation,"Image Segmentation has been an active field of research as it has a wide range of applications, ranging from automated disease detection to self-driving cars. In recent years, various research papers proposed different loss functions used in case of biased data, sparse segmentation, and unbalanced dataset. In this paper, we introduce SemSegLoss, a python package consisting of some of the well-known loss functions widely used for image segmentation. It is developed with the intent to help researchers in the development of novel loss functions and perform an extensive set of experiments on model architectures for various applications. The ease-of-use and flexibility of the presented package have allowed reducing the development time and increased evaluation strategies of machine learning models for semantic segmentation. Furthermore, different applications that use image segmentation can use SemSegLoss because of the generality of its functions. This wide range of applications will lead to the development and growth of AI across all industries."
3D Semantic Mapping from Arthroscopy using Out-of-distribution Pose and Depth and In-distribution Segmentation Training,"Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has many documented advantages, but the surgeon's limited visual contact with the scene can be problematic. Hence, systems that can help surgeons navigate, such as a method that can produce a 3D semantic map, can compensate for the limitation above. In theory, we can borrow 3D semantic mapping techniques developed for robotics, but this requires finding solutions to the following challenges in MIS: 1) semantic segmentation, 2) depth estimation, and 3) pose estimation. In this paper, we propose the first 3D semantic mapping system from knee arthroscopy that solves the three challenges above. Using out-of-distribution non-human datasets, where pose could be labeled, we jointly train depth+pose estimators using selfsupervised and supervised losses. Using an in-distribution human knee dataset, we train a fully-supervised semantic segmentation system to label arthroscopic image pixels into femur, ACL, and meniscus. Taking testing images from human knees, we combine the results from these two systems to automatically create 3D semantic maps of the human knee. The result of this work opens the pathway to the generation of intraoperative 3D semantic mapping, registration with pre-operative data, and robotic-assisted arthroscopy"
ST++: Make Self-training Work Better for Semi-supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Self-training via pseudo labeling is a conventional, simple, and popular pipeline to leverage unlabeled data. In this work, we first construct a strong baseline of self-training (namely ST) for semi-supervised semantic segmentation via injecting strong data augmentations (SDA) on unlabeled images to alleviate overfitting noisy labels as well as decouple similar predictions between the teacher and student. With this simple mechanism, our ST outperforms all existing methods without any bells and whistles, e.g., iterative re-training. Inspired by the impressive results, we thoroughly investigate the SDA and provide some empirical analysis. Nevertheless, incorrect pseudo labels are still prone to accumulate and degrade the performance. To this end, we further propose an advanced self-training framework (namely ST++), that performs selective re-training via prioritizing reliable unlabeled images based on holistic prediction-level stability. Concretely, several model checkpoints are saved in the first stage supervised training, and the discrepancy of their predictions on the unlabeled image serves as a measurement for reliability. Our image-level selection offers holistic contextual information for learning. We demonstrate that it is more suitable for segmentation than common pixel-wise selection. As a result, ST++ further boosts the performance of our ST. Code is available at https://github.com/LiheYoung/ST-PlusPlus."
CSRNet: Cascaded Selective Resolution Network for Real-time Semantic Segmentation,"Real-time semantic segmentation has received considerable attention due to growing demands in many practical applications, such as autonomous vehicles, robotics, etc. Existing real-time segmentation approaches often utilize feature fusion to improve segmentation accuracy. However, they fail to fully consider the feature information at different resolutions and the receptive fields of the networks are relatively limited, thereby compromising the performance. To tackle this problem, we propose a light Cascaded Selective Resolution Network (CSRNet) to improve the performance of real-time segmentation through multiple context information embedding and enhanced feature aggregation. The proposed network builds a three-stage segmentation system, which integrates feature information from low resolution to high resolution and achieves feature refinement progressively. CSRNet contains two critical modules: the Shorted Pyramid Fusion Module (SPFM) and the Selective Resolution Module (SRM). The SPFM is a computationally efficient module to incorporate the global context information and significantly enlarge the receptive field at each stage. The SRM is designed to fuse multi-resolution feature maps with various receptive fields, which assigns soft channel attentions across the feature maps and helps to remedy the problem caused by multi-scale objects. Comprehensive experiments on two well-known datasets demonstrate that the proposed CSRNet effectively improves the performance for real-time segmentation."
Adversarial Semantic Hallucination for Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation,"Convolutional neural networks typically perform poorly when the test (target domain) and training (source domain) data have significantly different distributions. While this problem can be mitigated by using the target domain data to align the source and target domain feature representations, the target domain data may be unavailable due to privacy concerns. Consequently, there is a need for methods that generalize well despite restricted access to target domain data during training. In this work, we propose an adversarial semantic hallucination approach (ASH), which combines a class-conditioned hallucination module and a semantic segmentation module. Since the segmentation performance varies across different classes, we design a semantic-conditioned style hallucination module to generate affine transformation parameters from semantic information in the segmentation probability maps of the source domain image. Unlike previous adaptation approaches, which treat all classes equally, ASH considers the class-wise differences. The segmentation module and the hallucination module compete adversarially, with the hallucination module generating increasingly ""difficult"" stylized images to challenge the segmentation module. In response, the segmentation module improves as it is trained with generated samples at an appropriate class-wise difficulty level. Our results on the Cityscapes and Mapillary benchmark datasets show that our method is competitive with state of the art work. Code is made available at https://github.com/gabriel-tjio/ASH."
Multi-dataset Pretraining: A Unified Model for Semantic Segmentation,"Collecting annotated data for semantic segmentation is time-consuming and hard to scale up. In this paper, we for the first time propose a unified framework, termed as Multi-Dataset Pretraining, to take full advantage of the fragmented annotations of different datasets. The highlight is that the annotations from different domains can be efficiently reused and consistently boost performance for each specific domain. This is achieved by first pretraining the network via the proposed pixel-to-prototype contrastive loss over multiple datasets regardless of their taxonomy labels, and followed by fine-tuning the pretrained model over specific dataset as usual. In order to better model the relationship among images and classes from different datasets, we extend the pixel level embeddings via cross dataset mixing and propose a pixel-to-class sparse coding strategy that explicitly models the pixel-class similarity over the manifold embedding space. In this way, we are able to increase intra-class compactness and inter-class separability, as well as considering inter-class similarity across different datasets for better transferability. Experiments conducted on several benchmarks demonstrate its superior performance. Notably, MDP consistently outperforms the pretrained models over ImageNet by a considerable margin, while only using less than 10% samples for pretraining."
Fully Transformer Networks for Semantic Image Segmentation,"Transformers have shown impressive performance in various natural language processing and computer vision tasks, due to the capability of modeling long-range dependencies. Recent progress has demonstrated that combining such Transformers with CNN-based semantic image segmentation models is very promising. However, it is not well studied yet on how well a pure Transformer based approach can achieve for image segmentation. In this work, we explore a novel framework for semantic image segmentation, which is encoder-decoder based Fully Transformer Networks (FTN). Specifically, we first propose a Pyramid Group Transformer (PGT) as the encoder for progressively learning hierarchical features, meanwhile reducing the computation complexity of the standard Visual Transformer (ViT). Then, we propose a Feature Pyramid Transformer (FPT) to fuse semantic-level and spatial-level information from multiple levels of the PGT encoder for semantic image segmentation. Surprisingly, this simple baseline can achieve better results on multiple challenging semantic segmentation and face parsing benchmarks, including PASCAL Context, ADE20K, COCOStuff, and CelebAMask-HQ. The source code will be released on https://github.com/BR-IDL/PaddleViT."
Affinity Attention Graph Neural Network for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Weakly supervised semantic segmentation is receiving great attention due to its low human annotation cost. In this paper, we aim to tackle bounding box supervised semantic segmentation, i.e., training accurate semantic segmentation models using bounding box annotations as supervision. To this end, we propose Affinity Attention Graph Neural Network (A^2GNN). Following previous practices, we first generate pseudo semantic-aware seeds, which are then formed into semantic graphs based on our newly proposed affinity Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Then the built graphs are input to our A^2GNN, in which an affinity attention layer is designed to acquire the short- and long- distance information from soft graph edges to accurately propagate semantic labels from the confident seeds to the unlabeled pixels. However, to guarantee the precision of the seeds, we only adopt a limited number of confident pixel seed labels for A^2GNN, which may lead to insufficient supervision for training. To alleviate this issue, we further introduce a new loss function and a consistency-checking mechanism to leverage the bounding box constraint, so that more reliable guidance can be included for the model optimization. Experiments show that our approach achieves new state-of-the-art performances on Pascal VOC 2012 datasets (val: 76.5\%, test: 75.2\%). More importantly, our approach can be readily applied to bounding box supervised instance segmentation task or other weakly supervised semantic segmentation tasks, with state-of-the-art or comparable performance among almot all weakly supervised tasks on PASCAL VOC or COCO dataset. Our source code will be available at https://github.com/zbf1991/A2GNN."
SpaceMeshLab: Spatial Context Memoization and Meshgrid Atrous Convolution Consensus for Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation networks adopt transfer learning from image classification networks which occurs a shortage of spatial context information. For this reason, we propose Spatial Context Memoization (SpaM), a bypassing branch for spatial context by retaining the input dimension and constantly communicating its spatial context and rich semantic information mutually with the backbone network. Multi-scale context information for semantic segmentation is crucial for dealing with diverse sizes and shapes of target objects in the given scene. Conventional multi-scale context scheme adopts multiple effective receptive fields by multiple dilation rates or pooling operations, but often suffer from misalignment problem with respect to the target pixel. To this end, we propose Meshgrid Atrous Convolution Consensus (MetroCon^2) which brings multi-scale scheme into fine-grained multi-scale object context using convolutions with meshgrid-like scattered dilation rates. SpaceMeshLab (ResNet-101 + SpaM + MetroCon^2) achieves 82.0% mIoU in Cityscapes test and 53.5% mIoU on Pascal-Context validation set."
Document-level Relation Extraction as Semantic Segmentation,"Document-level relation extraction aims to extract relations among multiple entity pairs from a document. Previously proposed graph-based or transformer-based models utilize the entities independently, regardless of global information among relational triples. This paper approaches the problem by predicting an entity-level relation matrix to capture local and global information, parallel to the semantic segmentation task in computer vision. Herein, we propose a Document U-shaped Network for document-level relation extraction. Specifically, we leverage an encoder module to capture the context information of entities and a U-shaped segmentation module over the image-style feature map to capture global interdependency among triples. Experimental results show that our approach can obtain state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets DocRED, CDR, and GDA."
Multi-Exit Semantic Segmentation Networks,"Semantic segmentation arises as the backbone of many vision systems, spanning from self-driving cars and robot navigation to augmented reality and teleconferencing. Frequently operating under stringent latency constraints within a limited resource envelope, optimising for efficient execution becomes important. At the same time, the heterogeneous capabilities of the target platforms and the diverse constraints of different applications require the design and training of multiple target-specific segmentation models, leading to excessive maintenance costs. To this end, we propose a framework for converting state-of-the-art segmentation CNNs to Multi-Exit Semantic Segmentation (MESS) networks: specially trained models that employ parametrised early exits along their depth to i) dynamically save computation during inference on easier samples and ii) save training and maintenance cost by offering a post-training customisable speed-accuracy trade-off. Designing and training such networks naively can hurt performance. Thus, we propose a novel two-staged training scheme for multi-exit networks. Furthermore, the parametrisation of MESS enables co-optimising the number, placement and architecture of the attached segmentation heads along with the exit policy, upon deployment via exhaustive search in <1 GPUh. This allows MESS to rapidly adapt to the device capabilities and application requirements for each target use-case, offering a train-once-deploy-everywhere solution. MESS variants achieve latency gains of up to 2.83x with the same accuracy, or 5.33 pp higher accuracy for the same computational budget, compared to the original backbone network. Lastly, MESS delivers orders of magnitude faster architectural customisation, compared to state-of-the-art techniques."
Source-Free Open Compound Domain Adaptation in Semantic Segmentation,"In this work, we introduce a new concept, named source-free open compound domain adaptation (SF-OCDA), and study it in semantic segmentation. SF-OCDA is more challenging than the traditional domain adaptation but it is more practical. It jointly considers (1) the issues of data privacy and data storage and (2) the scenario of multiple target domains and unseen open domains. In SF-OCDA, only the source pre-trained model and the target data are available to learn the target model. The model is evaluated on the samples from the target and unseen open domains. To solve this problem, we present an effective framework by separating the training process into two stages: (1) pre-training a generalized source model and (2) adapting a target model with self-supervised learning. In our framework, we propose the Cross-Patch Style Swap (CPSS) to diversify samples with various patch styles in the feature-level, which can benefit the training of both stages. First, CPSS can significantly improve the generalization ability of the source model, providing more accurate pseudo-labels for the latter stage. Second, CPSS can reduce the influence of noisy pseudo-labels and also avoid the model overfitting to the target domain during self-supervised learning, consistently boosting the performance on the target and open domains. Experiments demonstrate that our method produces state-of-the-art results on the C-Driving dataset. Furthermore, our model also achieves the leading performance on CityScapes for domain generalization."
Large-scale Unsupervised Semantic Segmentation,"Empowered by large datasets, e.g., ImageNet, unsupervised learning on large-scale data has enabled significant advances for classification tasks. However, whether the large-scale unsupervised semantic segmentation can be achieved remains unknown. There are two major challenges: i) we need a large-scale benchmark for assessing algorithms; ii) we need to develop methods to simultaneously learn category and shape representation in an unsupervised manner. In this work, we propose a new problem of large-scale unsupervised semantic segmentation (LUSS) with a newly created benchmark dataset to help the research progress. Building on the ImageNet dataset, we propose the ImageNet-S dataset with 1.2 million training images and 50k high-quality semantic segmentation annotations for evaluation. Our benchmark has a high data diversity and a clear task objective. We also present a simple yet effective method that works surprisingly well for LUSS. In addition, we benchmark related un/weakly/fully supervised methods accordingly, identifying the challenges and possible directions of LUSS. The benchmark and source code is publicly available at https://github.com/LUSSeg."
Multi-Scale Feature Aggregation by Cross-Scale Pixel-to-Region Relation Operation for Semantic Segmentation,"Exploiting multi-scale features has shown great potential in tackling semantic segmentation problems. The aggregation is commonly done with sum or concatenation (concat) followed by convolutional (conv) layers. However, it fully passes down the high-level context to the following hierarchy without considering their interrelation. In this work, we aim to enable the low-level feature to aggregate the complementary context from adjacent high-level feature maps by a cross-scale pixel-to-region relation operation. We leverage cross-scale context propagation to make the long-range dependency capturable even by the high-resolution low-level features. To this end, we employ an efficient feature pyramid network to obtain multi-scale features. We propose a Relational Semantics Extractor (RSE) and Relational Semantics Propagator (RSP) for context extraction and propagation respectively. Then we stack several RSP into an RSP head to achieve the progressive top-down distribution of the context. Experiment results on two challenging datasets Cityscapes and COCO demonstrate that the RSP head performs competitively on both semantic segmentation and panoptic segmentation with high efficiency. It outperforms DeeplabV3 [1] by 0.7% with 75% fewer FLOPs (multiply-adds) in the semantic segmentation task."
Semantic-Aware Contrastive Learning for Multi-object Medical Image Segmentation,"Medical image segmentation, or computing voxelwise semantic masks, is a fundamental yet challenging task to compute a voxel-level semantic mask. To increase the ability of encoder-decoder neural networks to perform this task across large clinical cohorts, contrastive learning provides an opportunity to stabilize model initialization and enhance encoders without labels. However, multiple target objects (with different semantic meanings) may exist in a single image, which poses a problem for adapting traditional contrastive learning methods from prevalent 'image-level classification' to 'pixel-level segmentation'. In this paper, we propose a simple semantic-aware contrastive learning approach leveraging attention masks to advance multi-object semantic segmentation. Briefly, we embed different semantic objects to different clusters rather than the traditional image-level embeddings. We evaluate our proposed method on a multi-organ medical image segmentation task with both in-house data and MICCAI Challenge 2015 BTCV datasets. Compared with current state-of-the-art training strategies, our proposed pipeline yields a substantial improvement of 5.53% and 6.09% on Dice score for both medical image segmentation cohorts respectively (p-value<0.01). The performance of the proposed method is further assessed on natural images via the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset, and achieves a substantial improvement of 2.75% on mIoU (p-value<0.01)."
Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation with Cross Pseudo Supervision,"In this paper, we study the semi-supervised semantic segmentation problem via exploring both labeled data and extra unlabeled data. We propose a novel consistency regularization approach, called cross pseudo supervision (CPS). Our approach imposes the consistency on two segmentation networks perturbed with different initialization for the same input image. The pseudo one-hot label map, output from one perturbed segmentation network, is used to supervise the other segmentation network with the standard cross-entropy loss, and vice versa. The CPS consistency has two roles: encourage high similarity between the predictions of two perturbed networks for the same input image, and expand training data by using the unlabeled data with pseudo labels. Experiment results show that our approach achieves the state-of-the-art semi-supervised segmentation performance on Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC 2012. Code is available at https://git.io/CPS."
Robust Mutual Learning for Semi-supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Recent semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods are commonly based on pseudo labeling. Since the SSL performance is greatly influenced by the quality of pseudo labels, mutual learning has been proposed to effectively suppress the noises in the pseudo supervision. In this work, we propose robust mutual learning that improves the prior approach in two aspects. First, the vanilla mutual learners suffer from the coupling issue that models may converge to learn homogeneous knowledge. We resolve this issue by introducing mean teachers to generate mutual supervisions so that there is no direct interaction between the two students. We also show that strong data augmentations, model noises and heterogeneous network architectures are essential to alleviate the model coupling. Second, we notice that mutual learning fails to leverage the network's own ability for pseudo label refinement. Therefore, we introduce self-rectification that leverages the internal knowledge and explicitly rectifies the pseudo labels before the mutual teaching. Such self-rectification and mutual teaching collaboratively improve the pseudo label accuracy throughout the learning. The proposed robust mutual learning demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on semantic segmentation in low-data regime."
Detecting Anomalies in Semantic Segmentation with Prototypes,"Traditional semantic segmentation methods can recognize at test time only the classes that are present in the training set. This is a significant limitation, especially for semantic segmentation algorithms mounted on intelligent autonomous systems, deployed in realistic settings. Regardless of how many classes the system has seen at training time, it is inevitable that unexpected, unknown objects will appear at test time. The failure in identifying such anomalies may lead to incorrect, even dangerous behaviors of the autonomous agent equipped with such segmentation model when deployed in the real world. Current state of the art of anomaly segmentation uses generative models, exploiting their incapability to reconstruct patterns unseen during training. However, training these models is expensive, and their generated artifacts may create false anomalies. In this paper we take a different route and we propose to address anomaly segmentation through prototype learning. Our intuition is that anomalous pixels are those that are dissimilar to all class prototypes known by the model. We extract class prototypes from the training data in a lightweight manner using a cosine similarity-based classifier. Experiments on StreetHazards show that our approach achieves the new state of the art, with a significant margin over previous works, despite the reduced computational overhead. Code is available at https://github.com/DarioFontanel/PAnS."
DLA-Net: Learning Dual Local Attention Features for Semantic Segmentation of Large-Scale Building Facade Point Clouds,"Semantic segmentation of building facade is significant in various applications, such as urban building reconstruction and damage assessment. As there is a lack of 3D point clouds datasets related to the fine-grained building facade, we construct the first large-scale building facade point clouds benchmark dataset for semantic segmentation. The existing methods of semantic segmentation cannot fully mine the local neighborhood information of point clouds. Addressing this problem, we propose a learnable attention module that learns Dual Local Attention features, called DLA in this paper. The proposed DLA module consists of two blocks, including the self-attention block and attentive pooling block, which both embed an enhanced position encoding block. The DLA module could be easily embedded into various network architectures for point cloud segmentation, naturally resulting in a new 3D semantic segmentation network with an encoder-decoder architecture, called DLA-Net in this work. Extensive experimental results on our constructed building facade dataset demonstrate that the proposed DLA-Net achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art methods for semantic segmentation."
Anti-aliasing Semantic Reconstruction for Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation,"Encouraging progress in few-shot semantic segmentation has been made by leveraging features learned upon base classes with sufficient training data to represent novel classes with few-shot examples. However, this feature sharing mechanism inevitably causes semantic aliasing between novel classes when they have similar compositions of semantic concepts. In this paper, we reformulate few-shot segmentation as a semantic reconstruction problem, and convert base class features into a series of basis vectors which span a class-level semantic space for novel class reconstruction. By introducing contrastive loss, we maximize the orthogonality of basis vectors while minimizing semantic aliasing between classes. Within the reconstructed representation space, we further suppress interference from other classes by projecting query features to the support vector for precise semantic activation. Our proposed approach, referred to as anti-aliasing semantic reconstruction (ASR), provides a systematic yet interpretable solution for few-shot learning problems. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets show that ASR achieves strong results compared with the prior works."
Closer Look at the Uncertainty Estimation in Semantic Segmentation under Distributional Shift,"While recent computer vision algorithms achieve impressive performance on many benchmarks, they lack robustness - presented with an image from a different distribution, (e.g. weather or lighting conditions not considered during training), they may produce an erroneous prediction. Therefore, it is desired that such a model will be able to reliably predict its confidence measure. In this work, uncertainty estimation for the task of semantic segmentation is evaluated under a varying level of domain shift: in a cross-dataset setting and when adapting a model trained on data from the simulation. It was shown that simple color transformations already provide a strong baseline, comparable to using more sophisticated style-transfer data augmentation. Further, by constructing an ensemble consisting of models using different backbones and/or augmentation methods, it was possible to improve significantly model performance in terms of overall accuracy and uncertainty estimation under the domain shift setting. The Expected Calibration Error (ECE) on challenging GTA to Cityscapes adaptation was reduced from 4.05 to the competitive value of 1.1. Further, an ensemble of models was utilized in the self-training setting to improve the pseudo-labels generation, which resulted in a significant gain in the final model accuracy, compared to the standard fine-tuning (without ensemble)."
SegFormer: Simple and Efficient Design for Semantic Segmentation with Transformers,"We present SegFormer, a simple, efficient yet powerful semantic segmentation framework which unifies Transformers with lightweight multilayer perception (MLP) decoders. SegFormer has two appealing features: 1) SegFormer comprises a novel hierarchically structured Transformer encoder which outputs multiscale features. It does not need positional encoding, thereby avoiding the interpolation of positional codes which leads to decreased performance when the testing resolution differs from training. 2) SegFormer avoids complex decoders. The proposed MLP decoder aggregates information from different layers, and thus combining both local attention and global attention to render powerful representations. We show that this simple and lightweight design is the key to efficient segmentation on Transformers. We scale our approach up to obtain a series of models from SegFormer-B0 to SegFormer-B5, reaching significantly better performance and efficiency than previous counterparts. For example, SegFormer-B4 achieves 50.3% mIoU on ADE20K with 64M parameters, being 5x smaller and 2.2% better than the previous best method. Our best model, SegFormer-B5, achieves 84.0% mIoU on Cityscapes validation set and shows excellent zero-shot robustness on Cityscapes-C. Code will be released at: github.com/NVlabs/SegFormer."
Attention Based Semantic Segmentation on UAV Dataset for Natural Disaster Damage Assessment,The detrimental impacts of climate change include stronger and more destructive hurricanes happening all over the world. Identifying different damaged structures of an area including buildings and roads are vital since it helps the rescue team to plan their efforts to minimize the damage caused by a natural disaster. Semantic segmentation helps to identify different parts of an image. We implement a novel self-attention based semantic segmentation model on a high resolution UAV dataset and attain Mean IoU score of around 88% on the test set. The result inspires to use self-attention schemes in natural disaster damage assessment which will save human lives and reduce economic losses.
Learning Uncertainty For Safety-Oriented Semantic Segmentation In Autonomous Driving,"In this paper, we show how uncertainty estimation can be leveraged to enable safety critical image segmentation in autonomous driving, by triggering a fallback behavior if a target accuracy cannot be guaranteed. We introduce a new uncertainty measure based on disagreeing predictions as measured by a dissimilarity function. We propose to estimate this dissimilarity by training a deep neural architecture in parallel to the task-specific network. It allows this observer to be dedicated to the uncertainty estimation, and let the task-specific network make predictions. We propose to use self-supervision to train the observer, which implies that our method does not require additional training data. We show experimentally that our proposed approach is much less computationally intensive at inference time than competing methods (e.g. MCDropout), while delivering better results on safety-oriented evaluation metrics on the CamVid dataset, especially in the case of glare artifacts."
Empirical Study of Multi-Task Hourglass Model for Semantic Segmentation Task,"The semantic segmentation (SS) task aims to create a dense classification by labeling at the pixel level each object present on images. Convolutional neural network (CNN) approaches have been widely used, and exhibited the best results in this task. However, the loss of spatial precision on the results is a main drawback that has not been solved. In this work, we propose to use a multi-task approach by complementing the semantic segmentation task with edge detection, semantic contour, and distance transform tasks. We propose that by sharing a common latent space, the complementary tasks can produce more robust representations that can enhance the semantic labels. We explore the influence of contour-based tasks on latent space, as well as their impact on the final results of SS. We demonstrate the effectiveness of learning in a multi-task setting for hourglass models in the Cityscapes, CamVid, and Freiburg Forest datasets by improving the state-of-the-art without any refinement post-processing."
Feature Reuse and Fusion for Real-time Semantic segmentation,"For real-time semantic segmentation, how to increase the speed while maintaining high resolution is a problem that has been discussed and solved. Backbone design and fusion design have always been two essential parts of real-time semantic segmentation. We hope to design a light-weight network based on previous design experience and reach the level of state-of-the-art real-time semantic segmentation without any pre-training. To achieve this goal, a encoder-decoder architectures are proposed to solve this problem by applying a decoder network onto a backbone model designed for real-time segmentation tasks and designed three different ways to fuse semantics and detailed information in the aggregation phase. We have conducted extensive experiments on two semantic segmentation benchmarks. Experiments on the Cityscapes and CamVid datasets show that the proposed FRFNet strikes a balance between speed calculation and accuracy. It achieves 72% Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU%) on the Cityscapes test dataset with the speed of 144 on a single RTX 1080Ti card. The Code is available at https://github.com/favoMJ/FRFNet."
Unsupervised Adaptive Semantic Segmentation with Local Lipschitz Constraint,"Recent advances in unsupervised domain adaptation have seen considerable progress in semantic segmentation. Existing methods either align different domains with adversarial training or involve the self-learning that utilizes pseudo labels to conduct supervised training. The former always suffers from the unstable training caused by adversarial training and only focuses on the inter-domain gap that ignores intra-domain knowledge. The latter tends to put overconfident label prediction on wrong categories, which propagates errors to more samples. To solve these problems, we propose a two-stage adaptive semantic segmentation method based on the local Lipschitz constraint that satisfies both domain alignment and domain-specific exploration under a unified principle. In the first stage, we propose the local Lipschitzness regularization as the objective function to align different domains by exploiting intra-domain knowledge, which explores a promising direction for non-adversarial adaptive semantic segmentation. In the second stage, we use the local Lipschitzness regularization to estimate the probability of satisfying Lipschitzness for each pixel, and then dynamically sets the threshold of pseudo labels to conduct self-learning. Such dynamical self-learning effectively avoids the error propagation caused by noisy labels. Optimization in both stages is based on the same principle, i.e., the local Lipschitz constraint, so that the knowledge learned in the first stage can be maintained in the second stage. Further, due to the model-agnostic property, our method can easily adapt to any CNN-based semantic segmentation networks. Experimental results demonstrate the excellent performance of our method on standard benchmarks."
Review on Indoor RGB-D Semantic Segmentation with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks,"Many research works focus on leveraging the complementary geometric information of indoor depth sensors in vision tasks performed by deep convolutional neural networks, notably semantic segmentation. These works deal with a specific vision task known as ""RGB-D Indoor Semantic Segmentation"". The challenges and resulting solutions of this task differ from its standard RGB counterpart. This results in a new active research topic. The objective of this paper is to introduce the field of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for RGB-D Indoor Semantic Segmentation. This review presents the most popular public datasets, proposes a categorization of the strategies employed by recent contributions, evaluates the performance of the current state-of-the-art, and discusses the remaining challenges and promising directions for future works."
Dynamic Dual Sampling Module for Fine-Grained Semantic Segmentation,"Representation of semantic context and local details is the essential issue for building modern semantic segmentation models. However, the interrelationship between semantic context and local details is not well explored in previous works. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Dual Sampling Module (DDSM) to conduct dynamic affinity modeling and propagate semantic context to local details, which yields a more discriminative representation. Specifically, a dynamic sampling strategy is used to sparsely sample representative pixels and channels in the higher layer, forming adaptive compact support for each pixel and channel in the lower layer. The sampled features with high semantics are aggregated according to the affinities and then propagated to detailed lower-layer features, leading to a fine-grained segmentation result with well-preserved boundaries. Experiment results on both Cityscapes and Camvid datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach. Code and models will be available at \url{x3https://github.com/Fantasticarl/DDSM}."
Dynamic region proposal networks for semantic segmentation in automated glaucoma screening,"Screening for the diagnosis of glaucoma through a fundus image can be determined by the optic cup to disc diameter ratio (CDR), which requires the segmentation of the cup and disc regions. In this paper, we propose two novel approaches, namely Parameter-Shared Branched Network (PSBN) andWeak Region of Interest Model-based segmentation (WRoIM) to identify disc and cup boundaries. Unlike the previous approaches, the proposed methods are trained end-to-end through a single neural network architecture and use dynamic cropping instead of manual or traditional computer vision-based cropping. We are able to achieve similar performance as that of state-of-the-art approaches with less number of network parameters. Our experiments include comparison with different best known methods on publicly available Drishti-GS1 and RIM-ONE v3 datasets. With 7.8 \times 10^6 parameters our approach achieves a Dice score of 0.96/0.89 for disc/cup segmentation on Drishti-GS1 data whereas the existing state-of-the-art approach uses 19.8\times 10^6 parameters to achieve a dice score of 0.97/0.89."
Exploring Robustness of Unsupervised Domain Adaptation in Semantic Segmentation,"Recent studies imply that deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples -- inputs with a slight but intentional perturbation are incorrectly classified by the network. Such vulnerability makes it risky for some security-related applications (e.g., semantic segmentation in autonomous cars) and triggers tremendous concerns on the model reliability. For the first time, we comprehensively evaluate the robustness of existing UDA methods and propose a robust UDA approach. It is rooted in two observations: (i) the robustness of UDA methods in semantic segmentation remains unexplored, which pose a security concern in this field; and (ii) although commonly used self-supervision (e.g., rotation and jigsaw) benefits image tasks such as classification and recognition, they fail to provide the critical supervision signals that could learn discriminative representation for segmentation tasks. These observations motivate us to propose adversarial self-supervision UDA (or ASSUDA) that maximizes the agreement between clean images and their adversarial examples by a contrastive loss in the output space. Extensive empirical studies on commonly used benchmarks demonstrate that ASSUDA is resistant to adversarial attacks."
WeGleNet: A Weakly-Supervised Convolutional Neural Network for the Semantic Segmentation of Gleason Grades in Prostate Histology Images,"Prostate cancer is one of the main diseases affecting men worldwide. The Gleason scoring system is the primary diagnostic tool for prostate cancer. This is obtained via the visual analysis of cancerous patterns in prostate biopsies performed by expert pathologists, and the aggregation of the main Gleason grades in a combined score. Computer-aided diagnosis systems allow to reduce the workload of pathologists and increase the objectivity. Recently, efforts have been made in the literature to develop algorithms aiming the direct estimation of the global Gleason score at biopsy/core level with global labels. However, these algorithms do not cover the accurate localization of the Gleason patterns into the tissue. In this work, we propose a deep-learning-based system able to detect local cancerous patterns in the prostate tissue using only the global-level Gleason score during training. The methodological core of this work is the proposed weakly-supervised-trained convolutional neural network, WeGleNet, based on a multi-class segmentation layer after the feature extraction module, a global-aggregation, and the slicing of the background class for the model loss estimation during training. We obtained a Cohen's quadratic kappa (k) of 0.67 for the pixel-level prediction of cancerous patterns in the validation cohort. We compared the model performance for semantic segmentation of Gleason grades with supervised state-of-the-art architectures in the test cohort. We obtained a pixel-level k of 0.61 and a macro-averaged f1-score of 0.58, at the same level as fully-supervised methods. Regarding the estimation of the core-level Gleason score, we obtained a k of 0.76 and 0.67 between the model and two different pathologists. WeGleNet is capable of performing the semantic segmentation of Gleason grades similarly to fully-supervised methods without requiring pixel-level annotations."
Safety Metrics for Semantic Segmentation in Autonomous Driving,"Within the context of autonomous driving, safety-related metrics for deep neural networks have been widely studied for image classification and object detection. In this paper, we further consider safety-aware correctness and robustness metrics specialized for semantic segmentation. The novelty of our proposal is to move beyond pixel-level metrics: Given two images with each having N pixels being class-flipped, the designed metrics should, depending on the clustering of pixels being class-flipped or the location of occurrence, reflect a different level of safety criticality. The result evaluated on an autonomous driving dataset demonstrates the validity and practicality of our proposed methodology."
Semantic segmentation of multispectral photoacoustic images using deep learning,"Photoacoustic (PA) imaging has the potential to revolutionize functional medical imaging in healthcare due to the valuable information on tissue physiology contained in multispectral photoacoustic measurements. Clinical translation of the technology requires conversion of the high-dimensional acquired data into clinically relevant and interpretable information. In this work, we present a deep learning-based approach to semantic segmentation of multispectral photoacoustic images to facilitate image interpretability. Manually annotated photoacoustic {and ultrasound} imaging data are used as reference and enable the training of a deep learning-based segmentation algorithm in a supervised manner. Based on a validation study with experimentally acquired data from 16 healthy human volunteers, we show that automatic tissue segmentation can be used to create powerful analyses and visualizations of multispectral photoacoustic images. Due to the intuitive representation of high-dimensional information, such a preprocessing algorithm could be a valuable means to facilitate the clinical translation of photoacoustic imaging."
Railroad is not a Train: Saliency as Pseudo-pixel Supervision for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Existing studies in weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) using image-level weak supervision have several limitations: sparse object coverage, inaccurate object boundaries, and co-occurring pixels from non-target objects. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel framework, namely Explicit Pseudo-pixel Supervision (EPS), which learns from pixel-level feedback by combining two weak supervisions; the image-level label provides the object identity via the localization map and the saliency map from the off-the-shelf saliency detection model offers rich boundaries. We devise a joint training strategy to fully utilize the complementary relationship between both information. Our method can obtain accurate object boundaries and discard co-occurring pixels, thereby significantly improving the quality of pseudo-masks. Experimental results show that the proposed method remarkably outperforms existing methods by resolving key challenges of WSSS and achieves the new state-of-the-art performance on both PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 datasets."
Attentional Prototype Inference for Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation,"This paper aims to address few-shot semantic segmentation. While existing prototype-based methods have achieved considerable success, they suffer from uncertainty and ambiguity caused by limited labelled examples. In this work, we propose attentional prototype inference (API), a probabilistic latent variable framework for few-shot semantic segmentation. We define a global latent variable to represent the prototype of each object category, which we model as a probabilistic distribution. The probabilistic modeling of the prototype enhances the model's generalization ability by handling the inherent uncertainty caused by limited data and intra-class variations of objects. To further enhance the model, we introduce a local latent variable to represent the attention map of each query image, which enables the model to attend to foreground objects while suppressing background. The optimization of the proposed model is formulated as a variational Bayesian inference problem, which is established by amortized inference networks.We conduct extensive experiments on three benchmarks, where our proposal obtains at least competitive and often better performance than state-of-the-art methods. We also provide comprehensive analyses and ablation studies to gain insight into the effectiveness of our method for few-shot semantic segmentation."
DiscoBox: Weakly Supervised Instance Segmentation and Semantic Correspondence from Box Supervision,"We introduce DiscoBox, a novel framework that jointly learns instance segmentation and semantic correspondence using bounding box supervision. Specifically, we propose a self-ensembling framework where instance segmentation and semantic correspondence are jointly guided by a structured teacher in addition to the bounding box supervision. The teacher is a structured energy model incorporating a pairwise potential and a cross-image potential to model the pairwise pixel relationships both within and across the boxes. Minimizing the teacher energy simultaneously yields refined object masks and dense correspondences between intra-class objects, which are taken as pseudo-labels to supervise the task network and provide positive/negative correspondence pairs for dense constrastive learning. We show a symbiotic relationship where the two tasks mutually benefit from each other. Our best model achieves 37.9% AP on COCO instance segmentation, surpassing prior weakly supervised methods and is competitive to supervised methods. We also obtain state of the art weakly supervised results on PASCAL VOC12 and PF-PASCAL with real-time inference."
Superevents: Towards Native Semantic Segmentation for Event-based Cameras,"Most successful computer vision models transform low-level features, such as Gabor filter responses, into richer representations of intermediate or mid-level complexity for downstream visual tasks. These mid-level representations have not been explored for event cameras, although it is especially relevant to the visually sparse and often disjoint spatial information in the event stream. By making use of locally consistent intermediate representations, termed as superevents, numerous visual tasks ranging from semantic segmentation, visual tracking, depth estimation shall benefit. In essence, superevents are perceptually consistent local units that delineate parts of an object in a scene. Inspired by recent deep learning architectures, we present a novel method that employs lifetime augmentation for obtaining an event stream representation that is fed to a fully convolutional network to extract superevents. Our qualitative and quantitative experimental results on several sequences of a benchmark dataset highlights the significant potential for event-based downstream applications."
Segmenter: Transformer for Semantic Segmentation,"Image segmentation is often ambiguous at the level of individual image patches and requires contextual information to reach label consensus. In this paper we introduce Segmenter, a transformer model for semantic segmentation. In contrast to convolution-based methods, our approach allows to model global context already at the first layer and throughout the network. We build on the recent Vision Transformer (ViT) and extend it to semantic segmentation. To do so, we rely on the output embeddings corresponding to image patches and obtain class labels from these embeddings with a point-wise linear decoder or a mask transformer decoder. We leverage models pre-trained for image classification and show that we can fine-tune them on moderate sized datasets available for semantic segmentation. The linear decoder allows to obtain excellent results already, but the performance can be further improved by a mask transformer generating class masks. We conduct an extensive ablation study to show the impact of the different parameters, in particular the performance is better for large models and small patch sizes. Segmenter attains excellent results for semantic segmentation. It outperforms the state of the art on both ADE20K and Pascal Context datasets and is competitive on Cityscapes."
Object-Based Augmentation Improves Quality of Remote Sensing Semantic Segmentation,"Today deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) push the limits for most computer vision problems, define trends, and set state-of-the-art results. In remote sensing tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation, CNNs reach the SotA performance. However, for precise performance, CNNs require much high-quality training data. Rare objects and the variability of environmental conditions strongly affect prediction stability and accuracy. To overcome these data restrictions, it is common to consider various approaches including data augmentation techniques. This study focuses on the development and testing of object-based augmentation. The practical usefulness of the developed augmentation technique is shown in the remote sensing domain, being one of the most demanded ineffective augmentation techniques. We propose a novel pipeline for georeferenced image augmentation that enables a significant increase in the number of training samples. The presented pipeline is called object-based augmentation (OBA) and exploits objects' segmentation masks to produce new realistic training scenes using target objects and various label-free backgrounds. We test the approach on the buildings segmentation dataset with six different CNN architectures and show that the proposed method benefits for all the tested models. We also show that further augmentation strategy optimization can improve the results. The proposed method leads to the meaningful improvement of U-Net model predictions from 0.78 to 0.83 F1-score."
Semantic Distribution-aware Contrastive Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation,"Domain adaptive semantic segmentation refers to making predictions on a certain target domain with only annotations of a specific source domain. Current state-of-the-art works suggest that performing category alignment can alleviate domain shift reasonably. However, they are mainly based on image-to-image adversarial training and little consideration is given to semantic variations of an object among images, failing to capture a comprehensive picture of different categories. This motivates us to explore a holistic representative, the semantic distribution from each category in source domain, to mitigate the problem above. In this paper, we present semantic distribution-aware contrastive adaptation algorithm that enables pixel-wise representation alignment under the guidance of semantic distributions. Specifically, we first design a pixel-wise contrastive loss by considering the correspondences between semantic distributions and pixel-wise representations from both domains. Essentially, clusters of pixel representations from the same category should cluster together and those from different categories should spread out. Next, an upper bound on this formulation is derived by involving the learning of an infinite number of (dis)similar pairs, making it efficient. Finally, we verify that SDCA can further improve segmentation accuracy when integrated with the self-supervised learning. We evaluate SDCA on multiple benchmarks, achieving considerable improvements over existing algorithms.The code is publicly available at https://github.com/BIT-DA/SDCA"
An Attention-Fused Network for Semantic Segmentation of Very-High-Resolution Remote Sensing Imagery,"Semantic segmentation is an essential part of deep learning. In recent years, with the development of remote sensing big data, semantic segmentation has been increasingly used in remote sensing. Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) face the challenge of feature fusion: very-high-resolution remote sensing image multisource data fusion can increase the network's learnable information, which is conducive to correctly classifying target objects by DCNNs; simultaneously, the fusion of high-level abstract features and low-level spatial features can improve the classification accuracy at the border between target objects. In this paper, we propose a multipath encoder structure to extract features of multipath inputs, a multipath attention-fused block module to fuse multipath features, and a refinement attention-fused block module to fuse high-level abstract features and low-level spatial features. Furthermore, we propose a novel convolutional neural network architecture, named attention-fused network (AFNet). Based on our AFNet, we achieve state-of-the-art performance with an overall accuracy of 91.7% and a mean F1 score of 90.96% on the ISPRS Vaihingen 2D dataset and an overall accuracy of 92.1% and a mean F1 score of 93.44% on the ISPRS Potsdam 2D dataset."
Deep feature selection-and-fusion for RGB-D semantic segmentation,"Scene depth information can help visual information for more accurate semantic segmentation. However, how to effectively integrate multi-modality information into representative features is still an open problem. Most of the existing work uses DCNNs to implicitly fuse multi-modality information. But as the network deepens, some critical distinguishing features may be lost, which reduces the segmentation performance. This work proposes a unified and efficient feature selectionand-fusion network (FSFNet), which contains a symmetric cross-modality residual fusion module used for explicit fusion of multi-modality information. Besides, the network includes a detailed feature propagation module, which is used to maintain low-level detailed information during the forward process of the network. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed model achieves competitive performance on two public datasets."
More Separable and Easier to Segment: A Cluster Alignment Method for Cross-Domain Semantic Segmentation,"Feature alignment between domains is one of the mainstream methods for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) semantic segmentation. Existing feature alignment methods for semantic segmentation learn domain-invariant features by adversarial training to reduce domain discrepancy, but they have two limits: 1) associations among pixels are not maintained, 2) the classifier trained on the source domain couldn't adapted well to the target. In this paper, we propose a new UDA semantic segmentation approach based on domain closeness assumption to alleviate the above problems. Specifically, a prototype clustering strategy is applied to cluster pixels with the same semantic, which will better maintain associations among target domain pixels during the feature alignment. After clustering, to make the classifier more adaptive, a normalized cut loss based on the affinity graph of the target domain is utilized, which will make the decision boundary target-specific. Sufficient experiments conducted on GTA5 \rightarrow Cityscapes and SYNTHIA \rightarrow Cityscapes proved the effectiveness of our method, which illustrated that our results achieved the new state-of-the-art."
Contrastive Learning and Self-Training for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation in Semantic Segmentation,"Deep convolutional neural networks have considerably improved state-of-the-art results for semantic segmentation. Nevertheless, even modern architectures lack the ability to generalize well to a test dataset that originates from a different domain. To avoid the costly annotation of training data for unseen domains, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) attempts to provide efficient knowledge transfer from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Previous work has mainly focused on minimizing the discrepancy between the two domains by using adversarial training or self-training. While adversarial training may fail to align the correct semantic categories as it minimizes the discrepancy between the global distributions, self-training raises the question of how to provide reliable pseudo-labels. To align the correct semantic categories across domains, we propose a contrastive learning approach that adapts category-wise centroids across domains. Furthermore, we extend our method with self-training, where we use a memory-efficient temporal ensemble to generate consistent and reliable pseudo-labels. Although both contrastive learning and self-training (CLST) through temporal ensembling enable knowledge transfer between two domains, it is their combination that leads to a symbiotic structure. We validate our approach on two domain adaptation benchmarks: GTA5 \rightarrow Cityscapes and SYNTHIA \rightarrow Cityscapes. Our method achieves better or comparable results than the state-of-the-art. We will make the code publicly available."
Weakly Supervised Pseudo-Label assisted Learning for ALS Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation,"Competitive point cloud semantic segmentation results usually rely on a large amount of labeled data. However, data annotation is a time-consuming and labor-intensive task, particularly for three-dimensional point cloud data. Thus, obtaining accurate results with limited ground truth as training data is considerably important. As a simple and effective method, pseudo labels can use information from unlabeled data for training neural networks. In this study, we propose a pseudo-label-assisted point cloud segmentation method with very few sparsely sampled labels that are normally randomly selected for each class. An adaptive thresholding strategy was proposed to generate a pseudo-label based on the prediction probability. Pseudo-label learning is an iterative process, and pseudo labels were updated solely on ground-truth weak labels as the model converged to improve the training efficiency. Experiments using the ISPRS 3D sematic labeling benchmark dataset indicated that our proposed method achieved an equally competitive result compared to that using a full supervision scheme with only up to 2\unicode{x2030} of labeled points from the original training set, with an overall accuracy of 83.7% and an average F1 score of 70.2%."
Improved Real-Time Monocular SLAM Using Semantic Segmentation on Selective Frames,"Monocular simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is emerging in advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous driving, because a single camera is cheap and easy to install. Conventional monocular SLAM has two major challenges leading inaccurate localization and mapping. First, it is challenging to estimate scales in localization and mapping. Second, conventional monocular SLAM uses inappropriate mapping factors such as dynamic objects and low-parallax areas in mapping. This paper proposes an improved real-time monocular SLAM that resolves the aforementioned challenges by efficiently using deep learning-based semantic segmentation. To achieve the real-time execution of the proposed method, we apply semantic segmentation only to downsampled keyframes in parallel with mapping processes. In addition, the proposed method corrects scales of camera poses and three-dimensional (3D) points, using estimated ground plane from road-labeled 3D points and the real camera height. The proposed method also removes inappropriate corner features labeled as moving objects and low parallax areas. Experiments with eight video sequences demonstrate that the proposed monocular SLAM system achieves significantly improved and comparable trajectory tracking accuracy, compared to existing state-of-the-art monocular and stereo SLAM systems, respectively. The proposed system can achieve real-time tracking on a standard CPU potentially with a standard GPU support, whereas existing segmentation-aided monocular SLAM does not."
Self-supervised Augmentation Consistency for Adapting Semantic Segmentation,"We propose an approach to domain adaptation for semantic segmentation that is both practical and highly accurate. In contrast to previous work, we abandon the use of computationally involved adversarial objectives, network ensembles and style transfer. Instead, we employ standard data augmentation techniques - photometric noise, flipping and scaling - and ensure consistency of the semantic predictions across these image transformations. We develop this principle in a lightweight self-supervised framework trained on co-evolving pseudo labels without the need for cumbersome extra training rounds. Simple in training from a practitioner's standpoint, our approach is remarkably effective. We achieve significant improvements of the state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy after adaptation, consistent both across different choices of the backbone architecture and adaptation scenarios."
AttendSeg: A Tiny Attention Condenser Neural Network for Semantic Segmentation on the Edge,"In this study, we introduce \textbf{AttendSeg}, a low-precision, highly compact deep neural network tailored for on-device semantic segmentation. AttendSeg possesses a self-attention network architecture comprising of light-weight attention condensers for improved spatial-channel selective attention at a very low complexity. The unique macro-architecture and micro-architecture design properties of AttendSeg strike a strong balance between representational power and efficiency, achieved via a machine-driven design exploration strategy tailored specifically for the task at hand. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed AttendSeg can achieve segmentation accuracy comparable to much larger deep neural networks with greater complexity while possessing a significantly lower architecture and computational complexity (requiring as much as >27x fewer MACs, >72x fewer parameters, and >288x lower weight memory requirements), making it well-suited for TinyML applications on the edge."
Crack Semantic Segmentation using the U-Net with Full Attention Strategy,"Structures suffer from the emergence of cracks, therefore, crack detection is always an issue with much concern in structural health monitoring. Along with the rapid progress of deep learning technology, image semantic segmentation, an active research field, offers another solution, which is more effective and intelligent, to crack detection Through numerous artificial neural networks have been developed to address the preceding issue, corresponding explorations are never stopped improving the quality of crack detection. This paper presents a novel artificial neural network architecture named Full Attention U-net for image semantic segmentation. The proposed architecture leverages the U-net as the backbone and adopts the Full Attention Strategy, which is a synthesis of the attention mechanism and the outputs from each encoding layer in skip connection. Subject to the hardware in training, the experiments are composed of verification and validation. In verification, 4 networks including U-net, Attention U-net, Advanced Attention U-net, and Full Attention U-net are tested through cell images for a competitive study. With respect to mean intersection-over-unions and clarity of edge identification, the Full Attention U-net performs best in verification, and is hence applied for crack semantic segmentation in validation to demonstrate its effectiveness."
Rethinking Ensemble-Distillation for Semantic Segmentation Based Unsupervised Domain Adaptation,"Recent researches on unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) have demonstrated that end-to-end ensemble learning frameworks serve as a compelling option for UDA tasks. Nevertheless, these end-to-end ensemble learning methods often lack flexibility as any modification to the ensemble requires retraining of their frameworks. To address this problem, we propose a flexible ensemble-distillation framework for performing semantic segmentation based UDA, allowing any arbitrary composition of the members in the ensemble while still maintaining its superior performance. To achieve such flexibility, our framework is designed to be robust against the output inconsistency and the performance variation of the members within the ensemble. To examine the effectiveness and the robustness of our method, we perform an extensive set of experiments on both GTA5 to Cityscapes and SYNTHIA to Cityscapes benchmarks to quantitatively inspect the improvements achievable by our method. We further provide detailed analyses to validate that our design choices are practical and beneficial. The experimental evidence validates that the proposed method indeed offer superior performance, robustness and flexibility in semantic segmentation based UDA tasks against contemporary baseline methods."
Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation with Self-Supervised Depth Estimation,"Domain adaptation for semantic segmentation aims to improve the model performance in the presence of a distribution shift between source and target domain. Leveraging the supervision from auxiliary tasks~(such as depth estimation) has the potential to heal this shift because many visual tasks are closely related to each other. However, such a supervision is not always available. In this work, we leverage the guidance from self-supervised depth estimation, which is available on both domains, to bridge the domain gap. On the one hand, we propose to explicitly learn the task feature correlation to strengthen the target semantic predictions with the help of target depth estimation. On the other hand, we use the depth prediction discrepancy from source and target depth decoders to approximate the pixel-wise adaptation difficulty. The adaptation difficulty, inferred from depth, is then used to refine the target semantic segmentation pseudo-labels. The proposed method can be easily implemented into existing segmentation frameworks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the benchmark tasks SYNTHIA-to-Cityscapes and GTA-to-Cityscapes, on which we achieve the new state-of-the-art performance of 55.0\% and 56.6\%, respectively. Our code is available at \url{https://qin.ee/corda}."
Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation with Pixel-Level Contrastive Learning from a Class-wise Memory Bank,"This work presents a novel approach for semi-supervised semantic segmentation. The key element of this approach is our contrastive learning module that enforces the segmentation network to yield similar pixel-level feature representations for same-class samples across the whole dataset. To achieve this, we maintain a memory bank continuously updated with relevant and high-quality feature vectors from labeled data. In an end-to-end training, the features from both labeled and unlabeled data are optimized to be similar to same-class samples from the memory bank. Our approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art for semi-supervised semantic segmentation and semi-supervised domain adaptation on well-known public benchmarks, with larger improvements on the most challenging scenarios, i.e., less available labeled data. https://github.com/Shathe/SemiSeg-Contrastive"
Rethinking BiSeNet For Real-time Semantic Segmentation,"BiSeNet has been proved to be a popular two-stream network for real-time segmentation. However, its principle of adding an extra path to encode spatial information is time-consuming, and the backbones borrowed from pretrained tasks, e.g., image classification, may be inefficient for image segmentation due to the deficiency of task-specific design. To handle these problems, we propose a novel and efficient structure named Short-Term Dense Concatenate network (STDC network) by removing structure redundancy. Specifically, we gradually reduce the dimension of feature maps and use the aggregation of them for image representation, which forms the basic module of STDC network. In the decoder, we propose a Detail Aggregation module by integrating the learning of spatial information into low-level layers in single-stream manner. Finally, the low-level features and deep features are fused to predict the final segmentation results. Extensive experiments on Cityscapes and CamVid dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by achieving promising trade-off between segmentation accuracy and inference speed. On Cityscapes, we achieve 71.9% mIoU on the test set with a speed of 250.4 FPS on NVIDIA GTX 1080Ti, which is 45.2% faster than the latest methods, and achieve 76.8% mIoU with 97.0 FPS while inferring on higher resolution images."
A Novel Transformer Based Semantic Segmentation Scheme for Fine-Resolution Remote Sensing Images,"The fully convolutional network (FCN) with an encoder-decoder architecture has been the standard paradigm for semantic segmentation. The encoder-decoder architecture utilizes an encoder to capture multilevel feature maps, which are incorporated into the final prediction by a decoder. As the context is crucial for precise segmentation, tremendous effort has been made to extract such information in an intelligent fashion, including employing dilated/atrous convolutions or inserting attention modules. However, these endeavors are all based on the FCN architecture with ResNet or other backbones, which cannot fully exploit the context from the theoretical concept. By contrast, we introduce the Swin Transformer as the backbone to extract the context information and design a novel decoder of densely connected feature aggregation module (DCFAM) to restore the resolution and produce the segmentation map. The experimental results on two remotely sensed semantic segmentation datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.Code is available at https://github.com/WangLibo1995/GeoSeg"
A Closer Look at Self-training for Zero-Label Semantic Segmentation,"Being able to segment unseen classes not observed during training is an important technical challenge in deep learning, because of its potential to reduce the expensive annotation required for semantic segmentation. Prior zero-label semantic segmentation works approach this task by learning visual-semantic embeddings or generative models. However, they are prone to overfitting on the seen classes because there is no training signal for them. In this paper, we study the challenging generalized zero-label semantic segmentation task where the model has to segment both seen and unseen classes at test time. We assume that pixels of unseen classes could be present in the training images but without being annotated. Our idea is to capture the latent information on unseen classes by supervising the model with self-produced pseudo-labels for unlabeled pixels. We propose a consistency regularizer to filter out noisy pseudo-labels by taking the intersections of the pseudo-labels generated from different augmentations of the same image. Our framework generates pseudo-labels and then retrain the model with human-annotated and pseudo-labelled data. This procedure is repeated for several iterations. As a result, our approach achieves the new state-of-the-art on PascalVOC12 and COCO-stuff datasets in the challenging generalized zero-label semantic segmentation setting, surpassing other existing methods addressing this task with more complex strategies."
Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation via Patch-Wise Contrastive Learning,"We introduce a novel approach to unsupervised and semi-supervised domain adaptation for semantic segmentation. Unlike many earlier methods that rely on adversarial learning for feature alignment, we leverage contrastive learning to bridge the domain gap by aligning the features of structurally similar label patches across domains. As a result, the networks are easier to train and deliver better performance. Our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised and semi-supervised methods on two challenging domain adaptive segmentation tasks, particularly with a small number of target domain annotations. It can also be naturally extended to weakly-supervised domain adaptation, where only a minor drop in accuracy can save up to 75% of annotation cost."
A Data-Adaptive Loss Function for Incomplete Data and Incremental Learning in Semantic Image Segmentation,"In the last years, deep learning has dramatically improved the performances in a variety of medical image analysis applications. Among different types of deep learning models, convolutional neural networks have been among the most successful and they have been used in many applications in medical imaging.  Training deep convolutional neural networks often requires large amounts of image data to generalize well to new unseen images. It is often time-consuming and expensive to collect large amounts of data in the medical image domain due to expensive imaging systems, and the need for experts to manually make ground truth annotations. A potential problem arises if new structures are added when a decision support system is already deployed and in use. Since the field of radiation therapy is constantly developing, the new structures would also have to be covered by the decision support system.  In the present work, we propose a novel loss function, that adapts to the available data in order to utilize all available data, even when some have missing annotations. We demonstrate that the proposed loss function also works well in an incremental learning setting, where it can automatically incorporate new structures as they appear. Experiments on a large in-house data set show that the proposed method performs on par with baseline models, while greatly reducing the training time."
DANNet: A One-Stage Domain Adaptation Network for Unsupervised Nighttime Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation of nighttime images plays an equally important role as that of daytime images in autonomous driving, but the former is much more challenging due to poor illuminations and arduous human annotations. In this paper, we propose a novel domain adaptation network (DANNet) for nighttime semantic segmentation without using labeled nighttime image data. It employs an adversarial training with a labeled daytime dataset and an unlabeled dataset that contains coarsely aligned day-night image pairs. Specifically, for the unlabeled day-night image pairs, we use the pixel-level predictions of static object categories on a daytime image as a pseudo supervision to segment its counterpart nighttime image. We further design a re-weighting strategy to handle the inaccuracy caused by misalignment between day-night image pairs and wrong predictions of daytime images, as well as boost the prediction accuracy of small objects. The proposed DANNet is the first one stage adaptation framework for nighttime semantic segmentation, which does not train additional day-night image transfer models as a separate pre-processing stage. Extensive experiments on Dark Zurich and Nighttime Driving datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance for nighttime semantic segmentation."
Semantic Segmentation by Improved Generative Adversarial Networks,"While most existing segmentation methods usually combined the powerful feature extraction capabilities of CNNs with Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) post-processing, the result always limited by the fault of CRFs . Due to the notoriously slow calculation speeds and poor efficiency of CRFs, in recent years, CRFs post-processing has been gradually eliminated. In this paper, an improved Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for image semantic segmentation task (semantic segmentation by GANs, Seg-GAN) is proposed to facilitate further segmentation research. In addition, we introduce Convolutional CRFs (ConvCRFs) as an effective improvement solution for the image semantic segmentation task. Towards the goal of differentiating the segmentation results from the ground truth distribution and improving the details of the output images, the proposed discriminator network is specially designed in a full convolutional manner combined with cascaded ConvCRFs. Besides, the adversarial loss aggressively encourages the output image to be close to the distribution of the ground truth. Our method not only learns an end-to-end mapping from input image to corresponding output image, but also learns a loss function to train this mapping. The experiments show that our method achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods."
CTNet: Context-based Tandem Network for Semantic Segmentation,"Contextual information has been shown to be powerful for semantic segmentation. This work proposes a novel Context-based Tandem Network (CTNet) by interactively exploring the spatial contextual information and the channel contextual information, which can discover the semantic context for semantic segmentation. Specifically, the Spatial Contextual Module (SCM) is leveraged to uncover the spatial contextual dependency between pixels by exploring the correlation between pixels and categories. Meanwhile, the Channel Contextual Module (CCM) is introduced to learn the semantic features including the semantic feature maps and class-specific features by modeling the long-term semantic dependence between channels. The learned semantic features are utilized as the prior knowledge to guide the learning of SCM, which can make SCM obtain more accurate long-range spatial dependency. Finally, to further improve the performance of the learned representations for semantic segmentation, the results of the two context modules are adaptively integrated to achieve better results. Extensive experiments are conducted on three widely-used datasets, i.e., PASCAL-Context, ADE20K and PASCAL VOC2012. The results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed CTNet by comparison with several state-of-the-art methods."
Plants Don't Walk on the Street: Common-Sense Reasoning for Reliable Semantic Segmentation,"Data-driven sensor interpretation in autonomous driving can lead to highly implausible predictions as can most of the time be verified with common-sense knowledge. However, learning common knowledge only from data is hard and approaches for knowledge integration are an active research area. We propose to use a partly human-designed, partly learned set of rules to describe relations between objects of a traffic scene on a high level of abstraction. In doing so, we improve and robustify existing deep neural networks consuming low-level sensor information. We present an initial study adapting the well-established Probabilistic Soft Logic (PSL) framework to validate and improve on the problem of semantic segmentation. We describe in detail how we integrate common knowledge into the segmentation pipeline using PSL and verify our approach in a set of experiments demonstrating the increase in robustness against several severe image distortions applied to the A2D2 autonomous driving data set."
SCNet: Enhancing Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation by Self-Contrastive Background Prototypes,"Few-shot semantic segmentation aims to segment novel-class objects in a query image with only a few annotated examples in support images. Most of advanced solutions exploit a metric learning framework that performs segmentation through matching each pixel to a learned foreground prototype. However, this framework suffers from biased classification due to incomplete construction of sample pairs with the foreground prototype only. To address this issue, in this paper, we introduce a complementary self-contrastive task into few-shot semantic segmentation. Our new model is able to associate the pixels in a region with the prototype of this region, no matter they are in the foreground or background. To this end, we generate self-contrastive background prototypes directly from the query image, with which we enable the construction of complete sample pairs and thus a complementary and auxiliary segmentation task to achieve the training of a better segmentation model. Extensive experiments on PASCAL-5^i and COCO-20^i demonstrate clearly the superiority of our proposal. At no expense of inference efficiency, our model achieves state-of-the results in both 1-shot and 5-shot settings for few-shot semantic segmentation."
A De-raining semantic segmentation network for real-time foreground segmentation,"Few researches have been proposed specifically for real-time semantic segmentation in rainy environments. However, the demand in this area is huge and it is challenging for lightweight networks. Therefore, this paper proposes a lightweight network which is specially designed for the foreground segmentation in rainy environments, named De-raining Semantic Segmentation Network (DRSNet). By analyzing the characteristics of raindrops, the MultiScaleSE Block is targetedly designed to encode the input image, it uses multi-scale dilated convolutions to increase the receptive field, and SE attention mechanism to learn the weights of each channels. In order to combine semantic information between different encoder and decoder layers, it is proposed to use Asymmetric Skip, that is, the higher semantic layer of encoder employs bilinear interpolation and the output passes through pointwise convolution, then added element-wise to the lower semantic layer of decoder. According to the control experiments, the performances of MultiScaleSE Block and Asymmetric Skip compared with SEResNet18 and Symmetric Skip respectively are improved to a certain degree on the Foreground Accuracy index. The parameters and the floating point of operations (FLOPs) of DRSNet is only 0.54M and 0.20GFLOPs separately. The state-of-the-art results and real-time performances are achieved on both the UESTC all-day Scenery add rain (UAS-add-rain) and the Baidu People Segmentation add rain (BPS-add-rain) benchmarks with the input sizes of 192*128, 384*256 and 768*512. The speed of DRSNet exceeds all the networks within 1GFLOPs, and Foreground Accuracy index is also the best among the similar magnitude networks on both benchmarks."
SSPC-Net: Semi-supervised Semantic 3D Point Cloud Segmentation Network,"Point cloud semantic segmentation is a crucial task in 3D scene understanding. Existing methods mainly focus on employing a large number of annotated labels for supervised semantic segmentation. Nonetheless, manually labeling such large point clouds for the supervised segmentation task is time-consuming. In order to reduce the number of annotated labels, we propose a semi-supervised semantic point cloud segmentation network, named SSPC-Net, where we train the semantic segmentation network by inferring the labels of unlabeled points from the few annotated 3D points. In our method, we first partition the whole point cloud into superpoints and build superpoint graphs to mine the long-range dependencies in point clouds. Based on the constructed superpoint graph, we then develop a dynamic label propagation method to generate the pseudo labels for the unsupervised superpoints. Particularly, we adopt a superpoint dropout strategy to dynamically select the generated pseudo labels. In order to fully exploit the generated pseudo labels of the unsupervised superpoints, we furthermore propose a coupled attention mechanism for superpoint feature embedding. Finally, we employ the cross-entropy loss to train the semantic segmentation network with the labels of the supervised superpoints and the pseudo labels of the unsupervised superpoints. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate that our semi-supervised segmentation method can achieve better performance than the current semi-supervised segmentation method with fewer annotated 3D points. Our code is available at https://github.com/MMCheng/SSPC-Net."
Street-Map Based Validation of Semantic Segmentation in Autonomous Driving,"Artificial intelligence for autonomous driving must meet strict requirements on safety and robustness, which motivates the thorough validation of learned models. However, current validation approaches mostly require ground truth data and are thus both cost-intensive and limited in their applicability. We propose to overcome these limitations by a model agnostic validation using a-priori knowledge from street maps. In particular, we show how to validate semantic segmentation masks and demonstrate the potential of our approach using OpenStreetMap. We introduce validation metrics that indicate false positive or negative road segments. Besides the validation approach, we present a method to correct the vehicle's GPS position so that a more accurate localization can be used for the street-map based validation. Lastly, we present quantitative results on the Cityscapes dataset indicating that our validation approach can indeed uncover errors in semantic segmentation masks."
A Simple Baseline for Semi-supervised Semantic Segmentation with Strong Data Augmentation,"Recently, significant progress has been made on semantic segmentation. However, the success of supervised semantic segmentation typically relies on a large amount of labelled data, which is time-consuming and costly to obtain. Inspired by the success of semi-supervised learning methods in image classification, here we propose a simple yet effective semi-supervised learning framework for semantic segmentation. We demonstrate that the devil is in the details: a set of simple design and training techniques can collectively improve the performance of semi-supervised semantic segmentation significantly. Previous works [3, 27] fail to employ strong augmentation in pseudo label learning efficiently, as the large distribution change caused by strong augmentation harms the batch normalisation statistics. We design a new batch normalisation, namely distribution-specific batch normalisation (DSBN) to address this problem and demonstrate the importance of strong augmentation for semantic segmentation. Moreover, we design a self correction loss which is effective in noise resistance. We conduct a series of ablation studies to show the effectiveness of each component. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results in the semi-supervised settings on the Cityscapes and Pascal VOC datasets."
Learning structure-aware semantic segmentation with image-level supervision,"Compared with expensive pixel-wise annotations, image-level labels make it possible to learn semantic segmentation in a weakly-supervised manner. Within this pipeline, the class activation map (CAM) is obtained and further processed to serve as a pseudo label to train the semantic segmentation model in a fully-supervised manner. In this paper, we argue that the lost structure information in CAM limits its application in downstream semantic segmentation, leading to deteriorated predictions. Furthermore, the inconsistent class activation scores inside the same object contradicts the common sense that each region of the same object should belong to the same semantic category. To produce sharp prediction with structure information, we introduce an auxiliary semantic boundary detection module, which penalizes the deteriorated predictions. Furthermore, we adopt smoothness loss to encourage prediction inside the object to be consistent. Experimental results on the PASCAL-VOC dataset illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution."
SVS-net: A Novel Semantic Segmentation Network in Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography Images,"Automated vascular segmentation on optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is important for the quantitative analyses of retinal microvasculature in neuroretinal and systemic diseases. Despite recent improvements, artifacts continue to pose challenges in segmentation. Our study focused on removing the speckle noise artifact from OCTA images when performing segmentation. Speckle noise is common in OCTA and is particularly prominent over large non-perfusion areas. It may interfere with the proper assessment of retinal vasculature. In this study, we proposed a novel Supervision Vessel Segmentation network (SVS-net) to detect vessels of different sizes. The SVS-net includes a new attention-based module to describe vessel positions and facilitate the understanding of the network learning process. The model is efficient and explainable and could be utilized to reduce the need for manual labeling. Our SVS-net had better performance in accuracy, recall, F1 score, and Kappa score when compared to other well recognized models."
All you need are a few pixels: semantic segmentation with PixelPick,"A central challenge for the task of semantic segmentation is the prohibitive cost of obtaining dense pixel-level annotations to supervise model training. In this work, we show that in order to achieve a good level of segmentation performance, all you need are a few well-chosen pixel labels. We make the following contributions: (i) We investigate the novel semantic segmentation setting in which labels are supplied only at sparse pixel locations, and show that deep neural networks can use a handful of such labels to good effect; (ii) We demonstrate how to exploit this phenomena within an active learning framework, termed PixelPick, to radically reduce labelling cost, and propose an efficient ""mouse-free"" annotation strategy to implement our approach; (iii) We conduct extensive experiments to study the influence of annotation diversity under a fixed budget, model pretraining, model capacity and the sampling mechanism for picking pixels in this low annotation regime; (iv) We provide comparisons to the existing state of the art in semantic segmentation with active learning, and demonstrate comparable performance with up to two orders of magnitude fewer pixel annotations on the CamVid, Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC 2012 benchmarks; (v) Finally, we evaluate the efficiency of our annotation pipeline and its sensitivity to annotator error to demonstrate its practicality."
Semantic Segmentation with Generative Models: Semi-Supervised Learning and Strong Out-of-Domain Generalization,"Training deep networks with limited labeled data while achieving a strong generalization ability is key in the quest to reduce human annotation efforts. This is the goal of semi-supervised learning, which exploits more widely available unlabeled data to complement small labeled data sets. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for discriminative pixel-level tasks using a generative model of both images and labels. Concretely, we learn a generative adversarial network that captures the joint image-label distribution and is trained efficiently using a large set of unlabeled images supplemented with only few labeled ones. We build our architecture on top of StyleGAN2, augmented with a label synthesis branch. Image labeling at test time is achieved by first embedding the target image into the joint latent space via an encoder network and test-time optimization, and then generating the label from the inferred embedding. We evaluate our approach in two important domains: medical image segmentation and part-based face segmentation. We demonstrate strong in-domain performance compared to several baselines, and are the first to showcase extreme out-of-domain generalization, such as transferring from CT to MRI in medical imaging, and photographs of real faces to paintings, sculptures, and even cartoons and animal faces.

Improving Online Performance Prediction for Semantic Segmentation,"In this work we address the task of observing the performance of a semantic segmentation deep neural network (DNN) during online operation, i.e., during inference, which is of high importance in safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. Here, many high-level decisions rely on such DNNs, which are usually evaluated offline, while their performance in online operation remains unknown. To solve this problem, we propose an improved online performance prediction scheme, building on a recently proposed concept of predicting the primary semantic segmentation task's performance. This can be achieved by evaluating the auxiliary task of monocular depth estimation with a measurement supplied by a LiDAR sensor and a subsequent regression to the semantic segmentation performance. In particular, we propose (i) sequential training methods for both tasks in a multi-task training setup, (ii) to share the encoder as well as parts of the decoder between both task's networks for improved efficiency, and (iii) a temporal statistics aggregation method, which significantly reduces the performance prediction error at the cost of a small algorithmic latency. Evaluation on the KITTI dataset shows that all three aspects improve the performance prediction compared to previous approaches."
SQN: Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation of Large-Scale 3D Point Clouds,"Labelling point clouds fully is highly time-consuming and costly. As larger point cloud datasets with billions of points become more common, we ask whether the full annotation is even necessary, demonstrating that existing baselines designed under a fully annotated assumption only degrade slightly even when faced with 1% random point annotations. However, beyond this point, e.g., at 0.1% annotations, segmentation accuracy is unacceptably low. We observe that, as point clouds are samples of the 3D world, the distribution of points in a local neighborhood is relatively homogeneous, exhibiting strong semantic similarity. Motivated by this, we propose a new weak supervision method to implicitly augment highly sparse supervision signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed Semantic Query Network (SQN) achieves promising performance on seven large-scale open datasets under weak supervision schemes, while requiring only 0.1% randomly annotated points for training, greatly reducing annotation cost and effort. The code is available at https://github.com/QingyongHu/SQN."
Estimation of BMI from Facial Images using Semantic Segmentation based Region-Aware Pooling,"Body-Mass-Index (BMI) conveys important information about one's life such as health and socio-economic conditions. Large-scale automatic estimation of BMIs can help predict several societal behaviors such as health, job opportunities, friendships, and popularity. The recent works have either employed hand-crafted geometrical face features or face-level deep convolutional neural network features for face to BMI prediction. The hand-crafted geometrical face feature lack generalizability and face-level deep features don't have detailed local information. Although useful, these methods missed the detailed local information which is essential for exact BMI prediction. In this paper, we propose to use deep features that are pooled from different face regions (eye, nose, eyebrow, lips, etc.,) and demonstrate that this explicit pooling from face regions can significantly boost the performance of BMI prediction. To address the problem of accurate and pixel-level face regions localization, we propose to use face semantic segmentation in our framework. Extensive experiments are performed using different Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) backbones including FaceNet and VGG-face on three publicly available datasets: VisualBMI, Bollywood and VIP attributes. Experimental results demonstrate that, as compared to the recent works, the proposed Reg-GAP gives a percentage improvement of 22.4\% on VIP-attribute, 3.3\% on VisualBMI, and 63.09\% on the Bollywood dataset."
Bootstrapping Semantic Segmentation with Regional Contrast,"We present ReCo, a contrastive learning framework designed at a regional level to assist learning in semantic segmentation. ReCo performs semi-supervised or supervised pixel-level contrastive learning on a sparse set of hard negative pixels, with minimal additional memory footprint. ReCo is easy to implement, being built on top of off-the-shelf segmentation networks, and consistently improves performance in both semi-supervised and supervised semantic segmentation methods, achieving smoother segmentation boundaries and faster convergence. The strongest effect is in semi-supervised learning with very few labels. With ReCo, we achieve high-quality semantic segmentation models, requiring only 5 examples of each semantic class. Code is available at https://github.com/lorenmt/reco."
Context-self contrastive pretraining for crop type semantic segmentation,"In this paper, we propose a fully supervised pre-training scheme based on contrastive learning particularly tailored to dense classification tasks. The proposed Context-Self Contrastive Loss (CSCL) learns an embedding space that makes semantic boundaries pop-up by use of a similarity metric between every location in a training sample and its local context. For crop type semantic segmentation from Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) we find performance at parcel boundaries to be a critical bottleneck and explain how CSCL tackles the underlying cause of that problem, improving the state-of-the-art performance in this task. Additionally, using images from the Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite missions we compile the largest, to our knowledge, SITS dataset densely annotated by crop type and parcel identities, which we make publicly available together with the data generation pipeline. Using that data we find CSCL, even with minimal pre-training, to improve all respective baselines and present a process for semantic segmentation at super-resolution for obtaining crop classes at a more granular level. The code and instructions to download the data can be found in https://github.com/michaeltrs/DeepSatModels."
Progressive Semantic Segmentation,"The objective of this work is to segment high-resolution images without overloading GPU memory usage or losing the fine details in the output segmentation map. The memory constraint means that we must either downsample the big image or divide the image into local patches for separate processing. However, the former approach would lose the fine details, while the latter can be ambiguous due to the lack of a global picture. In this work, we present MagNet, a multi-scale framework that resolves local ambiguity by looking at the image at multiple magnification levels. MagNet has multiple processing stages, where each stage corresponds to a magnification level, and the output of one stage is fed into the next stage for coarse-to-fine information propagation. Each stage analyzes the image at a higher resolution than the previous stage, recovering the previously lost details due to the lossy downsampling step, and the segmentation output is progressively refined through the processing stages. Experiments on three high-resolution datasets of urban views, aerial scenes, and medical images show that MagNet consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin."
Few-Shot Meta-Learning on Point Cloud for Semantic Segmentation,"The promotion of construction robots can solve the problem of human resource shortage and improve the quality of decoration. To help the construction robots obtain environmental information, we need to use 3D point cloud, which is widely used in robotics, autonomous driving, and so on. With a good understanding of environmental information, construction robots can work better. However, the dynamic changes of 3D point cloud data may bring difficulties for construction robots to understand environmental information, such as when construction robots renovate houses. The paper proposes a semantic segmentation method for point cloud based on meta-learning. The method includes a basic learning module and a meta-learning module. The basic learning module is responsible for learning data features and evaluating the model, while the meta-learning module is responsible for updating the parameters of the model and improving the model generalization ability. In our work, we pioneered the method of producing datasets for meta-learning in 3D scenes, as well as demonstrated that the Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) algorithm can be applied to process 3D point cloud data. At the same time, experiments show that our method can allow the model to be quickly applied to new environments with a few samples. Our method has important applications."
Latent Space Regularization for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation in Semantic Segmentation,"Deep convolutional neural networks for semantic segmentation achieve outstanding accuracy, however they also have a couple of major drawbacks: first, they do not generalize well to distributions slightly different from the one of the training data; second, they require a huge amount of labeled data for their optimization. In this paper, we introduce feature-level space-shaping regularization strategies to reduce the domain discrepancy in semantic segmentation. In particular, for this purpose we jointly enforce a clustering objective, a perpendicularity constraint and a norm alignment goal on the feature vectors corresponding to source and target samples. Additionally, we propose a novel measure able to capture the relative efficacy of an adaptation strategy compared to supervised training. We verify the effectiveness of such methods in the autonomous driving setting achieving state-of-the-art results in multiple synthetic-to-real road scenes benchmarks."
DCANet: Dense Context-Aware Network for Semantic Segmentation,"As the superiority of context information gradually manifests in advanced semantic segmentation, learning to capture the compact context relationship can help to understand the complex scenes. In contrast to some previous works utilizing the multi-scale context fusion, we propose a novel module, named Dense Context-Aware (DCA) module, to adaptively integrate local detail information with global dependencies. Driven by the contextual relationship, the DCA module can better achieve the aggregation of context information to generate more powerful features. Furthermore, we deliberately design two extended structures based on the DCA modules to further capture the long-range contextual dependency information. By combining the DCA modules in cascade or parallel, our networks use a progressive strategy to improve multi-scale feature representations for robust segmentation. We empirically demonstrate the promising performance of our approach (DCANet) with extensive experiments on three challenging datasets, including PASCAL VOC 2012, Cityscapes, and ADE20K."
One Thing One Click: A Self-Training Approach for Weakly Supervised 3D Semantic Segmentation,"Point cloud semantic segmentation often requires largescale annotated training data, but clearly, point-wise labels are too tedious to prepare. While some recent methods propose to train a 3D network with small percentages of point labels, we take the approach to an extreme and propose ""One Thing One Click,"" meaning that the annotator only needs to label one point per object. To leverage these extremely sparse labels in network training, we design a novel self-training approach, in which we iteratively conduct the training and label propagation, facilitated by a graph propagation module. Also, we adopt a relation network to generate per-category prototype and explicitly model the similarity among graph nodes to generate pseudo labels to guide the iterative training. Experimental results on both ScanNet-v2 and S3DIS show that our self-training approach, with extremely-sparse annotations, outperforms all existing weakly supervised methods for 3D semantic segmentation by a large margin, and our results are also comparable to those of the fully supervised counterparts."
Hierarchical Pyramid Representations for Semantic Segmentation,"Understanding the context of complex and cluttered scenes is a challenging problem for semantic segmentation. However, it is difficult to model the context without prior and additional supervision because the scene's factors, such as the scale, shape, and appearance of objects, vary considerably in these scenes. To solve this, we propose to learn the structures of objects and the hierarchy among objects because context is based on these intrinsic properties. In this study, we design novel hierarchical, contextual, and multiscale pyramidal representations to capture the properties from an input image. Our key idea is the recursive segmentation in different hierarchical regions based on a predefined number of regions and the aggregation of the context in these regions. The aggregated contexts are used to predict the contextual relationship between the regions and partition the regions in the following hierarchical level. Finally, by constructing the pyramid representations from the recursively aggregated context, multiscale and hierarchical properties are attained. In the experiments, we confirmed that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in PASCAL Context."
Semantically Stealthy Adversarial Attacks against Segmentation Models,"Segmentation models have been found to be vulnerable to targeted and non-targeted adversarial attacks. However, the resulting segmentation outputs are often so damaged that it is easy to spot an attack. In this paper, we propose semantically stealthy adversarial attacks which can manipulate targeted labels while preserving non-targeted labels at the same time. One challenge is making semantically meaningful manipulations across datasets and models. Another challenge is avoiding damaging non-targeted labels. To solve these challenges, we consider each input image as prior knowledge to generate perturbations. We also design a special regularizer to help extract features. To evaluate our model's performance, we design three basic attack types, namely `vanishing into the context,' `embedding fake labels,' and `displacing target objects.' Our experiments show that our stealthy adversarial model can attack segmentation models with a relatively high success rate on Cityscapes, Mapillary, and BDD100K. Our framework shows good empirical generalization across datasets and models."
Multi-class motion-based semantic segmentation for ureteroscopy and laser lithotripsy,"Kidney stones represent a considerable burden for public health-care systems. Ureteroscopy with laser lithotripsy has evolved as the most commonly used technique for the treatment of kidney stones. Automated segmentation of kidney stones and laser fiber is an important initial step to performing any automated quantitative analysis of the stones, particularly stone-size estimation, that helps the surgeon decide if the stone requires more fragmentation. Factors such as turbid fluid inside the cavity, specularities, motion blur due to kidney movements and camera motion, bleeding, and stone debris impact the quality of vision within the kidney and lead to extended operative times. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt made towards multi-class segmentation in ureteroscopy and laser lithotripsy data. We propose an end-to-end CNN-based framework for the segmentation of stones and laser fiber. The proposed approach utilizes two sub-networks: HybResUNet, a version of residual U-Net, that uses residual connections in the encoder path of U-Net and a DVFNet that generates DVF predictions which are then used to prune the prediction maps. We also present ablation studies that combine dilated convolutions, recurrent and residual connections, ASPP and attention gate. We propose a compound loss function that improves our segmentation performance. We have also provided an ablation study to determine the optimal data augmentation strategy. Our qualitative and quantitative results illustrate that our proposed method outperforms SOTA methods such as UNet and DeepLabv3+ showing an improvement of 5.2% and 15.93%, respectively, for the combined mean of DSC and JI in our invivo test dataset. We also show that our proposed model generalizes better on a new clinical dataset showing a mean improvement of 25.4%, 20%, and 11% over UNet, HybResUNet, and DeepLabv3+, respectively, for the same metric."
A Semantic Segmentation Network for Urban-Scale Building Footprint Extraction Using RGB Satellite Imagery,"Urban areas consume over two-thirds of the world's energy and account for more than 70 percent of global CO2 emissions. As stated in IPCC's Global Warming of 1.5C report, achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 requires a clear understanding of urban geometry. High-quality building footprint generation from satellite images can accelerate this predictive process and empower municipal decision-making at scale. However, previous Deep Learning-based approaches face consequential issues such as scale invariance and defective footprints, partly due to ever-present class-wise imbalance. Additionally, most approaches require supplemental data such as point cloud data, building height information, and multi-band imagery - which has limited availability and are tedious to produce. In this paper, we propose a modified DeeplabV3+ module with a Dilated Res-Net backbone to generate masks of building footprints from three-channel RGB satellite imagery only. Furthermore, we introduce an F-Beta measure in our objective function to help the model account for skewed class distributions and prevent false-positive footprints. In addition to F-Beta, we incorporate an exponentially weighted boundary loss and use a cross-dataset training strategy to further increase the quality of predictions. As a result, we achieve state-of-the-art performances across three public benchmarks and demonstrate that our RGB-only method produces higher quality visual results and is agnostic to the scale, resolution, and urban density of satellite imagery."
Background-Aware Pooling and Noise-Aware Loss for Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"We address the problem of weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) using bounding box annotations. Although object bounding boxes are good indicators to segment corresponding objects, they do not specify object boundaries, making it hard to train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for semantic segmentation. We find that background regions are perceptually consistent in part within an image, and this can be leveraged to discriminate foreground and background regions inside object bounding boxes. To implement this idea, we propose a novel pooling method, dubbed background-aware pooling (BAP), that focuses more on aggregating foreground features inside the bounding boxes using attention maps. This allows to extract high-quality pseudo segmentation labels to train CNNs for semantic segmentation, but the labels still contain noise especially at object boundaries. To address this problem, we also introduce a noise-aware loss (NAL) that makes the networks less susceptible to incorrect labels. Experimental results demonstrate that learning with our pseudo labels already outperforms state-of-the-art weakly- and semi-supervised methods on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset, and the NAL further boosts the performance."
Half-Real Half-Fake Distillation for Class-Incremental Semantic Segmentation,"Despite their success for semantic segmentation, convolutional neural networks are ill-equipped for incremental learning, \ie, adapting the original segmentation model as new classes are available but the initial training data is not retained. Actually, they are vulnerable to catastrophic forgetting problem. We try to address this issue by ""inverting"" the trained segmentation network to synthesize input images starting from random noise. To avoid setting detailed pixel-wise segmentation maps as the supervision manually, we propose the SegInversion to synthesize images using the image-level labels. To increase the diversity of synthetic images, the Scale-Aware Aggregation module is integrated into SegInversion for controlling the scale (the number of pixels) of synthetic objects. Along with real images of new classes, the synthesized images will be fed into the distillation-based framework to train the new segmentation model which retains the information about previously learned classes, whilst updating the current model to learn the new ones. The proposed method significantly outperforms other incremental learning methods and obtains state-of-the-art performance on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and ADE20K datasets. The code and models will be made publicly available."
Classification of Hematoma: Joint Learning of Semantic Segmentation and Classification,"Cerebral hematoma grows rapidly in 6-24 hours and misprediction of the growth can be fatal if it is not operated by a brain surgeon. There are two types of cerebral hematomas: one that grows rapidly and the other that does not grow rapidly. We are developing the technique of artificial intelligence to determine whether the CT image includes the cerebral hematoma which leads to the rapid growth. This problem has various difficulties: the few positive cases in this classification problem of cerebral hematoma and the targeted hematoma has deformable object. Other difficulties include the imbalance classification, the covariate shift, the small data, and the spurious correlation problems. It is difficult with the plain CNN classification such as VGG. This paper proposes the joint learning of semantic segmentation and classification and evaluate the performance of this."
PiCIE: Unsupervised Semantic Segmentation using Invariance and Equivariance in Clustering,"We present a new framework for semantic segmentation without annotations via clustering. Off-the-shelf clustering methods are limited to curated, single-label, and object-centric images yet real-world data are dominantly uncurated, multi-label, and scene-centric. We extend clustering from images to pixels and assign separate cluster membership to different instances within each image. However, solely relying on pixel-wise feature similarity fails to learn high-level semantic concepts and overfits to low-level visual cues. We propose a method to incorporate geometric consistency as an inductive bias to learn invariance and equivariance for photometric and geometric variations. With our novel learning objective, our framework can learn high-level semantic concepts. Our method, PiCIE (Pixel-level feature Clustering using Invariance and Equivariance), is the first method capable of segmenting both things and stuff categories without any hyperparameter tuning or task-specific pre-processing. Our method largely outperforms existing baselines on COCO and Cityscapes with +17.5 Acc. and +4.5 mIoU. We show that PiCIE gives a better initialization for standard supervised training. The code is available at https://github.com/janghyuncho/PiCIE."
Weakly-Supervised Image Semantic Segmentation Using Graph Convolutional Networks,"This work addresses weakly-supervised image semantic segmentation based on image-level class labels. One common approach to this task is to propagate the activation scores of Class Activation Maps (CAMs) using a random-walk mechanism in order to arrive at complete pseudo labels for training a semantic segmentation network in a fully-supervised manner. However, the feed-forward nature of the random walk imposes no regularization on the quality of the resulting complete pseudo labels. To overcome this issue, we propose a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)-based feature propagation framework. We formulate the generation of complete pseudo labels as a semi-supervised learning task and learn a 2-layer GCN separately for every training image by back-propagating a Laplacian and an entropy regularization loss. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset confirm the superiority of our scheme to several state-of-the-art baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/Xavier-Pan/WSGCN."
Evaluation of Multimodal Semantic Segmentation using RGB-D Data,"Our goal is to develop stable, accurate, and robust semantic scene understanding methods for wide-area scene perception and understanding, especially in challenging outdoor environments. To achieve this, we are exploring and evaluating a range of related technology and solutions, including AI-driven multimodal scene perception, fusion, processing, and understanding. This work reports our efforts on the evaluation of a state-of-the-art approach for semantic segmentation with multiple RGB and depth sensing data. We employ four large datasets composed of diverse urban and terrain scenes and design various experimental methods and metrics. In addition, we also develop new strategies of multi-datasets learning to improve the detection and recognition of unseen objects. Extensive experiments, implementations, and results are reported in the paper."
Geometric Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation,"Simulators can efficiently generate large amounts of labeled synthetic data with perfect supervision for hard-to-label tasks like semantic segmentation. However, they introduce a domain gap that severely hurts real-world performance. We propose to use self-supervised monocular depth estimation as a proxy task to bridge this gap and improve sim-to-real unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). Our Geometric Unsupervised Domain Adaptation method (GUDA) learns a domain-invariant representation via a multi-task objective combining synthetic semantic supervision with real-world geometric constraints on videos. GUDA establishes a new state of the art in UDA for semantic segmentation on three benchmarks, outperforming methods that use domain adversarial learning, self-training, or other self-supervised proxy tasks. Furthermore, we show that our method scales well with the quality and quantity of synthetic data while also improving depth prediction."
Source-Free Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation,"Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) can tackle the challenge that convolutional neural network(CNN)-based approaches for semantic segmentation heavily rely on the pixel-level annotated data, which is labor-intensive. However, existing UDA approaches in this regard inevitably require the full access to source datasets to reduce the gap between the source and target domains during model adaptation, which are impractical in the real scenarios where the source datasets are private, and thus cannot be released along with the well-trained source models. To cope with this issue, we propose a source-free domain adaptation framework for semantic segmentation, namely SFDA, in which only a well-trained source model and an unlabeled target domain dataset are available for adaptation. SFDA not only enables to recover and preserve the source domain knowledge from the source model via knowledge transfer during model adaptation, but also distills valuable information from the target domain for self-supervised learning. The pixel- and patch-level optimization objectives tailored for semantic segmentation are seamlessly integrated in the framework. The extensive experimental results on numerous benchmark datasets highlight the effectiveness of our framework against the existing UDA approaches relying on source data."
Multi-View Radar Semantic Segmentation,"Understanding the scene around the ego-vehicle is key to assisted and autonomous driving. Nowadays, this is mostly conducted using cameras and laser scanners, despite their reduced performances in adverse weather conditions. Automotive radars are low-cost active sensors that measure properties of surrounding objects, including their relative speed, and have the key advantage of not being impacted by rain, snow or fog. However, they are seldom used for scene understanding due to the size and complexity of radar raw data and the lack of annotated datasets. Fortunately, recent open-sourced datasets have opened up research on classification, object detection and semantic segmentation with raw radar signals using end-to-end trainable models. In this work, we propose several novel architectures, and their associated losses, which analyse multiple ""views"" of the range-angle-Doppler radar tensor to segment it semantically. Experiments conducted on the recent CARRADA dataset demonstrate that our best model outperforms alternative models, derived either from the semantic segmentation of natural images or from radar scene understanding, while requiring significantly fewer parameters. Both our code and trained models are available at https://github.com/valeoai/MVRSS."
Category-Adaptive Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation,"Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) becomes more and more popular in tackling real-world problems without ground truth of the target domain. Though tedious annotation work is not required, UDA unavoidably faces two problems: 1) how to narrow the domain discrepancy to boost the transferring performance; 2) how to improve pseudo annotation producing mechanism for self-supervised learning (SSL). In this paper, we focus on UDA for semantic segmentation task. Firstly, we introduce adversarial learning into style gap bridging mechanism to keep the style information from two domains in the similar space. Secondly, to keep the balance of pseudo labels on each category, we propose a category-adaptive threshold mechanism to choose category-wise pseudo labels for SSL. The experiments are conducted using GTA5 as the source domain, Cityscapes as the target domain. The results show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-arts with a noticeable gain on cross-domain adaptation tasks."
Non-Salient Region Object Mining for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation aims to classify every pixel of an input image. Considering the difficulty of acquiring dense labels, researchers have recently been resorting to weak labels to alleviate the annotation burden of segmentation. However, existing works mainly concentrate on expanding the seed of pseudo labels within the image's salient region. In this work, we propose a non-salient region object mining approach for weakly supervised semantic segmentation. We introduce a graph-based global reasoning unit to strengthen the classification network's ability to capture global relations among disjoint and distant regions. This helps the network activate the object features outside the salient area. To further mine the non-salient region objects, we propose to exert the segmentation network's self-correction ability. Specifically, a potential object mining module is proposed to reduce the false-negative rate in pseudo labels. Moreover, we propose a non-salient region masking module for complex images to generate masked pseudo labels. Our non-salient region masking module helps further discover the objects in the non-salient region. Extensive experiments on the PASCAL VOC dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art results compared to current methods."
Input-Output Balanced Framework for Long-tailed LiDAR Semantic Segmentation,"A thorough and holistic scene understanding is crucial for autonomous vehicles, where LiDAR semantic segmentation plays an indispensable role. However, most existing methods focus on the network design while neglecting the inherent difficulty, imbalanced data distribution in the realistic dataset (also named long-tailed distribution), which narrows down the capability of state-of-the-art methods. In this paper, we propose an input-output balanced framework to handle the issue of long-tailed distribution. Specifically, for the input space, we synthesize these tailed instances from mesh models and well simulate the position and density distribution of LiDAR scan, which enhances the input data balance and improves the data diversity. For the output space, a multi-head block is proposed to group different categories based on their shapes and instance amounts, which alleviates the biased representation of dominating category during the feature learning. We evaluate the proposed model on two large-scale datasets, SemanticKITTI and nuScenes, where state-of-the-art results demonstrate its effectiveness. The proposed new modules can also be used as a plug-and-play, and we apply them on various backbones and datasets, showing its good generalization ability."
Learning from Pixel-Level Label Noise: A New Perspective for Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"This paper addresses semi-supervised semantic segmentation by exploiting a small set of images with pixel-level annotations (strong supervisions) and a large set of images with only image-level annotations (weak supervisions). Most existing approaches aim to generate accurate pixel-level labels from weak supervisions. However, we observe that those generated labels still inevitably contain noisy labels. Motivated by this observation, we present a novel perspective and formulate this task as a problem of learning with pixel-level label noise. Existing noisy label methods, nevertheless, mainly aim at image-level tasks, which can not capture the relationship between neighboring labels in one image. Therefore, we propose a graph based label noise detection and correction framework to deal with pixel-level noisy labels. In particular, for the generated pixel-level noisy labels from weak supervisions by Class Activation Map (CAM), we train a clean segmentation model with strong supervisions to detect the clean labels from these noisy labels according to the cross-entropy loss. Then, we adopt a superpixel-based graph to represent the relations of spatial adjacency and semantic similarity between pixels in one image. Finally we correct the noisy labels using a Graph Attention Network (GAT) supervised by detected clean labels. We comprehensively conduct experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012, PASCAL-Context and MS-COCO datasets. The experimental results show that our proposed semi supervised method achieves the state-of-the-art performances and even outperforms the fully-supervised models on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS-COCO datasets in some cases."
Tilted Cross Entropy (TCE): Promoting Fairness in Semantic Segmentation,"Traditional empirical risk minimization (ERM) for semantic segmentation can disproportionately advantage or disadvantage certain target classes in favor of an (unfair but) improved overall performance. Inspired by the recently introduced tilted ERM (TERM), we propose tilted cross-entropy (TCE) loss and adapt it to the semantic segmentation setting to minimize performance disparity among target classes and promote fairness. Through quantitative and qualitative performance analyses, we demonstrate that the proposed Stochastic TCE for semantic segmentation can efficiently improve the low-performing classes of Cityscapes and ADE20k datasets trained with multi-class cross-entropy (MCCE), and also results in improved overall fairness."
Spirit Distillation: Precise Real-time Semantic Segmentation of Road Scenes with Insufficient Data,"Semantic segmentation of road scenes is one of the key technologies for realizing autonomous driving scene perception, and the effectiveness of deep Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs) for this task has been demonstrated. State-of-art CNNs for semantic segmentation suffer from excessive computations as well as large-scale training data requirement. Inspired by the ideas of Fine-tuning-based Transfer Learning (FTT) and feature-based knowledge distillation, we propose a new knowledge distillation method for cross-domain knowledge transference and efficient data-insufficient network training, named Spirit Distillation(SD), which allow the student network to mimic the teacher network to extract general features, so that a compact and accurate student network can be trained for real-time semantic segmentation of road scenes. Then, in order to further alleviate the trouble of insufficient data and improve the robustness of the student, an Enhanced Spirit Distillation (ESD) method is proposed, which commits to exploit a more comprehensive general features extraction capability by considering images from both the target and the proximity domains as input. To our knowledge, this paper is a pioneering work on the application of knowledge distillation to few-shot learning. Persuasive experiments conducted on Cityscapes semantic segmentation with the prior knowledge transferred from COCO2017 and KITTI demonstrate that our methods can train a better student network (mIOU and high-precision accuracy boost by 1.4% and 8.2% respectively, with 78.2% segmentation variance) with only 41.8% FLOPs (see Fig. 1)."
Evidential fully convolutional network for semantic segmentation,"We propose a hybrid architecture composed of a fully convolutional network (FCN) and a Dempster-Shafer layer for image semantic segmentation. In the so-called evidential FCN (E-FCN), an encoder-decoder architecture first extracts pixel-wise feature maps from an input image. A Dempster-Shafer layer then computes mass functions at each pixel location based on distances to prototypes. Finally, a utility layer performs semantic segmentation from mass functions and allows for imprecise classification of ambiguous pixels and outliers. We propose an end-to-end learning strategy for jointly updating the network parameters, which can make use of soft (imprecise) labels. Experiments using three databases (Pascal VOC 2011, MIT-scene Parsing and SIFT Flow) show that the proposed combination improves the accuracy and calibration of semantic segmentation by assigning confusing pixels to multi-class sets."
A Fine-Grained Dataset and its Efficient Semantic Segmentation for Unstructured Driving Scenarios,"Research in autonomous driving for unstructured environments suffers from a lack of semantically labeled datasets compared to its urban counterpart. Urban and unstructured outdoor environments are challenging due to the varying lighting and weather conditions during a day and across seasons. In this paper, we introduce TAS500, a novel semantic segmentation dataset for autonomous driving in unstructured environments. TAS500 offers fine-grained vegetation and terrain classes to learn drivable surfaces and natural obstacles in outdoor scenes effectively. We evaluate the performance of modern semantic segmentation models with an additional focus on their efficiency. Our experiments demonstrate the advantages of fine-grained semantic classes to improve the overall prediction accuracy, especially along the class boundaries. The dataset and pretrained model are available at mucar3.de/icpr2020-tas500."
MSCFNet: A Lightweight Network With Multi-Scale Context Fusion for Real-Time Semantic Segmentation,"In recent years, how to strike a good trade-off between accuracy and inference speed has become the core issue for real-time semantic segmentation applications, which plays a vital role in real-world scenarios such as autonomous driving systems and drones. In this study, we devise a novel lightweight network using a multi-scale context fusion (MSCFNet) scheme, which explores an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture to dispose this problem. More specifically, the encoder adopts some developed efficient asymmetric residual (EAR) modules, which are composed of factorization depth-wise convolution and dilation convolution. Meanwhile, instead of complicated computation, simple deconvolution is applied in the decoder to further reduce the amount of parameters while still maintaining high segmentation accuracy. Also, MSCFNet has branches with efficient attention modules from different stages of the network to well capture multi-scale contextual information. Then we combine them before the final classification to enhance the expression of the features and improve the segmentation efficiency. Comprehensive experiments on challenging datasets have demonstrated that the proposed MSCFNet, which contains only 1.15M parameters, achieves 71.9\% Mean IoU on the Cityscapes testing dataset and can run at over 50 FPS on a single Titan XP GPU configuration."
Coarse-to-Fine Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation with Photometric Alignment and Category-Center Regularization,"Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) in semantic segmentation is a fundamental yet promising task relieving the need for laborious annotation works. However, the domain shifts/discrepancies problem in this task compromise the final segmentation performance. Based on our observation, the main causes of the domain shifts are differences in imaging conditions, called image-level domain shifts, and differences in object category configurations called category-level domain shifts. In this paper, we propose a novel UDA pipeline that unifies image-level alignment and category-level feature distribution regularization in a coarse-to-fine manner. Specifically, on the coarse side, we propose a photometric alignment module that aligns an image in the source domain with a reference image from the target domain using a set of image-level operators; on the fine side, we propose a category-oriented triplet loss that imposes a soft constraint to regularize category centers in the source domain and a self-supervised consistency regularization method in the target domain. Experimental results show that our proposed pipeline improves the generalization capability of the final segmentation model and significantly outperforms all previous state-of-the-arts."
MLAN: Multi-Level Adversarial Network for Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation,"Recent progresses in domain adaptive semantic segmentation demonstrate the effectiveness of adversarial learning (AL) in unsupervised domain adaptation. However, most adversarial learning based methods align source and target distributions at a global image level but neglect the inconsistency around local image regions. This paper presents a novel multi-level adversarial network (MLAN) that aims to address inter-domain inconsistency at both global image level and local region level optimally. MLAN has two novel designs, namely, region-level adversarial learning (RL-AL) and co-regularized adversarial learning (CR-AL). Specifically, RL-AL models prototypical regional context-relations explicitly in the feature space of a labelled source domain and transfers them to an unlabelled target domain via adversarial learning. CR-AL fuses region-level AL and image-level AL optimally via mutual regularization. In addition, we design a multi-level consistency map that can guide domain adaptation in both input space (i.e., image-to-image translation) and output space (i.e., self-training) effectively. Extensive experiments show that MLAN outperforms the state-of-the-art with a large margin consistently across multiple datasets."
OFFSEG: A Semantic Segmentation Framework For Off-Road Driving,"Off-road image semantic segmentation is challenging due to the presence of uneven terrains, unstructured class boundaries, irregular features and strong textures. These aspects affect the perception of the vehicle from which the information is used for path planning. Current off-road datasets exhibit difficulties like class imbalance and understanding of varying environmental topography. To overcome these issues we propose a framework for off-road semantic segmentation called as OFFSEG that involves (i) a pooled class semantic segmentation with four classes (sky, traversable region, non-traversable region and obstacle) using state-of-the-art deep learning architectures (ii) a colour segmentation methodology to segment out specific sub-classes (grass, puddle, dirt, gravel, etc.) from the traversable region for better scene understanding. The evaluation of the framework is carried out on two off-road driving datasets, namely, RELLIS-3D and RUGD. We have also tested proposed framework in IISERB campus frames. The results show that OFFSEG achieves good performance and also provides detailed information on the traversable region."
Dilated SpineNet for Semantic Segmentation,"Scale-permuted networks have shown promising results on object bounding box detection and instance segmentation. Scale permutation and cross-scale fusion of features enable the network to capture multi-scale semantics while preserving spatial resolution. In this work, we evaluate this meta-architecture design on semantic segmentation - another vision task that benefits from high spatial resolution and multi-scale feature fusion at different network stages. By further leveraging dilated convolution operations, we propose SpineNet-Seg, a network discovered by NAS that is searched from the DeepLabv3 system. SpineNet-Seg is designed with a better scale-permuted network topology with customized dilation ratios per block on a semantic segmentation task. SpineNet-Seg models outperform the DeepLabv3/v3+ baselines at all model scales on multiple popular benchmarks in speed and accuracy. In particular, our SpineNet-S143+ model achieves the new state-of-the-art on the popular Cityscapes benchmark at 83.04% mIoU and attained strong performance on the PASCAL VOC2012 benchmark at 85.56% mIoU. SpineNet-Seg models also show promising results on a challenging Street View segmentation dataset. Code and checkpoints will be open-sourced."
CFPNet: Channel-wise Feature Pyramid for Real-Time Semantic Segmentation,"Real-time semantic segmentation is playing a more important role in computer vision, due to the growing demand for mobile devices and autonomous driving. Therefore, it is very important to achieve a good trade-off among performance, model size and inference speed. In this paper, we propose a Channel-wise Feature Pyramid (CFP) module to balance those factors. Based on the CFP module, we built CFPNet for real-time semantic segmentation which applied a series of dilated convolution channels to extract effective features. Experiments on Cityscapes and CamVid datasets show that the proposed CFPNet achieves an effective combination of those factors. For the Cityscapes test dataset, CFPNet achieves 70.1% class-wise mIoU with only 0.55 million parameters and 2.5 MB memory. The inference speed can reach 30 FPS on a single RTX 2080Ti GPU with a 1024x2048-pixel image."
Deep Neural Networks Learn Meta-Structures from Noisy Labels in Semantic Segmentation,"How deep neural networks (DNNs) learn from noisy labels has been studied extensively in image classification but much less in image segmentation. So far, our understanding of the learning behavior of DNNs trained by noisy segmentation labels remains limited. In this study, we address this deficiency in both binary segmentation of biological microscopy images and multi-class segmentation of natural images. We generate extremely noisy labels by randomly sampling a small fraction (e.g., 10%) or flipping a large fraction (e.g., 90%) of the ground truth labels. When trained with these noisy labels, DNNs provide largely the same segmentation performance as trained by the original ground truth. This indicates that DNNs learn structures hidden in labels rather than pixel-level labels per se in their supervised training for semantic segmentation. We refer to these hidden structures in labels as meta-structures. When DNNs are trained by labels with different perturbations to the meta-structure, we find consistent degradation in their segmentation performance. In contrast, incorporation of meta-structure information substantially improves performance of an unsupervised segmentation model developed for binary semantic segmentation. We define meta-structures mathematically as spatial density distributions and show both theoretically and experimentally how this formulation explains key observed learning behavior of DNNs."
Cross-Dataset Collaborative Learning for Semantic Segmentation in Autonomous Driving,"Semantic segmentation is an important task for scene understanding in self-driving cars and robotics, which aims to assign dense labels for all pixels in the image. Existing work typically improves semantic segmentation performance by exploring different network architectures on a target dataset. Little attention has been paid to build a unified system by simultaneously learning from multiple datasets due to the inherent distribution shift across different datasets. In this paper, we propose a simple, flexible, and general method for semantic segmentation, termed Cross-Dataset Collaborative Learning (CDCL). Our goal is to train a unified model for improving the performance in each dataset by leveraging information from all the datasets. Specifically, we first introduce a family of Dataset-Aware Blocks (DAB) as the fundamental computing units of the network, which help capture homogeneous convolutional representations and heterogeneous statistics across different datasets. Second, we present a Dataset Alternation Training (DAT) mechanism to facilitate the collaborative optimization procedure. We conduct extensive evaluations on diverse semantic segmentation datasets for autonomous driving. Experiments demonstrate that our method consistently achieves notable improvements over prior single-dataset and cross-dataset training methods without introducing extra FLOPs. Particularly, with the same architecture of PSPNet (ResNet-18), our method outperforms the single-dataset baseline by 5.65\%, 6.57\%, and 5.79\% mIoU on the validation sets of Cityscapes, BDD100K, CamVid, respectively. We also apply CDCL for point cloud 3D semantic segmentation and achieve improved performance, which further validates the superiority and generality of our method. Code and models will be released."
A Novel Upsampling and Context Convolution for Image Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation, which refers to pixel-wise classification of an image, is a fundamental topic in computer vision owing to its growing importance in robot vision and autonomous driving industries. It provides rich information about objects in the scene such as object boundary, category, and location. Recent methods for semantic segmentation often employ an encoder-decoder structure using deep convolutional neural networks. The encoder part extracts feature of the image using several filters and pooling operations, whereas the decoder part gradually recovers the low-resolution feature maps of the encoder into a full input resolution feature map for pixel-wise prediction. However, the encoder-decoder variants for semantic segmentation suffer from severe spatial information loss, caused by pooling operations or convolutions with stride, and does not consider the context in the scene. In this paper, we propose a dense upsampling convolution method based on guided filtering to effectively preserve the spatial information of the image in the network. We further propose a novel local context convolution method that not only covers larger-scale objects in the scene but covers them densely for precise object boundary delineation. Theoretical analyses and experimental results on several benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of our method. Qualitatively, our approach delineates object boundaries at a level of accuracy that is beyond the current excellent methods. Quantitatively, we report a new record of 82.86% and 81.62% of pixel accuracy on ADE20K and Pascal-Context benchmark datasets, respectively. In comparison with the state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method offers promising improvements."
Bootstrapped Self-Supervised Training with Monocular Video for Semantic Segmentation and Depth Estimation,"For a robot deployed in the world, it is desirable to have the ability of autonomous learning to improve its initial pre-set knowledge. We formalize this as a bootstrapped self-supervised learning problem where a system is initially bootstrapped with supervised training on a labeled dataset and we look for a self-supervised training method that can subsequently improve the system over the supervised training baseline using only unlabeled data. In this work, we leverage temporal consistency between frames in monocular video to perform this bootstrapped self-supervised training. We show that a well-trained state-of-the-art semantic segmentation network can be further improved through our method. In addition, we show that the bootstrapped self-supervised training framework can help a network learn depth estimation better than pure supervised training or self-supervised training."
Investigate Indistinguishable Points in Semantic Segmentation of 3D Point Cloud,"This paper investigates the indistinguishable points (difficult to predict label) in semantic segmentation for large-scale 3D point clouds. The indistinguishable points consist of those located in complex boundary, points with similar local textures but different categories, and points in isolate small hard areas, which largely harm the performance of 3D semantic segmentation. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Indistinguishable Area Focalization Network (IAF-Net), which selects indistinguishable points adaptively by utilizing the hierarchical semantic features and enhances fine-grained features for points especially those indistinguishable points. We also introduce multi-stage loss to improve the feature representation in a progressive way. Moreover, in order to analyze the segmentation performances of indistinguishable areas, we propose a new evaluation metric called Indistinguishable Points Based Metric (IPBM). Our IAF-Net achieves the comparable results with state-of-the-art performance on several popular 3D point cloud datasets e.g. S3DIS and ScanNet, and clearly outperforms other methods on IPBM."
Unsupervised Anomaly Segmentation using Image-Semantic Cycle Translation,"The goal of unsupervised anomaly segmentation (UAS) is to detect the pixel-level anomalies unseen during training. It is a promising field in the medical imaging community, e.g, we can use the model trained with only healthy data to segment the lesions of rare diseases. Existing methods are mainly based on Information Bottleneck, whose underlying principle is modeling the distribution of normal anatomy via learning to compress and recover the healthy data with a low-dimensional manifold, and then detecting lesions as the outlier from this learned distribution. However, this dimensionality reduction inevitably damages the localization information, which is especially essential for pixel-level anomaly detection. In this paper, to alleviate this issue, we introduce the semantic space of healthy anatomy in the process of modeling healthy-data distribution. More precisely, we view the couple of segmentation and synthesis as a special Autoencoder, and propose a novel cycle translation framework with a journey of 'image->semantic->image'. Experimental results on the BraTS and ISLES databases show that the proposed approach achieves significantly superior performance compared to several prior methods and segments the anomalies more accurately."
EADNet: Efficient Asymmetric Dilated Network for Semantic Segmentation,"Due to real-time image semantic segmentation needs on power constrained edge devices, there has been an increasing desire to design lightweight semantic segmentation neural network, to simultaneously reduce computational cost and increase inference speed. In this paper, we propose an efficient asymmetric dilated semantic segmentation network, named EADNet, which consists of multiple developed asymmetric convolution branches with different dilation rates to capture the variable shapes and scales information of an image. Specially, a multi-scale multi-shape receptive field convolution (MMRFC) block with only a few parameters is designed to capture such information. Experimental results on the Cityscapes dataset demonstrate that our proposed EADNet achieves segmentation mIoU of 67.1 with smallest number of parameters (only 0.35M) among mainstream lightweight semantic segmentation networks."
BBAM: Bounding Box Attribution Map for Weakly Supervised Semantic and Instance Segmentation,"Weakly supervised segmentation methods using bounding box annotations focus on obtaining a pixel-level mask from each box containing an object. Existing methods typically depend on a class-agnostic mask generator, which operates on the low-level information intrinsic to an image. In this work, we utilize higher-level information from the behavior of a trained object detector, by seeking the smallest areas of the image from which the object detector produces almost the same result as it does from the whole image. These areas constitute a bounding-box attribution map (BBAM), which identifies the target object in its bounding box and thus serves as pseudo ground-truth for weakly supervised semantic and instance segmentation. This approach significantly outperforms recent comparable techniques on both the PASCAL VOC and MS COCO benchmarks in weakly supervised semantic and instance segmentation. In addition, we provide a detailed analysis of our method, offering deeper insight into the behavior of the BBAM."
Anti-Adversarially Manipulated Attributions for Weakly and Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Weakly supervised semantic segmentation produces a pixel-level localization from a classifier, but it is likely to restrict its focus to a small discriminative region of the target object. AdvCAM is an attribution map of an image that is manipulated to increase the classification score. This manipulation is realized in an anti-adversarial manner, which perturbs the images along pixel gradients in the opposite direction from those used in an adversarial attack. It forces regions initially considered not to be discriminative to become involved in subsequent classifications, and produces attribution maps that successively identify more regions of the target object. In addition, we introduce a new regularization procedure that inhibits the incorrect attribution of regions unrelated to the target object and limits the attributions of the regions that already have high scores. On PASCAL VOC 2012 test images, we achieve mIoUs of 68.0 and 76.9 for weakly and semi-supervised semantic segmentation respectively, which represent a new state-of-the-art."
Lite-HDSeg: LiDAR Semantic Segmentation Using Lite Harmonic Dense Convolutions,"Autonomous driving vehicles and robotic systems rely on accurate perception of their surroundings. Scene understanding is one of the crucial components of perception modules. Among all available sensors, LiDARs are one of the essential sensing modalities of autonomous driving systems due to their active sensing nature with high resolution of sensor readings. Accurate and fast semantic segmentation methods are needed to fully utilize LiDAR sensors for scene understanding. In this paper, we present Lite-HDSeg, a novel real-time convolutional neural network for semantic segmentation of full 3D LiDAR point clouds. Lite-HDSeg can achieve the best accuracy vs. computational complexity trade-off in SemanticKitti benchmark and is designed on the basis of a new encoder-decoder architecture with light-weight harmonic dense convolutions as its core. Moreover, we introduce ICM, an improved global contextual module to capture multi-scale contextual features, and MCSPN, a multi-class Spatial Propagation Network to further refine the semantic boundaries. Our experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art semantic segmentation approaches which can run real-time, thus is suitable for robotic and autonomous driving applications."
GSVNet: Guided Spatially-Varying Convolution for Fast Semantic Segmentation on Video,"This paper addresses fast semantic segmentation on video.Video segmentation often calls for real-time, or even fasterthan real-time, processing. One common recipe for conserving computation arising from feature extraction is to propagate features of few selected keyframes. However, recent advances in fast image segmentation make these solutions less attractive. To leverage fast image segmentation for furthering video segmentation, we propose a simple yet efficient propagation framework. Specifically, we perform lightweight flow estimation in 1/8-downscaled image space for temporal warping in segmentation outpace space. Moreover, we introduce a guided spatially-varying convolution for fusing segmentations derived from the previous and current frames, to mitigate propagation error and enable lightweight feature extraction on non-keyframes. Experimental results on Cityscapes and CamVid show that our scheme achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy-throughput trade-off on video segmentation."
S3Net: 3D LiDAR Sparse Semantic Segmentation Network,"Semantic Segmentation is a crucial component in the perception systems of many applications, such as robotics and autonomous driving that rely on accurate environmental perception and understanding. In literature, several approaches are introduced to attempt LiDAR semantic segmentation task, such as projection-based (range-view or birds-eye-view), and voxel-based approaches. However, they either abandon the valuable 3D topology and geometric relations and suffer from information loss introduced in the projection process or are inefficient. Therefore, there is a need for accurate models capable of processing the 3D driving-scene point cloud in 3D space. In this paper, we propose S3Net, a novel convolutional neural network for LiDAR point cloud semantic segmentation. It adopts an encoder-decoder backbone that consists of Sparse Intra-channel Attention Module (SIntraAM), and Sparse Inter-channel Attention Module (SInterAM) to emphasize the fine details of both within each feature map and among nearby feature maps. To extract the global contexts in deeper layers, we introduce Sparse Residual Tower based upon sparse convolution that suits varying sparsity of LiDAR point cloud. In addition, geo-aware anisotrophic loss is leveraged to emphasize the semantic boundaries and penalize the noise within each predicted regions, leading to a robust prediction. Our experimental results show that the proposed method leads to a large improvement (12\%) compared to its baseline counterpart (MinkNet42 \cite{choy20194d}) on SemanticKITTI \cite{DBLP:conf/iccv/BehleyGMQBSG19} test set and achieves state-of-the-art mIoU accuracy of semantic segmentation approaches."
Scale-aware Neural Network for Semantic Segmentation of Multi-resolution Remote Sensing Images,"Assigning geospatial objects with specific categories at the pixel level is a fundamental task in remote sensing image analysis. Along with rapid development in sensor technologies, remotely sensed images can be captured at multiple spatial resolutions (MSR) with information content manifested at different scales. Extracting information from these MSR images represents huge opportunities for enhanced feature representation and characterisation. However, MSR images suffer from two critical issues: 1) increased scale variation of geo-objects and 2) loss of detailed information at coarse spatial resolutions. To bridge these gaps, in this paper, we propose a novel scale-aware neural network (SaNet) for semantic segmentation of MSR remotely sensed imagery. SaNet deploys a densely connected feature network (DCFFM) module to capture high-quality multi-scale context, such that the scale variation is handled properly and the quality of segmentation is increased for both large and small objects. A spatial feature recalibration (SFRM) module is further incorporated into the network to learn intact semantic content with enhanced spatial relationships, where the negative effects of information loss are removed. The combination of DCFFM and SFRM allows SaNet to learn scale-aware feature representation, which outperforms the existing multi-scale feature representation. Extensive experiments on three semantic segmentation datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed SaNet in cross-resolution segmentation."
Discriminative Region Suppression for Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) using image-level labels has recently attracted much attention for reducing annotation costs. Existing WSSS methods utilize localization maps from the classification network to generate pseudo segmentation labels. However, since localization maps obtained from the classifier focus only on sparse discriminative object regions, it is difficult to generate high-quality segmentation labels. To address this issue, we introduce discriminative region suppression (DRS) module that is a simple yet effective method to expand object activation regions. DRS suppresses the attention on discriminative regions and spreads it to adjacent non-discriminative regions, generating dense localization maps. DRS requires few or no additional parameters and can be plugged into any network. Furthermore, we introduce an additional learning strategy to give a self-enhancement of localization maps, named localization map refinement learning. Benefiting from this refinement learning, localization maps are refined and enhanced by recovering some missing parts or removing noise itself. Due to its simplicity and effectiveness, our approach achieves mIoU 71.4% on the PASCAL VOC 2012 segmentation benchmark using only image-level labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The code is available at https://github.com/qjadud1994/DRS."
Semantic Segmentation for Real Point Cloud Scenes via Bilateral Augmentation and Adaptive Fusion,"Given the prominence of current 3D sensors, a fine-grained analysis on the basic point cloud data is worthy of further investigation. Particularly, real point cloud scenes can intuitively capture complex surroundings in the real world, but due to 3D data's raw nature, it is very challenging for machine perception. In this work, we concentrate on the essential visual task, semantic segmentation, for large-scale point cloud data collected in reality. On the one hand, to reduce the ambiguity in nearby points, we augment their local context by fully utilizing both geometric and semantic features in a bilateral structure. On the other hand, we comprehensively interpret the distinctness of the points from multiple resolutions and represent the feature map following an adaptive fusion method at point-level for accurate semantic segmentation. Further, we provide specific ablation studies and intuitive visualizations to validate our key modules. By comparing with state-of-the-art networks on three different benchmarks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our network."
PointFlow: Flowing Semantics Through Points for Aerial Image Segmentation,"Aerial Image Segmentation is a particular semantic segmentation problem and has several challenging characteristics that general semantic segmentation does not have. There are two critical issues: The one is an extremely foreground-background imbalanced distribution, and the other is multiple small objects along with the complex background. Such problems make the recent dense affinity context modeling perform poorly even compared with baselines due to over-introduced background context. To handle these problems, we propose a point-wise affinity propagation module based on the Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) framework, named PointFlow. Rather than dense affinity learning, a sparse affinity map is generated upon selected points between the adjacent features, which reduces the noise introduced by the background while keeping efficiency. In particular, we design a dual point matcher to select points from the salient area and object boundaries, respectively. Experimental results on three different aerial segmentation datasets suggest that the proposed method is more effective and efficient than state-of-the-art general semantic segmentation methods. Especially, our methods achieve the best speed and accuracy trade-off on three aerial benchmarks. Further experiments on three general semantic segmentation datasets prove the generality of our method. Code will be provided in (https: //github.com/lxtGH/PFSegNets)."
Continual Semantic Segmentation via Repulsion-Attraction of Sparse and Disentangled Latent Representations,"Deep neural networks suffer from the major limitation of catastrophic forgetting old tasks when learning new ones. In this paper we focus on class incremental continual learning in semantic segmentation, where new categories are made available over time while previous training data is not retained. The proposed continual learning scheme shapes the latent space to reduce forgetting whilst improving the recognition of novel classes. Our framework is driven by three novel components which we also combine on top of existing techniques effortlessly. First, prototypes matching enforces latent space consistency on old classes, constraining the encoder to produce similar latent representation for previously seen classes in the subsequent steps. Second, features sparsification allows to make room in the latent space to accommodate novel classes. Finally, contrastive learning is employed to cluster features according to their semantics while tearing apart those of different classes. Extensive evaluation on the Pascal VOC2012 and ADE20K datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods."
Learning Class-Agnostic Pseudo Mask Generation for Box-Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Recently, several weakly supervised learning methods have been devoted to utilize bounding box supervision for training deep semantic segmentation models. Most existing methods usually leverage the generic proposal generators (e.g., dense CRF and MCG) to produce enhanced segmentation masks for further training segmentation models. These proposal generators, however, are generic and not specifically designed for box-supervised semantic segmentation, thereby leaving some leeway for improving segmentation performance. In this paper, we aim at seeking for a more accurate learning-based class-agnostic pseudo mask generator tailored to box-supervised semantic segmentation. To this end, we resort to a pixel-level annotated auxiliary dataset where the class labels are non-overlapped with those of the box-annotated dataset. For learning pseudo mask generator from the auxiliary dataset, we present a bi-level optimization formulation. In particular, the lower subproblem is used to learn box-supervised semantic segmentation, while the upper subproblem is used to learn an optimal class-agnostic pseudo mask generator. The learned pseudo segmentation mask generator can then be deployed to the box-annotated dataset for improving weakly supervised semantic segmentation. Experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset show that the learned pseudo mask generator is effective in boosting segmentation performance, and our method can further close the performance gap between box-supervised and fully-supervised models. Our code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/Vious/LPG_BBox_Segmentation ."
MetaCorrection: Domain-aware Meta Loss Correction for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation in Semantic Segmentation,"Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer the knowledge from the labeled source domain to the unlabeled target domain. Existing self-training based UDA approaches assign pseudo labels for target data and treat them as ground truth labels to fully leverage unlabeled target data for model adaptation. However, the generated pseudo labels from the model optimized on the source domain inevitably contain noise due to the domain gap. To tackle this issue, we advance a MetaCorrection framework, where a Domain-aware Meta-learning strategy is devised to benefit Loss Correction (DMLC) for UDA semantic segmentation. In particular, we model the noise distribution of pseudo labels in target domain by introducing a noise transition matrix (NTM) and construct meta data set with domain-invariant source data to guide the estimation of NTM. Through the risk minimization on the meta data set, the optimized NTM thus can correct the noisy issues in pseudo labels and enhance the generalization ability of the model on the target data. Considering the capacity gap between shallow and deep features, we further employ the proposed DMLC strategy to provide matched and compatible supervision signals for different level features, thereby ensuring deep adaptation. Extensive experimental results highlight the effectiveness of our method against existing state-of-the-art methods on three benchmarks."
Use square root affinity to regress labels in semantic segmentation,"Semantic segmentation is a basic but non-trivial task in computer vision. Many previous work focus on utilizing affinity patterns to enhance segmentation networks. Most of these studies use the affinity matrix as a kind of feature fusion weights, which is part of modules embedded in the network, such as attention models and non-local models. In this paper, we associate affinity matrix with labels, exploiting the affinity in a supervised way. Specifically, we utilize the label to generate a multi-scale label affinity matrix as a structural supervision, and we use a square root kernel to compute a non-local affinity matrix on output layers. With such two affinities, we define a novel loss called Affinity Regression loss (AR loss), which can be an auxiliary loss providing pair-wise similarity penalty. Our model is easy to train and adds little computational burden without run-time inference. Extensive experiments on NYUv2 dataset and Cityscapes dataset demonstrate that our proposed method is sufficient in promoting semantic segmentation networks."
Multi-Source Domain Adaptation with Collaborative Learning for Semantic Segmentation,"Multi-source unsupervised domain adaptation~(MSDA) aims at adapting models trained on multiple labeled source domains to an unlabeled target domain. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-source domain adaptation framework based on collaborative learning for semantic segmentation. Firstly, a simple image translation method is introduced to align the pixel value distribution to reduce the gap between source domains and target domain to some extent. Then, to fully exploit the essential semantic information across source domains, we propose a collaborative learning method for domain adaptation without seeing any data from target domain. In addition, similar to the setting of unsupervised domain adaptation, unlabeled target domain data is leveraged to further improve the performance of domain adaptation. This is achieved by additionally constraining the outputs of multiple adaptation models with pseudo labels online generated by an ensembled model. Extensive experiments and ablation studies are conducted on the widely-used domain adaptation benchmark datasets in semantic segmentation. Our proposed method achieves 59.0\% mIoU on the validation set of Cityscapes by training on the labeled Synscapes and GTA5 datasets and unlabeled training set of Cityscapes. It significantly outperforms all previous state-of-the-arts single-source and multi-source unsupervised domain adaptation methods."
Semi-supervised Domain Adaptation based on Dual-level Domain Mixing for Semantic Segmentation,"Data-driven based approaches, in spite of great success in many tasks, have poor generalization when applied to unseen image domains, and require expensive cost of annotation especially for dense pixel prediction tasks such as semantic segmentation. Recently, both unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) from large amounts of synthetic data and semi-supervised learning (SSL) with small set of labeled data have been studied to alleviate this issue. However, there is still a large gap on performance compared to their supervised counterparts. We focus on a more practical setting of semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) where both a small set of labeled target data and large amounts of labeled source data are available. To address the task of SSDA, a novel framework based on dual-level domain mixing is proposed. The proposed framework consists of three stages. First, two kinds of data mixing methods are proposed to reduce domain gap in both region-level and sample-level respectively. We can obtain two complementary domain-mixed teachers based on dual-level mixed data from holistic and partial views respectively. Then, a student model is learned by distilling knowledge from these two teachers. Finally, pseudo labels of unlabeled data are generated in a self-training manner for another few rounds of teachers training. Extensive experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed framework on synthetic-to-real semantic segmentation benchmarks."
Repurposing GANs for One-shot Semantic Part Segmentation,"While GANs have shown success in realistic image generation, the idea of using GANs for other tasks unrelated to synthesis is underexplored. Do GANs learn meaningful structural parts of objects during their attempt to reproduce those objects? In this work, we test this hypothesis and propose a simple and effective approach based on GANs for semantic part segmentation that requires as few as one label example along with an unlabeled dataset. Our key idea is to leverage a trained GAN to extract pixel-wise representation from the input image and use it as feature vectors for a segmentation network. Our experiments demonstrate that GANs representation is ""readily discriminative"" and produces surprisingly good results that are comparable to those from supervised baselines trained with significantly more labels. We believe this novel repurposing of GANs underlies a new class of unsupervised representation learning that is applicable to many other tasks. More results are available at https://repurposegans.github.io/."
Perception Framework through Real-Time Semantic Segmentation and Scene Recognition on a Wearable System for the Visually Impaired,"As the scene information, including objectness and scene type, are important for people with visual impairment, in this work we present a multi-task efficient perception system for the scene parsing and recognition tasks. Building on the compact ResNet backbone, our designed network architecture has two paths with shared parameters. In the structure, the semantic segmentation path integrates fast attention, with the aim of harvesting long-range contextual information in an efficient manner. Simultaneously, the scene recognition path attains the scene type inference by passing the semantic features into semantic-driven attention networks and combining the semantic extracted representations with the RGB extracted representations through a gated attention module. In the experiments, we have verified the systems' accuracy and efficiency on both public datasets and real-world scenes. This system runs on a wearable belt with an Intel RealSense LiDAR camera and an Nvidia Jetson AGX Xavier processor, which can accompany visually impaired people and provide assistive scene information in their navigation tasks."
Learning Statistical Texture for Semantic Segmentation,"Existing semantic segmentation works mainly focus on learning the contextual information in high-level semantic features with CNNs. In order to maintain a precise boundary, low-level texture features are directly skip-connected into the deeper layers. Nevertheless, texture features are not only about local structure, but also include global statistical knowledge of the input image. In this paper, we fully take advantages of the low-level texture features and propose a novel Statistical Texture Learning Network (STLNet) for semantic segmentation. For the first time, STLNet analyzes the distribution of low level information and efficiently utilizes them for the task. Specifically, a novel Quantization and Counting Operator (QCO) is designed to describe the texture information in a statistical manner. Based on QCO, two modules are introduced: (1) Texture Enhance Module (TEM), to capture texture-related information and enhance the texture details; (2) Pyramid Texture Feature Extraction Module (PTFEM), to effectively extract the statistical texture features from multiple scales. Through extensive experiments, we show that the proposed STLNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on three semantic segmentation benchmarks: Cityscapes, PASCAL Context and ADE20K."
Hidden Backdoor Attack against Semantic Segmentation Models,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to the \emph{backdoor attack}, which intends to embed hidden backdoors in DNNs by poisoning training data. The attacked model behaves normally on benign samples, whereas its prediction will be changed to a particular target label if hidden backdoors are activated. So far, backdoor research has mostly been conducted towards classification tasks. In this paper, we reveal that this threat could also happen in semantic segmentation, which may further endanger many mission-critical applications (e.g., autonomous driving). Except for extending the existing attack paradigm to maliciously manipulate the segmentation models from the image-level, we propose a novel attack paradigm, the \emph{fine-grained attack}, where we treat the target label (i.e., annotation) from the object-level instead of the image-level to achieve more sophisticated manipulation. In the annotation of poisoned samples generated by the fine-grained attack, only pixels of specific objects will be labeled with the attacker-specified target class while others are still with their ground-truth ones. Experiments show that the proposed methods can successfully attack semantic segmentation models by poisoning only a small proportion of training data. Our method not only provides a new perspective for designing novel attacks but also serves as a strong baseline for improving the robustness of semantic segmentation methods."
Morphological Operation Residual Blocks: Enhancing 3D Morphological Feature Representation in Convolutional Neural Networks for Semantic Segmentation of Medical Images,"The shapes and morphology of the organs and tissues are important prior knowledge in medical imaging recognition and segmentation. The morphological operation is a well-known method for morphological feature extraction. As the morphological operation is performed well in hand-crafted image segmentation techniques, it is also promising to design an approach to approximate morphological operation in the convolutional networks. However, using the traditional convolutional neural network as a black-box is usually hard to specify the morphological operation action. Here, we introduced a 3D morphological operation residual block to extract morphological features in end-to-end deep learning models for semantic segmentation. This study proposed a novel network block architecture that embedded the morphological operation as an infinitely strong prior in the convolutional neural network. Several 3D deep learning models with the proposed morphological operation block were built and compared in different medical imaging segmentation tasks. Experimental results showed the proposed network achieved a relatively higher performance in the segmentation tasks comparing with the conventional approach. In conclusion, the novel network block could be easily embedded in traditional networks and efficiently reinforce the deep learning models for medical imaging segmentation."
Deeply supervised UNet for semantic segmentation to assist dermatopathological assessment of Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC),"Accurate and fast assessment of resection margins is an essential part of a dermatopathologist's clinical routine. In this work, we successfully develop a deep learning method to assist the pathologists by marking critical regions that have a high probability of exhibiting pathological features in Whole Slide Images (WSI). We focus on detecting Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) through semantic segmentation using several models based on the UNet architecture. The study includes 650 WSI with 3443 tissue sections in total. Two clinical dermatopathologists annotated the data, marking tumor tissues' exact location on 100 WSI. The rest of the data, with ground-truth section-wise labels, is used to further validate and test the models. We analyze two different encoders for the first part of the UNet network and two additional training strategies: a) deep supervision, b) linear combination of decoder outputs, and obtain some interpretations about what the network's decoder does in each case. The best model achieves over 96%, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity on the test set."
Fine-Grained Off-Road Semantic Segmentation and Mapping via Contrastive Learning,"Road detection or traversability analysis has been a key technique for a mobile robot to traverse complex off-road scenes. The problem has been mainly formulated in early works as a binary classification one, e.g. associating pixels with road or non-road labels. Whereas understanding scenes with fine-grained labels are needed for off-road robots, as scenes are very diverse, and the various mechanical performance of off-road robots may lead to different definitions of safe regions to traverse. How to define and annotate fine-grained labels to achieve meaningful scene understanding for a robot to traverse off-road is still an open question. This research proposes a contrastive learning based method. With a set of human-annotated anchor patches, a feature representation is learned to discriminate regions with different traversability, a method of fine-grained semantic segmentation and mapping is subsequently developed for off-road scene understanding. Experiments are conducted on a dataset of three driving segments that represent very diverse off-road scenes. An anchor accuracy of 89.8% is achieved by evaluating the matching with human-annotated image patches in cross-scene validation. Examined by associated 3D LiDAR data, the fine-grained segments of visual images are demonstrated to have different levels of toughness and terrain elevation, which represents their semantical meaningfulness. The resultant maps contain both fine-grained labels and confidence values, providing rich information to support a robot traversing complex off-road scenes."
LiDAR-based Recurrent 3D Semantic Segmentation with Temporal Memory Alignment,"Understanding and interpreting a 3d environment is a key challenge for autonomous vehicles. Semantic segmentation of 3d point clouds combines 3d information with semantics and thereby provides a valuable contribution to this task. In many real-world applications, point clouds are generated by lidar sensors in a consecutive fashion. Working with a time series instead of single and independent frames enables the exploitation of temporal information. We therefore propose a recurrent segmentation architecture (RNN), which takes a single range image frame as input and exploits recursively aggregated temporal information. An alignment strategy, which we call Temporal Memory Alignment, uses ego motion to temporally align the memory between consecutive frames in feature space. A Residual Network and ConvGRU are investigated for the memory update. We demonstrate the benefits of the presented approach on two large-scale datasets and compare it to several stateof-the-art methods. Our approach ranks first on the SemanticKITTI multiple scan benchmark and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the single scan benchmark. In addition, the evaluation shows that the exploitation of temporal information significantly improves segmentation results compared to a single frame approach."
Context Decoupling Augmentation for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Data augmentation is vital for deep learning neural networks. By providing massive training samples, it helps to improve the generalization ability of the model. Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) is a challenging problem that has been deeply studied in recent years, conventional data augmentation approaches for WSSS usually employ geometrical transformations, random cropping and color jittering. However, merely increasing the same contextual semantic data does not bring much gain to the networks to distinguish the objects, e.g., the correct image-level classification of ""aeroplane"" may be not only due to the recognition of the object itself, but also its co-occurrence context like ""sky"", which will cause the model to focus less on the object features. To this end, we present a Context Decoupling Augmentation (CDA) method, to change the inherent context in which the objects appear and thus drive the network to remove the dependence between object instances and contextual information. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset with several alternative network architectures demonstrate that CDA can boost various popular WSSS methods to the new state-of-the-art by a large margin."
Achieving Competitive Play Through Bottom-Up Approach in Semantic Segmentation,"With the renaissance of neural networks, object detection has slowly shifted from a bottom-up recognition problem to a top-down approach. Best in class algorithms enumerate a near-complete list of objects and classify each into object/not object. In this paper, we show that strong performance can still be achieved using a bottom-up approach for vision-based object recognition tasks and achieve competitive video game play. We propose PuckNet, which is used to detect four extreme points (top, left, bottom, and right-most points) and one center point of objects using a fully convolutional neural network. Object detection is then a purely keypoint-based appearance estimation problem, without implicit feature learning or region classification. The method proposed herein performs on-par with the best in class region-based detection methods, with a bounding box AP of 36.4% on COCO test-dev. In addition, the extreme points estimated directly resolve into a rectangular object mask, with a COCO Mask AP of 17.6%, outperforming the Mask AP of vanilla bounding boxes. Guided segmentation of extreme points further improves this to 32.1% Mask AP. We applied the PuckNet vision system to the SuperTuxKart video game to test it's capacity to achieve competitive play in dynamic and co-operative multiplayer environments."
Snowy Night-to-Day Translator and Semantic Segmentation Label Similarity for Snow Hazard Indicator,"In 2021, Japan recorded more than three times as much snowfall as usual, so road user maybe come across dangerous situation. The poor visibility caused by snow triggers traffic accidents. For example, 2021 January 19, due to the dry snow and the strong wind speed of 27 m / s, blizzards occurred and the outlook has been ineffective. Because of the whiteout phenomenon, multiple accidents with 17 casualties occurred, and 134 vehicles were stacked up for 10 hours over 1 km. At the night time zone, the temperature drops and the road surface tends to freeze. CCTV images on the road surface have the advantage that we enable to monitor the status of major points at the same time. Road managers are required to make decisions on road closures and snow removal work owing to the road surface conditions even at night. In parallel, they would provide road users to alert for hazardous road surfaces. This paper propose a method to automate a snow hazard indicator that the road surface region is generated from the night snow image using the Conditional GAN, pix2pix. In addition, the road surface and the snow covered ROI are predicted using the semantic segmentation DeepLabv3+ with a backbone MobileNet, and the snow hazard indicator to automatically compute how much the night road surface is covered with snow. We demonstrate several results applied to the cold and snow region in the winter of Japan January 19 to 21 2021, and mention the usefulness of high similarity between snowy night-to-day fake output and real snowy day image for night snow visibility."
Exposing Semantic Segmentation Failures via Maximum Discrepancy Competition,"Semantic segmentation is an extensively studied task in computer vision, with numerous methods proposed every year. Thanks to the advent of deep learning in semantic segmentation, the performance on existing benchmarks is close to saturation. A natural question then arises: Does the superior performance on the closed (and frequently re-used) test sets transfer to the open visual world with unconstrained variations? In this paper, we take steps toward answering the question by exposing failures of existing semantic segmentation methods in the open visual world under the constraint of very limited human labeling effort. Inspired by previous research on model falsification, we start from an arbitrarily large image set, and automatically sample a small image set by MAximizing the Discrepancy (MAD) between two segmentation methods. The selected images have the greatest potential in falsifying either (or both) of the two methods. We also explicitly enforce several conditions to diversify the exposed failures, corresponding to different underlying root causes. A segmentation method, whose failures are more difficult to be exposed in the MAD competition, is considered better. We conduct a thorough MAD diagnosis of ten PASCAL VOC semantic segmentation algorithms. With detailed analysis of experimental results, we point out strengths and weaknesses of the competing algorithms, as well as potential research directions for further advancement in semantic segmentation. The codes are publicly available at \url{https://github.com/QTJiebin/MAD_Segmentation}."
Recursive Training for Zero-Shot Semantic Segmentation,"General purpose semantic segmentation relies on a backbone CNN network to extract discriminative features that help classify each image pixel into a 'seen' object class (ie., the object classes available during training) or a background class. Zero-shot semantic segmentation is a challenging task that requires a computer vision model to identify image pixels belonging to an object class which it has never seen before. Equipping a general purpose semantic segmentation model to separate image pixels of 'unseen' classes from the background remains an open challenge. Some recent models have approached this problem by fine-tuning the final pixel classification layer of a semantic segmentation model for a Zero-Shot setting, but struggle to learn discriminative features due to the lack of supervision. We propose a recursive training scheme to supervise the retraining of a semantic segmentation model for a zero-shot setting using a pseudo-feature representation. To this end, we propose a Zero-Shot Maximum Mean Discrepancy (ZS-MMD) loss that weighs high confidence outputs of the pixel classification layer as a pseudo-feature representation, and feeds it back to the generator. By closing-the-loop on the generator end, we provide supervision during retraining that in turn helps the model learn a more discriminative feature representation for 'unseen' classes. We show that using our recursive training and ZS-MMD loss, our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Pascal-VOC 2012 dataset and Pascal-Context dataset."
Maximizing Cosine Similarity Between Spatial Features for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation in Semantic Segmentation,"We propose a novel method that tackles the problem of unsupervised domain adaptation for semantic segmentation by maximizing the cosine similarity between the source and the target domain at the feature level. A segmentation network mainly consists of two parts, a feature extractor and a classification head. We expect that if we can make the two domains have small domain gap at the feature level, they would also have small domain discrepancy at the classification head. Our method computes a cosine similarity matrix between the source feature map and the target feature map, then we maximize the elements exceeding a threshold to guide the target features to have high similarity with the most similar source feature. Moreover, we use a class-wise source feature dictionary which stores the latest features of the source domain to prevent the unmatching problem when computing the cosine similarity matrix and be able to compare a target feature with various source features from various images. Through extensive experiments, we verify that our method gains performance on two unsupervised domain adaptation tasks (GTA5\to Cityscaspes and SYNTHIA\to Cityscapes)."
Synergy Between Semantic Segmentation and Image Denoising via Alternate Boosting,"The capability of image semantic segmentation may be deteriorated due to noisy input image, where image denoising prior to segmentation helps. Both image denoising and semantic segmentation have been developed significantly with the advance of deep learning. Thus, we are interested in the synergy between them by using a holistic deep model. We observe that not only denoising helps combat the drop of segmentation accuracy due to noise, but also pixel-wise semantic information boosts the capability of denoising. We then propose a boosting network to perform denoising and segmentation alternately. The proposed network is composed of multiple segmentation and denoising blocks (SDBs), each of which estimates semantic map then uses the map to regularize denoising. Experimental results show that the denoised image quality is improved substantially and the segmentation accuracy is improved to close to that of clean images. Our code and models will be made publicly available."
Semantically Meaningful Class Prototype Learning for One-Shot Image Semantic Segmentation,"One-shot semantic image segmentation aims to segment the object regions for the novel class with only one annotated image. Recent works adopt the episodic training strategy to mimic the expected situation at testing time. However, these existing approaches simulate the test conditions too strictly during the training process, and thus cannot make full use of the given label information. Besides, these approaches mainly focus on the foreground-background target class segmentation setting. They only utilize binary mask labels for training. In this paper, we propose to leverage the multi-class label information during the episodic training. It will encourage the network to generate more semantically meaningful features for each category. After integrating the target class cues into the query features, we then propose a pyramid feature fusion module to mine the fused features for the final classifier. Furthermore, to take more advantage of the support image-mask pair, we propose a self-prototype guidance branch to support image segmentation. It can constrain the network for generating more compact features and a robust prototype for each semantic class. For inference, we propose a fused prototype guidance branch for the segmentation of the query image. Specifically, we leverage the prediction of the query image to extract the pseudo-prototype and combine it with the initial prototype. Then we utilize the fused prototype to guide the final segmentation of the query image. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach."
Improved Semantic Segmentation of Tuberculosis-consistent findings in Chest X-rays Using Augmented Training of Modality-specific U-Net Models with Weak Localizations,"Deep learning (DL) has drawn tremendous attention in object localization and recognition for both natural and medical images. U-Net segmentation models have demonstrated superior performance compared to conventional handcrafted feature-based methods. Medical image modality-specific DL models are better at transferring domain knowledge to a relevant target task than those that are pretrained on stock photography images. This helps improve model adaptation, generalization, and class-specific region of interest (ROI) localization. In this study, we train chest X-ray (CXR) modality-specific U-Nets and other state-of-the-art U-Net models for semantic segmentation of tuberculosis (TB)-consistent findings. Automated segmentation of such manifestations could help radiologists reduce errors and supplement decision-making while improving patient care and productivity. Our approach uses the publicly available TBX11K CXR dataset with weak TB annotations, typically provided as bounding boxes, to train a set of U-Net models. Next, we improve the results by augmenting the training data with weak localizations, post-processed into an ROI mask, from a DL classifier that is trained to classify CXRs as showing normal lungs or suspected TB manifestations. Test data are individually derived from the TBX11K CXR training distribution and other cross-institutional collections including the Shenzhen TB and Montgomery TB CXR datasets. We observe that our augmented training strategy helped the CXR modality-specific U-Net models achieve superior performance with test data derived from the TBX11K CXR training distribution as well as from cross-institutional collections (p < 0.05)."
Adaptable Deformable Convolutions for Semantic Segmentation of Fisheye Images in Autonomous Driving Systems,"Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems rely heavily on perception tasks such as semantic segmentation where images are captured from large field of view (FoV) cameras. State-of-the-art works have made considerable progress toward applying Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to standard (rectilinear) images. However, the large FoV cameras used in autonomous vehicles produce fisheye images characterized by strong geometric distortion. This work demonstrates that a CNN trained on standard images can be readily adapted to fisheye images, which is crucial in real-world applications where time-consuming real-time data transformation must be avoided. Our adaptation protocol mainly relies on modifying the support of the convolutions by using their deformable equivalents on top of pre-existing layers. We prove that tuning an optimal support only requires a limited amount of labeled fisheye images, as a small number of training samples is sufficient to significantly improve an existing model's performance on wide-angle images. Furthermore, we show that finetuning the weights of the network is not necessary to achieve high performance once the deformable components are learned. Finally, we provide an in-depth analysis of the effect of the deformable convolutions, bringing elements of discussion on the behavior of CNN models."
Scribble-Supervised Semantic Segmentation by Uncertainty Reduction on Neural Representation and Self-Supervision on Neural Eigenspace,"Scribble-supervised semantic segmentation has gained much attention recently for its promising performance without high-quality annotations. Due to the lack of supervision, confident and consistent predictions are usually hard to obtain. Typically, people handle these problems to either adopt an auxiliary task with the well-labeled dataset or incorporate the graphical model with additional requirements on scribble annotations. Instead, this work aims to achieve semantic segmentation by scribble annotations directly without extra information and other limitations. Specifically, we propose holistic operations, including minimizing entropy and a network embedded random walk on neural representation to reduce uncertainty. Given the probabilistic transition matrix of a random walk, we further train the network with self-supervision on its neural eigenspace to impose consistency on predictions between related images. Comprehensive experiments and ablation studies verify the proposed approach, which demonstrates superiority over others; it is even comparable to some full-label supervised ones and works well when scribbles are randomly shrunk or dropped."
Temporal Memory Attention for Video Semantic Segmentation,"Video semantic segmentation requires to utilize the complex temporal relations between frames of the video sequence. Previous works usually exploit accurate optical flow to leverage the temporal relations, which suffer much from heavy computational cost. In this paper, we propose a Temporal Memory Attention Network (TMANet) to adaptively integrate the long-range temporal relations over the video sequence based on the self-attention mechanism without exhaustive optical flow prediction. Specially, we construct a memory using several past frames to store the temporal information of the current frame. We then propose a temporal memory attention module to capture the relation between the current frame and the memory to enhance the representation of the current frame. Our method achieves new state-of-the-art performances on two challenging video semantic segmentation datasets, particularly 80.3% mIoU on Cityscapes and 76.5% mIoU on CamVid with ResNet-50."
A2-FPN for Semantic Segmentation of Fine-Resolution Remotely Sensed Images,"Semantic segmentation using fine-resolution remotely sensed images plays a critical role in many practical applications, such as urban planning, environmental protection, natural and anthropogenic landscape monitoring, etc. However, the automation of semantic segmentation, i.e., automatic categorization/labeling and segmentation is still a challenging task, particularly for fine-resolution images with huge spatial and spectral complexity. Addressing such a problem represents an exciting research field, which paves the way for scene-level landscape pattern analysis and decision making. In this paper, we propose an approach for automatic land segmentation based on the Feature Pyramid Network (FPN). As a classic architecture, FPN can build a feature pyramid with high-level semantics throughout. However, intrinsic defects in feature extraction and fusion hinder FPN from further aggregating more discriminative features. Hence, we propose an Attention Aggregation Module (AAM) to enhance multi-scale feature learning through attention-guided feature aggregation. Based on FPN and AAM, a novel framework named Attention Aggregation Feature Pyramid Network (A2-FPN) is developed for semantic segmentation of fine-resolution remotely sensed images. Extensive experiments conducted on three datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our A2 -FPN in segmentation accuracy. Code is available at https://github.com/lironui/A2-FPN."
Multi-source Pseudo-label Learning of Semantic Segmentation for the Scene Recognition of Agricultural Mobile Robots,"This paper describes a novel method of training a semantic segmentation model for scene recognition of agricultural mobile robots exploiting publicly available datasets of outdoor scenes that are different from the target greenhouse environments. Semantic segmentation models require abundant labels given by tedious manual annotation. A method to work around it is unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) that transfers knowledge from labeled source datasets to unlabeled target datasets. However, the effectiveness of existing methods is not well studied in adaptation between heterogeneous environments, such as urban scenes and greenhouses. In this paper, we propose a method to train a semantic segmentation model for greenhouse images without manually labeled datasets of greenhouse images. The core of our idea is to use multiple rich image datasets of different environments with segmentation labels to generate pseudo-labels for the target images to effectively transfer the knowledge from multiple sources and realize a precise training of semantic segmentation. Along with the pseudo-label generation, we introduce state-of-the-art methods to deal with noise in the pseudo-labels to further improve the performance. We demonstrate in experiments with multiple greenhouse datasets that our proposed method improves the performance compared to the single-source baselines and an existing approach."
Unsupervised Semantic Segmentation by Contrasting Object Mask Proposals,"Being able to learn dense semantic representations of images without supervision is an important problem in computer vision. However, despite its significance, this problem remains rather unexplored, with a few exceptions that considered unsupervised semantic segmentation on small-scale datasets with a narrow visual domain. In this paper, we make a first attempt to tackle the problem on datasets that have been traditionally utilized for the supervised case. To achieve this, we introduce a two-step framework that adopts a predetermined mid-level prior in a contrastive optimization objective to learn pixel embeddings. This marks a large deviation from existing works that relied on proxy tasks or end-to-end clustering. Additionally, we argue about the importance of having a prior that contains information about objects, or their parts, and discuss several possibilities to obtain such a prior in an unsupervised manner.  Experimental evaluation shows that our method comes with key advantages over existing works. First, the learned pixel embeddings can be directly clustered in semantic groups using K-Means on PASCAL. Under the fully unsupervised setting, there is no precedent in solving the semantic segmentation task on such a challenging benchmark. Second, our representations can improve over strong baselines when transferred to new datasets, e.g. COCO and DAVIS. The code is available."
The Hessigheim 3D (H3D) Benchmark on Semantic Segmentation of High-Resolution 3D Point Clouds and Textured Meshes from UAV LiDAR and Multi-View-Stereo,"Automated semantic segmentation and object detection are of great importance in geospatial data analysis. However, supervised machine learning systems such as convolutional neural networks require large corpora of annotated training data. Especially in the geospatial domain, such datasets are quite scarce. Within this paper, we aim to alleviate this issue by introducing a new annotated 3D dataset that is unique in three ways: i) The dataset consists of both an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) laser scanning point cloud and a 3D textured mesh. ii) The point cloud features a mean point density of about 800 pts/sqm and the oblique imagery used for 3D mesh texturing realizes a ground sampling distance of about 2-3 cm. This enables the identification of fine-grained structures and represents the state of the art in UAV-based mapping. iii) Both data modalities will be published for a total of three epochs allowing applications such as change detection. The dataset depicts the village of Hessigheim (Germany), henceforth referred to as H3D. It is designed to promote research in the field of 3D data analysis on one hand and to evaluate and rank existing and emerging approaches for semantic segmentation of both data modalities on the other hand. Ultimately, we hope that H3D will become a widely used benchmark dataset in company with the well-established ISPRS Vaihingen 3D Semantic Labeling Challenge benchmark (V3D). The dataset can be downloaded from https://ifpwww.ifp.uni-stuttgart.de/benchmark/hessigheim/default.aspx."
Semantic Segmentation with Labeling Uncertainty and Class Imbalance,"Recently, methods based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) achieved impressive success in semantic segmentation tasks. However, challenges such as the class imbalance and the uncertainty in the pixel-labeling process are not completely addressed. As such, we present a new approach that calculates a weight for each pixel considering its class and uncertainty during the labeling process. The pixel-wise weights are used during training to increase or decrease the importance of the pixels. Experimental results show that the proposed approach leads to significant improvements in three challenging segmentation tasks in comparison to baseline methods. It was also proved to be more invariant to noise. The approach presented here may be used within a wide range of semantic segmentation methods to improve their robustness."
(AF)2-S3Net: Attentive Feature Fusion with Adaptive Feature Selection for Sparse Semantic Segmentation Network,"Autonomous robotic systems and self driving cars rely on accurate perception of their surroundings as the safety of the passengers and pedestrians is the top priority. Semantic segmentation is one the essential components of environmental perception that provides semantic information of the scene. Recently, several methods have been introduced for 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation. While, they can lead to improved performance, they are either afflicted by high computational complexity, therefore are inefficient, or lack fine details of smaller instances. To alleviate this problem, we propose AF2-S3Net, an end-to-end encoder-decoder CNN network for 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation. We present a novel multi-branch attentive feature fusion module in the encoder and a unique adaptive feature selection module with feature map re-weighting in the decoder. Our AF2-S3Net fuses the voxel based learning and point-based learning into a single framework to effectively process the large 3D scene. Our experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on the large-scale SemanticKITTI benchmark, ranking 1st on the competitive public leaderboard competition upon publication."
MudrockNet: Semantic Segmentation of Mudrock SEM Images through Deep Learning,"Segmentation and analysis of individual pores and grains of mudrocks from scanning electron microscope images is non-trivial because of noise, imaging artifacts, variation in pixel grayscale values across images, and overlaps in grayscale values among different physical features such as silt grains, clay grains, and pores in an image, which make their identification difficult. Moreover, because grains and pores often have overlapping grayscale values, direct application of threshold-based segmentation techniques is not sufficient. Recent advances in the field of computer vision have made it easier and faster to segment images and identify multiple occurrences of such features in an image, provided that ground-truth data for training the algorithm is available. Here, we propose a deep learning SEM image segmentation model, MudrockNet based on Google's DeepLab-v3+ architecture implemented with the TensorFlow library. The ground-truth data was obtained from an image-processing workflow applied to scanning electron microscope images of uncemented muds from the Kumano Basin offshore Japan at depths < 1.1 km. The trained deep learning model obtained a pixel-accuracy about 90%, and predictions for the test data obtained a mean intersection over union (IoU) of 0.6591 for silt grains and 0.6642 for pores. We also compared our model with the random forest classifier using trainable Weka segmentation in ImageJ, and it was observed that MudrockNet gave better predictions for both silt grains and pores. The size, concentration, and spatial arrangement of the silt and clay grains can affect the petrophysical properties of a mudrock, and an automated method to accurately identify the different grains and pores in mudrocks can help improve reservoir and seal characterization for petroleum exploration and anthropogenic waste sequestration."
Bidirectional Multi-scale Attention Networks for Semantic Segmentation of Oblique UAV Imagery,"Semantic segmentation for aerial platforms has been one of the fundamental scene understanding task for the earth observation. Most of the semantic segmentation research focused on scenes captured in nadir view, in which objects have relatively smaller scale variation compared with scenes captured in oblique view. The huge scale variation of objects in oblique images limits the performance of deep neural networks (DNN) that process images in a single scale fashion. In order to tackle the scale variation issue, in this paper, we propose the novel bidirectional multi-scale attention networks, which fuse features from multiple scales bidirectionally for more adaptive and effective feature extraction. The experiments are conducted on the UAVid2020 dataset and have shown the effectiveness of our method. Our model achieved the state-of-the-art (SOTA) result with a mean intersection over union (mIoU) score of 70.80%."
Active Boundary Loss for Semantic Segmentation,"This paper proposes a novel active boundary loss for semantic segmentation. It can progressively encourage the alignment between predicted boundaries and ground-truth boundaries during end-to-end training, which is not explicitly enforced in commonly used cross-entropy loss. Based on the predicted boundaries detected from the segmentation results using current network parameters, we formulate the boundary alignment problem as a differentiable direction vector prediction problem to guide the movement of predicted boundaries in each iteration. Our loss is model-agnostic and can be plugged in to the training of segmentation networks to improve the boundary details. Experimental results show that training with the active boundary loss can effectively improve the boundary F-score and mean Intersection-over-Union on challenging image and video object segmentation datasets."
ABCNet: Attentive Bilateral Contextual Network for Efficient Semantic Segmentation of Fine-Resolution Remote Sensing Images,"Semantic segmentation of remotely sensed images plays a crucial role in precision agriculture, environmental protection, and economic assessment. In recent years, substantial fine-resolution remote sensing images are available for semantic segmentation. However, due to the complicated information caused by the increased spatial resolution, state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms normally utilize complex network architectures for segmentation, which usually incurs high computational complexity. Specifically, the high-caliber performance of the convolutional neural network (CNN) heavily relies on fine-grained spatial details (fine resolution) and sufficient contextual information (large receptive fields), both of which trigger high computational costs. This crucially impedes their practicability and availability in real-world scenarios that require real-time processing. In this paper, we propose an Attentive Bilateral Contextual Network (ABCNet), a convolutional neural network (CNN) with double branches, with prominently lower computational consumptions compared to the cutting-edge algorithms, while maintaining a competitive accuracy. Code is available at https://github.com/lironui/ABCNet."
ObjectAug: Object-level Data Augmentation for Semantic Image Segmentation,"Semantic image segmentation aims to obtain object labels with precise boundaries, which usually suffers from overfitting. Recently, various data augmentation strategies like regional dropout and mix strategies have been proposed to address the problem. These strategies have proved to be effective for guiding the model to attend on less discriminative parts. However, current strategies operate at the image level, and objects and the background are coupled. Thus, the boundaries are not well augmented due to the fixed semantic scenario. In this paper, we propose ObjectAug to perform object-level augmentation for semantic image segmentation. ObjectAug first decouples the image into individual objects and the background using the semantic labels. Next, each object is augmented individually with commonly used augmentation methods (e.g., scaling, shifting, and rotation). Then, the black area brought by object augmentation is further restored using image inpainting. Finally, the augmented objects and background are assembled as an augmented image. In this way, the boundaries can be fully explored in the various semantic scenarios. In addition, ObjectAug can support category-aware augmentation that gives various possibilities to objects in each category, and can be easily combined with existing image-level augmentation methods to further boost performance. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on both natural image and medical image datasets. Experiment results demonstrate that our ObjectAug can evidently improve segmentation performance."
DRIV100: In-The-Wild Multi-Domain Dataset and Evaluation for Real-World Domain Adaptation of Semantic Segmentation,"Together with the recent advances in semantic segmentation, many domain adaptation methods have been proposed to overcome the domain gap between training and deployment environments. However, most previous studies use limited combinations of source/target datasets, and domain adaptation techniques have never been thoroughly evaluated in a more challenging and diverse set of target domains. This work presents a new multi-domain dataset DRIV100 for benchmarking domain adaptation techniques on in-the-wild road-scene videos collected from the Internet. The dataset consists of pixel-level annotations for 100 videos selected to cover diverse scenes/domains based on two criteria; human subjective judgment and an anomaly score judged using an existing road-scene dataset. We provide multiple manually labeled ground-truth frames for each video, enabling a thorough evaluation of video-level domain adaptation where each video independently serves as the target domain. Using the dataset, we quantify domain adaptation performances of state-of-the-art methods and clarify the potential and novel challenges of domain adaptation techniques. The dataset is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4389243."
Neural networks for semantic segmentation of historical city maps: Cross-cultural performance and the impact of figurative diversity,"In this work, we present a new semantic segmentation model for historical city maps that surpasses the state of the art in terms of flexibility and performance. Research in automatic map processing is largely focused on homogeneous corpora or even individual maps, leading to inflexible algorithms. Recently, convolutional neural networks have opened new perspectives for the development of more generic tools. Based on two new maps corpora, the first one centered on Paris and the second one gathering cities from all over the world, we propose a method for operationalizing the figuration based on traditional computer vision algorithms that allows large-scale quantitative analysis. In a second step, we propose a semantic segmentation model based on neural networks and implement several improvements. Finally, we analyze the impact of map figuration on segmentation performance and evaluate future ways to improve the representational flexibility of neural networks. To conclude, we show that these networks are able to semantically segment map data of a very large figurative diversity with efficiency."
Exploring Cross-Image Pixel Contrast for Semantic Segmentation,"Current semantic segmentation methods focus only on mining ""local"" context, i.e., dependencies between pixels within individual images, by context-aggregation modules (e.g., dilated convolution, neural attention) or structure-aware optimization criteria (e.g., IoU-like loss). However, they ignore ""global"" context of the training data, i.e., rich semantic relations between pixels across different images. Inspired by the recent advance in unsupervised contrastive representation learning, we propose a pixel-wise contrastive framework for semantic segmentation in the fully supervised setting. The core idea is to enforce pixel embeddings belonging to a same semantic class to be more similar than embeddings from different classes. It raises a pixel-wise metric learning paradigm for semantic segmentation, by explicitly exploring the structures of labeled pixels, which were rarely explored before. Our method can be effortlessly incorporated into existing segmentation frameworks without extra overhead during testing. We experimentally show that, with famous segmentation models (i.e., DeepLabV3, HRNet, OCR) and backbones (i.e., ResNet, HR-Net), our method brings consistent performance improvements across diverse datasets (i.e., Cityscapes, PASCAL-Context, COCO-Stuff, CamVid). We expect this work will encourage our community to rethink the current de facto training paradigm in fully supervised semantic segmentation."
Prototypical Pseudo Label Denoising and Target Structure Learning for Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation,"Self-training is a competitive approach in domain adaptive segmentation, which trains the network with the pseudo labels on the target domain. However inevitably, the pseudo labels are noisy and the target features are dispersed due to the discrepancy between source and target domains. In this paper, we rely on representative prototypes, the feature centroids of classes, to address the two issues for unsupervised domain adaptation. In particular, we take one step further and exploit the feature distances from prototypes that provide richer information than mere prototypes. Specifically, we use it to estimate the likelihood of pseudo labels to facilitate online correction in the course of training. Meanwhile, we align the prototypical assignments based on relative feature distances for two different views of the same target, producing a more compact target feature space. Moreover, we find that distilling the already learned knowledge to a self-supervised pretrained model further boosts the performance. Our method shows tremendous performance advantage over state-of-the-art methods. We will make the code publicly available."
Global-Local Propagation Network for RGB-D Semantic Segmentation,"Depth information matters in RGB-D semantic segmentation task for providing additional geometric information to color images. Most existing methods exploit a multi-stage fusion strategy to propagate depth feature to the RGB branch. However, at the very deep stage, the propagation in a simple element-wise addition manner can not fully utilize the depth information. We propose Global-Local propagation network (GLPNet) to solve this problem. Specifically, a local context fusion module(L-CFM) is introduced to dynamically align both modalities before element-wise fusion, and a global context fusion module(G-CFM) is introduced to propagate the depth information to the RGB branch by jointly modeling the multi-modal global context features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and complementarity of the proposed fusion modules. Embedding two fusion modules into a two-stream encoder-decoder structure, our GLPNet achieves new state-of-the-art performance on two challenging indoor scene segmentation datasets, i.e., NYU-Depth v2 and SUN-RGBD dataset."
GnetSeg: Semantic Segmentation Model Optimized on a 224mW CNN Accelerator Chip at the Speed of 318FPS,"Semantic segmentation is the task to cluster pixels on an image belonging to the same class. It is widely used in the real-world applications including autonomous driving, medical imaging analysis, industrial inspection, smartphone camera for person segmentation and so on. Accelerating the semantic segmentation models on the mobile and edge devices are practical needs for the industry. Recent years have witnessed the wide availability of CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) accelerators. They have the advantages on power efficiency, inference speed, which are ideal for accelerating the semantic segmentation models on the edge devices. However, the CNN accelerator chips also have the limitations on flexibility and memory. In addition, the CPU load is very critical because the CNN accelerator chip works as a co-processor with a host CPU. In this paper, we optimize the semantic segmentation model in order to fully utilize the limited memory and the supported operators on the CNN accelerator chips, and at the same time reduce the CPU load of the CNN model to zero. The resulting model is called GnetSeg. Furthermore, we propose the integer encoding for the mask of the GnetSeg model, which minimizes the latency of data transfer between the CNN accelerator and the host CPU. The experimental result shows that the model running on the 224mW chip achieves the speed of 318FPS with excellent accuracy for applications such as person segmentation."
Mask-based Data Augmentation for Semi-supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation using convolutional neural networks (CNN) is a crucial component in image analysis. Training a CNN to perform semantic segmentation requires a large amount of labeled data, where the production of such labeled data is both costly and labor intensive. Semi-supervised learning algorithms address this issue by utilizing unlabeled data and so reduce the amount of labeled data needed for training. In particular, data augmentation techniques such as CutMix and ClassMix generate additional training data from existing labeled data. In this paper we propose a new approach for data augmentation, termed ComplexMix, which incorporates aspects of CutMix and ClassMix with improved performance. The proposed approach has the ability to control the complexity of the augmented data while attempting to be semantically-correct and address the tradeoff between complexity and correctness. The proposed ComplexMix approach is evaluated on a standard dataset for semantic segmentation and compared to other state-of-the-art techniques. Experimental results show that our method yields improvement over state-of-the-art methods on standard datasets for semantic image segmentation."
Image Compression with Encoder-Decoder Matched Semantic Segmentation,"In recent years, layered image compression is demonstrated to be a promising direction, which encodes a compact representation of the input image and apply an up-sampling network to reconstruct the image. To further improve the quality of the reconstructed image, some works transmit the semantic segment together with the compressed image data. Consequently, the compression ratio is also decreased because extra bits are required for transmitting the semantic segment. To solve this problem, we propose a new layered image compression framework with encoder-decoder matched semantic segmentation (EDMS). And then, followed by the semantic segmentation, a special convolution neural network is used to enhance the inaccurate semantic segment. As a result, the accurate semantic segment can be obtained in the decoder without requiring extra bits. The experimental results show that the proposed EDMS framework can get up to 35.31% BD-rate reduction over the HEVC-based (BPG) codec, 5% bitrate, and 24% encoding time saving compare to the state-of-the-art semantic-based image codec."
"ItNet: iterative neural networks with small graphs for accurate, efficient and anytime semantic segmentation","Deep neural networks have usually to be compressed and accelerated for their usage in low-power, e.g. mobile, devices. Recently, massively-parallel hardware accelerators were developed that offer high throughput and low latency at low power by utilizing in-memory computation. However, to exploit these benefits the computational graph of a neural network has to fit into the in-computation memory of these hardware systems that is usually rather limited in size. In this study, we introduce a class of network models that have a small memory footprint in terms of their computational graphs. To this end, the graph is designed to contain loops by iteratively executing a single network building block. Furthermore, the trade-off between accuracy and latency of these so-called iterative neural networks is improved by adding multiple intermediate outputs during both training and inference. We show state-of-the-art results for semantic segmentation on the CamVid and Cityscapes datasets that are especially demanding in terms of computational resources. In ablation studies, the improvement of network training by intermediate network outputs as well as the trade-off between weight sharing over iterations and the network size are investigated."
Rethinking Semantic Segmentation Evaluation for Explainability and Model Selection,"Semantic segmentation aims to robustly predict coherent class labels for entire regions of an image. It is a scene understanding task that powers real-world applications (e.g., autonomous navigation). One important application, the use of imagery for automated semantic understanding of pedestrian environments, provides remote mapping of accessibility features in street environments. This application (and others like it) require detailed geometric information of geographical objects. Semantic segmentation is a prerequisite for this task since it maps contiguous regions of the same class as single entities. Importantly, semantic segmentation uses like ours are not pixel-wise outcomes; however, most of their quantitative evaluation metrics (e.g., mean Intersection Over Union) are based on pixel-wise similarities to a ground-truth, which fails to emphasize over- and under-segmentation properties of a segmentation model. Here, we introduce a new metric to assess region-based over- and under-segmentation. We analyze and compare it to other metrics, demonstrating that the use of our metric lends greater explainability to semantic segmentation model performance in real-world applications."
Feature Sharing Cooperative Network for Semantic Segmentation,"In recent years, deep neural networks have achieved high ac-curacy in the field of image recognition. By inspired from human learning method, we propose a semantic segmentation method using cooperative learning which shares the information resembling a group learning. We use two same networks and paths for sending feature maps between two networks. Two networks are trained simultaneously. By sharing feature maps, one of two networks can obtain the information that cannot be obtained by a single network. In addition, in order to enhance the degree of cooperation, we propose two kinds of methods that connect only the same layer and multiple layers. We evaluated our proposed idea on two kinds of networks. One is Dual Attention Network (DANet) and the other one is DeepLabv3+. The proposed method achieved better segmentation accuracy than the conventional single network and ensemble of networks."
Comparative Evaluation of 3D and 2D Deep Learning Techniques for Semantic Segmentation in CT Scans,"Image segmentation plays a pivotal role in several medical-imaging applications by assisting the segmentation of the regions of interest. Deep learning-based approaches have been widely adopted for semantic segmentation of medical data. In recent years, in addition to 2D deep learning architectures, 3D architectures have been employed as the predictive algorithms for 3D medical image data. In this paper, we propose a 3D stack-based deep learning technique for segmenting manifestations of consolidation and ground-glass opacities in 3D Computed Tomography (CT) scans. We also present a comparison based on the segmentation results, the contextual information retained, and the inference time between this 3D technique and a traditional 2D deep learning technique. We also define the area-plot, which represents the peculiar pattern observed in the slice-wise areas of the pathology regions predicted by these deep learning models. In our exhaustive evaluation, 3D technique performs better than the 2D technique for the segmentation of CT scans. We get dice scores of 79% and 73% for the 3D and the 2D techniques respectively. The 3D technique results in a 5X reduction in the inference time compared to the 2D technique. Results also show that the area-plots predicted by the 3D model are more similar to the ground truth than those predicted by the 2D model. We also show how increasing the amount of contextual information retained during the training can improve the 3D model's performance."
Channelized Axial Attention for Semantic Segmentation -- Considering Channel Relation within Spatial Attention for Semantic Segmentation,"Spatial and channel attentions, modelling the semantic interdependencies in spatial and channel dimensions respectively, have recently been widely used for semantic segmentation. However, computing spatial and channel attentions separately sometimes causes errors, especially for those difficult cases. In this paper, we propose Channelized Axial Attention (CAA) to seamlessly integrate channel attention and spatial attention into a single operation with negligible computation overhead. Specifically, we break down the dot-product operation of the spatial attention into two parts and insert channel relation in between, allowing for independently optimized channel attention on each spatial location. We further develop grouped vectorization, which allows our model to run with very little memory consumption without slowing down the running speed. Comparative experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets, including Cityscapes, PASCAL Context, and COCO-Stuff, demonstrate that our CAA outperforms many state-of-the-art segmentation models (including dual attention) on all tested datasets."
SOSD-Net: Joint Semantic Object Segmentation and Depth Estimation from Monocular images,"Depth estimation and semantic segmentation play essential roles in scene understanding. The state-of-the-art methods employ multi-task learning to simultaneously learn models for these two tasks at the pixel-wise level. They usually focus on sharing the common features or stitching feature maps from the corresponding branches. However, these methods lack in-depth consideration on the correlation of the geometric cues and the scene parsing. In this paper, we first introduce the concept of semantic objectness to exploit the geometric relationship of these two tasks through an analysis of the imaging process, then propose a Semantic Object Segmentation and Depth Estimation Network (SOSD-Net) based on the objectness assumption. To the best of our knowledge, SOSD-Net is the first network that exploits the geometry constraint for simultaneous monocular depth estimation and semantic segmentation. In addition, considering the mutual implicit relationship between these two tasks, we exploit the iterative idea from the expectation-maximization algorithm to train the proposed network more effectively. Extensive experimental results on the Cityscapes and NYU v2 dataset are presented to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach."
Cross-modal Learning for Domain Adaptation in 3D Semantic Segmentation,"Domain adaptation is an important task to enable learning when labels are scarce. While most works focus only on the image modality, there are many important multi-modal datasets. In order to leverage multi-modality for domain adaptation, we propose cross-modal learning, where we enforce consistency between the predictions of two modalities via mutual mimicking. We constrain our network to make correct predictions on labeled data and consistent predictions across modalities on unlabeled target-domain data. Experiments in unsupervised and semi-supervised domain adaptation settings prove the effectiveness of this novel domain adaptation strategy. Specifically, we evaluate on the task of 3D semantic segmentation from either the 2D image, the 3D point cloud or from both. We leverage recent driving datasets to produce a wide variety of domain adaptation scenarios including changes in scene layout, lighting, sensor setup and weather, as well as the synthetic-to-real setup. Our method significantly improves over previous uni-modal adaptation baselines on all adaption scenarios. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/valeoai/xmuda_journal"
Label-Efficient Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation: An Active Learning Approach,"Deep learning models are the state-of-the-art methods for semantic point cloud segmentation, the success of which relies on the availability of large-scale annotated datasets. However, it can be extremely time-consuming and prohibitively expensive to compile such datasets. In this work, we propose an active learning approach to maximize model performance given limited annotation budgets. We investigate the appropriate sample granularity for active selection under realistic annotation cost measurement (clicks), and demonstrate that super-point based selection allows for more efficient usage of the limited budget compared to point-level and instance-level selection. We further exploit local consistency constraints to boost the performance of the super-point based approach. We evaluate our methods on two benchmarking datasets (ShapeNet and S3DIS) and the results demonstrate that active learning is an effective strategy to address the high annotation costs in semantic point cloud segmentation."
Deep Dual-resolution Networks for Real-time and Accurate Semantic Segmentation of Road Scenes,"Semantic segmentation is a key technology for autonomous vehicles to understand the surrounding scenes. The appealing performances of contemporary models usually come at the expense of heavy computations and lengthy inference time, which is intolerable for self-driving. Using light-weight architectures (encoder-decoder or two-pathway) or reasoning on low-resolution images, recent methods realize very fast scene parsing, even running at more than 100 FPS on a single 1080Ti GPU. However, there is still a significant gap in performance between these real-time methods and the models based on dilation backbones. To tackle this problem, we proposed a family of efficient backbones specially designed for real-time semantic segmentation. The proposed deep dual-resolution networks (DDRNets) are composed of two deep branches between which multiple bilateral fusions are performed. Additionally, we design a new contextual information extractor named Deep Aggregation Pyramid Pooling Module (DAPPM) to enlarge effective receptive fields and fuse multi-scale context based on low-resolution feature maps. Our method achieves a new state-of-the-art trade-off between accuracy and speed on both Cityscapes and CamVid dataset. In particular, on a single 2080Ti GPU, DDRNet-23-slim yields 77.4% mIoU at 102 FPS on Cityscapes test set and 74.7% mIoU at 230 FPS on CamVid test set. With widely used test augmentation, our method is superior to most state-of-the-art models and requires much less computation. Codes and trained models are available online."
Road Surface Translation Under Snow-covered and Semantic Segmentation for Snow Hazard Index,"In 2020, there was a record heavy snowfall owing to climate change. In reality, 2,000 vehicles were stuck on the highway for three days. Because of the freezing of the road surface, 10 vehicles had a billiard accident. Road managers are required to provide indicators to alert drivers regarding snow cover at hazardous locations. This study proposes a deep learning application with live image post-processing to automatically calculate a snow hazard ratio indicator. First, the road surface hidden under snow is translated using a generative adversarial network, pix2pix. Second, snow-covered and road surface classes are detected by semantic segmentation using DeepLabv3+ with MobileNet as a backbone. Based on these trained networks, we automatically compute the road to snow rate hazard index, indicating the amount of snow covered on the road surface. We demonstrate the applied results to 1,155 live snow images of the cold region in Japan. We mention the usefulness and the practical robustness of our study."
The Vulnerability of Semantic Segmentation Networks to Adversarial Attacks in Autonomous Driving: Enhancing Extensive Environment Sensing,"Enabling autonomous driving (AD) can be considered one of the biggest challenges in today's technology. AD is a complex task accomplished by several functionalities, with environment perception being one of its core functions. Environment perception is usually performed by combining the semantic information captured by several sensors, i.e., lidar or camera. The semantic information from the respective sensor can be extracted by using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for dense prediction. In the past, CNNs constantly showed state-of-the-art performance on several vision-related tasks, such as semantic segmentation of traffic scenes using nothing but the red-green-blue (RGB) images provided by a camera. Although CNNs obtain state-of-the-art performance on clean images, almost imperceptible changes to the input, referred to as adversarial perturbations, may lead to fatal deception. The goal of this article is to illuminate the vulnerability aspects of CNNs used for semantic segmentation with respect to adversarial attacks, and share insights into some of the existing known adversarial defense strategies. We aim to clarify the advantages and disadvantages associated with applying CNNs for environment perception in AD to serve as a motivation for future research in this field."
Semantic Segmentation of Remote Sensing Images with Sparse Annotations,"Training Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for very high resolution images requires a large quantity of high-quality pixel-level annotations, which is extremely labor- and time-consuming to produce. Moreover, professional photo interpreters might have to be involved for guaranteeing the correctness of annotations. To alleviate such a burden, we propose a framework for semantic segmentation of aerial images based on incomplete annotations, where annotators are asked to label a few pixels with easy-to-draw scribbles. To exploit these sparse scribbled annotations, we propose the FEature and Spatial relaTional regulArization (FESTA) method to complement the supervised task with an unsupervised learning signal that accounts for neighbourhood structures both in spatial and feature terms."
Boundary-Aware Geometric Encoding for Semantic Segmentation of Point Clouds,"Boundary information plays a significant role in 2D image segmentation, while usually being ignored in 3D point cloud segmentation where ambiguous features might be generated in feature extraction, leading to misclassification in the transition area between two objects. In this paper, firstly, we propose a Boundary Prediction Module (BPM) to predict boundary points. Based on the predicted boundary, a boundary-aware Geometric Encoding Module (GEM) is designed to encode geometric information and aggregate features with discrimination in a neighborhood, so that the local features belonging to different categories will not be polluted by each other. To provide extra geometric information for boundary-aware GEM, we also propose a light-weight Geometric Convolution Operation (GCO), making the extracted features more distinguishing. Built upon the boundary-aware GEM, we build our network and test it on benchmarks like ScanNet v2, S3DIS. Results show our methods can significantly improve the baseline and achieve state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at https://github.com/JchenXu/BoundaryAwareGEM."
Active Bayesian Multi-class Mapping from Range and Semantic Segmentation Observation,"Many robot applications call for autonomous exploration and mapping of unknown and unstructured environments. Information-based exploration techniques, such as Cauchy-Schwarz quadratic mutual information (CSQMI) and fast Shannon mutual information (FSMI), have successfully achieved active binary occupancy mapping with range measurements. However, as we envision robots performing complex tasks specified with semantically meaningful objects, it is necessary to capture semantic categories in the measurements, map representation, and exploration objective. This work develops a Bayesian multi-class mapping algorithm utilizing range-category measurements. We derive a closed-form efficiently computable lower bound for the Shannon mutual information between the multi-class map and the measurements. The bound allows rapid evaluation of many potential robot trajectories for autonomous exploration and mapping. We compare our method against frontier-based and FSMI exploration and apply it in a 3-D photo-realistic simulation environment."
Local Memory Attention for Fast Video Semantic Segmentation,"We propose a novel neural network module that transforms an existing single-frame semantic segmentation model into a video semantic segmentation pipeline. In contrast to prior works, we strive towards a simple, fast, and general module that can be integrated into virtually any single-frame architecture. Our approach aggregates a rich representation of the semantic information in past frames into a memory module. Information stored in the memory is then accessed through an attention mechanism. In contrast to previous memory-based approaches, we propose a fast local attention layer, providing temporal appearance cues in the local region of prior frames. We further fuse these cues with an encoding of the current frame through a second attention-based module. The segmentation decoder processes the fused representation to predict the final semantic segmentation. We integrate our approach into two popular semantic segmentation networks: ERFNet and PSPNet. We observe an improvement in segmentation performance on Cityscapes by 1.7% and 2.1% in mIoU respectively, while increasing inference time of ERFNet by only 1.5ms."
Semantic Video Segmentation for Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection Procedures,"We present the first deep learning model for the analysis of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) procedures. Using a dataset of ICSI procedure videos, we train a deep neural network to segment key objects in the videos achieving a mean IoU of 0.962, and to localize the needle tip achieving a mean pixel error of 3.793 pixels at 14 FPS on a single GPU. We further analyze the variation between the dataset's human annotators and find the model's performance to be comparable to human experts."
Rethinking Semantic Segmentation from a Sequence-to-Sequence Perspective with Transformers,"Most recent semantic segmentation methods adopt a fully-convolutional network (FCN) with an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder progressively reduces the spatial resolution and learns more abstract/semantic visual concepts with larger receptive fields. Since context modeling is critical for segmentation, the latest efforts have been focused on increasing the receptive field, through either dilated/atrous convolutions or inserting attention modules. However, the encoder-decoder based FCN architecture remains unchanged. In this paper, we aim to provide an alternative perspective by treating semantic segmentation as a sequence-to-sequence prediction task. Specifically, we deploy a pure transformer (ie, without convolution and resolution reduction) to encode an image as a sequence of patches. With the global context modeled in every layer of the transformer, this encoder can be combined with a simple decoder to provide a powerful segmentation model, termed SEgmentation TRansformer (SETR). Extensive experiments show that SETR achieves new state of the art on ADE20K (50.28% mIoU), Pascal Context (55.83% mIoU) and competitive results on Cityscapes. Particularly, we achieve the first position in the highly competitive ADE20K test server leaderboard on the day of submission."
SALA: Soft Assignment Local Aggregation for Parameter Efficient 3D Semantic Segmentation,"In this work, we focus on designing a point local aggregation function that yields parameter efficient networks for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation. We explore the idea of using learnable neighbor-to-grid soft assignment in grid-based aggregation functions. Previous methods in literature operate on a predefined geometric grid such as local volume partitions or irregular kernel points. A more general alternative is to allow the network to learn an assignment function that best suits the end task. Since it is learnable, this mapping is allowed to be different per layer instead of being applied uniformly throughout the depth of the network. By endowing the network with the flexibility to learn its own neighbor-to-grid assignment, we arrive at parameter efficient models that achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on S3DIS with at least 10\times less parameters than the current reigning method. We also demonstrate competitive performance on ScanNet and PartNet compared with much larger SOTA models."
Compositional Prototype Network with Multi-view Comparision for Few-Shot Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation,"Point cloud segmentation is a fundamental visual understanding task in 3D vision. A fully supervised point cloud segmentation network often requires a large amount of data with point-wise annotations, which is expensive to obtain. In this work, we present the Compositional Prototype Network that can undertake point cloud segmentation with only a few labeled training data. Inspired by the few-shot learning literature in images, our network directly transfers label information from the limited training data to unlabeled test data for prediction. The network decomposes the representations of complex point cloud data into a set of local regional representations and utilizes them to calculate the compositional prototypes of a visual concept. Our network includes a key Multi-View Comparison Component that exploits the redundant views of the support set. To evaluate the proposed method, we create a new segmentation benchmark dataset, ScanNet-6^i, which is built upon ScanNet dataset. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms baselines with a significant advantage. Moreover, when we use our network to handle the long-tail problem in a fully supervised point cloud segmentation dataset, it can also effectively boost the performance of the few-shot classes."
Spectral Analysis for Semantic Segmentation with Applications on Feature Truncation and Weak Annotation,"It is well known that semantic segmentation neural networks (SSNNs) produce dense segmentation maps to resolve the objects' boundaries while restrict the prediction on down-sampled grids to alleviate the computational cost. A striking balance between the accuracy and the training cost of the SSNNs such as U-Net exists. We propose a spectral analysis to investigate the correlations among the resolution of the down sampled grid, the loss function and the accuracy of the SSNNs. By analyzing the network back-propagation process in frequency domain, we discover that the traditional loss function, cross-entropy, and the key features of CNN are mainly affected by the low-frequency components of segmentation labels. Our discoveries can be applied to SSNNs in several ways including (i) determining an efficient low resolution grid for resolving the segmentation maps (ii) pruning the networks by truncating the high frequency decoder features for saving computation costs, and (iii) using block-wise weak annotation for saving the labeling time. Experimental results shown in this paper agree with our spectral analysis for the networks such as DeepLab V3+ and Deep Aggregation Net (DAN)."
Semantic Segmentation on Swiss3DCities: A Benchmark Study on Aerial Photogrammetric 3D Pointcloud Dataset,"We introduce a new outdoor urban 3D pointcloud dataset, covering a total area of 2.7 km^2, sampled from three Swiss cities with different characteristics. The dataset is manually annotated for semantic segmentation with per-point labels, and is built using photogrammetry from images acquired by multirotors equipped with high-resolution cameras. In contrast to datasets acquired with ground LiDAR sensors, the resulting point clouds are uniformly dense and complete, and are useful to disparate applications, including autonomous driving, gaming and smart city planning. As a benchmark, we report quantitative results of PointNet++, an established point-based deep 3D semantic segmentation model; on this model, we additionally study the impact of using different cities for model generalization."
ICMSC: Intra- and Cross-modality Semantic Consistency for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation on Hip Joint Bone Segmentation,"Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for cross-modality medical image segmentation has shown great progress by domain-invariant feature learning or image appearance translation. Adapted feature learning usually cannot detect domain shifts at the pixel level and is not able to achieve good results in dense semantic segmentation tasks. Image appearance translation, e.g. CycleGAN, translates images into different styles with good appearance, despite its population, its semantic consistency is hardly to maintain and results in poor cross-modality segmentation. In this paper, we propose intra- and cross-modality semantic consistency (ICMSC) for UDA and our key insight is that the segmentation of synthesised images in different styles should be consistent. Specifically, our model consists of an image translation module and a domain-specific segmentation module. The image translation module is a standard CycleGAN, while the segmentation module contains two domain-specific segmentation networks. The intra-modality semantic consistency (IMSC) forces the reconstructed image after a cycle to be segmented in the same way as the original input image, while the cross-modality semantic consistency (CMSC) encourages the synthesized images after translation to be segmented exactly the same as before translation. Comprehensive experimental results on cross-modality hip joint bone segmentation show the effectiveness of our proposed method, which achieves an average DICE of 81.61% on the acetabulum and 88.16% on the proximal femur, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods. It is worth to note that without UDA, a model trained on CT for hip joint bone segmentation is non-transferable to MRI and has almost zero-DICE segmentation."
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation by Content Transfer,"In this paper, we tackle the unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for semantic segmentation, which aims to segment the unlabeled real data using labeled synthetic data. The main problem of UDA for semantic segmentation relies on reducing the domain gap between the real image and synthetic image. To solve this problem, we focused on separating information in an image into content and style. Here, only the content has cues for semantic segmentation, and the style makes the domain gap. Thus, precise separation of content and style in an image leads to effect as supervision of real data even when learning with synthetic data. To make the best of this effect, we propose a zero-style loss. Even though we perfectly extract content for semantic segmentation in the real domain, another main challenge, the class imbalance problem, still exists in UDA for semantic segmentation. We address this problem by transferring the contents of tail classes from synthetic to real domain. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance in semantic segmentation on the major two UDA settings."
CholecSeg8k: A Semantic Segmentation Dataset for Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy Based on Cholec80,"Computer-assisted surgery has been developed to enhance surgery correctness and safety. However, researchers and engineers suffer from limited annotated data to develop and train better algorithms. Consequently, the development of fundamental algorithms such as Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is limited. This article elaborates on the efforts of preparing the dataset for semantic segmentation, which is the foundation of many computer-assisted surgery mechanisms. Based on the Cholec80 dataset [3], we extracted 8,080 laparoscopic cholecystectomy image frames from 17 video clips in Cholec80 and annotated the images. The dataset is named CholecSeg8K and its total size is 3GB. Each of these images is annotated at pixel-level for thirteen classes, which are commonly founded in laparoscopic cholecystectomy surgery. CholecSeg8k is released under the license CC BY- NC-SA 4.0."
HyperSeg: Patch-wise Hypernetwork for Real-time Semantic Segmentation,"We present a novel, real-time, semantic segmentation network in which the encoder both encodes and generates the parameters (weights) of the decoder. Furthermore, to allow maximal adaptivity, the weights at each decoder block vary spatially. For this purpose, we design a new type of hypernetwork, composed of a nested U-Net for drawing higher level context features, a multi-headed weight generating module which generates the weights of each block in the decoder immediately before they are consumed, for efficient memory utilization, and a primary network that is composed of novel dynamic patch-wise convolutions. Despite the usage of less-conventional blocks, our architecture obtains real-time performance. In terms of the runtime vs. accuracy trade-off, we surpass state of the art (SotA) results on popular semantic segmentation benchmarks: PASCAL VOC 2012 (val. set) and real-time semantic segmentation on Cityscapes, and CamVid. The code is available: https://nirkin.com/hyperseg."
Three Ways to Improve Semantic Segmentation with Self-Supervised Depth Estimation,"Training deep networks for semantic segmentation requires large amounts of labeled training data, which presents a major challenge in practice, as labeling segmentation masks is a highly labor-intensive process. To address this issue, we present a framework for semi-supervised semantic segmentation, which is enhanced by self-supervised monocular depth estimation from unlabeled image sequences. In particular, we propose three key contributions: (1) We transfer knowledge from features learned during self-supervised depth estimation to semantic segmentation, (2) we implement a strong data augmentation by blending images and labels using the geometry of the scene, and (3) we utilize the depth feature diversity as well as the level of difficulty of learning depth in a student-teacher framework to select the most useful samples to be annotated for semantic segmentation. We validate the proposed model on the Cityscapes dataset, where all three modules demonstrate significant performance gains, and we achieve state-of-the-art results for semi-supervised semantic segmentation. The implementation is available at https://github.com/lhoyer/improving_segmentation_with_selfsupervised_depth."
SegGroup: Seg-Level Supervision for 3D Instance and Semantic Segmentation,"Most existing point cloud instance and semantic segmentation methods rely heavily on strong supervision signals, which require point-level labels for every point in the scene. However, such strong supervision suffers from large annotation costs, arousing the need to study efficient annotating. In this paper, we discover that the locations of instances matter for both instance and semantic 3D scene segmentation. By fully taking advantage of locations, we design a weakly-supervised point cloud segmentation method that only requires clicking on one point per instance to indicate its location for annotation. With over-segmentation for pre-processing, we extend these location annotations into segments as seg-level labels. We further design a segment grouping network (SegGroup) to generate point-level pseudo labels under seg-level labels by hierarchically grouping the unlabeled segments into the relevant nearby labeled segments, so that existing point-level supervised segmentation models can directly consume these pseudo labels for training. Experimental results show that our seg-level supervised method (SegGroup) achieves comparable results with the fully annotated point-level supervised methods. Moreover, it outperforms the recent weakly-supervised methods given a fixed annotation budget. Code is available at https://github.com/AnTao97/SegGroup."
LGENet: Local and Global Encoder Network for Semantic Segmentation of Airborne Laser Scanning Point Clouds,"Interpretation of Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) point clouds is a critical procedure for producing various geo-information products like 3D city models, digital terrain models and land use maps. In this paper, we present a local and global encoder network (LGENet) for semantic segmentation of ALS point clouds. Adapting the KPConv network, we first extract features by both 2D and 3D point convolutions to allow the network to learn more representative local geometry. Then global encoders are used in the network to exploit contextual information at the object and point level. We design a segment-based Edge Conditioned Convolution to encode the global context between segments. We apply a spatial-channel attention module at the end of the network, which not only captures the global interdependencies between points but also models interactions between channels. We evaluate our method on two ALS datasets namely, the ISPRS benchmark dataset and DCF2019 dataset. For the ISPRS benchmark dataset, our model achieves state-of-the-art results with an overall accuracy of 0.845 and an average F1 score of 0.737. With regards to the DFC2019 dataset, our proposed network achieves an overall accuracy of 0.984 and an average F1 score of 0.834."
A Holistically-Guided Decoder for Deep Representation Learning with Applications to Semantic Segmentation and Object Detection,"Both high-level and high-resolution feature representations are of great importance in various visual understanding tasks. To acquire high-resolution feature maps with high-level semantic information, one common strategy is to adopt dilated convolutions in the backbone networks to extract high-resolution feature maps, such as the dilatedFCN-based methods for semantic segmentation. However, due to many convolution operations are conducted on the high-resolution feature maps, such methods have large computational complexity and memory consumption. In this paper, we propose one novel holistically-guided decoder which is introduced to obtain the high-resolution semantic-rich feature maps via the multi-scale features from the encoder. The decoding is achieved via novel holistic codeword generation and codeword assembly operations, which take advantages of both the high-level and low-level features from the encoder features. With the proposed holistically-guided decoder, we implement the EfficientFCN architecture for semantic segmentation and HGD-FPN for object detection and instance segmentation. The EfficientFCN achieves comparable or even better performance than state-of-the-art methods with only 1/3 of their computational costs for semantic segmentation on PASCAL Context, PASCAL VOC, ADE20K datasets. Meanwhile, the proposed HGD-FPN achieves >2\% higher mean Average Precision (mAP) when integrated into several object detection frameworks with ResNet-50 encoding backbones."
Weakly-supervised Semantic Segmentation in Cityscape via Hyperspectral Image,"High-resolution hyperspectral images (HSIs) contain the response of each pixel in different spectral bands, which can be used to effectively distinguish various objects in complex scenes. While HSI cameras have become low cost, algorithms based on it have not been well exploited. In this paper, we focus on a novel topic, weakly-supervised semantic segmentation in cityscape via HSIs. It is based on the idea that high-resolution HSIs in city scenes contain rich spectral information, which can be easily associated to semantics without manual labeling. Therefore, it enables low cost, highly reliable semantic segmentation in complex scenes. Specifically, in this paper, we theoretically analyze the HSIs and introduce a weakly-supervised HSI semantic segmentation framework, which utilizes spectral information to improve the coarse labels to a finer degree. The experimental results show that our method can obtain highly competitive labels and even have higher edge fineness than artificial fine labels in some classes. At the same time, the results also show that the refined labels can effectively improve the effect of semantic segmentation. The combination of HSIs and semantic segmentation proves that HSIs have great potential in high-level visual tasks."
Firearm Detection via Convolutional Neural Networks: Comparing a Semantic Segmentation Model Against End-to-End Solutions,"Threat detection of weapons and aggressive behavior from live video can be used for rapid detection and prevention of potentially deadly incidents such as terrorism, general criminal offences, or even domestic violence. One way for achieving this is through the use of artificial intelligence and, in particular, machine learning for image analysis. In this paper we conduct a comparison between a traditional monolithic end-to-end deep learning model and a previously proposed model based on an ensemble of simpler neural networks detecting fire-weapons via semantic segmentation. We evaluated both models from different points of view, including accuracy, computational and data complexity, flexibility and reliability. Our results show that a semantic segmentation model provides considerable amount of flexibility and resilience in the low data environment compared to classical deep model models, although its configuration and tuning presents a challenge in achieving the same levels of accuracy as an end-to-end model."
Embodied Visual Active Learning for Semantic Segmentation,"We study the task of embodied visual active learning, where an agent is set to explore a 3d environment with the goal to acquire visual scene understanding by actively selecting views for which to request annotation. While accurate on some benchmarks, today's deep visual recognition pipelines tend to not generalize well in certain real-world scenarios, or for unusual viewpoints. Robotic perception, in turn, requires the capability to refine the recognition capabilities for the conditions where the mobile system operates, including cluttered indoor environments or poor illumination. This motivates the proposed task, where an agent is placed in a novel environment with the objective of improving its visual recognition capability. To study embodied visual active learning, we develop a battery of agents - both learnt and pre-specified - and with different levels of knowledge of the environment. The agents are equipped with a semantic segmentation network and seek to acquire informative views, move and explore in order to propagate annotations in the neighbourhood of those views, then refine the underlying segmentation network by online retraining. The trainable method uses deep reinforcement learning with a reward function that balances two competing objectives: task performance, represented as visual recognition accuracy, which requires exploring the environment, and the necessary amount of annotated data requested during active exploration. We extensively evaluate the proposed models using the photorealistic Matterport3D simulator and show that a fully learnt method outperforms comparable pre-specified counterparts, even when requesting fewer annotations."
"Cluster, Split, Fuse, and Update: Meta-Learning for Open Compound Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation","Open compound domain adaptation (OCDA) is a domain adaptation setting, where target domain is modeled as a compound of multiple unknown homogeneous domains, which brings the advantage of improved generalization to unseen domains. In this work, we propose a principled meta-learning based approach to OCDA for semantic segmentation, MOCDA, by modeling the unlabeled target domain continuously. Our approach consists of four key steps. First, we cluster target domain into multiple sub-target domains by image styles, extracted in an unsupervised manner. Then, different sub-target domains are split into independent branches, for which batch normalization parameters are learnt to treat them independently. A meta-learner is thereafter deployed to learn to fuse sub-target domain-specific predictions, conditioned upon the style code. Meanwhile, we learn to online update the model by model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) algorithm, thus to further improve generalization. We validate the benefits of our approach by extensive experiments on synthetic-to-real knowledge transfer benchmark datasets, where we achieve the state-of-the-art performance in both compound and open domains."
Cross-Domain Grouping and Alignment for Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation,"Existing techniques to adapt semantic segmentation networks across the source and target domains within deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) deal with all the samples from the two domains in a global or category-aware manner. They do not consider an inter-class variation within the target domain itself or estimated category, providing the limitation to encode the domains having a multi-modal data distribution. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a learnable clustering module, and a novel domain adaptation framework called cross-domain grouping and alignment. To cluster the samples across domains with an aim to maximize the domain alignment without forgetting precise segmentation ability on the source domain, we present two loss functions, in particular, for encouraging semantic consistency and orthogonality among the clusters. We also present a loss so as to solve a class imbalance problem, which is the other limitation of the previous methods. Our experiments show that our method consistently boosts the adaptation performance in semantic segmentation, outperforming the state-of-the-arts on various domain adaptation settings."
Scaling Semantic Segmentation Beyond 1K Classes on a Single GPU,"The state-of-the-art object detection and image classification methods can perform impressively on more than 9k and 10k classes, respectively. In contrast, the number of classes in semantic segmentation datasets is relatively limited. This is not surprising when the restrictions caused by the lack of labeled data and high computation demand for segmentation are considered. In this paper, we propose a novel training methodology to train and scale the existing semantic segmentation models for a large number of semantic classes without increasing the memory overhead. In our embedding-based scalable segmentation approach, we reduce the space complexity of the segmentation model's output from O(C) to O(1), propose an approximation method for ground-truth class probability, and use it to compute cross-entropy loss. The proposed approach is general and can be adopted by any state-of-the-art segmentation model to gracefully scale it for any number of semantic classes with only one GPU. Our approach achieves similar, and in some cases, even better mIoU for Cityscapes, Pascal VOC, ADE20k, COCO-Stuff10k datasets when adopted to DeeplabV3+ model with different backbones. We demonstrate a clear benefit of our approach on a dataset with 1284 classes, bootstrapped from LVIS and COCO annotations, with three times better mIoU than the DeeplabV3+ model."
Iterative Utterance Segmentation for Neural Semantic Parsing,"Neural semantic parsers usually fail to parse long and complex utterances into correct meaning representations, due to the lack of exploiting the principle of compositionality. To address this issue, we present a novel framework for boosting neural semantic parsers via iterative utterance segmentation. Given an input utterance, our framework iterates between two neural modules: a segmenter for segmenting a span from the utterance, and a parser for mapping the span into a partial meaning representation. Then, these intermediate parsing results are composed into the final meaning representation. One key advantage is that this framework does not require any handcraft templates or additional labeled data for utterance segmentation: we achieve this through proposing a novel training method, in which the parser provides pseudo supervision for the segmenter. Experiments on Geo, ComplexWebQuestions, and Formulas show that our framework can consistently improve performances of neural semantic parsers in different domains. On data splits that require compositional generalization, our framework brings significant accuracy gains: Geo 63.1 to 81.2, Formulas 59.7 to 72.7, ComplexWebQuestions 27.1 to 56.3."
Contrastive Learning for Label-Efficient Semantic Segmentation,"Collecting labeled data for the task of semantic segmentation is expensive and time-consuming, as it requires dense pixel-level annotations. While recent Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based semantic segmentation approaches have achieved impressive results by using large amounts of labeled training data, their performance drops significantly as the amount of labeled data decreases. This happens because deep CNNs trained with the de facto cross-entropy loss can easily overfit to small amounts of labeled data. To address this issue, we propose a simple and effective contrastive learning-based training strategy in which we first pretrain the network using a pixel-wise, label-based contrastive loss, and then fine-tune it using the cross-entropy loss. This approach increases intra-class compactness and inter-class separability, thereby resulting in a better pixel classifier. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed training strategy using the Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC 2012 segmentation datasets. Our results show that pretraining with the proposed contrastive loss results in large performance gains (more than 20% absolute improvement in some settings) when the amount of labeled data is limited. In many settings, the proposed contrastive pretraining strategy, which does not use any additional data, is able to match or outperform the widely-used ImageNet pretraining strategy that uses more than a million additional labeled images."
Entropy Maximization and Meta Classification for Out-Of-Distribution Detection in Semantic Segmentation,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) for the semantic segmentation of images are usually trained to operate on a predefined closed set of object classes. This is in contrast to the ""open world"" setting where DNNs are envisioned to be deployed to. From a functional safety point of view, the ability to detect so-called ""out-of-distribution"" (OoD) samples, i.e., objects outside of a DNN's semantic space, is crucial for many applications such as automated driving. A natural baseline approach to OoD detection is to threshold on the pixel-wise softmax entropy. We present a two-step procedure that significantly improves that approach. Firstly, we utilize samples from the COCO dataset as OoD proxy and introduce a second training objective to maximize the softmax entropy on these samples. Starting from pretrained semantic segmentation networks we re-train a number of DNNs on different in-distribution datasets and consistently observe improved OoD detection performance when evaluating on completely disjoint OoD datasets. Secondly, we perform a transparent post-processing step to discard false positive OoD samples by so-called ""meta classification"". To this end, we apply linear models to a set of hand-crafted metrics derived from the DNN's softmax probabilities. In our experiments we consistently observe a clear additional gain in OoD detection performance, cutting down the number of detection errors by up to 52% when comparing the best baseline with our results. We achieve this improvement sacrificing only marginally in original segmentation performance. Therefore, our method contributes to safer DNNs with more reliable overall system performance."
Group-Wise Semantic Mining for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Acquiring sufficient ground-truth supervision to train deep visual models has been a bottleneck over the years due to the data-hungry nature of deep learning. This is exacerbated in some structured prediction tasks, such as semantic segmentation, which requires pixel-level annotations. This work addresses weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS), with the goal of bridging the gap between image-level annotations and pixel-level segmentation. We formulate WSSS as a novel group-wise learning task that explicitly models semantic dependencies in a group of images to estimate more reliable pseudo ground-truths, which can be used for training more accurate segmentation models. In particular, we devise a graph neural network (GNN) for group-wise semantic mining, wherein input images are represented as graph nodes, and the underlying relations between a pair of images are characterized by an efficient co-attention mechanism. Moreover, in order to prevent the model from paying excessive attention to common semantics only, we further propose a graph dropout layer, encouraging the model to learn more accurate and complete object responses. The whole network is end-to-end trainable by iterative message passing, which propagates interaction cues over the images to progressively improve the performance. We conduct experiments on the popular PASCAL VOC 2012 and COCO benchmarks, and our model yields state-of-the-art performance. Our code is available at: https://github.com/Lixy1997/Group-WSSS."
AMVNet: Assertion-based Multi-View Fusion Network for LiDAR Semantic Segmentation,"In this paper, we present an Assertion-based Multi-View Fusion network (AMVNet) for LiDAR semantic segmentation which aggregates the semantic features of individual projection-based networks using late fusion. Given class scores from different projection-based networks, we perform assertion-guided point sampling on score disagreements and pass a set of point-level features for each sampled point to a simple point head which refines the predictions. This modular-and-hierarchical late fusion approach provides the flexibility of having two independent networks with a minor overhead from a light-weight network. Such approaches are desirable for robotic systems, e.g. autonomous vehicles, for which the computational and memory resources are often limited. Extensive experiments show that AMVNet achieves state-of-the-art results in both the SemanticKITTI and nuScenes benchmark datasets and that our approach outperforms the baseline method of combining the class scores of the projection-based networks."
Self-Training for Class-Incremental Semantic Segmentation,"In class-incremental semantic segmentation, we have no access to the labeled data of previous tasks. Therefore, when incrementally learning new classes, deep neural networks suffer from catastrophic forgetting of previously learned knowledge. To address this problem, we propose to apply a self-training approach that leverages unlabeled data, which is used for the rehearsal of previous knowledge. Specifically, we first learn a temporary model for the current task, and then pseudo labels for the unlabeled data are computed by fusing information from the old model of the previous task and the current temporary model. Additionally, conflict reduction is proposed to resolve the conflicts of pseudo labels generated from both the old and temporary models. We show that maximizing self-entropy can further improve results by smoothing the overconfident predictions. Interestingly, in the experiments we show that the auxiliary data can be different from the training data and that even general-purpose but diverse auxiliary data can lead to large performance gains. The experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results: obtaining a relative gain of up to 114% on Pascal-VOC 2012 and 8.5% on the more challenging ADE20K compared to previous state-of-the-art methods."
Semantic Segmentation of Medium-Resolution Satellite Imagery using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks,"Semantic segmentation of satellite imagery is a common approach to identify patterns and detect changes around the planet. Most of the state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models are trained in a fully supervised way using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The generalization property of CNN is poor for satellite imagery because the data can be very diverse in terms of landscape types, image resolutions, and scarcity of labels for different geographies and seasons. Hence, the performance of CNN doesn't translate well to images from unseen regions or seasons. Inspired by Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGAN) based approach of image-to-image translation for high-resolution satellite imagery, we propose a CGAN framework for land cover classification using medium-resolution Sentinel-2 imagery. We find that the CGAN model outperforms the CNN model of similar complexity by a significant margin on an unseen imbalanced test dataset."
Domain Adaptation on Semantic Segmentation for Aerial Images,"Semantic segmentation has achieved significant advances in recent years. While deep neural networks perform semantic segmentation well, their success rely on pixel level supervision which is expensive and time-consuming. Further, training using data from one domain may not generalize well to data from a new domain due to a domain gap between data distributions in the different domains. This domain gap is particularly evident in aerial images where visual appearance depends on the type of environment imaged, season, weather, and time of day when the environment is imaged. Subsequently, this distribution gap leads to severe accuracy loss when using a pretrained segmentation model to analyze new data with different characteristics. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised domain adaptation framework to address domain shift in the context of aerial semantic image segmentation. To this end, we solve the problem of domain shift by learn the soft label distribution difference between the source and target domains. Further, we also apply entropy minimization on the target domain to produce high-confident prediction rather than using high-confident prediction by pseudo-labeling. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our domain adaptation framework using the challenge image segmentation dataset of ISPRS, and show improvement over state-of-the-art methods in terms of various metrics."
From a Fourier-Domain Perspective on Adversarial Examples to a Wiener Filter Defense for Semantic Segmentation,"Despite recent advancements, deep neural networks are not robust against adversarial perturbations. Many of the proposed adversarial defense approaches use computationally expensive training mechanisms that do not scale to complex real-world tasks such as semantic segmentation, and offer only marginal improvements. In addition, fundamental questions on the nature of adversarial perturbations and their relation to the network architecture are largely understudied. In this work, we study the adversarial problem from a frequency domain perspective. More specifically, we analyze discrete Fourier transform (DFT) spectra of several adversarial images and report two major findings: First, there exists a strong connection between a model architecture and the nature of adversarial perturbations that can be observed and addressed in the frequency domain. Second, the observed frequency patterns are largely image- and attack-type independent, which is important for the practical impact of any defense making use of such patterns. Motivated by these findings, we additionally propose an adversarial defense method based on the well-known Wiener filters that captures and suppresses adversarial frequencies in a data-driven manner. Our proposed method not only generalizes across unseen attacks but also beats five existing state-of-the-art methods across two models in a variety of attack settings."
Prototype-based Incremental Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation models have two fundamental weaknesses: i) they require large training sets with costly pixel-level annotations, and ii) they have a static output space, constrained to the classes of the training set. Toward addressing both problems, we introduce a new task, Incremental Few-Shot Segmentation (iFSS). The goal of iFSS is to extend a pretrained segmentation model with new classes from few annotated images and without access to old training data. To overcome the limitations of existing models iniFSS, we propose Prototype-based Incremental Few-Shot Segmentation (PIFS) that couples prototype learning and knowledge distillation. PIFS exploits prototypes to initialize the classifiers of new classes, fine-tuning the network to refine its features representation. We design a prototype-based distillation loss on the scores of both old and new class prototypes to avoid overfitting and forgetting, and batch-renormalization to cope with non-i.i.d.few-shot data. We create an extensive benchmark for iFSS showing that PIFS outperforms several few-shot and incremental learning methods in all scenarios."
A Three-Stage Self-Training Framework for Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation has been widely investigated in the community, in which the state of the art techniques are based on supervised models. Those models have reported unprecedented performance at the cost of requiring a large set of high quality segmentation masks. To obtain such annotations is highly expensive and time consuming, in particular, in semantic segmentation where pixel-level annotations are required. In this work, we address this problem by proposing a holistic solution framed as a three-stage self-training framework for semi-supervised semantic segmentation. The key idea of our technique is the extraction of the pseudo-masks statistical information to decrease uncertainty in the predicted probability whilst enforcing segmentation consistency in a multi-task fashion. We achieve this through a three-stage solution. Firstly, we train a segmentation network to produce rough pseudo-masks which predicted probability is highly uncertain. Secondly, we then decrease the uncertainty of the pseudo-masks using a multi-task model that enforces consistency whilst exploiting the rich statistical information of the data. We compare our approach with existing methods for semi-supervised semantic segmentation and demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance with extensive experiments."
3D Guided Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Pixel-wise clean annotation is necessary for fully-supervised semantic segmentation, which is laborious and expensive to obtain. In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised 2D semantic segmentation model by incorporating sparse bounding box labels with available 3D information, which is much easier to obtain with advanced sensors. We manually labeled a subset of the 2D-3D Semantics(2D-3D-S) dataset with bounding boxes, and introduce our 2D-3D inference module to generate accurate pixel-wise segment proposal masks. Guided by 3D information, we first generate a point cloud of objects and calculate objectness probability score for each point. Then we project the point cloud with objectness probabilities back to 2D images followed by a refinement step to obtain segment proposals, which are treated as pseudo labels to train a semantic segmentation network. Our method works in a recursive manner to gradually refine the above-mentioned segment proposals. Extensive experimental results on the 2D-3D-S dataset show that the proposed method can generate accurate segment proposals when bounding box labels are available on only a small subset of training images. Performance comparison with recent state-of-the-art methods further illustrates the effectiveness of our method."
Training and Inference for Integer-Based Semantic Segmentation Network,"Semantic segmentation has been a major topic in research and industry in recent years. However, due to the computation complexity of pixel-wise prediction and backpropagation algorithm, semantic segmentation has been demanding in computation resources, resulting in slow training and inference speed and large storage space to store models. Existing schemes that speed up segmentation network change the network structure and come with noticeable accuracy degradation. However, neural network quantization can be used to reduce computation load while maintaining comparable accuracy and original network structure. Semantic segmentation networks are different from traditional deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) in many ways, and this topic has not been thoroughly explored in existing works. In this paper, we propose a new quantization framework for training and inference of segmentation networks, where parameters and operations are constrained to 8-bit integer-based values for the first time. Full quantization of the data flow and the removal of square and root operations in batch normalization give our framework the ability to perform inference on fixed-point devices. Our proposed framework is evaluated on mainstream semantic segmentation networks like FCN-VGG16 and DeepLabv3-ResNet50, achieving comparable accuracy against floating-point framework on ADE20K dataset and PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset."
Multi-stage Attention ResU-Net for Semantic Segmentation of Fine-Resolution Remote Sensing Images,"The attention mechanism can refine the extracted feature maps and boost the classification performance of the deep network, which has become an essential technique in computer vision and natural language processing. However, the memory and computational costs of the dot-product attention mechanism increase quadratically with the spatio-temporal size of the input. Such growth hinders the usage of attention mechanisms considerably in application scenarios with large-scale inputs. In this Letter, we propose a Linear Attention Mechanism (LAM) to address this issue, which is approximately equivalent to dot-product attention with computational efficiency. Such a design makes the incorporation between attention mechanisms and deep networks much more flexible and versatile. Based on the proposed LAM, we re-factor the skip connections in the raw U-Net and design a Multi-stage Attention ResU-Net (MAResU-Net) for semantic segmentation from fine-resolution remote sensing images. Experiments conducted on the Vaihingen dataset demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of our MAResU-Net. Open-source code is available at https://github.com/lironui/Multistage-Attention-ResU-Net."
UVid-Net: Enhanced Semantic Segmentation of UAV Aerial Videos by Embedding Temporal Information,"Semantic segmentation of aerial videos has been extensively used for decision making in monitoring environmental changes, urban planning, and disaster management. The reliability of these decision support systems is dependent on the accuracy of the video semantic segmentation algorithms. The existing CNN based video semantic segmentation methods have enhanced the image semantic segmentation methods by incorporating an additional module such as LSTM or optical flow for computing temporal dynamics of the video which is a computational overhead. The proposed research work modifies the CNN architecture by incorporating temporal information to improve the efficiency of video semantic segmentation.  In this work, an enhanced encoder-decoder based CNN architecture (UVid-Net) is proposed for UAV video semantic segmentation. The encoder of the proposed architecture embeds temporal information for temporally consistent labelling. The decoder is enhanced by introducing the feature-refiner module, which aids in accurate localization of the class labels. The proposed UVid-Net architecture for UAV video semantic segmentation is quantitatively evaluated on extended ManipalUAVid dataset. The performance metric mIoU of 0.79 has been observed which is significantly greater than the other state-of-the-art algorithms. Further, the proposed work produced promising results even for the pre-trained model of UVid-Net on urban street scene with fine tuning the final layer on UAV aerial videos."
Multi-task GANs for Semantic Segmentation and Depth Completion with Cycle Consistency,"Semantic segmentation and depth completion are two challenging tasks in scene understanding, and they are widely used in robotics and autonomous driving. Although several works are proposed to jointly train these two tasks using some small modifications, like changing the last layer, the result of one task is not utilized to improve the performance of the other one despite that there are some similarities between these two tasks. In this paper, we propose multi-task generative adversarial networks (Multi-task GANs), which are not only competent in semantic segmentation and depth completion, but also improve the accuracy of depth completion through generated semantic images. In addition, we improve the details of generated semantic images based on CycleGAN by introducing multi-scale spatial pooling blocks and the structural similarity reconstruction loss. Furthermore, considering the inner consistency between semantic and geometric structures, we develop a semantic-guided smoothness loss to improve depth completion results. Extensive experiments on Cityscapes dataset and KITTI depth completion benchmark show that the Multi-task GANs are capable of achieving competitive performance for both semantic segmentation and depth completion tasks."
Spherical Interpolated Convolutional Network with Distance-Feature Density for 3D Semantic Segmentation of Point Clouds,"The semantic segmentation of point clouds is an important part of the environment perception for robots. However, it is difficult to directly adopt the traditional 3D convolution kernel to extract features from raw 3D point clouds because of the unstructured property of point clouds. In this paper, a spherical interpolated convolution operator is proposed to replace the traditional grid-shaped 3D convolution operator. This newly proposed feature extraction operator improves the accuracy of the network and reduces the parameters of the network. In addition, this paper analyzes the defect of point cloud interpolation methods based on the distance as the interpolation weight and proposes the self-learned distance-feature density by combining the distance and the feature correlation. The proposed method makes the feature extraction of spherical interpolated convolution network more rational and effective. The effectiveness of the proposed network is demonstrated on the 3D semantic segmentation task of point clouds. Experiments show that the proposed method achieves good performance on the ScanNet dataset and Paris-Lille-3D dataset."
Polarization-driven Semantic Segmentation via Efficient Attention-bridged Fusion,"Semantic Segmentation (SS) is promising for outdoor scene perception in safety-critical applications like autonomous vehicles, assisted navigation and so on. However, traditional SS is primarily based on RGB images, which limits the reliability of SS in complex outdoor scenes, where RGB images lack necessary information dimensions to fully perceive unconstrained environments. As preliminary investigation, we examine SS in an unexpected obstacle detection scenario, which demonstrates the necessity of multimodal fusion. Thereby, in this work, we present EAFNet, an Efficient Attention-bridged Fusion Network to exploit complementary information coming from different optical sensors. Specifically, we incorporate polarization sensing to obtain supplementary information, considering its optical characteristics for robust representation of diverse materials. By using a single-shot polarization sensor, we build the first RGB-P dataset which consists of 394 annotated pixel-aligned RGB-Polarization images. A comprehensive variety of experiments shows the effectiveness of EAFNet to fuse polarization and RGB information, as well as the flexibility to be adapted to other sensor combination scenarios."
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation in Semantic Segmentation via Orthogonal and Clustered Embeddings,"Deep learning frameworks allowed for a remarkable advancement in semantic segmentation, but the data hungry nature of convolutional networks has rapidly raised the demand for adaptation techniques able to transfer learned knowledge from label-abundant domains to unlabeled ones. In this paper we propose an effective Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) strategy, based on a feature clustering method that captures the different semantic modes of the feature distribution and groups features of the same class into tight and well-separated clusters. Furthermore, we introduce two novel learning objectives to enhance the discriminative clustering performance: an orthogonality loss forces spaced out individual representations to be orthogonal, while a sparsity loss reduces class-wise the number of active feature channels. The joint effect of these modules is to regularize the structure of the feature space. Extensive evaluations in the synthetic-to-real scenario show that we achieve state-of-the-art performance."
PLOP: Learning without Forgetting for Continual Semantic Segmentation,"Deep learning approaches are nowadays ubiquitously used to tackle computer vision tasks such as semantic segmentation, requiring large datasets and substantial computational power. Continual learning for semantic segmentation (CSS) is an emerging trend that consists in updating an old model by sequentially adding new classes. However, continual learning methods are usually prone to catastrophic forgetting. This issue is further aggravated in CSS where, at each step, old classes from previous iterations are collapsed into the background. In this paper, we propose Local POD, a multi-scale pooling distillation scheme that preserves long- and short-range spatial relationships at feature level. Furthermore, we design an entropy-based pseudo-labelling of the background w.r.t. classes predicted by the old model to deal with background shift and avoid catastrophic forgetting of the old classes. Our approach, called PLOP, significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in existing CSS scenarios, as well as in newly proposed challenging benchmarks."
Deep LF-Net: Semantic Lung Segmentation from Indian Chest Radiographs Including Severely Unhealthy Images,"A chest radiograph, commonly called chest x-ray (CxR), plays a vital role in the diagnosis of various lung diseases, such as lung cancer, tuberculosis, pneumonia, and many more. Automated segmentation of the lungs is an important step to design a computer-aided diagnostic tool for examination of a CxR. Precise lung segmentation is considered extremely challenging because of variance in the shape of the lung caused by health issues, age, and gender. The proposed work investigates the use of an efficient deep convolutional neural network for accurate segmentation of lungs from CxR. We attempt an end to end DeepLabv3+ network which integrates DeepLab architecture, encoder-decoder, and dilated convolution for semantic lung segmentation with fast training and high accuracy. We experimented with the different pre-trained base networks: Resnet18 and Mobilenetv2, associated with the Deeplabv3+ model for performance analysis. The proposed approach does not require any pre-processing technique on chest x-ray images before being fed to a neural network. Morphological operations were used to remove false positives that occurred during semantic segmentation. We construct a CxR dataset of the Indian population that contain healthy and unhealthy CxRs of clinically confirmed patients of tuberculosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, pleural effusion, and lung cancer. The proposed method is tested on 688 images of our Indian CxR dataset including images with severe abnormal findings to validate its robustness. We also experimented on commonly used benchmark datasets such as Japanese Society of Radiological Technology; Montgomery County, USA; and Shenzhen, China for state-of-the-art comparison. The performance of our method is tested against techniques described in the literature and achieved the highest accuracy for lung segmentation on Indian and public datasets."
Multi Receptive Field Network for Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation is one of the key tasks in computer vision, which is to assign a category label to each pixel in an image. Despite significant progress achieved recently, most existing methods still suffer from two challenging issues: 1) the size of objects and stuff in an image can be very diverse, demanding for incorporating multi-scale features into the fully convolutional networks (FCNs); 2) the pixels close to or at the boundaries of object/stuff are hard to classify due to the intrinsic weakness of convolutional networks. To address the first issue, we propose a new Multi-Receptive Field Module (MRFM), explicitly taking multi-scale features into account. For the second issue, we design an edge-aware loss which is effective in distinguishing the boundaries of object/stuff. With these two designs, our Multi Receptive Field Network achieves new state-of-the-art results on two widely-used semantic segmentation benchmark datasets. Specifically, we achieve a mean IoU of 83.0 on the Cityscapes dataset and 88.4 mean IoU on the Pascal VOC2012 dataset."
Unsupervised BatchNorm Adaptation (UBNA): A Domain Adaptation Method for Semantic Segmentation Without Using Source Domain Representations,"In this paper we present a solution to the task of ""unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) of a given pre-trained semantic segmentation model without relying on any source domain representations"". Previous UDA approaches for semantic segmentation either employed simultaneous training of the model in the source and target domains, or they relied on an additional network, replaying source domain knowledge to the model during adaptation. In contrast, we present our novel Unsupervised BatchNorm Adaptation (UBNA) method, which adapts a given pre-trained model to an unseen target domain without using -- beyond the existing model parameters from pre-training -- any source domain representations (neither data, nor networks) and which can also be applied in an online setting or using just a few unlabeled images from the target domain in a few-shot manner. Specifically, we partially adapt the normalization layer statistics to the target domain using an exponentially decaying momentum factor, thereby mixing the statistics from both domains. By evaluation on standard UDA benchmarks for semantic segmentation we show that this is superior to a model without adaptation and to baseline approaches using statistics from the target domain only. Compared to standard UDA approaches we report a trade-off between performance and usage of source domain representations."
A comparative study of semi- and self-supervised semantic segmentation of biomedical microscopy data,"In recent years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the state-of-the-art method for biomedical image analysis. However, these networks are usually trained in a supervised manner, requiring large amounts of labelled training data. These labelled data sets are often difficult to acquire in the biomedical domain. In this work, we validate alternative ways to train CNNs with fewer labels for biomedical image segmentation using. We adapt two semi- and self-supervised image classification methods and analyse their performance for semantic segmentation of biomedical microscopy images."
Street to Cloud: Improving Flood Maps With Crowdsourcing and Semantic Segmentation,"To address the mounting destruction caused by floods in climate-vulnerable regions, we propose Street to Cloud, a machine learning pipeline for incorporating crowdsourced ground truth data into the segmentation of satellite imagery of floods. We propose this approach as a solution to the labor-intensive task of generating high-quality, hand-labeled training data, and demonstrate successes and failures of different plausible crowdsourcing approaches in our model. Street to Cloud leverages community reporting and machine learning to generate novel, near-real time insights into the extent of floods to be used for emergency response."
Towards Map-Based Validation of Semantic Segmentation Masks,"Artificial intelligence for autonomous driving must meet strict requirements on safety and robustness. We propose to validate machine learning models for self-driving vehicles not only with given ground truth labels, but also with additional a-priori knowledge. In particular, we suggest to validate the drivable area in semantic segmentation masks using given street map data. We present first results, which indicate that prediction errors can be uncovered by map-based validation."
Domain Adaptive Knowledge Distillation for Driving Scene Semantic Segmentation,"Practical autonomous driving systems face two crucial challenges: memory constraints and domain gap issues. In this paper, we present a novel approach to learn domain adaptive knowledge in models with limited memory, thus bestowing the model with the ability to deal with these issues in a comprehensive manner. We term this as ""Domain Adaptive Knowledge Distillation"" and address the same in the context of unsupervised domain-adaptive semantic segmentation by proposing a multi-level distillation strategy to effectively distil knowledge at different levels. Further, we introduce a novel cross entropy loss that leverages pseudo labels from the teacher. These pseudo teacher labels play a multifaceted role towards: (i) knowledge distillation from the teacher network to the student network & (ii) serving as a proxy for the ground truth for target domain images, where the problem is completely unsupervised. We introduce four paradigms for distilling domain adaptive knowledge and carry out extensive experiments and ablation studies on real-to-real as well as synthetic-to-real scenarios. Our experiments demonstrate the profound success of our proposed method."
Studying Robustness of Semantic Segmentation under Domain Shift in cardiac MRI,"Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) is an integral part of diagnosis in many heart related diseases. Recently, deep neural networks have demonstrated successful automatic segmentation, thus alleviating the burden of time-consuming manual contouring of cardiac structures. Moreover, frameworks such as nnU-Net provide entirely automatic model configuration to unseen datasets enabling out-of-the-box application even by non-experts. However, current studies commonly neglect the clinically realistic scenario, in which a trained network is applied to data from a different domain such as deviating scanners or imaging protocols. This potentially leads to unexpected performance drops of deep learning models in real life applications. In this work, we systematically study challenges and opportunities of domain transfer across images from multiple clinical centres and scanner vendors. In order to maintain out-of-the-box usability, we build upon a fixed U-Net architecture configured by the nnU-net framework to investigate various data augmentation techniques and batch normalization layers as an easy-to-customize pipeline component and provide general guidelines on how to improve domain generalizability abilities in existing deep learning methods. Our proposed method ranked first at the Multi-Centre, Multi-Vendor & Multi-Disease Cardiac Image Segmentation Challenge (M&Ms)."
Efficient RGB-D Semantic Segmentation for Indoor Scene Analysis,"Analyzing scenes thoroughly is crucial for mobile robots acting in different environments. Semantic segmentation can enhance various subsequent tasks, such as (semantically assisted) person perception, (semantic) free space detection, (semantic) mapping, and (semantic) navigation. In this paper, we propose an efficient and robust RGB-D segmentation approach that can be optimized to a high degree using NVIDIA TensorRT and, thus, is well suited as a common initial processing step in a complex system for scene analysis on mobile robots. We show that RGB-D segmentation is superior to processing RGB images solely and that it can still be performed in real time if the network architecture is carefully designed. We evaluate our proposed Efficient Scene Analysis Network (ESANet) on the common indoor datasets NYUv2 and SUNRGB-D and show that we reach state-of-the-art performance while enabling faster inference. Furthermore, our evaluation on the outdoor dataset Cityscapes shows that our approach is suitable for other areas of application as well. Finally, instead of presenting benchmark results only, we also show qualitative results in one of our indoor application scenarios."
LULC classification by semantic segmentation of satellite images using FastFCN,"This paper analyses how well a Fast Fully Convolutional Network (FastFCN) semantically segments satellite images and thus classifies Land Use/Land Cover(LULC) classes. Fast-FCN was used on Gaofen-2 Image Dataset (GID-2) to segment them in five different classes: BuiltUp, Meadow, Farmland, Water and Forest. The results showed better accuracy (0.93), precision (0.99), recall (0.98) and mean Intersection over Union (mIoU)(0.97) than other approaches like using FCN-8 or eCognition, a readily available software. We presented a comparison between the results. We propose FastFCN to be both faster and more accurate automated method than other existing methods for LULC classification."
Scribble-Supervised Semantic Segmentation by Random Walk on Neural Representation and Self-Supervision on Neural Eigenspace,"Scribble-supervised semantic segmentation has gained much attention recently for its promising performance without high-quality annotations. Many approaches have been proposed. Typically, they handle this problem to either introduce a well-labeled dataset from another related task, turn to iterative refinement and post-processing with the graphical model, or manipulate the scribble label. This work aims to achieve semantic segmentation supervised by scribble label directly without auxiliary information and other intermediate manipulation. Specifically, we impose diffusion on neural representation by random walk and consistency on neural eigenspace by self-supervision, which forces the neural network to produce dense and consistent predictions over the whole dataset. The random walk embedded in the network will compute a probabilistic transition matrix, with which the neural representation diffused to be uniform. Moreover, given the probabilistic transition matrix, we apply the self-supervision on its eigenspace for consistency in the image's main parts. In addition to comparing the common scribble dataset, we also conduct experiments on the modified datasets that randomly shrink and even drop the scribbles on image objects. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method and are even comparable to some full-label supervised ones. The code and datasets are available at https://github.com/panzhiyi/RW-SS."
MP-ResNet: Multi-path Residual Network for the Semantic segmentation of High-Resolution PolSAR Images,"There are limited studies on the semantic segmentation of high-resolution Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) images due to the scarcity of training data and the inference of speckle noises. The Gaofen contest has provided open access of a high-quality PolSAR semantic segmentation dataset. Taking this chance, we propose a Multi-path ResNet (MP-ResNet) architecture for the semantic segmentation of high-resolution PolSAR images. Compared to conventional U-shape encoder-decoder convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, the MP-ResNet learns semantic context with its parallel multi-scale branches, which greatly enlarges its valid receptive fields and improves the embedding of local discriminative features. In addition, MP-ResNet adopts a multi-level feature fusion design in its decoder to make the best use of the features learned from its different branches. Ablation studies show that the MPResNet has significant advantages over its baseline method (FCN with ResNet34). It also surpasses several classic state-of-the-art methods in terms of overall accuracy (OA), mean F1 and fwIoU, whereas its computational costs are not much increased. This CNN architecture can be used as a baseline method for future studies on the semantic segmentation of PolSAR images. The code is available at: https://github.com/ggsDing/SARSeg."
Find it if You Can: End-to-End Adversarial Erasing for Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation is a task that traditionally requires a large dataset of pixel-level ground truth labels, which is time-consuming and expensive to obtain. Recent advancements in the weakly-supervised setting show that reasonable performance can be obtained by using only image-level labels. Classification is often used as a proxy task to train a deep neural network from which attention maps are extracted. However, the classification task needs only the minimum evidence to make predictions, hence it focuses on the most discriminative object regions. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel formulation of adversarial erasing of the attention maps. In contrast to previous adversarial erasing methods, we optimize two networks with opposing loss functions, which eliminates the requirement of certain suboptimal strategies; for instance, having multiple training steps that complicate the training process or a weight sharing policy between networks operating on different distributions that might be suboptimal for performance. The proposed solution does not require saliency masks, instead it uses a regularization loss to prevent the attention maps from spreading to less discriminative object regions. Our experiments on the Pascal VOC dataset demonstrate that our adversarial approach increases segmentation performance by 2.1 mIoU compared to our baseline and by 1.0 mIoU compared to previous adversarial erasing approaches."
Multi Projection Fusion for Real-time Semantic Segmentation of 3D LiDAR Point Clouds,"Semantic segmentation of 3D point cloud data is essential for enhanced high-level perception in autonomous platforms. Furthermore, given the increasing deployment of LiDAR sensors onboard of cars and drones, a special emphasis is also placed on non-computationally intensive algorithms that operate on mobile GPUs. Previous efficient state-of-the-art methods relied on 2D spherical projection of point clouds as input for 2D fully convolutional neural networks to balance the accuracy-speed trade-off. This paper introduces a novel approach for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation that exploits multiple projections of the point cloud to mitigate the loss of information inherent in single projection methods. Our Multi-Projection Fusion (MPF) framework analyzes spherical and bird's-eye view projections using two separate highly-efficient 2D fully convolutional models then combines the segmentation results of both views. The proposed framework is validated on the SemanticKITTI dataset where it achieved a mIoU of 55.5 which is higher than state-of-the-art projection-based methods RangeNet++ and PolarNet while being 1.6x faster than the former and 3.1x faster than the latter."
Convolution Neural Networks for Semantic Segmentation: Application to Small Datasets of Biomedical Images,"This thesis studies how the segmentation results, produced by convolutional neural networks (CNN), is different from each other when applied to small biomedical datasets. We use different architectures, parameters and hyper-parameters, trying to find out the better configurations for our task, and trying to find out underlying regularities. Two working datasets are from biomedical area of research. We conducted a lot of experiments with the two types of networks and the received results have shown the preference of some conditions of experiments and parameters of the networks over the others. All testing results are given in the tables and some selected resulting graphs and segmentation predictions are shown for better illustration."
Real-time Semantic Segmentation with Context Aggregation Network,"With the increasing demand of autonomous systems, pixelwise semantic segmentation for visual scene understanding needs to be not only accurate but also efficient for potential real-time applications. In this paper, we propose Context Aggregation Network, a dual branch convolutional neural network, with significantly lower computational costs as compared to the state-of-the-art, while maintaining a competitive prediction accuracy. Building upon the existing dual branch architectures for high-speed semantic segmentation, we design a cheap high resolution branch for effective spatial detailing and a context branch with light-weight versions of global aggregation and local distribution blocks, potent to capture both long-range and local contextual dependencies required for accurate semantic segmentation, with low computational overheads. We evaluate our method on two semantic segmentation datasets, namely Cityscapes dataset and UAVid dataset. For Cityscapes test set, our model achieves state-of-the-art results with mIOU of 75.9%, at 76 FPS on an NVIDIA RTX 2080Ti and 8 FPS on a Jetson Xavier NX. With regards to UAVid dataset, our proposed network achieves mIOU score of 63.5% with high execution speed (15 FPS)."
Highway Driving Dataset for Semantic Video Segmentation,"Scene understanding is an essential technique in semantic segmentation. Although there exist several datasets that can be used for semantic segmentation, they are mainly focused on semantic image segmentation with large deep neural networks. Therefore, these networks are not useful for real time applications, especially in autonomous driving systems. In order to solve this problem, we make two contributions to semantic segmentation task. The first contribution is that we introduce the semantic video dataset, the Highway Driving dataset, which is a densely annotated benchmark for a semantic video segmentation task. The Highway Driving dataset consists of 20 video sequences having a 30Hz frame rate, and every frame is densely annotated. Secondly, we propose a baseline algorithm that utilizes a temporal correlation. Together with our attempt to analyze the temporal correlation, we expect the Highway Driving dataset to encourage research on semantic video segmentation."
Pixel-Level Cycle Association: A New Perspective for Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation,"Domain adaptive semantic segmentation aims to train a model performing satisfactory pixel-level predictions on the target with only out-of-domain (source) annotations. The conventional solution to this task is to minimize the discrepancy between source and target to enable effective knowledge transfer. Previous domain discrepancy minimization methods are mainly based on the adversarial training. They tend to consider the domain discrepancy globally, which ignore the pixel-wise relationships and are less discriminative. In this paper, we propose to build the pixel-level cycle association between source and target pixel pairs and contrastively strengthen their connections to diminish the domain gap and make the features more discriminative. To the best of our knowledge, this is a new perspective for tackling such a challenging task. Experiment results on two representative domain adaptation benchmarks, i.e. GTAV \rightarrow Cityscapes and SYNTHIA \rightarrow Cityscapes, verify the effectiveness of our proposed method and demonstrate that our method performs favorably against previous state-of-the-arts. Our method can be trained end-to-end in one stage and introduces no additional parameters, which is expected to serve as a general framework and help ease future research in domain adaptive semantic segmentation. Code is available at https://github.com/kgl-prml/Pixel- Level-Cycle-Association."
Semantic video segmentation for autonomous driving,"We aim to solve semantic video segmentation in autonomous driving, namely road detection in real time video, using techniques discussed in (Shelhamer et al., 2016a). While fully convolutional network gives good result, we show that the speed can be halved while preserving the accuracy. The test dataset being used is KITTI, which consists of real footage from Germany's streets."
Instance Semantic Segmentation Benefits from Generative Adversarial Networks,"In design of instance segmentation networks that reconstruct masks, segmentation is often taken as its literal definition -- assigning each pixel a label. This has led to thinking the problem as a template matching one with the goal of minimizing the loss between the reconstructed and the ground truth pixels. Rethinking reconstruction networks as a generator, we define the problem of predicting masks as a GANs game framework: A segmentation network generates the masks, and a discriminator network decides on the quality of the masks. To demonstrate this game, we show effective modifications on the general segmentation framework in Mask R-CNN. We find that playing the game in feature space is more effective than the pixel space leading to stable training between the discriminator and the generator, predicting object coordinates should be replaced by predicting contextual regions for objects, and overall the adversarial loss helps the performance and removes the need for any custom settings per different data domain. We test our framework in various domains and report on cellphone recycling, autonomous driving, large-scale object detection, and medical glands. We observe in general GANs yield masks that account for crispier boundaries, clutter, small objects, and details, being in domain of regular shapes or heterogeneous and coalescing shapes. Our code for reproducing the results is available publicly."
A Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation Approach based on the Centroid Loss: Application to Quality Control and Inspection,"It is generally accepted that one of the critical parts of current vision algorithms based on deep learning and convolutional neural networks is the annotation of a sufficient number of images to achieve competitive performance. This is particularly difficult for semantic segmentation tasks since the annotation must be ideally generated at the pixel level. Weakly-supervised semantic segmentation aims at reducing this cost by employing simpler annotations that, hence, are easier, cheaper and quicker to produce. In this paper, we propose and assess a new weakly-supervised semantic segmentation approach making use of a novel loss function whose goal is to counteract the effects of weak annotations. To this end, this loss function comprises several terms based on partial cross-entropy losses, being one of them the Centroid Loss. This term induces a clustering of the image pixels in the object classes under consideration, whose aim is to improve the training of the segmentation network by guiding the optimization. The performance of the approach is evaluated against datasets from two different industry-related case studies: while one involves the detection of instances of a number of different object classes in the context of a quality control application, the other stems from the visual inspection domain and deals with the localization of images areas whose pixels correspond to scene surface points affected by a specific sort of defect. The detection results that are reported for both cases show that, despite the differences among them and the particular challenges, the use of weak annotations do not prevent from achieving a competitive performance level for both."
Importance-Aware Semantic Segmentation in Self-Driving with Discrete Wasserstein Training,"Semantic segmentation (SS) is an important perception manner for self-driving cars and robotics, which classifies each pixel into a pre-determined class. The widely-used cross entropy (CE) loss-based deep networks has achieved significant progress w.r.t. the mean Intersection-over Union (mIoU). However, the cross entropy loss can not take the different importance of each class in an self-driving system into account. For example, pedestrians in the image should be much more important than the surrounding buildings when make a decisions in the driving, so their segmentation results are expected to be as accurate as possible. In this paper, we propose to incorporate the importance-aware inter-class correlation in a Wasserstein training framework by configuring its ground distance matrix. The ground distance matrix can be pre-defined following a priori in a specific task, and the previous importance-ignored methods can be the particular cases. From an optimization perspective, we also extend our ground metric to a linear, convex or concave increasing function w.r.t. pre-defined ground distance. We evaluate our method on CamVid and Cityscapes datasets with different backbones (SegNet, ENet, FCN and Deeplab) in a plug and play fashion. In our extenssive experiments, Wasserstein loss demonstrates superior segmentation performance on the predefined critical classes for safe-driving."
Domain Adaptation in LiDAR Semantic Segmentation by Aligning Class Distributions,"LiDAR semantic segmentation provides 3D semantic information about the environment, an essential cue for intelligent systems during their decision making processes. Deep neural networks are achieving state-of-the-art results on large public benchmarks on this task. Unfortunately, finding models that generalize well or adapt to additional domains, where data distribution is different, remains a major challenge. This work addresses the problem of unsupervised domain adaptation for LiDAR semantic segmentation models. Our approach combines novel ideas on top of the current state-of-the-art approaches and yields new state-of-the-art results. We propose simple but effective strategies to reduce the domain shift by aligning the data distribution on the input space. Besides, we propose a learning-based approach that aligns the distribution of the semantic classes of the target domain to the source domain. The presented ablation study shows how each part contributes to the final performance. Our strategy is shown to outperform previous approaches for domain adaptation with comparisons run on three different domains."
Dense Dual-Path Network for Real-time Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation has achieved remarkable results with high computational cost and a large number of parameters. However, real-world applications require efficient inference speed on embedded devices. Most previous works address the challenge by reducing depth, width and layer capacity of network, which leads to poor performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel Dense Dual-Path Network (DDPNet) for real-time semantic segmentation under resource constraints. We design a light-weight and powerful backbone with dense connectivity to facilitate feature reuse throughout the whole network and the proposed Dual-Path module (DPM) to sufficiently aggregate multi-scale contexts. Meanwhile, a simple and effective framework is built with a skip architecture utilizing the high-resolution feature maps to refine the segmentation output and an upsampling module leveraging context information from the feature maps to refine the heatmaps. The proposed DDPNet shows an obvious advantage in balancing accuracy and speed. Specifically, on Cityscapes test dataset, DDPNet achieves 75.3% mIoU with 52.6 FPS for an input of 1024 X 2048 resolution on a single GTX 1080Ti card. Compared with other state-of-the-art methods, DDPNet achieves a significant better accuracy with a comparable speed and fewer parameters."
The STDyn-SLAM: A stereo vision and semantic segmentation approach for SLAM in dynamic outdoor environments,"Commonly, SLAM algorithms are focused on a static environment, however, there are several scenes where dynamic objects are present. This work presents the STDyn-SLAM an image feature-based SLAM system working on dynamic environments using a series of sub-systems, like optic flow, orb features extraction, visual odometry, and convolutional neural networks to discern moving objects in the scene. The neural network is used to support object detection and segmentation to avoid erroneous maps and wrong system localization. The STDyn-SLAM employs a stereo pair and is developed for outdoor environments. Moreover, the processing time of the proposed system is fast enough to run in real-time as it was demonstrated through the experiments given in real dynamic outdoor environments. Further, we compare our SLAM with state-of-the-art methods achieving promising results."
PseudoSeg: Designing Pseudo Labels for Semantic Segmentation,"Recent advances in semi-supervised learning (SSL) demonstrate that a combination of consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling can effectively improve image classification accuracy in the low-data regime. Compared to classification, semantic segmentation tasks require much more intensive labeling costs. Thus, these tasks greatly benefit from data-efficient training methods. However, structured outputs in segmentation render particular difficulties (e.g., designing pseudo-labeling and augmentation) to apply existing SSL strategies. To address this problem, we present a simple and novel re-design of pseudo-labeling to generate well-calibrated structured pseudo labels for training with unlabeled or weakly-labeled data. Our proposed pseudo-labeling strategy is network structure agnostic to apply in a one-stage consistency training framework. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed pseudo-labeling strategy in both low-data and high-data regimes. Extensive experiments have validated that pseudo labels generated from wisely fusing diverse sources and strong data augmentation are crucial to consistency training for segmentation. The source code is available at https://github.com/googleinterns/wss."
Noisy-LSTM: Improving Temporal Awareness for Video Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic video segmentation is a key challenge for various applications. This paper presents a new model named Noisy-LSTM, which is trainable in an end-to-end manner, with convolutional LSTMs (ConvLSTMs) to leverage the temporal coherency in video frames. We also present a simple yet effective training strategy, which replaces a frame in video sequence with noises. This strategy spoils the temporal coherency in video frames during training and thus makes the temporal links in ConvLSTMs unreliable, which may consequently improve feature extraction from video frames, as well as serve as a regularizer to avoid overfitting, without requiring extra data annotation or computational costs. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model can achieve state-of-the-art performances in both the CityScapes and EndoVis2018 datasets."
Continual Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation,"Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) for semantic segmentation has been favorably applied to real-world scenarios in which pixel-level labels are hard to be obtained. In most of the existing UDA methods, all target data are assumed to be introduced simultaneously. Yet, the data are usually presented sequentially in the real world. Moreover, Continual UDA, which deals with more practical scenarios with multiple target domains in the continual learning setting, has not been actively explored. In this light, we propose Continual UDA for semantic segmentation based on a newly designed Expanding Target-specific Memory (ETM) framework. Our novel ETM framework contains Target-specific Memory (TM) for each target domain to alleviate catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, a proposed Double Hinge Adversarial (DHA) loss leads the network to produce better UDA performance overall. Our design of the TM and training objectives let the semantic segmentation network adapt to the current target domain while preserving the knowledge learned on previous target domains. The model with the proposed framework outperforms other state-of-the-art models in continual learning settings on standard benchmarks such as GTA5, SYNTHIA, CityScapes, IDD, and Cross-City datasets. The source code is available at https://github.com/joonh-kim/ETM."
DEAL: Difficulty-aware Active Learning for Semantic Segmentation,"Active learning aims to address the paucity of labeled data by finding the most informative samples. However, when applying to semantic segmentation, existing methods ignore the segmentation difficulty of different semantic areas, which leads to poor performance on those hard semantic areas such as tiny or slender objects. To deal with this problem, we propose a semantic Difficulty-awarE Active Learning (DEAL) network composed of two branches: the common segmentation branch and the semantic difficulty branch. For the latter branch, with the supervision of segmentation error between the segmentation result and GT, a pixel-wise probability attention module is introduced to learn the semantic difficulty scores for different semantic areas. Finally, two acquisition functions are devised to select the most valuable samples with semantic difficulty. Competitive results on semantic segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that DEAL achieves state-of-the-art active learning performance and improves the performance of the hard semantic areas in particular."
Semantic Editing On Segmentation Map Via Multi-Expansion Loss,"Semantic editing on segmentation map has been proposed as an intermediate interface for image generation, because it provides flexible and strong assistance in various image generation tasks. This paper aims to improve quality of edited segmentation map conditioned on semantic inputs. Even though recent studies apply global and local adversarial losses extensively to generate images for higher image quality, we find that they suffer from the misalignment of the boundary area in the mask area. To address this, we propose MExGAN for semantic editing on segmentation map, which uses a novel Multi-Expansion (MEx) loss implemented by adversarial losses on MEx areas. Each MEx area has the mask area of the generation as the majority and the boundary of original context as the minority. To boost convenience and stability of MEx loss, we further propose an Approximated MEx (A-MEx) loss. Besides, in contrast to previous model that builds training data for semantic editing on segmentation map with part of the whole image, which leads to model performance degradation, MExGAN applies the whole image to build the training data. Extensive experiments on semantic editing on segmentation map and natural image inpainting show competitive results on four datasets."
Auto Seg-Loss: Searching Metric Surrogates for Semantic Segmentation,"Designing proper loss functions is essential in training deep networks. Especially in the field of semantic segmentation, various evaluation metrics have been proposed for diverse scenarios. Despite the success of the widely adopted cross-entropy loss and its variants, the mis-alignment between the loss functions and evaluation metrics degrades the network performance. Meanwhile, manually designing loss functions for each specific metric requires expertise and significant manpower. In this paper, we propose to automate the design of metric-specific loss functions by searching differentiable surrogate losses for each metric. We substitute the non-differentiable operations in the metrics with parameterized functions, and conduct parameter search to optimize the shape of loss surfaces. Two constraints are introduced to regularize the search space and make the search efficient. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC and Cityscapes demonstrate that the searched surrogate losses outperform the manually designed loss functions consistently. The searched losses can generalize well to other datasets and networks. Code shall be released."
"Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation in Earth Observation: The MiniFrance Suite, Dataset Analysis and Multi-task Network Study","The development of semi-supervised learning techniques is essential to enhance the generalization capacities of machine learning algorithms. Indeed, raw image data are abundant while labels are scarce, therefore it is crucial to leverage unlabeled inputs to build better models. The availability of large databases have been key for the development of learning algorithms with high level performance.  Despite the major role of machine learning in Earth Observation to derive products such as land cover maps, datasets in the field are still limited, either because of modest surface coverage, lack of variety of scenes or restricted classes to identify. We introduce a novel large-scale dataset for semi-supervised semantic segmentation in Earth Observation, the MiniFrance suite. MiniFrance has several unprecedented properties: it is large-scale, containing over 2000 very high resolution aerial images, accounting for more than 200 billions samples (pixels); it is varied, covering 16 conurbations in France, with various climates, different landscapes, and urban as well as countryside scenes; and it is challenging, considering land use classes with high-level semantics. Nevertheless, the most distinctive quality of MiniFrance is being the only dataset in the field especially designed for semi-supervised learning: it contains labeled and unlabeled images in its training partition, which reproduces a life-like scenario. Along with this dataset, we present tools for data representativeness analysis in terms of appearance similarity and a thorough study of MiniFrance data, demonstrating that it is suitable for learning and generalizes well in a semi-supervised setting. Finally, we present semi-supervised deep architectures based on multi-task learning and the first experiments on MiniFrance."
Encoder-decoder semantic segmentation models for electroluminescence images of thin-film photovoltaic modules,"We consider a series of image segmentation methods based on the deep neural networks in order to perform semantic segmentation of electroluminescence (EL) images of thin-film modules. We utilize the encoder-decoder deep neural network architecture. The framework is general such that it can easily be extended to other types of images (e.g. thermography) or solar cell technologies (e.g. crystalline silicon modules). The networks are trained and tested on a sample of images from a database with 6000 EL images of Copper Indium Gallium Diselenide (CIGS) thin film modules. We selected two types of features to extract, shunts and so called ""droplets"". The latter feature is often observed in the set of images. Several models are tested using various combinations of encoder-decoder layers, and a procedure is proposed to select the best model. We show exemplary results with the best selected model. Furthermore, we applied the best model to the full set of 6000 images and demonstrate that the automated segmentation of EL images can reveal many subtle features which cannot be inferred from studying a small sample of images. We believe these features can contribute to process optimization and quality control."
PP-LinkNet: Improving Semantic Segmentation of High Resolution Satellite Imagery with Multi-stage Training,"Road network and building footprint extraction is essential for many applications such as updating maps, traffic regulations, city planning, ride-hailing, disaster response \textit{etc}. Mapping road networks is currently both expensive and labor-intensive. Recently, improvements in image segmentation through the application of deep neural networks has shown promising results in extracting road segments from large scale, high resolution satellite imagery. However, significant challenges remain due to lack of enough labeled training data needed to build models for industry grade applications. In this paper, we propose a two-stage transfer learning technique to improve robustness of semantic segmentation for satellite images that leverages noisy pseudo ground truth masks obtained automatically (without human labor) from crowd-sourced OpenStreetMap (OSM) data. We further propose Pyramid Pooling-LinkNet (PP-LinkNet), an improved deep neural network for segmentation that uses focal loss, poly learning rate, and context module. We demonstrate the strengths of our approach through evaluations done on three popular datasets over two tasks, namely, road extraction and building foot-print detection. Specifically, we obtain 78.19\% meanIoU on SpaceNet building footprint dataset, 67.03\% and 77.11\% on the road topology metric on SpaceNet and DeepGlobe road extraction dataset, respectively."
Semantic Segmentation for Partially Occluded Apple Trees Based on Deep Learning,"Fruit tree pruning and fruit thinning require a powerful vision system that can provide high resolution segmentation of the fruit trees and their branches. However, recent works only consider the dormant season, where there are minimal occlusions on the branches or fit a polynomial curve to reconstruct branch shape and hence, losing information about branch thickness. In this work, we apply two state-of-the-art supervised learning models U-Net and DeepLabv3, and a conditional Generative Adversarial Network Pix2Pix (with and without the discriminator) to segment partially occluded 2D-open-V apple trees. Binary accuracy, Mean IoU, Boundary F1 score and Occluded branch recall were used to evaluate the performances of the models. DeepLabv3 outperforms the other models at Binary accuracy, Mean IoU and Boundary F1 score, but is surpassed by Pix2Pix (without discriminator) and U-Net in Occluded branch recall. We define two difficulty indices to quantify the difficulty of the task: (1) Occlusion Difficulty Index and (2) Depth Difficulty Index. We analyze the worst 10 images in both difficulty indices by means of Branch Recall and Occluded Branch Recall. U-Net outperforms the other two models in the current metrics. On the other hand, Pix2Pix (without discriminator) provides more information on branch paths, which are not reflected by the metrics. This highlights the need for more specific metrics on recovering occluded information. Furthermore, this shows the usefulness of image-transfer networks for hallucination behind occlusions. Future work is required to further enhance the models to recover more information from occlusions such that this technology can be applied to automating agricultural tasks in a commercial environment."
Land Cover Semantic Segmentation Using ResUNet,"In this paper we present our work on developing an automated system for land cover classification. This system takes a multiband satellite image of an area as input and outputs the land cover map of the area at the same resolution as the input. For this purpose convolutional machine learning models were trained in the task of predicting the land cover semantic segmentation of satellite images. This is a case of supervised learning. The land cover label data were taken from the CORINE Land Cover inventory and the satellite images were taken from the Copernicus hub. As for the model, U-Net architecture variations were applied. Our area of interest are the Ionian islands (Greece). We created a dataset from scratch covering this particular area. In addition, transfer learning from the BigEarthNet dataset [1] was performed. In [1] simple classification of satellite images into the classes of CLC is performed but not segmentation as we do. However, their models have been trained into a dataset much bigger than ours, so we applied transfer learning using their pretrained models as the first part of out network, utilizing the ability these networks have developed to extract useful features from the satellite images (we transferred a pretrained ResNet50 into a U-Res-Net). Apart from transfer learning other techniques were applied in order to overcome the limitations set by the small size of our area of interest. We used data augmentation (cutting images into overlapping patches, applying random transformations such as rotations and flips) and cross validation. The results are tested on the 3 CLC class hierarchy levels and a comparative study is made on the results of different approaches."
Increasing the Robustness of Semantic Segmentation Models with Painting-by-Numbers,"For safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving, CNNs have to be robust with respect to unavoidable image corruptions, such as image noise. While previous works addressed the task of robust prediction in the context of full-image classification, we consider it for dense semantic segmentation. We build upon an insight from image classification that output robustness can be improved by increasing the network-bias towards object shapes. We present a new training schema that increases this shape bias. Our basic idea is to alpha-blend a portion of the RGB training images with faked images, where each class-label is given a fixed, randomly chosen color that is not likely to appear in real imagery. This forces the network to rely more strongly on shape cues. We call this data augmentation technique ``Painting-by-Numbers''. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our training schema for DeepLabv3+ with various network backbones, MobileNet-V2, ResNets, and Xception, and evaluate it on the Cityscapes dataset. With respect to our 16 different types of image corruptions and 5 different network backbones, we are in 74% better than training with clean data. For cases where we are worse than a model trained without our training schema, it is mostly only marginally worse. However, for some image corruptions such as images with noise, we see a considerable performance gain of up to 25%."
Generalized Few-shot Semantic Segmentation,"Training semantic segmentation models requires a large amount of finely annotated data, making it hard to quickly adapt to novel classes not satisfying this condition. Few-Shot Segmentation (FS-Seg) tackles this problem with many constraints. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark, called Generalized Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation (GFS-Seg), to analyze the generalization ability of simultaneously segmenting the novel categories with very few examples and the base categories with sufficient examples. It is the first study showing that previous representative state-of-the-art FS-Seg methods fall short in GFS-Seg and the performance discrepancy mainly comes from the constrained setting of FS-Seg. To make GFS-Seg tractable, we set up a GFS-Seg baseline that achieves decent performance without structural change on the original model. Then, since context is essential for semantic segmentation, we propose the Context-Aware Prototype Learning (CAPL) that significantly improves performance by 1) leveraging the co-occurrence prior knowledge from support samples, and 2) dynamically enriching contextual information to the classifier, conditioned on the content of each query image. Both two contributions are experimentally shown to have substantial practical merit. Extensive experiments on Pascal-VOC and COCO manifest the effectiveness of CAPL, and CAPL generalizes well to FS-Seg by achieving competitive performance. Code is available at https://github.com/dvlab-research/GFS-Seg."
HCNet: Hierarchical Context Network for Semantic Segmentation,"Global context information is vital in visual understanding problems, especially in pixel-level semantic segmentation. The mainstream methods adopt the self-attention mechanism to model global context information. However, pixels belonging to different classes usually have weak feature correlation. Modeling the global pixel-level correlation matrix indiscriminately is extremely redundant in the self-attention mechanism. In order to solve the above problem, we propose a hierarchical context network to differentially model homogeneous pixels with strong correlations and heterogeneous pixels with weak correlations. Specifically, we first propose a multi-scale guided pre-segmentation module to divide the entire feature map into different classed-based homogeneous regions. Within each homogeneous region, we design the pixel context module to capture pixel-level correlations. Subsequently, different from the self-attention mechanism that still models weak heterogeneous correlations in a dense pixel-level manner, the region context module is proposed to model sparse region-level dependencies using a unified representation of each region. Through aggregating fine-grained pixel context features and coarse-grained region context features, our proposed network can not only hierarchically model global context information but also harvest multi-granularity representations to more robustly identify multi-scale objects. We evaluate our approach on Cityscapes and the ISPRS Vaihingen dataset. Without Bells or Whistles, our approach realizes a mean IoU of 82.8% and overall accuracy of 91.4% on Cityscapes and ISPRS Vaihingen test set, achieving state-of-the-art results."
Refining Semantic Segmentation with Superpixel by Transparent Initialization and Sparse Encoder,"Although deep learning greatly improves the performance of semantic segmentation, its success mainly lies in object central areas without accurate edges. As superpixels are a popular and effective auxiliary to preserve object edges, in this paper, we jointly learn semantic segmentation with trainable superpixels. We achieve it with fully-connected layers with Transparent Initialization (TI) and efficient logit consistency using a sparse encoder. The proposed TI preserves the effects of learned parameters of pretrained networks. This avoids a significant increase of the loss of pretrained networks, which otherwise may be caused by inappropriate parameter initialization of the additional layers. Meanwhile, consistent pixel labels in each superpixel are guaranteed by logit consistency. The sparse encoder with sparse matrix operations substantially reduces both the memory requirement and the computational complexity. We demonstrated the superiority of TI over other parameter initialization methods and tested its numerical stability. The effectiveness of our proposal was validated on PASCAL VOC 2012, ADE20K, and PASCAL Context showing enhanced semantic segmentation edges. With quantitative evaluations on segmentation edges using performance ratio and F-measure, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art."
Collaboratively boosting data-driven deep learning and knowledge-guided ontological reasoning for semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery,"As one kind of architecture from the deep learning family, deep semantic segmentation network (DSSN) achieves a certain degree of success on the semantic segmentation task and obviously outperforms the traditional methods based on hand-crafted features. As a classic data-driven technique, DSSN can be trained by an end-to-end mechanism and competent for employing the low-level and mid-level cues (i.e., the discriminative image structure) to understand images, but lacks the high-level inference ability. By contrast, human beings have an excellent inference capacity and can be able to reliably interpret the RS imagery only when human beings master the basic RS domain knowledge. In literature, ontological modeling and reasoning is an ideal way to imitate and employ the domain knowledge of human beings, but is still rarely explored and adopted in the RS domain. To remedy the aforementioned critical limitation of DSSN, this paper proposes a collaboratively boosting framework (CBF) to combine data-driven deep learning module and knowledge-guided ontological reasoning module in an iterative way."
Semantics through Time: Semi-supervised Segmentation of Aerial Videos with Iterative Label Propagation,"Semantic segmentation is a crucial task for robot navigation and safety. However, current supervised methods require a large amount of pixelwise annotations to yield accurate results. Labeling is a tedious and time consuming process that has hampered progress in low altitude UAV applications. This paper makes an important step towards automatic annotation by introducing SegProp, a novel iterative flow-based method, with a direct connection to spectral clustering in space and time, to propagate the semantic labels to frames that lack human annotations. The labels are further used in semi-supervised learning scenarios. Motivated by the lack of a large video aerial dataset, we also introduce Ruralscapes, a new dataset with high resolution (4K) images and manually-annotated dense labels every 50 frames - the largest of its kind, to the best of our knowledge. Our novel SegProp automatically annotates the remaining unlabeled 98% of frames with an accuracy exceeding 90% (F-measure), significantly outperforming other state-of-the-art label propagation methods. Moreover, when integrating other methods as modules inside SegProp's iterative label propagation loop, we achieve a significant boost over the baseline labels. Finally, we test SegProp in a full semi-supervised setting: we train several state-of-the-art deep neural networks on the SegProp-automatically-labeled training frames and test them on completely novel videos. We convincingly demonstrate, every time, a significant improvement over the supervised scenario."
MetaBox+: A new Region Based Active Learning Method for Semantic Segmentation using Priority Maps,"We present a novel region based active learning method for semantic image segmentation, called MetaBox+. For acquisition, we train a meta regression model to estimate the segment-wise Intersection over Union (IoU) of each predicted segment of unlabeled images. This can be understood as an estimation of segment-wise prediction quality. Queried regions are supposed to minimize to competing targets, i.e., low predicted IoU values / segmentation quality and low estimated annotation costs. For estimating the latter we propose a simple but practical method for annotation cost estimation. We compare our method to entropy based methods, where we consider the entropy as uncertainty of the prediction. The comparison and analysis of the results provide insights into annotation costs as well as robustness and variance of the methods. Numerical experiments conducted with two different networks on the Cityscapes dataset clearly demonstrate a reduction of annotation effort compared to random acquisition. Noteworthily, we achieve 95%of the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), using MetaBox+ compared to when training with the full dataset, with only 10.47% / 32.01% annotation effort for the two networks, respectively."
Tubular Shape Aware Data Generation for Semantic Segmentation in Medical Imaging,"Chest X-ray is one of the most widespread examinations of the human body. In interventional radiology, its use is frequently associated with the need to visualize various tube-like objects, such as puncture needles, guiding sheaths, wires, and catheters. Detection and precise localization of these tube-like objects in the X-ray images is, therefore, of utmost value, catalyzing the development of accurate target-specific segmentation algorithms. Similar to the other medical imaging tasks, the manual pixel-wise annotation of the tubes is a resource-consuming process. In this work, we aim to alleviate the lack of the annotated images by using artificial data. Specifically, we present an approach for synthetic data generation of the tube-shaped objects, with a generative adversarial network being regularized with a prior-shape constraint. Our method eliminates the need for paired image--mask data and requires only a weakly-labeled dataset (10--20 images) to reach the accuracy of the fully-supervised models. We report the applicability of the approach for the task of segmenting tubes and catheters in the X-ray images, whereas the results should also hold for the other imaging modalities."
Towards Adaptive Semantic Segmentation by Progressive Feature Refinement,"As one of the fundamental tasks in computer vision, semantic segmentation plays an important role in real world applications. Although numerous deep learning models have made notable progress on several mainstream datasets with the rapid development of convolutional networks, they still encounter various challenges in practical scenarios. Unsupervised adaptive semantic segmentation aims to obtain a robust classifier trained with source domain data, which is able to maintain stable performance when deployed to a target domain with different data distribution. In this paper, we propose an innovative progressive feature refinement framework, along with domain adversarial learning to boost the transferability of segmentation networks. Specifically, we firstly align the multi-stage intermediate feature maps of source and target domain images, and then a domain classifier is adopted to discriminate the segmentation output. As a result, the segmentation models trained with source domain images can be transferred to a target domain without significant performance degradation. Experimental results verify the efficiency of our proposed method compared with state-of-the-art methods."
Incomplete Utterance Rewriting as Semantic Segmentation,"Recent years the task of incomplete utterance rewriting has raised a large attention. Previous works usually shape it as a machine translation task and employ sequence to sequence based architecture with copy mechanism. In this paper, we present a novel and extensive approach, which formulates it as a semantic segmentation task. Instead of generating from scratch, such a formulation introduces edit operations and shapes the problem as prediction of a word-level edit matrix. Benefiting from being able to capture both local and global information, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several public datasets. Furthermore, our approach is four times faster than the standard approach in inference."
A Survey on Deep Learning Methods for Semantic Image Segmentation in Real-Time,"Semantic image segmentation is one of fastest growing areas in computer vision with a variety of applications. In many areas, such as robotics and autonomous vehicles, semantic image segmentation is crucial, since it provides the necessary context for actions to be taken based on a scene understanding at the pixel level. Moreover, the success of medical diagnosis and treatment relies on the extremely accurate understanding of the data under consideration and semantic image segmentation is one of the important tools in many cases. Recent developments in deep learning have provided a host of tools to tackle this problem efficiently and with increased accuracy. This work provides a comprehensive analysis of state-of-the-art deep learning architectures in image segmentation and, more importantly, an extensive list of techniques to achieve fast inference and computational efficiency. The origins of these techniques as well as their strengths and trade-offs are discussed with an in-depth analysis of their impact in the area. The best-performing architectures are summarized with a list of methods used to achieve these state-of-the-art results."
Affinity Space Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation Across Domains,"Semantic segmentation with dense pixel-wise annotation has achieved excellent performance thanks to deep learning. However, the generalization of semantic segmentation in the wild remains challenging. In this paper, we address the problem of unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) in semantic segmentation. Motivated by the fact that source and target domain have invariant semantic structures, we propose to exploit such invariance across domains by leveraging co-occurring patterns between pairwise pixels in the output of structured semantic segmentation. This is different from most existing approaches that attempt to adapt domains based on individual pixel-wise information in image, feature, or output level. Specifically, we perform domain adaptation on the affinity relationship between adjacent pixels termed affinity space of source and target domain. To this end, we develop two affinity space adaptation strategies: affinity space cleaning and adversarial affinity space alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance against some state-of-the-art methods on several challenging benchmarks for semantic segmentation across domains. The code is available at https://github.com/idealwei/ASANet."
Causal Intervention for Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"We present a causal inference framework to improve Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS). Specifically, we aim to generate better pixel-level pseudo-masks by using only image-level labels -- the most crucial step in WSSS. We attribute the cause of the ambiguous boundaries of pseudo-masks to the confounding context, e.g., the correct image-level classification of ""horse"" and ""person"" may be not only due to the recognition of each instance, but also their co-occurrence context, making the model inspection (e.g., CAM) hard to distinguish between the boundaries. Inspired by this, we propose a structural causal model to analyze the causalities among images, contexts, and class labels. Based on it, we develop a new method: Context Adjustment (CONTA), to remove the confounding bias in image-level classification and thus provide better pseudo-masks as ground-truth for the subsequent segmentation model. On PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS-COCO, we show that CONTA boosts various popular WSSS methods to new state-of-the-arts."
Unsupervised Model Adaptation for Continual Semantic Segmentation,"We develop an algorithm for adapting a semantic segmentation model that is trained using a labeled source domain to generalize well in an unlabeled target domain. A similar problem has been studied extensively in the unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) literature, but existing UDA algorithms require access to both the source domain labeled data and the target domain unlabeled data for training a domain agnostic semantic segmentation model. Relaxing this constraint enables a user to adapt pretrained models to generalize in a target domain, without requiring access to source data. To this end, we learn a prototypical distribution for the source domain in an intermediate embedding space. This distribution encodes the abstract knowledge that is learned from the source domain. We then use this distribution for aligning the target domain distribution with the source domain distribution in the embedding space. We provide theoretical analysis and explain conditions under which our algorithm is effective. Experiments on benchmark adaptation task demonstrate our method achieves competitive performance even compared with joint UDA approaches."
SemanticVoxels: Sequential Fusion for 3D Pedestrian Detection using LiDAR Point Cloud and Semantic Segmentation,"3D pedestrian detection is a challenging task in automated driving because pedestrians are relatively small, frequently occluded and easily confused with narrow vertical objects. LiDAR and camera are two commonly used sensor modalities for this task, which should provide complementary information. Unexpectedly, LiDAR-only detection methods tend to outperform multisensor fusion methods in public benchmarks. Recently, PointPainting has been presented to eliminate this performance drop by effectively fusing the output of a semantic segmentation network instead of the raw image information. In this paper, we propose a generalization of PointPainting to be able to apply fusion at different levels. After the semantic augmentation of the point cloud, we encode raw point data in pillars to get geometric features and semantic point data in voxels to get semantic features and fuse them in an effective way. Experimental results on the KITTI test set show that SemanticVoxels achieves state-of-the-art performance in both 3D and bird's eye view pedestrian detection benchmarks. In particular, our approach demonstrates its strength in detecting challenging pedestrian cases and outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches."
From Pixel to Patch: Synthesize Context-aware Features for Zero-shot Semantic Segmentation,"Zero-shot learning has been actively studied for image classification task to relieve the burden of annotating image labels. Interestingly, semantic segmentation task requires more labor-intensive pixel-wise annotation, but zero-shot semantic segmentation has only attracted limited research interest. Thus, we focus on zero-shot semantic segmentation, which aims to segment unseen objects with only category-level semantic representations provided for unseen categories. In this paper, we propose a novel Context-aware feature Generation Network (CaGNet), which can synthesize context-aware pixel-wise visual features for unseen categories based on category-level semantic representations and pixel-wise contextual information. The synthesized features are used to finetune the classifier to enable segmenting unseen objects. Furthermore, we extend pixel-wise feature generation and finetuning to patch-wise feature generation and finetuning, which additionally considers inter-pixel relationship. Experimental results on Pascal-VOC, Pascal-Context, and COCO-stuff show that our method significantly outperforms the existing zero-shot semantic segmentation methods. Code is available at https://github.com/bcmi/CaGNetv2-Zero-Shot-Semantic-Segmentation."
Interactive Learning for Semantic Segmentation in Earth Observation,"Dense pixel-wise classification maps output by deep neural networks are of extreme importance for scene understanding. However, these maps are often partially inaccurate due to a variety of possible factors. Therefore, we propose to interactively refine them within a framework named DISCA (Deep Image Segmentation with Continual Adaptation). It consists of continually adapting a neural network to a target image using an interactive learning process with sparse user annotations as ground-truth. We show through experiments on three datasets using synthesized annotations the benefits of the approach, reaching an IoU improvement up to 4.7% for ten sampled clicks. Finally, we exhibit that our approach can be particularly rewarding when it is faced to additional issues such as domain adaptation."
Improving Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation by Learning 3D Object Detection,"Point cloud semantic segmentation plays an essential role in autonomous driving, providing vital information about drivable surfaces and nearby objects that can aid higher level tasks such as path planning and collision avoidance. While current 3D semantic segmentation networks focus on convolutional architectures that perform great for well represented classes, they show a significant drop in performance for underrepresented classes that share similar geometric features. We propose a novel Detection Aware 3D Semantic Segmentation (DASS) framework that explicitly leverages localization features from an auxiliary 3D object detection task. By utilizing multitask training, the shared feature representation of the network is guided to be aware of per class detection features that aid tackling the differentiation of geometrically similar classes. We additionally provide a pipeline that uses DASS to generate high recall proposals for existing 2-stage detectors and demonstrate that the added supervisory signal can be used to improve 3D orientation estimation capabilities. Extensive experiments on both the SemanticKITTI and KITTI object datasets show that DASS can improve 3D semantic segmentation results of geometrically similar classes up to 37.8% IoU in image FOV while maintaining high precision bird's-eye view (BEV) detection results."
Semi-supervised Semantic Segmentation of Prostate and Organs-at-Risk on 3D Pelvic CT Images,"Automated segmentation can assist radiotherapy treatment planning by saving manual contouring efforts and reducing intra-observer and inter-observer variations. The recent development of deep learning approaches has revoluted medical data processing, including semantic segmentation, by dramatically improving performance. However, training effective deep learning models usually require a large amount of high-quality labeled data, which are often costly to collect. We developed a novel semi-supervised adversarial deep learning approach for 3D pelvic CT image semantic segmentation. Unlike supervised deep learning methods, the new approach can utilize both annotated and un-annotated data for training. It generates un-annotated synthetic data by a data augmentation scheme using generative adversarial networks (GANs). We applied the new approach to segmenting multiple organs in male pelvic CT images, where CT images without annotations and GAN-synthesized un-annotated images were used in semi-supervised learning. Experimental results, evaluated by three metrics (Dice similarity coefficient, average Hausdorff distance, and average surface Hausdorff distance), showed that the new method achieved either comparable performance with substantially fewer annotated images or better performance with the same amount of annotated data, outperforming the existing state-of-the-art methods."
Synthetic Convolutional Features for Improved Semantic Segmentation,"Recently, learning-based image synthesis has enabled to generate high-resolution images, either applying popular adversarial training or a powerful perceptual loss. However, it remains challenging to successfully leverage synthetic data for improving semantic segmentation with additional synthetic images. Therefore, we suggest to generate intermediate convolutional features and propose the first synthesis approach that is catered to such intermediate convolutional features. This allows us to generate new features from label masks and include them successfully into the training procedure in order to improve the performance of semantic segmentation. Experimental results and analysis on two challenging datasets Cityscapes and ADE20K show that our generated feature improves performance on segmentation tasks."
SML: Semantic Meta-learning for Few-shot Semantic Segmentation,"The significant amount of training data required for training Convolutional Neural Networks has become a bottleneck for applications like semantic segmentation. Few-shot semantic segmentation algorithms address this problem, with an aim to achieve good performance in the low-data regime, with few annotated training images. Recently, approaches based on class-prototypes computed from available training data have achieved immense success for this task. In this work, we propose a novel meta-learning framework, Semantic Meta-Learning (SML) which incorporates class level semantic descriptions in the generated prototypes for this problem. In addition, we propose to use the well established technique, ridge regression, to not only bring in the class-level semantic information, but also to effectively utilise the information available from multiple images present in the training data for prototype computation. This has a simple closed-form solution, and thus can be implemented easily and efficiently. Extensive experiments on the benchmark PASCAL-5i dataset under different experimental settings show the effectiveness of the proposed framework."
EfficientSeg: An Efficient Semantic Segmentation Network,"Deep neural network training without pre-trained weights and few data is shown to need more training iterations. It is also known that, deeper models are more successful than their shallow counterparts for semantic segmentation task. Thus, we introduce EfficientSeg architecture, a modified and scalable version of U-Net, which can be efficiently trained despite its depth. We evaluated EfficientSeg architecture on Minicity dataset and outperformed U-Net baseline score (40% mIoU) using the same parameter count (51.5% mIoU). Our most successful model obtained 58.1% mIoU score and got the fourth place in semantic segmentation track of ECCV 2020 VIPriors challenge."
Semantic Segmentation of Surface from Lidar Point Cloud,"In the field of SLAM (Simultaneous Localization And Mapping) for robot navigation, mapping the environment is an important task. In this regard the Lidar sensor can produce near accurate 3D map of the environment in the format of point cloud, in real time. Though the data is adequate for extracting information related to SLAM, processing millions of points in the point cloud is computationally quite expensive. The methodology presented proposes a fast algorithm that can be used to extract semantically labelled surface segments from the cloud, in real time, for direct navigational use or higher level contextual scene reconstruction. First, a single scan from a spinning Lidar is used to generate a mesh of subsampled cloud points online. The generated mesh is further used for surface normal computation of those points on the basis of which surface segments are estimated. A novel descriptor to represent the surface segments is proposed and utilized to determine the surface class of the segments (semantic label) with the help of classifier. These semantic surface segments can be further utilized for geometric reconstruction of objects in the scene, or can be used for optimized trajectory planning by a robot. The proposed methodology is compared with number of point cloud segmentation methods and state of the art semantic segmentation methods to emphasize its efficacy in terms of speed and accuracy."
Semantic Segmentation of Histopathological Slides for the Classification of Cutaneous Lymphoma and Eczema,"Mycosis fungoides (MF) is a rare, potentially life threatening skin disease, which in early stages clinically and histologically strongly resembles Eczema, a very common and benign skin condition. In order to increase the survival rate, one needs to provide the appropriate treatment early on. To this end, one crucial step for specialists is the evaluation of histopathological slides (glass slides), or Whole Slide Images (WSI), of the patients' skin tissue. We introduce a deep learning aided diagnostics tool that brings a two-fold value to the decision process of pathologists. First, our algorithm accurately segments WSI into regions that are relevant for an accurate diagnosis, achieving a Mean-IoU of 69% and a Matthews Correlation score of 83% on a novel dataset. Additionally, we also show that our model is competitive with the state of the art on a reference dataset. Second, using the segmentation map and the original image, we are able to predict if a patient has MF or Eczema. We created two models that can be applied in different stages of the diagnostic pipeline, potentially eliminating life-threatening mistakes. The classification outcome is considerably more interpretable than using only the WSI as the input, since it is also based on the segmentation map. Our segmentation model, which we call EU-Net, extends a classical U-Net with an EfficientNet-B7 encoder which was pre-trained on the Imagenet dataset."
ARM: A Confidence-Based Adversarial Reweighting Module for Coarse Semantic Segmentation,"Coarsely-labeled semantic segmentation annotations are easy to obtain, but therefore bear the risk of losing edge details and introducing background pixels. Impeded by the inherent noise, existing coarse annotations are only taken as a bonus for model pre-training. In this paper, we try to exploit their potentials with a confidence-based reweighting strategy. To expand, loss-based reweighting strategies usually take the high loss value to identify two completely different types of pixels, namely, valuable pixels in noise-free annotations and mislabeled pixels in noisy annotations. This makes it impossible to perform two tasks of mining valuable pixels and suppressing mislabeled pixels at the same time. However, with the help of the prediction confidence, we successfully solve this dilemma and simultaneously perform two subtasks with a single reweighting strategy. Furthermore, we generalize this strategy into an Adversarial Reweighting Module (ARM) and prove its convergence strictly. Experiments on standard datasets shows our ARM can bring consistent improvements for both coarse annotations and fine annotations. Specifically, built on top of DeepLabv3+, ARM improves the mIoU on the coarsely-labeled Cityscapes by a considerable margin and increases the mIoU on the ADE20K dataset to 47.50."
"Towards Semantic Segmentation of Urban-Scale 3D Point Clouds: A Dataset, Benchmarks and Challenges","An essential prerequisite for unleashing the potential of supervised deep learning algorithms in the area of 3D scene understanding is the availability of large-scale and richly annotated datasets. However, publicly available datasets are either in relative small spatial scales or have limited semantic annotations due to the expensive cost of data acquisition and data annotation, which severely limits the development of fine-grained semantic understanding in the context of 3D point clouds. In this paper, we present an urban-scale photogrammetric point cloud dataset with nearly three billion richly annotated points, which is three times the number of labeled points than the existing largest photogrammetric point cloud dataset. Our dataset consists of large areas from three UK cities, covering about 7.6 km^2 of the city landscape. In the dataset, each 3D point is labeled as one of 13 semantic classes. We extensively evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art algorithms on our dataset and provide a comprehensive analysis of the results. In particular, we identify several key challenges towards urban-scale point cloud understanding. The dataset is available at https://github.com/QingyongHu/SensatUrban."
Multi-Attention-Network for Semantic Segmentation of Fine Resolution Remote Sensing Images,"Semantic segmentation of remote sensing images plays an important role in a wide range of applications including land resource management, biosphere monitoring and urban planning. Although the accuracy of semantic segmentation in remote sensing images has been increased significantly by deep convolutional neural networks, several limitations exist in standard models. First, for encoder-decoder architectures such as U-Net, the utilization of multi-scale features causes the underuse of information, where low-level features and high-level features are concatenated directly without any refinement. Second, long-range dependencies of feature maps are insufficiently explored, resulting in sub-optimal feature representations associated with each semantic class. Third, even though the dot-product attention mechanism has been introduced and utilized in semantic segmentation to model long-range dependencies, the large time and space demands of attention impede the actual usage of attention in application scenarios with large-scale input. This paper proposed a Multi-Attention-Network (MANet) to address these issues by extracting contextual dependencies through multiple efficient attention modules. A novel attention mechanism of kernel attention with linear complexity is proposed to alleviate the large computational demand in attention. Based on kernel attention and channel attention, we integrate local feature maps extracted by ResNeXt-101 with their corresponding global dependencies and reweight interdependent channel maps adaptively. Numerical experiments on three large-scale fine resolution remote sensing images captured by different satellite sensors demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed MANet, outperforming the DeepLab V3+, PSPNet, FastFCN, DANet, OCRNet, and other benchmark approaches."
Multi-domain semantic segmentation with pyramidal fusion,"We present our submission to the semantic segmentation contest of the Robust Vision Challenge held at ECCV 2020. The contest requires submitting the same model to seven benchmarks from three different domains. Our approach is based on the SwiftNet architecture with pyramidal fusion. We address inconsistent taxonomies with a single-level 193-dimensional softmax output. We strive to train with large batches in order to stabilize optimization of a hard recognition problem, and to favour smooth evolution of batchnorm statistics. We achieve this by implementing a custom backward step through log-sum-prob loss, and by using small crops before freezing the population statistics. Our model ranks first on the RVC semantic segmentation challenge as well as on the WildDash 2 leaderboard. This suggests that pyramidal fusion is competitive not only for efficient inference with lightweight backbones, but also in large-scale setups for multi-domain application."
SCG-Net: Self-Constructing Graph Neural Networks for Semantic Segmentation,"Capturing global contextual representations by exploiting long-range pixel-pixel dependencies has shown to improve semantic segmentation performance. However, how to do this efficiently is an open question as current approaches of utilising attention schemes or very deep models to increase the models field of view, result in complex models with large memory consumption. Inspired by recent work on graph neural networks, we propose the Self-Constructing Graph (SCG) module that learns a long-range dependency graph directly from the image and uses it to propagate contextual information efficiently to improve semantic segmentation. The module is optimised via a novel adaptive diagonal enhancement method and a variational lower bound that consists of a customized graph reconstruction term and a Kullback-Leibler divergence regularization term. When incorporated into a neural network (SCG-Net), semantic segmentation is performed in an end-to-end manner and competitive performance (mean F1-scores of 92.0% and 89.8% respectively) on the publicly available ISPRS Potsdam and Vaihingen datasets is achieved, with much fewer parameters, and at a lower computational cost compared to related pure convolutional neural network (CNN) based models."
Comprehensive Semantic Segmentation on High Resolution UAV Imagery for Natural Disaster Damage Assessment,"In this paper, we present a large-scale hurricane Michael dataset for visual perception in disaster scenarios, and analyze state-of-the-art deep neural network models for semantic segmentation. The dataset consists of around 2000 high-resolution aerial images, with annotated ground-truth data for semantic segmentation. We discuss the challenges of the dataset and train the state-of-the-art methods on this dataset to evaluate how well these methods can recognize the disaster situations. Finally, we discuss challenges for future research."
Semantically Adaptive Image-to-image Translation for Domain Adaptation of Semantic Segmentation,"Domain shift is a very challenging problem for semantic segmentation. Any model can be easily trained on synthetic data, where images and labels are artificially generated, but it will perform poorly when deployed on real environments. In this paper, we address the problem of domain adaptation for semantic segmentation of street scenes. Many state-of-the-art approaches focus on translating the source image while imposing that the result should be semantically consistent with the input. However, we advocate that the image semantics can also be exploited to guide the translation algorithm. To this end, we rethink the generative model to enforce this assumption and strengthen the connection between pixel-level and feature-level domain alignment. We conduct extensive experiments by training common semantic segmentation models with our method and show that the results we obtain on the synthetic-to-real benchmarks surpass the state-of-the-art."
On the Structures of Representation for the Robustness of Semantic Segmentation to Input Corruption,"Semantic segmentation is a scene understanding task at the heart of safety-critical applications where robustness to corrupted inputs is essential. Implicit Background Estimation (IBE) has demonstrated to be a promising technique to improve the robustness to out-of-distribution inputs for semantic segmentation models for little to no cost. In this paper, we provide analysis comparing the structures learned as a result of optimization objectives that use Softmax, IBE, and Sigmoid in order to improve understanding their relationship to robustness. As a result of this analysis, we propose combining Sigmoid with IBE (SCrIBE) to improve robustness. Finally, we demonstrate that SCrIBE exhibits superior segmentation performance aggregated across all corruptions and severity levels with a mIOU of 42.1 compared to both IBE 40.3 and the Softmax Baseline 37.5."
Semantic Segmentation of Neuronal Bodies in Fluorescence Microscopy Using a 2D+3D CNN Training Strategy with Sparsely Annotated Data,"Semantic segmentation of neuronal structures in 3D high-resolution fluorescence microscopy imaging of the human brain cortex can take advantage of bidimensional CNNs, which yield good results in neuron localization but lead to inaccurate surface reconstruction. 3D CNNs, on the other hand, would require manually annotated volumetric data on a large scale and hence considerable human effort. Semi-supervised alternative strategies which make use only of sparse annotations suffer from longer training times and achieved models tend to have increased capacity compared to 2D CNNs, needing more ground truth data to attain similar results. To overcome these issues we propose a two-phase strategy for training native 3D CNN models on sparse 2D annotations where missing labels are inferred by a 2D CNN model and combined with manual annotations in a weighted manner during loss calculation."
W-Net: Dense Semantic Segmentation of Subcutaneous Tissue in Ultrasound Images by Expanding U-Net to Incorporate Ultrasound RF Waveform Data,"We present W-Net, a novel Convolution Neural Network (CNN) framework that employs raw ultrasound waveforms from each A-scan, typically referred to as ultrasound Radio Frequency (RF) data, in addition to the gray ultrasound image to semantically segment and label tissues. Unlike prior work, we seek to label every pixel in the image, without the use of a background class. To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first deep-learning or CNN approach for segmentation that analyses ultrasound raw RF data along with the gray image. International patent(s) pending [PCT/US20/37519]. We chose subcutaneous tissue (SubQ) segmentation as our initial clinical goal since it has diverse intermixed tissues, is challenging to segment, and is an underrepresented research area. SubQ potential applications include plastic surgery, adipose stem-cell harvesting, lymphatic monitoring, and possibly detection/treatment of certain types of tumors. A custom dataset consisting of hand-labeled images by an expert clinician and trainees are used for the experimentation, currently labeled into the following categories: skin, fat, fat fascia/stroma, muscle and muscle fascia. We compared our results with U-Net and Attention U-Net. Our novel \emph{W-Net}'s RF-Waveform input and architecture increased mIoU accuracy (averaged across all tissue classes) by 4.5\% and 4.9\% compared to regular U-Net and Attention U-Net, respectively. We present analysis as to why the Muscle fascia and Fat fascia/stroma are the most difficult tissues to label. Muscle fascia in particular, the most difficult anatomic class to recognize for both humans and AI algorithms, saw mIoU improvements of 13\% and 16\% from our W-Net vs U-Net and Attention U-Net respectively."
Unsupervised Surgical Instrument Segmentation via Anchor Generation and Semantic Diffusion,"Surgical instrument segmentation is a key component in developing context-aware operating rooms. Existing works on this task heavily rely on the supervision of a large amount of labeled data, which involve laborious and expensive human efforts. In contrast, a more affordable unsupervised approach is developed in this paper. To train our model, we first generate anchors as pseudo labels for instruments and background tissues respectively by fusing coarse handcrafted cues. Then a semantic diffusion loss is proposed to resolve the ambiguity in the generated anchors via the feature correlation between adjacent video frames. In the experiments on the binary instrument segmentation task of the 2017 MICCAI EndoVis Robotic Instrument Segmentation Challenge dataset, the proposed method achieves 0.71 IoU and 0.81 Dice score without using a single manual annotation, which is promising to show the potential of unsupervised learning for surgical tool segmentation."
3D Semantic Segmentation of Brain Tumor for Overall Survival Prediction,"Glioma, the malignant brain tumor, requires immediate treatment to improve the survival of patients. Gliomas heterogeneous nature makes the segmentation difficult, especially for sub-regions like necrosis, enhancing tumor, non-enhancing tumor, and Edema. Deep neural networks like full convolution neural networks and ensemble of fully convolution neural networks are successful for Glioma segmentation. The paper demonstrates the use of a 3D fully convolution neural network with a three layer encoder decoder approach for layer arrangement. The encoder blocks include the dense modules, and decoder blocks include convolution modules. The input to the network is 3D patches. The loss function combines dice loss and focal loss functions. The validation set dice score of the network is 0.74, 0.88, and 0.73 for enhancing tumor, whole tumor, and tumor core, respectively. The Random Forest Regressor uses shape, volumetric, and age features extracted from ground truth for overall survival prediction. The regressor achieves an accuracy of 44.8% on the validation set."
SNE-RoadSeg: Incorporating Surface Normal Information into Semantic Segmentation for Accurate Freespace Detection,"Freespace detection is an essential component of visual perception for self-driving cars. The recent efforts made in data-fusion convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have significantly improved semantic driving scene segmentation. Freespace can be hypothesized as a ground plane, on which the points have similar surface normals. Hence, in this paper, we first introduce a novel module, named surface normal estimator (SNE), which can infer surface normal information from dense depth/disparity images with high accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, we propose a data-fusion CNN architecture, referred to as RoadSeg, which can extract and fuse features from both RGB images and the inferred surface normal information for accurate freespace detection. For research purposes, we publish a large-scale synthetic freespace detection dataset, named Ready-to-Drive (R2D) road dataset, collected under different illumination and weather conditions. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed SNE module can benefit all the state-of-the-art CNNs for freespace detection, and our SNE-RoadSeg achieves the best overall performance among different datasets."
Polarimetric SAR Image Semantic Segmentation with 3D Discrete Wavelet Transform and Markov Random Field,"Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) image segmentation is currently of great importance in image processing for remote sensing applications. However, it is a challenging task due to two main reasons. Firstly, the label information is difficult to acquire due to high annotation costs. Secondly, the speckle effect embedded in the PolSAR imaging process remarkably degrades the segmentation performance. To address these two issues, we present a contextual PolSAR image semantic segmentation method in this paper.With a newly defined channelwise consistent feature set as input, the three-dimensional discrete wavelet transform (3D-DWT) technique is employed to extract discriminative multi-scale features that are robust to speckle noise. Then Markov random field (MRF) is further applied to enforce label smoothness spatially during segmentation. By simultaneously utilizing 3D-DWT features and MRF priors for the first time, contextual information is fully integrated during the segmentation to ensure accurate and smooth segmentation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on three real benchmark PolSAR image data sets. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method achieves promising segmentation accuracy and preferable spatial consistency using a minimal number of labeled pixels."
TORNADO-Net: mulTiview tOtal vaRiatioN semAntic segmentation with Diamond inceptiOn module,"Semantic segmentation of point clouds is a key component of scene understanding for robotics and autonomous driving. In this paper, we introduce TORNADO-Net - a neural network for 3D LiDAR point cloud semantic segmentation. We incorporate a multi-view (bird-eye and range) projection feature extraction with an encoder-decoder ResNet architecture with a novel diamond context block. Current projection-based methods do not take into account that neighboring points usually belong to the same class. To better utilize this local neighbourhood information and reduce noisy predictions, we introduce a combination of Total Variation, Lovasz-Softmax, and Weighted Cross-Entropy losses. We also take advantage of the fact that the LiDAR data encompasses 360 degrees field of view and uses circular padding. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results on the SemanticKITTI dataset and also provide thorough quantitative evaluations and ablation results."
EfficientFCN: Holistically-guided Decoding for Semantic Segmentation,"Both performance and efficiency are important to semantic segmentation. State-of-the-art semantic segmentation algorithms are mostly based on dilated Fully Convolutional Networks (dilatedFCN), which adopt dilated convolutions in the backbone networks to extract high-resolution feature maps for achieving high-performance segmentation performance. However, due to many convolution operations are conducted on the high-resolution feature maps, such dilatedFCN-based methods result in large computational complexity and memory consumption. To balance the performance and efficiency, there also exist encoder-decoder structures that gradually recover the spatial information by combining multi-level feature maps from the encoder. However, the performances of existing encoder-decoder methods are far from comparable with the dilatedFCN-based methods. In this paper, we propose the EfficientFCN, whose backbone is a common ImageNet pre-trained network without any dilated convolution. A holistically-guided decoder is introduced to obtain the high-resolution semantic-rich feature maps via the multi-scale features from the encoder. The decoding task is converted to novel codebook generation and codeword assembly task, which takes advantages of the high-level and low-level features from the encoder. Such a framework achieves comparable or even better performance than state-of-the-art methods with only 1/3 of the computational cost. Extensive experiments on PASCAL Context, PASCAL VOC, ADE20K validate the effectiveness of the proposed EfficientFCN."
m2caiSeg: Semantic Segmentation of Laparoscopic Images using Convolutional Neural Networks,"Autonomous surgical procedures, in particular minimal invasive surgeries, are the next frontier for Artificial Intelligence research. However, the existing challenges include precise identification of the human anatomy and the surgical settings, and modeling the environment for training of an autonomous agent. To address the identification of human anatomy and the surgical settings, we propose a deep learning based semantic segmentation algorithm to identify and label the tissues and organs in the endoscopic video feed of the human torso region. We present an annotated dataset, m2caiSeg, created from endoscopic video feeds of real-world surgical procedures. Overall, the data consists of 307 images, each of which is annotated for the organs and different surgical instruments present in the scene. We propose and train a deep convolutional neural network for the semantic segmentation task. To cater for the low quantity of annotated data, we use unsupervised pre-training and data augmentation. The trained model is evaluated on an independent test set of the proposed dataset. We obtained a F1 score of 0.33 while using all the labeled categories for the semantic segmentation task. Secondly, we labeled all instruments into an 'Instruments' superclass to evaluate the model's performance on discerning the various organs and obtained a F1 score of 0.57. We propose a new dataset and a deep learning method for pixel level identification of various organs and instruments in a endoscopic surgical scene. Surgical scene understanding is one of the first steps towards automating surgical procedures."
Symbolic Semantic Segmentation and Interpretation of COVID-19 Lung Infections in Chest CT volumes based on Emergent Languages,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has resulted in a pandemic crippling the a breadth of services critical to daily life. Segmentation of lung infections in computerized tomography (CT) slices could be be used to improve diagnosis and understanding of COVID-19 in patients. Deep learning systems lack interpretability because of their black box nature. Inspired by human communication of complex ideas through language, we propose a symbolic framework based on emergent languages for the segmentation of COVID-19 infections in CT scans of lungs. We model the cooperation between two artificial agents - a Sender and a Receiver. These agents synergistically cooperate using emergent symbolic language to solve the task of semantic segmentation. Our game theoretic approach is to model the cooperation between agents unlike Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The Sender retrieves information from one of the higher layers of the deep network and generates a symbolic sentence sampled from a categorical distribution of vocabularies. The Receiver ingests the stream of symbols and cogenerates the segmentation mask. A private emergent language is developed that forms the communication channel used to describe the task of segmentation of COVID infections. We augment existing state of the art semantic segmentation architectures with our symbolic generator to form symbolic segmentation models. Our symbolic segmentation framework achieves state of the art performance for segmentation of lung infections caused by COVID-19. Our results show direct interpretation of symbolic sentences to discriminate between normal and infected regions, infection morphology and image characteristics. We show state of the art results for segmentation of COVID-19 lung infections in CT."
Semantic Segmentation and Data Fusion of Microsoft Bing 3D Cities and Small UAV-based Photogrammetric Data,"With state-of-the-art sensing and photogrammetric techniques, Microsoft Bing Maps team has created over 125 highly detailed 3D cities from 11 different countries that cover hundreds of thousands of square kilometer areas. The 3D city models were created using the photogrammetric technique with high-resolution images that were captured from aircraft-mounted cameras. Such a large 3D city database has caught the attention of the US Army for creating virtual simulation environments to support military operations. However, the 3D city models do not have semantic information such as buildings, vegetation, and ground and cannot allow sophisticated user-level and system-level interaction. At I/ITSEC 2019, the authors presented a fully automated data segmentation and object information extraction framework for creating simulation terrain using UAV-based photogrammetric data. This paper discusses the next steps in extending our designed data segmentation framework for segmenting 3D city data. In this study, the authors first investigated the strengths and limitations of the existing framework when applied to the Bing data. The main differences between UAV-based and aircraft-based photogrammetric data are highlighted. The data quality issues in the aircraft-based photogrammetric data, which can negatively affect the segmentation performance, are identified. Based on the findings, a workflow was designed specifically for segmenting Bing data while considering its characteristics. In addition, since the ultimate goal is to combine the use of both small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) collected data and the Bing data in a virtual simulation environment, data from these two sources needed to be aligned and registered together. To this end, the authors also proposed a data registration workflow that utilized the traditional iterative closest point (ICP) with the extracted semantic information."
ISSAFE: Improving Semantic Segmentation in Accidents by Fusing Event-based Data,"Ensuring the safety of all traffic participants is a prerequisite for bringing intelligent vehicles closer to practical applications. The assistance system should not only achieve high accuracy under normal conditions, but obtain robust perception against extreme situations. However, traffic accidents that involve object collisions, deformations, overturns, etc., yet unseen in most training sets, will largely harm the performance of existing semantic segmentation models. To tackle this issue, we present a rarely addressed task regarding semantic segmentation in accidental scenarios, along with an accident dataset DADA-seg. It contains 313 various accident sequences with 40 frames each, of which the time windows are located before and during a traffic accident. Every 11th frame is manually annotated for benchmarking the segmentation performance. Furthermore, we propose a novel event-based multi-modal segmentation architecture ISSAFE. Our experiments indicate that event-based data can provide complementary information to stabilize semantic segmentation under adverse conditions by preserving fine-grain motion of fast-moving foreground (crash objects) in accidents. Our approach achieves +8.2% mIoU performance gain on the proposed evaluation set, exceeding more than 10 state-of-the-art segmentation methods. The proposed ISSAFE architecture is demonstrated to be consistently effective for models learned on multiple source databases including Cityscapes, KITTI-360, BDD and ApolloScape."
Training CNN Classifiers for Semantic Segmentation using Partially Annotated Images: with Application on Human Thigh and Calf MRI,"Objective: Medical image datasets with pixel-level labels tend to have a limited number of organ or tissue label classes annotated, even when the images have wide anatomical coverage. With supervised learning, multiple classifiers are usually needed given these partially annotated datasets. In this work, we propose a set of strategies to train one single classifier in segmenting all label classes that are heterogeneously annotated across multiple datasets without moving into semi-supervised learning. Methods: Masks were first created from each label image through a process we termed presence masking. Three presence masking modes were evaluated, differing mainly in weightage assigned to the annotated and unannotated classes. These masks were then applied to the loss function during training to remove the influence of unannotated classes. Results: Evaluation against publicly available CT datasets shows that presence masking is a viable method for training class-generic classifiers. Our class-generic classifier can perform as well as multiple class-specific classifiers combined, while the training duration is similar to that required for one class-specific classifier. Furthermore, the class-generic classifier can outperform the class-specific classifiers when trained on smaller datasets. Finally, consistent results are observed from evaluations against human thigh and calf MRI datasets collected in-house. Conclusion: The evaluation outcomes show that presence masking is capable of significantly improving both training and inference efficiency across imaging modalities and anatomical regions. Improved performance may even be observed on small datasets. Significance: Presence masking strategies can reduce the computational resources and costs involved in manual medical image annotations. All codes are publicly available at https://github.com/wong-ck/DeepSegment."
Context-aware Feature Generation for Zero-shot Semantic Segmentation,"Existing semantic segmentation models heavily rely on dense pixel-wise annotations. To reduce the annotation pressure, we focus on a challenging task named zero-shot semantic segmentation, which aims to segment unseen objects with zero annotations. This task can be accomplished by transferring knowledge across categories via semantic word embeddings. In this paper, we propose a novel context-aware feature generation method for zero-shot segmentation named CaGNet. In particular, with the observation that a pixel-wise feature highly depends on its contextual information, we insert a contextual module in a segmentation network to capture the pixel-wise contextual information, which guides the process of generating more diverse and context-aware features from semantic word embeddings. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on three benchmark datasets for zero-shot segmentation. Codes are available at: https://github.com/bcmi/CaGNet-Zero-Shot-Semantic-Segmentation."
Feature Binding with Category-Dependant MixUp for Semantic Segmentation and Adversarial Robustness,"In this paper, we present a strategy for training convolutional neural networks to effectively resolve interference arising from competing hypotheses relating to inter-categorical information throughout the network. The premise is based on the notion of feature binding, which is defined as the process by which activation's spread across space and layers in the network are successfully integrated to arrive at a correct inference decision. In our work, this is accomplished for the task of dense image labelling by blending images based on their class labels, and then training a feature binding network, which simultaneously segments and separates the blended images. Subsequent feature denoising to suppress noisy activations reveals additional desirable properties and high degrees of successful predictions. Through this process, we reveal a general mechanism, distinct from any prior methods, for boosting the performance of the base segmentation network while simultaneously increasing robustness to adversarial attacks."
Pixel-level Corrosion Detection on Metal Constructions by Fusion of Deep Learning Semantic and Contour Segmentation,"Corrosion detection on metal constructions is a major challenge in civil engineering for quick, safe and effective inspection. Existing image analysis approaches tend to place bounding boxes around the defected region which is not adequate both for structural analysis and pre-fabrication, an innovative construction concept which reduces maintenance cost, time and improves safety. In this paper, we apply three semantic segmentation-oriented deep learning models (FCN, U-Net and Mask R-CNN) for corrosion detection, which perform better in terms of accuracy and time and require a smaller number of annotated samples compared to other deep models, e.g. CNN. However, the final images derived are still not sufficiently accurate for structural analysis and pre-fabrication. Thus, we adopt a novel data projection scheme that fuses the results of color segmentation, yielding accurate but over-segmented contours of a region, with a processed area of the deep masks, resulting in high-confidence corroded pixels."
Reinforced Wasserstein Training for Severity-Aware Semantic Segmentation in Autonomous Driving,"Semantic segmentation is important for many real-world systems, e.g., autonomous vehicles, which predict the class of each pixel. Recently, deep networks achieved significant progress w.r.t. the mean Intersection-over Union (mIoU) with the cross-entropy loss. However, the cross-entropy loss can essentially ignore the difference of severity for an autonomous car with different wrong prediction mistakes. For example, predicting the car to the road is much more servery than recognize it as the bus. Targeting for this difficulty, we develop a Wasserstein training framework to explore the inter-class correlation by defining its ground metric as misclassification severity. The ground metric of Wasserstein distance can be pre-defined following the experience on a specific task. From the optimization perspective, we further propose to set the ground metric as an increasing function of the pre-defined ground metric. Furthermore, an adaptively learning scheme of the ground matrix is proposed to utilize the high-fidelity CARLA simulator. Specifically, we follow a reinforcement alternative learning scheme. The experiments on both CamVid and Cityscapes datasets evidenced the effectiveness of our Wasserstein loss. The SegNet, ENet, FCN and Deeplab networks can be adapted following a plug-in manner. We achieve significant improvements on the predefined important classes, and much longer continuous playtime in our simulator."
SynDistNet: Self-Supervised Monocular Fisheye Camera Distance Estimation Synergized with Semantic Segmentation for Autonomous Driving,"State-of-the-art self-supervised learning approaches for monocular depth estimation usually suffer from scale ambiguity. They do not generalize well when applied on distance estimation for complex projection models such as in fisheye and omnidirectional cameras. This paper introduces a novel multi-task learning strategy to improve self-supervised monocular distance estimation on fisheye and pinhole camera images. Our contribution to this work is threefold: Firstly, we introduce a novel distance estimation network architecture using a self-attention based encoder coupled with robust semantic feature guidance to the decoder that can be trained in a one-stage fashion. Secondly, we integrate a generalized robust loss function, which improves performance significantly while removing the need for hyperparameter tuning with the reprojection loss. Finally, we reduce the artifacts caused by dynamic objects violating static world assumptions using a semantic masking strategy. We significantly improve upon the RMSE of previous work on fisheye by 25% reduction in RMSE. As there is little work on fisheye cameras, we evaluated the proposed method on KITTI using a pinhole model. We achieved state-of-the-art performance among self-supervised methods without requiring an external scale estimation."
Prototype Mixture Models for Few-shot Semantic Segmentation,"Few-shot segmentation is challenging because objects within the support and query images could significantly differ in appearance and pose. Using a single prototype acquired directly from the support image to segment the query image causes semantic ambiguity. In this paper, we propose prototype mixture models (PMMs), which correlate diverse image regions with multiple prototypes to enforce the prototype-based semantic representation. Estimated by an Expectation-Maximization algorithm, PMMs incorporate rich channel-wised and spatial semantics from limited support images. Utilized as representations as well as classifiers, PMMs fully leverage the semantics to activate objects in the query image while depressing background regions in a duplex manner. Extensive experiments on Pascal VOC and MS-COCO datasets show that PMMs significantly improve upon state-of-the-arts. Particularly, PMMs improve 5-shot segmentation performance on MS-COCO by up to 5.82\% with only a moderate cost for model size and inference speed."
Importance of Self-Consistency in Active Learning for Semantic Segmentation,"We address the task of active learning in the context of semantic segmentation and show that self-consistency can be a powerful source of self-supervision to greatly improve the performance of a data-driven model with access to only a small amount of labeled data. Self-consistency uses the simple observation that the results of semantic segmentation for a specific image should not change under transformations like horizontal flipping (i.e., the results should only be flipped). In other words, the output of a model should be consistent under equivariant transformations. The self-supervisory signal of self-consistency is particularly helpful during active learning since the model is prone to overfitting when there is only a small amount of labeled training data. In our proposed active learning framework, we iteratively extract small image patches that need to be labeled, by selecting image patches that have high uncertainty (high entropy) under equivariant transformations. We enforce pixel-wise self-consistency between the outputs of segmentation network for each image and its transformation (horizontally flipped) to utilize the rich self-supervisory information and reduce the uncertainty of the network. In this way, we are able to find the image patches over which the current model struggles the most to classify. By iteratively training over these difficult image patches, our experiments show that our active learning approach reaches \sim96\% of the top performance of a model trained on all data, by using only 12\% of the total data on benchmark semantic segmentation datasets (e.g., CamVid and Cityscapes)."
Cylinder3D: An Effective 3D Framework for Driving-scene LiDAR Semantic Segmentation,"State-of-the-art methods for large-scale driving-scene LiDAR semantic segmentation often project and process the point clouds in the 2D space. The projection methods includes spherical projection, bird-eye view projection, etc. Although this process makes the point cloud suitable for the 2D CNN-based networks, it inevitably alters and abandons the 3D topology and geometric relations. A straightforward solution to tackle the issue of 3D-to-2D projection is to keep the 3D representation and process the points in the 3D space. In this work, we first perform an in-depth analysis for different representations and backbones in 2D and 3D spaces, and reveal the effectiveness of 3D representations and networks on LiDAR segmentation. Then, we develop a 3D cylinder partition and a 3D cylinder convolution based framework, termed as Cylinder3D, which exploits the 3D topology relations and structures of driving-scene point clouds. Moreover, a dimension-decomposition based context modeling module is introduced to explore the high-rank context information in point clouds in a progressive manner. We evaluate the proposed model on a large-scale driving-scene dataset, i.e. SematicKITTI. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and outperforms existing methods by 6% in terms of mIoU."
Mixup-CAM: Weakly-supervised Semantic Segmentation via Uncertainty Regularization,"Obtaining object response maps is one important step to achieve weakly-supervised semantic segmentation using image-level labels. However, existing methods rely on the classification task, which could result in a response map only attending on discriminative object regions as the network does not need to see the entire object for optimizing the classification loss. To tackle this issue, we propose a principled and end-to-end train-able framework to allow the network to pay attention to other parts of the object, while producing a more complete and uniform response map. Specifically, we introduce the mixup data augmentation scheme into the classification network and design two uncertainty regularization terms to better interact with the mixup strategy. In experiments, we conduct extensive analysis to demonstrate the proposed method and show favorable performance against state-of-the-art approaches."
Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation via Sub-category Exploration,"Existing weakly-supervised semantic segmentation methods using image-level annotations typically rely on initial responses to locate object regions. However, such response maps generated by the classification network usually focus on discriminative object parts, due to the fact that the network does not need the entire object for optimizing the objective function. To enforce the network to pay attention to other parts of an object, we propose a simple yet effective approach that introduces a self-supervised task by exploiting the sub-category information. Specifically, we perform clustering on image features to generate pseudo sub-categories labels within each annotated parent class, and construct a sub-category objective to assign the network to a more challenging task. By iteratively clustering image features, the training process does not limit itself to the most discriminative object parts, hence improving the quality of the response maps. We conduct extensive analysis to validate the proposed method and show that our approach performs favorably against the state-of-the-art approaches."
Frame-To-Frame Consistent Semantic Segmentation,"In this work, we aim for temporally consistent semantic segmentation throughout frames in a video. Many semantic segmentation algorithms process images individually which leads to an inconsistent scene interpretation due to illumination changes, occlusions and other variations over time. To achieve a temporally consistent prediction, we train a convolutional neural network (CNN) which propagates features through consecutive frames in a video using a convolutional long short term memory (ConvLSTM) cell. Besides the temporal feature propagation, we penalize inconsistencies in our loss function. We show in our experiments that the performance improves when utilizing video information compared to single frame prediction. The mean intersection over union (mIoU) metric on the Cityscapes validation set increases from 45.2 % for the single frames to 57.9 % for video data after implementing the ConvLSTM to propagate features trough time on the ESPNet. Most importantly, inconsistency decreases from 4.5 % to 1.3 % which is a reduction by 71.1 %. Our results indicate that the added temporal information produces a frame-to-frame consistent and more accurate image understanding compared to single frame processing. Code and videos are available at https://github.com/mrebol/f2f-consistent-semantic-segmentation"
Tensor Low-Rank Reconstruction for Semantic Segmentation,"Context information plays an indispensable role in the success of semantic segmentation. Recently, non-local self-attention based methods are proved to be effective for context information collection. Since the desired context consists of spatial-wise and channel-wise attentions, 3D representation is an appropriate formulation. However, these non-local methods describe 3D context information based on a 2D similarity matrix, where space compression may lead to channel-wise attention missing. An alternative is to model the contextual information directly without compression. However, this effort confronts a fundamental difficulty, namely the high-rank property of context information. In this paper, we propose a new approach to model the 3D context representations, which not only avoids the space compression but also tackles the high-rank difficulty. Here, inspired by tensor canonical-polyadic decomposition theory (i.e, a high-rank tensor can be expressed as a combination of rank-1 tensors.), we design a low-rank-to-high-rank context reconstruction framework (i.e, RecoNet). Specifically, we first introduce the tensor generation module (TGM), which generates a number of rank-1 tensors to capture fragments of context feature. Then we use these rank-1 tensors to recover the high-rank context features through our proposed tensor reconstruction module (TRM). Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art on various public datasets. Additionally, our proposed method has more than 100 times less computational cost compared with conventional non-local-based methods."
Joint Object Contour Points and Semantics for Instance Segmentation,"The attributes of object contours has great significance for instance segmentation task. However, most of the current popular deep neural networks do not pay much attention to the object edge information. Inspired by the human annotation process when making instance segmentation datasets, in this paper, we propose Mask Point R-CNN aiming at promoting the neural network's attention to the object boundary. Specifically, we innovatively extend the original human keypoint detection task to the contour point detection of any object. Based on this analogy, we present an contour point detection auxiliary task to Mask R-CNN, which can boost the gradient flow between different tasks by effectively using feature fusion strategies and multi-task joint training. As a consequence, the model will be more sensitive to the edges of the object and can capture more geometric features. Quantitatively, the experimental results show that our approach outperforms vanilla Mask R-CNN by 3.8\% on Cityscapes dataset and 0.8\% on COCO dataset."
Cascaded Non-local Neural Network for Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation,"In this paper, we propose a cascaded non-local neural network for point cloud segmentation. The proposed network aims to build the long-range dependencies of point clouds for the accurate segmentation. Specifically, we develop a novel cascaded non-local module, which consists of the neighborhood-level, superpoint-level and global-level non-local blocks. First, in the neighborhood-level block, we extract the local features of the centroid points of point clouds by assigning different weights to the neighboring points. The extracted local features of the centroid points are then used to encode the superpoint-level block with the non-local operation. Finally, the global-level block aggregates the non-local features of the superpoints for semantic segmentation in an encoder-decoder framework. Benefiting from the cascaded structure, geometric structure information of different neighborhoods with the same label can be propagated. In addition, the cascaded structure can largely reduce the computational cost of the original non-local operation on point clouds. Experiments on different indoor and outdoor datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and effectively reduces the time consumption and memory occupation."
Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation Using Weak Labels,"Learning semantic segmentation models requires a huge amount of pixel-wise labeling. However, labeled data may only be available abundantly in a domain different from the desired target domain, which only has minimal or no annotations. In this work, we propose a novel framework for domain adaptation in semantic segmentation with image-level weak labels in the target domain. The weak labels may be obtained based on a model prediction for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), or from a human annotator in a new weakly-supervised domain adaptation (WDA) paradigm for semantic segmentation. Using weak labels is both practical and useful, since (i) collecting image-level target annotations is comparably cheap in WDA and incurs no cost in UDA, and (ii) it opens the opportunity for category-wise domain alignment. Our framework uses weak labels to enable the interplay between feature alignment and pseudo-labeling, improving both in the process of domain adaptation. Specifically, we develop a weak-label classification module to enforce the network to attend to certain categories, and then use such training signals to guide the proposed category-wise alignment method. In experiments, we show considerable improvements with respect to the existing state-of-the-arts in UDA and present a new benchmark in the WDA setting. Project page is at http://www.nec-labs.com/~mas/WeakSegDA."
Linear Attention Mechanism: An Efficient Attention for Semantic Segmentation,"In this paper, to remedy this deficiency, we propose a Linear Attention Mechanism which is approximate to dot-product attention with much less memory and computational costs. The efficient design makes the incorporation between attention mechanisms and neural networks more flexible and versatile. Experiments conducted on semantic segmentation demonstrated the effectiveness of linear attention mechanism. Code is available at https://github.com/lironui/Linear-Attention-Mechanism."
Learning from Scale-Invariant Examples for Domain Adaptation in Semantic Segmentation,"Self-supervised learning approaches for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) of semantic segmentation models suffer from challenges of predicting and selecting reasonable good quality pseudo labels. In this paper, we propose a novel approach of exploiting scale-invariance property of the semantic segmentation model for self-supervised domain adaptation. Our algorithm is based on a reasonable assumption that, in general, regardless of the size of the object and stuff (given context) the semantic labeling should be unchanged. We show that this constraint is violated over the images of the target domain, and hence could be used to transfer labels in-between differently scaled patches. Specifically, we show that semantic segmentation model produces output with high entropy when presented with scaled-up patches of target domain, in comparison to when presented original size images. These scale-invariant examples are extracted from the most confident images of the target domain. Dynamic class specific entropy thresholding mechanism is presented to filter out unreliable pseudo-labels. Furthermore, we also incorporate the focal loss to tackle the problem of class imbalance in self-supervised learning. Extensive experiments have been performed, and results indicate that exploiting the scale-invariant labeling, we outperform existing self-supervised based state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods. Specifically, we achieve 1.3% and 3.8% of lead for GTA5 to Cityscapes and SYNTHIA to Cityscapes with VGG16-FCN8 baseline network."
Self-Prediction for Joint Instance and Semantic Segmentation of Point Clouds,"We develop a novel learning scheme named Self-Prediction for 3D instance and semantic segmentation of point clouds. Distinct from most existing methods that focus on designing convolutional operators, our method designs a new learning scheme to enhance point relation exploring for better segmentation. More specifically, we divide a point cloud sample into two subsets and construct a complete graph based on their representations. Then we use label propagation algorithm to predict labels of one subset when given labels of the other subset. By training with this Self-Prediction task, the backbone network is constrained to fully explore relational context/geometric/shape information and learn more discriminative features for segmentation. Moreover, a general associated framework equipped with our Self-Prediction scheme is designed for enhancing instance and semantic segmentation simultaneously, where instance and semantic representations are combined to perform Self-Prediction. Through this way, instance and semantic segmentation are collaborated and mutually reinforced. Significant performance improvements on instance and semantic segmentation compared with baseline are achieved on S3DIS and ShapeNet. Our method achieves state-of-the-art instance segmentation results on S3DIS and comparable semantic segmentation results compared with state-of-the-arts on S3DIS and ShapeNet when we only take PointNet++ as the backbone network."
Virtual Multi-view Fusion for 3D Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation of 3D meshes is an important problem for 3D scene understanding. In this paper we revisit the classic multiview representation of 3D meshes and study several techniques that make them effective for 3D semantic segmentation of meshes. Given a 3D mesh reconstructed from RGBD sensors, our method effectively chooses different virtual views of the 3D mesh and renders multiple 2D channels for training an effective 2D semantic segmentation model. Features from multiple per view predictions are finally fused on 3D mesh vertices to predict mesh semantic segmentation labels. Using the large scale indoor 3D semantic segmentation benchmark of ScanNet, we show that our virtual views enable more effective training of 2D semantic segmentation networks than previous multiview approaches. When the 2D per pixel predictions are aggregated on 3D surfaces, our virtual multiview fusion method is able to achieve significantly better 3D semantic segmentation results compared to all prior multiview approaches and competitive with recent 3D convolution approaches."
MACU-Net for Semantic Segmentation of Fine-Resolution Remotely Sensed Images,"Semantic segmentation of remotely sensed images plays an important role in land resource management, yield estimation, and economic assessment. U-Net, a deep encoder-decoder architecture, has been used frequently for image segmentation with high accuracy. In this Letter, we incorporate multi-scale features generated by different layers of U-Net and design a multi-scale skip connected and asymmetric-convolution-based U-Net (MACU-Net), for segmentation using fine-resolution remotely sensed images. Our design has the following advantages: (1) The multi-scale skip connections combine and realign semantic features contained in both low-level and high-level feature maps; (2) the asymmetric convolution block strengthens the feature representation and feature extraction capability of a standard convolution layer. Experiments conducted on two remotely sensed datasets captured by different satellite sensors demonstrate that the proposed MACU-Net transcends the U-Net, U-NetPPL, U-Net 3+, amongst other benchmark approaches. Code is available at https://github.com/lironui/MACU-Net."
Applying Semantic Segmentation to Autonomous Cars in the Snowy Environment,"This paper mainly focuses on environment perception in snowy situations which forms the backbone of the autonomous driving technology. For the purpose, semantic segmentation is employed to classify the objects while the vehicle is driven autonomously. We train the Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN) on our own dataset and present the experimental results. Finally, the outcomes are analyzed to give a conclusion. It can be concluded that the database still needs to be optimized and a favorable algorithm should be proposed to get better results."
Semantic Segmentation With Multi Scale Spatial Attention For Self Driving Cars,"In this paper, we present a novel neural network using multi scale feature fusion at various scales for accurate and efficient semantic image segmentation. We used ResNet based feature extractor, dilated convolutional layers in downsampling part, atrous convolutional layers in the upsampling part and used concat operation to merge them. A new attention module is proposed to encode more contextual information and enhance the receptive field of the network. We present an in depth theoretical analysis of our network with training and optimization details. Our network was trained and tested on the Camvid dataset and Cityscapes dataset using mean accuracy per class and Intersection Over Union (IOU) as the evaluation metrics. Our model outperforms previous state of the art methods on semantic segmentation achieving mean IOU value of 74.12 while running at >100 FPS."
KPRNet: Improving projection-based LiDAR semantic segmentation,"Semantic segmentation is an important component in the perception systems of autonomous vehicles. In this work, we adopt recent advances in both image and point cloud segmentation to achieve a better accuracy in the task of segmenting LiDAR scans. KPRNet improves the convolutional neural network architecture of 2D projection methods and utilizes KPConv to replace the commonly used post-processing techniques with a learnable point-wise component which allows us to obtain more accurate 3D labels. With these improvements our model outperforms the current best method on the SemanticKITTI benchmark, reaching an mIoU of 63.1."
Attend and Segment: Attention Guided Active Semantic Segmentation,"In a dynamic environment, an agent with a limited field of view/resource cannot fully observe the scene before attempting to parse it. The deployment of common semantic segmentation architectures is not feasible in such settings. In this paper we propose a method to gradually segment a scene given a sequence of partial observations. The main idea is to refine an agent's understanding of the environment by attending the areas it is most uncertain about. Our method includes a self-supervised attention mechanism and a specialized architecture to maintain and exploit spatial memory maps for filling-in the unseen areas in the environment. The agent can select and attend an area while relying on the cues coming from the visited areas to hallucinate the other parts. We reach a mean pixel-wise accuracy of 78.1%, 80.9% and 76.5% on CityScapes, CamVid, and Kitti datasets by processing only 18% of the image pixels (10 retina-like glimpses). We perform an ablation study on the number of glimpses, input image size and effectiveness of retina-like glimpses. We compare our method to several baselines and show that the optimal results are achieved by having access to a very low resolution view of the scene at the first timestep."
Shape-aware Semi-supervised 3D Semantic Segmentation for Medical Images,"Semi-supervised learning has attracted much attention in medical image segmentation due to challenges in acquiring pixel-wise image annotations, which is a crucial step for building high-performance deep learning methods. Most existing semi-supervised segmentation approaches either tend to neglect geometric constraint in object segments, leading to incomplete object coverage, or impose strong shape prior that requires extra alignment. In this work, we propose a novel shapeaware semi-supervised segmentation strategy to leverage abundant unlabeled data and to enforce a geometric shape constraint on the segmentation output. To achieve this, we develop a multi-task deep network that jointly predicts semantic segmentation and signed distance map(SDM) of object surfaces. During training, we introduce an adversarial loss between the predicted SDMs of labeled and unlabeled data so that our network is able to capture shape-aware features more effectively. Experiments on the Atrial Segmentation Challenge dataset show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches with improved shape estimation, which validates its efficacy. Code is available at https://github.com/kleinzcy/SASSnet."
Improving Semantic Segmentation via Decoupled Body and Edge Supervision,"Existing semantic segmentation approaches either aim to improve the object's inner consistency by modeling the global context, or refine objects detail along their boundaries by multi-scale feature fusion. In this paper, a new paradigm for semantic segmentation is proposed. Our insight is that appealing performance of semantic segmentation requires \textit{explicitly} modeling the object \textit{body} and \textit{edge}, which correspond to the high and low frequency of the image. To do so, we first warp the image feature by learning a flow field to make the object part more consistent. The resulting body feature and the residual edge feature are further optimized under decoupled supervision by explicitly sampling different parts (body or edge) pixels. We show that the proposed framework with various baselines or backbone networks leads to better object inner consistency and object boundaries. Extensive experiments on four major road scene semantic segmentation benchmarks including \textit{Cityscapes}, \textit{CamVid}, \textit{KIITI} and \textit{BDD} show that our proposed approach establishes new state of the art while retaining high efficiency in inference. In particular, we achieve 83.7 mIoU \% on Cityscape with only fine-annotated data. Code and models are made available to foster any further research (\url{https://github.com/lxtGH/DecoupleSegNets})."
Beyond Single Stage Encoder-Decoder Networks: Deep Decoders for Semantic Image Segmentation,"Single encoder-decoder methodologies for semantic segmentation are reaching their peak in terms of segmentation quality and efficiency per number of layers. To address these limitations, we propose a new architecture based on a decoder which uses a set of shallow networks for capturing more information content. The new decoder has a new topology of skip connections, namely backward and stacked residual connections. In order to further improve the architecture we introduce a weight function which aims to re-balance classes to increase the attention of the networks to under-represented objects. We carried out an extensive set of experiments that yielded state-of-the-art results for the CamVid, Gatech and Freiburg Forest datasets. Moreover, to further prove the effectiveness of our decoder, we conducted a set of experiments studying the impact of our decoder to state-of-the-art segmentation techniques. Additionally, we present a set of experiments augmenting semantic segmentation with optical flow information, showing that motion clues can boost pure image based semantic segmentation approaches."
Class-wise Dynamic Graph Convolution for Semantic Segmentation,"Recent works have made great progress in semantic segmentation by exploiting contextual information in a local or global manner with dilated convolutions, pyramid pooling or self-attention mechanism. In order to avoid potential misleading contextual information aggregation in previous works, we propose a class-wise dynamic graph convolution (CDGC) module to adaptively propagate information. The graph reasoning is performed among pixels in the same class. Based on the proposed CDGC module, we further introduce the Class-wise Dynamic Graph Convolution Network(CDGCNet), which consists of two main parts including the CDGC module and a basic segmentation network, forming a coarse-to-fine paradigm. Specifically, the CDGC module takes the coarse segmentation result as class mask to extract node features for graph construction and performs dynamic graph convolutions on the constructed graph to learn the feature aggregation and weight allocation. Then the refined feature and the original feature are fused to get the final prediction. We conduct extensive experiments on three popular semantic segmentation benchmarks including Cityscapes, PASCAL VOC 2012 and COCO Stuff, and achieve state-of-the-art performance on all three benchmarks."
Towards Emergent Language Symbolic Semantic Segmentation and Model Interpretability,"Recent advances in methods focused on the grounding problem have resulted in techniques that can be used to construct a symbolic language associated with a specific domain. Inspired by how humans communicate complex ideas through language, we developed a generalized Symbolic Semantic (\text{S}^2) framework for interpretable segmentation. Unlike adversarial models (e.g., GANs), we explicitly model cooperation between two agents, a Sender and a Receiver, that must cooperate to achieve a common goal. The Sender receives information from a high layer of a segmentation network and generates a symbolic sentence derived from a categorical distribution. The Receiver obtains the symbolic sentences and co-generates the segmentation mask. In order for the model to converge, the Sender and Receiver must learn to communicate using a private language. We apply our architecture to segment tumors in the TCGA dataset. A UNet-like architecture is used to generate input to the Sender network which produces a symbolic sentence, and a Receiver network co-generates the segmentation mask based on the sentence. Our Segmentation framework achieved similar or better performance compared with state-of-the-art segmentation methods. In addition, our results suggest direct interpretation of the symbolic sentences to discriminate between normal and tumor tissue, tumor morphology, and other image characteristics."
Classes Matter: A Fine-grained Adversarial Approach to Cross-domain Semantic Segmentation,"Despite great progress in supervised semantic segmentation,a large performance drop is usually observed when deploying the model in the wild. Domain adaptation methods tackle the issue by aligning the source domain and the target domain. However, most existing methods attempt to perform the alignment from a holistic view, ignoring the underlying class-level data structure in the target domain. To fully exploit the supervision in the source domain, we propose a fine-grained adversarial learning strategy for class-level feature alignment while preserving the internal structure of semantics across domains. We adopt a fine-grained domain discriminator that not only plays as a domain distinguisher, but also differentiates domains at class level. The traditional binary domain labels are also generalized to domain encodings as the supervision signal to guide the fine-grained feature alignment. An analysis with Class Center Distance (CCD) validates that our fine-grained adversarial strategy achieves better class-level alignment compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Our method is easy to implement and its effectiveness is evaluated on three classical domain adaptation tasks, i.e., GTA5 to Cityscapes, SYNTHIA to Cityscapes and Cityscapes to Cross-City. Large performance gains show that our method outperforms other global feature alignment based and class-wise alignment based counterparts. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/JDAI-CV/FADA."
Bi-directional Cross-Modality Feature Propagation with Separation-and-Aggregation Gate for RGB-D Semantic Segmentation,"Depth information has proven to be a useful cue in the semantic segmentation of RGB-D images for providing a geometric counterpart to the RGB representation. Most existing works simply assume that depth measurements are accurate and well-aligned with the RGB pixels and models the problem as a cross-modal feature fusion to obtain better feature representations to achieve more accurate segmentation. This, however, may not lead to satisfactory results as actual depth data are generally noisy, which might worsen the accuracy as the networks go deeper.  In this paper, we propose a unified and efficient Cross-modality Guided Encoder to not only effectively recalibrate RGB feature responses, but also to distill accurate depth information via multiple stages and aggregate the two recalibrated representations alternatively. The key of the proposed architecture is a novel Separation-and-Aggregation Gating operation that jointly filters and recalibrates both representations before cross-modality aggregation. Meanwhile, a Bi-direction Multi-step Propagation strategy is introduced, on the one hand, to help to propagate and fuse information between the two modalities, and on the other hand, to preserve their specificity along the long-term propagation process. Besides, our proposed encoder can be easily injected into the previous encoder-decoder structures to boost their performance on RGB-D semantic segmentation. Our model outperforms state-of-the-arts consistently on both in-door and out-door challenging datasets. Code of this work is available at https://charlescxk.github.io/"
GMNet: Graph Matching Network for Large Scale Part Semantic Segmentation in the Wild,"The semantic segmentation of parts of objects in the wild is a challenging task in which multiple instances of objects and multiple parts within those objects must be detected in the scene. This problem remains nowadays very marginally explored, despite its fundamental importance towards detailed object understanding. In this work, we propose a novel framework combining higher object-level context conditioning and part-level spatial relationships to address the task. To tackle object-level ambiguity, a class-conditioning module is introduced to retain class-level semantics when learning parts-level semantics. In this way, mid-level features carry also this information prior to the decoding stage. To tackle part-level ambiguity and localization we propose a novel adjacency graph-based module that aims at matching the relative spatial relationships between ground truth and predicted parts. The experimental evaluation on the Pascal-Part dataset shows that we achieve state-of-the-art results on this task."
Edge-Preserving Guided Semantic Segmentation for VIPriors Challenge,"Semantic segmentation is one of the most attractive research fields in computer vision. In the VIPriors challenge, only very limited numbers of training samples are allowed, leading to that the current state-of-the-art and deep learning-based semantic segmentation techniques are hard to train well. To overcome this shortcoming, therefore, we propose edge-preserving guidance to obtain the extra prior information, to avoid the overfitting under small-scale training dataset. First, a two-channeled convolutional layer is concatenated to the last layer of the conventional semantic segmentation network. Then, an edge map is calculated from the ground truth by Sobel operation and followed by concatenating a hard-thresholding operation to indicate whether the pixel is the edge or not. Then, the two-dimensional cross-entropy loss is adopted to calculate the loss between the predicted edge map and its ground truth, termed as an edge-preserving loss. In this way, the continuity of boundaries between different instances can be forced by the proposed edge-preserving loss. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve excellent performance under small-scale training set, compared to state-of-the-art semantic segmentation techniques."
Complete & Label: A Domain Adaptation Approach to Semantic Segmentation of LiDAR Point Clouds,"We study an unsupervised domain adaptation problem for the semantic labeling of 3D point clouds, with a particular focus on domain discrepancies induced by different LiDAR sensors. Based on the observation that sparse 3D point clouds are sampled from 3D surfaces, we take a Complete and Label approach to recover the underlying surfaces before passing them to a segmentation network. Specifically, we design a Sparse Voxel Completion Network (SVCN) to complete the 3D surfaces of a sparse point cloud. Unlike semantic labels, to obtain training pairs for SVCN requires no manual labeling. We also introduce local adversarial learning to model the surface prior. The recovered 3D surfaces serve as a canonical domain, from which semantic labels can transfer across different LiDAR sensors. Experiments and ablation studies with our new benchmark for cross-domain semantic labeling of LiDAR data show that the proposed approach provides 8.2-36.6% better performance than previous domain adaptation methods."
MTP: Multi-Task Pruning for Efficient Semantic Segmentation Networks,"This paper focuses on channel pruning for semantic segmentation networks. Previous methods to compress and accelerate deep neural networks in the classification task cannot be straightforwardly applied to the semantic segmentation network that involves an implicit multi-task learning problem via pre-training. To identify the redundancy in segmentation networks, we present a multi-task channel pruning approach. The importance of each convolution filter \wrt the channel of an arbitrary layer will be simultaneously determined by the classification and segmentation tasks. In addition, we develop an alternative scheme for optimizing importance scores of filters in the entire network. Experimental results on several benchmarks illustrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the state-of-the-art pruning methods. Notably, we can obtain an about 2\times FLOPs reduction on DeepLabv3 with only an about 1\% mIoU drop on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset and an about 1.3\% mIoU drop on Cityscapes dataset, respectively."
TrashCan: A Semantically-Segmented Dataset towards Visual Detection of Marine Debris,"This paper presents TrashCan, a large dataset comprised of images of underwater trash collected from a variety of sources, annotated both using bounding boxes and segmentation labels, for development of robust detectors of marine debris. The dataset has two versions, TrashCan-Material and TrashCan-Instance, corresponding to different object class configurations. The eventual goal is to develop efficient and accurate trash detection methods suitable for onboard robot deployment. Along with information about the construction and sourcing of the TrashCan dataset, we present initial results of instance segmentation from Mask R-CNN and object detection from Faster R-CNN. These do not represent the best possible detection results but provides an initial baseline for future work in instance segmentation and object detection on the TrashCan dataset."
Negative Pseudo Labeling using Class Proportion for Semantic Segmentation in Pathology,"We propose a weakly-supervised cell tracking method that can train a convolutional neural network (CNN) by using only the annotation of ""cell detection"" (i.e., the coordinates of cell positions) without association information, in which cell positions can be easily obtained by nuclear staining. First, we train a co-detection CNN that detects cells in successive frames by using weak-labels. Our key assumption is that the co-detection CNN implicitly learns association in addition to detection. To obtain the association information, we propose a backward-and-forward propagation method that analyzes the correspondence of cell positions in the detection maps output of the co-detection CNN. Experiments demonstrated that the proposed method can match positions by analyzing the co-detection CNN. Even though the method uses only weak supervision, the performance of our method was almost the same as the state-of-the-art supervised method."
Tackling the Problem of Limited Data and Annotations in Semantic Segmentation,"In this work, the case of semantic segmentation on a small image dataset (simulated by 1000 randomly selected images from PASCAL VOC 2012), where only weak supervision signals (scribbles from user interaction) are available is studied. Especially, to tackle the problem of limited data annotations in image segmentation, transferring different pre-trained models and CRF based methods are applied to enhance the segmentation performance. To this end, RotNet, DeeperCluster, and Semi&Weakly Supervised Learning (SWSL) pre-trained models are transferred and finetuned in a DeepLab-v2 baseline, and dense CRF is applied both as a post-processing and loss regularization technique. The results of my study show that, on this small dataset, using a pre-trained ResNet50 SWSL model gives results that are 7.4% better than applying an ImageNet pre-trained model; moreover, for the case of training on the full PASCAL VOC 2012 training data, this pre-training approach increases the mIoU results by almost 4%. On the other hand, dense CRF is shown to be very effective as well, enhancing the results both as a loss regularization technique in weakly supervised training and as a post-processing tool."
JSENet: Joint Semantic Segmentation and Edge Detection Network for 3D Point Clouds,"Semantic segmentation and semantic edge detection can be seen as two dual problems with close relationships in computer vision. Despite the fast evolution of learning-based 3D semantic segmentation methods, little attention has been drawn to the learning of 3D semantic edge detectors, even less to a joint learning method for the two tasks. In this paper, we tackle the 3D semantic edge detection task for the first time and present a new two-stream fully-convolutional network that jointly performs the two tasks. In particular, we design a joint refinement module that explicitly wires region information and edge information to improve the performances of both tasks. Further, we propose a novel loss function that encourages the network to produce semantic segmentation results with better boundaries. Extensive evaluations on S3DIS and ScanNet datasets show that our method achieves on par or better performance than the state-of-the-art methods for semantic segmentation and outperforms the baseline methods for semantic edge detection. Code release: https://github.com/hzykent/JSENet"
Part-aware Prototype Network for Few-shot Semantic Segmentation,"Few-shot semantic segmentation aims to learn to segment new object classes with only a few annotated examples, which has a wide range of real-world applications. Most existing methods either focus on the restrictive setting of one-way few-shot segmentation or suffer from incomplete coverage of object regions. In this paper, we propose a novel few-shot semantic segmentation framework based on the prototype representation. Our key idea is to decompose the holistic class representation into a set of part-aware prototypes, capable of capturing diverse and fine-grained object features. In addition, we propose to leverage unlabeled data to enrich our part-aware prototypes, resulting in better modeling of intra-class variations of semantic objects. We develop a novel graph neural network model to generate and enhance the proposed part-aware prototypes based on labeled and unlabeled images. Extensive experimental evaluations on two benchmarks show that our method outperforms the prior art with a sizable margin."
PCAMs: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation Using Point Supervision,"Current state of the art methods for generating semantic segmentation rely heavily on a large set of images that have each pixel labeled with a class of interest label or background. Coming up with such labels, especially in domains that require an expert to do annotations, comes at a heavy cost in time and money. Several methods have shown that we can learn semantic segmentation from less expensive image-level labels, but the effectiveness of point level labels, a healthy compromise between all pixels labelled and none, still remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a novel procedure for producing semantic segmentation from images given some point level annotations. This method includes point annotations in the training of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for producing improved localization and class activation maps. Then, we use another CNN for predicting semantic affinities in order to propagate rough class labels and create pseudo semantic segmentation labels. Finally, we propose training a CNN that is normally fully supervised using our pseudo labels in place of ground truth labels, which further improves performance and simplifies the inference process by requiring just one CNN during inference rather than two. Our method achieves state of the art results for point supervised semantic segmentation on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset \cite{everingham2010pascal}, even outperforming state of the art methods for stronger bounding box and squiggle supervision."
Real-time Semantic Segmentation with Fast Attention,"In deep CNN based models for semantic segmentation, high accuracy relies on rich spatial context (large receptive fields) and fine spatial details (high resolution), both of which incur high computational costs. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture that addresses both challenges and achieves state-of-the-art performance for semantic segmentation of high-resolution images and videos in real-time. The proposed architecture relies on our fast spatial attention, which is a simple yet efficient modification of the popular self-attention mechanism and captures the same rich spatial context at a small fraction of the computational cost, by changing the order of operations. Moreover, to efficiently process high-resolution input, we apply an additional spatial reduction to intermediate feature stages of the network with minimal loss in accuracy thanks to the use of the fast attention module to fuse features. We validate our method with a series of experiments, and show that results on multiple datasets demonstrate superior performance with better accuracy and speed compared to existing approaches for real-time semantic segmentation. On Cityscapes, our network achieves 74.4\% mIoU at 72 FPS and 75.5\% mIoU at 58 FPS on a single Titan X GPU, which is~\sim50\% faster than the state-of-the-art while retaining the same accuracy."
Spatial Semantic Embedding Network: Fast 3D Instance Segmentation with Deep Metric Learning,"We propose spatial semantic embedding network (SSEN), a simple, yet efficient algorithm for 3D instance segmentation using deep metric learning. The raw 3D reconstruction of an indoor environment suffers from occlusions, noise, and is produced without any meaningful distinction between individual entities. For high-level intelligent tasks from a large scale scene, 3D instance segmentation recognizes individual instances of objects. We approach the instance segmentation by simply learning the correct embedding space that maps individual instances of objects into distinct clusters that reflect both spatial and semantic information. Unlike previous approaches that require complex pre-processing or post-processing, our implementation is compact and fast with competitive performance, maintaining scalability on large scenes with high resolution voxels. We demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our algorithm in the ScanNet 3D instance segmentation benchmark on AP score."
Exploration of Optimized Semantic Segmentation Architectures for edge-Deployment on Drones,"In this paper, we present an analysis on the impact of network parameters for semantic segmentation architectures in context of UAV data processing. We present the analysis on the DroneDeploy Segmentation benchmark. Based on the comparative analysis we identify the optimal network architecture to be FPN-EfficientNetB3 with pretrained encoder backbones based on Imagenet Dataset. The network achieves IoU score of 0.65 and F1-score of 0.71 over the validation dataset. We also compare the various architectures in terms of their memory footprint and inference latency with further exploration of the impact of TensorRT based optimizations. We achieve memory savings of ~4.1x and latency improvement of 10% compared to Model: FPN and Backbone: InceptionResnetV2."
Automatic semantic segmentation for prediction of tuberculosis using lens-free microscopy images,"Tuberculosis (TB), caused by a germ called Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is one of the most serious public health problems in Peru and the world. The development of this project seeks to facilitate and automate the diagnosis of tuberculosis by the MODS method and using lens-free microscopy, due they are easier to calibrate and easier to use (by untrained personnel) in comparison with lens microscopy. Thus, we employ a U-Net network in our collected dataset to perform the automatic segmentation of the TB cords in order to predict tuberculosis. Our initial results show promising evidence for automatic segmentation of TB cords."
Contextual-Relation Consistent Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation,"Recent advances in unsupervised domain adaptation for semantic segmentation have shown great potentials to relieve the demand of expensive per-pixel annotations. However, most existing works address the domain discrepancy by aligning the data distributions of two domains at a global image level whereas the local consistencies are largely neglected. This paper presents an innovative local contextual-relation consistent domain adaptation (CrCDA) technique that aims to achieve local-level consistencies during the global-level alignment. The idea is to take a closer look at region-wise feature representations and align them for local-level consistencies. Specifically, CrCDA learns and enforces the prototypical local contextual-relations explicitly in the feature space of a labelled source domain while transferring them to an unlabelled target domain via backpropagation-based adversarial learning. An adaptive entropy max-min adversarial learning scheme is designed to optimally align these hundreds of local contextual-relations across domain without requiring discriminator or extra computation overhead. The proposed CrCDA has been evaluated extensively over two challenging domain adaptive segmentation tasks (e.g., GTA5 to Cityscapes and SYNTHIA to Cityscapes), and experiments demonstrate its superior segmentation performance as compared with state-of-the-art methods."
Self-supervised Depth Estimation to Regularise Semantic Segmentation in Knee Arthroscopy,"Intra-operative automatic semantic segmentation of knee joint structures can assist surgeons during knee arthroscopy in terms of situational awareness. However, due to poor imaging conditions (e.g., low texture, overexposure, etc.), automatic semantic segmentation is a challenging scenario, which justifies the scarce literature on this topic. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised monocular depth estimation to regularise the training of the semantic segmentation in knee arthroscopy. To further regularise the depth estimation, we propose the use of clean training images captured by the stereo arthroscope of routine objects (presenting none of the poor imaging conditions and with rich texture information) to pre-train the model. We fine-tune such model to produce both the semantic segmentation and self-supervised monocular depth using stereo arthroscopic images taken from inside the knee. Using a data set containing 3868 arthroscopic images captured during cadaveric knee arthroscopy with semantic segmentation annotations, 2000 stereo image pairs of cadaveric knee arthroscopy, and 2150 stereo image pairs of routine objects, we show that our semantic segmentation regularised by self-supervised depth estimation produces a more accurate segmentation than a state-of-the-art semantic segmentation approach modeled exclusively with semantic segmentation annotation."
Mining Cross-Image Semantics for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"This paper studies the problem of learning semantic segmentation from image-level supervision only. Current popular solutions leverage object localization maps from classifiers as supervision signals, and struggle to make the localization maps capture more complete object content. Rather than previous efforts that primarily focus on intra-image information, we address the value of cross-image semantic relations for comprehensive object pattern mining. To achieve this, two neural co-attentions are incorporated into the classifier to complimentarily capture cross-image semantic similarities and differences. In particular, given a pair of training images, one co-attention enforces the classifier to recognize the common semantics from co-attentive objects, while the other one, called contrastive co-attention, drives the classifier to identify the unshared semantics from the rest, uncommon objects. This helps the classifier discover more object patterns and better ground semantics in image regions. In addition to boosting object pattern learning, the co-attention can leverage context from other related images to improve localization map inference, hence eventually benefiting semantic segmentation learning. More essentially, our algorithm provides a unified framework that handles well different WSSS settings, i.e., learning WSSS with (1) precise image-level supervision only, (2) extra simple single-label data, and (3) extra noisy web data. It sets new state-of-the-arts on all these settings, demonstrating well its efficacy and generalizability. Moreover, our approach ranked 1st place in the Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation Track of CVPR2020 Learning from Imperfect Data Challenge."
Evaluating Uncertainty Estimation Methods on 3D Semantic Segmentation of Point Clouds,"Deep learning models are extensively used in various safety critical applications. Hence these models along with being accurate need to be highly reliable. One way of achieving this is by quantifying uncertainty. Bayesian methods for UQ have been extensively studied for Deep Learning models applied on images but have been less explored for 3D modalities such as point clouds often used for Robots and Autonomous Systems. In this work, we evaluate three uncertainty quantification methods namely Deep Ensembles, MC-Dropout and MC-DropConnect on the DarkNet21Seg 3D semantic segmentation model and comprehensively analyze the impact of various parameters such as number of models in ensembles or forward passes, and drop probability values, on task performance and uncertainty estimate quality. We find that Deep Ensembles outperforms other methods in both performance and uncertainty metrics. Deep ensembles outperform other methods by a margin of 2.4% in terms of mIOU, 1.3% in terms of accuracy, while providing reliable uncertainty for decision making."
Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation Augmented with Image-Level Weak Annotations,"Despite the great progress made by deep neural networks in the semantic segmentation task, traditional neural-networkbased methods typically suffer from a shortage of large amounts of pixel-level annotations. Recent progress in fewshot semantic segmentation tackles the issue by only a few pixel-level annotated examples. However, these few-shot approaches cannot easily be applied to multi-way or weak annotation settings. In this paper, we advance the few-shot segmentation paradigm towards a scenario where image-level annotations are available to help the training process of a few pixel-level annotations. Our key idea is to learn a better prototype representation of the class by fusing the knowledge from the image-level labeled data. Specifically, we propose a new framework, called PAIA, to learn the class prototype representation in a metric space by integrating image-level annotations. Furthermore, by considering the uncertainty of pseudo-masks, a distilled soft masked average pooling strategy is designed to handle distractions in image-level annotations. Extensive empirical results on two datasets show superior performance of PAIA."
Learning unbiased zero-shot semantic segmentation networks via transductive transfer,"Semantic segmentation, which aims to acquire a detailed understanding of images, is an essential issue in computer vision. However, in practical scenarios, new categories that are different from the categories in training usually appear. Since it is impractical to collect labeled data for all categories, how to conduct zero-shot learning in semantic segmentation establishes an important problem. Although the attribute embedding of categories can promote effective knowledge transfer across different categories, the prediction of segmentation network reveals obvious bias to seen categories. In this paper, we propose an easy-to-implement transductive approach to alleviate the prediction bias in zero-shot semantic segmentation. Our method assumes that both the source images with full pixel-level labels and unlabeled target images are available during training. To be specific, the source images are used to learn the relationship between visual images and semantic embeddings, while the target images are used to alleviate the prediction bias towards seen categories. We conduct comprehensive experiments on diverse split s of the PASCAL dataset. The experimental results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."
Robust Semantic Segmentation in Adverse Weather Conditions by means of Fast Video-Sequence Segmentation,"Computer vision tasks such as semantic segmentation perform very well in good weather conditions, but if the weather turns bad, they have problems to achieve this performance in these conditions. One possibility to obtain more robust and reliable results in adverse weather conditions is to use video-segmentation approaches instead of commonly used single-image segmentation methods. Video-segmentation approaches capture temporal information of the previous video-frames in addition to current image information, and hence, they are more robust against disturbances, especially if they occur in only a few frames of the video-sequence. However, video-segmentation approaches, which are often based on recurrent neural networks, cannot be applied in real-time applications anymore, since their recurrent structures in the network are computational expensive. For instance, the inference time of the LSTM-ICNet, in which recurrent units are placed at proper positions in the single-segmentation approach ICNet, increases up to 61 percent compared to the basic ICNet. Hence, in this work, the LSTM-ICNet is sped up by modifying the recurrent units of the network so that it becomes real-time capable again. Experiments on different datasets and various weather conditions show that the inference time can be decreased by about 23 percent by these modifications, while they achieve similar performance than the LSTM-ICNet and outperform the single-segmentation approach enormously in adverse weather conditions."
SASO: Joint 3D Semantic-Instance Segmentation via Multi-scale Semantic Association and Salient Point Clustering Optimization,"We propose a novel 3D point cloud segmentation framework named SASO, which jointly performs semantic and instance segmentation tasks. For semantic segmentation task, inspired by the inherent correlation among objects in spatial context, we propose a Multi-scale Semantic Association (MSA) module to explore the constructive effects of the semantic context information. For instance segmentation task, different from previous works that utilize clustering only in inference procedure, we propose a Salient Point Clustering Optimization (SPCO) module to introduce a clustering procedure into the training process and impel the network focusing on points that are difficult to be distinguished. In addition, because of the inherent structures of indoor scenes, the imbalance problem of the category distribution is rarely considered but severely limits the performance of 3D scene perception. To address this issue, we introduce an adaptive Water Filling Sampling (WFS) algorithm to balance the category distribution of training data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets in both semantic segmentation and instance segmentation tasks."
A survey of loss functions for semantic segmentation,"Image Segmentation has been an active field of research as it has a wide range of applications, ranging from automated disease detection to self-driving cars. In the past five years, various papers came up with different objective loss functions used in different cases such as biased data, sparse segmentation, etc. In this paper, we have summarized some of the well-known loss functions widely used for Image Segmentation and listed out the cases where their usage can help in fast and better convergence of a model. Furthermore, we have also introduced a new log-cosh dice loss function and compared its performance on the NBFS skull-segmentation open-source data-set with widely used loss functions. We also showcased that certain loss functions perform well across all data-sets and can be taken as a good baseline choice in unknown data distribution scenarios. Our code is available at Github: https://github.com/shruti-jadon/Semantic-Segmentation-Loss-Functions."
Calibrated Adversarial Refinement for Stochastic Semantic Segmentation,"In semantic segmentation tasks, input images can often have more than one plausible interpretation, thus allowing for multiple valid labels. To capture such ambiguities, recent work has explored the use of probabilistic networks that can learn a distribution over predictions. However, these do not necessarily represent the empirical distribution accurately. In this work, we present a strategy for learning a calibrated predictive distribution over semantic maps, where the probability associated with each prediction reflects its ground truth correctness likelihood. To this end, we propose a novel two-stage, cascaded approach for calibrated adversarial refinement: (i) a standard segmentation network is trained with categorical cross entropy to predict a pixelwise probability distribution over semantic classes and (ii) an adversarially trained stochastic network is used to model the inter-pixel correlations to refine the output of the first network into coherent samples. Importantly, to calibrate the refinement network and prevent mode collapse, the expectation of the samples in the second stage is matched to the probabilities predicted in the first. We demonstrate the versatility and robustness of the approach by achieving state-of-the-art results on the multigrader LIDC dataset and on a modified Cityscapes dataset with injected ambiguities. In addition, we show that the core design can be adapted to other tasks requiring learning a calibrated predictive distribution by experimenting on a toy regression dataset. We provide an open source implementation of our method at https://github.com/EliasKassapis/CARSSS."
HookNet: multi-resolution convolutional neural networks for semantic segmentation in histopathology whole-slide images,"We propose HookNet, a semantic segmentation model for histopathology whole-slide images, which combines context and details via multiple branches of encoder-decoder convolutional neural networks. Concentricpatches at multiple resolutions with different fields of view are used to feed different branches of HookNet, and intermediate representations are combined via a hooking mechanism. We describe a framework to design and train HookNet for achieving high-resolution semantic segmentation and introduce constraints to guarantee pixel-wise alignment in feature maps during hooking. We show the advantages of using HookNet in two histopathology image segmentation tasks where tissue type prediction accuracy strongly depends on contextual information, namely (1) multi-class tissue segmentation in breast cancer and, (2) segmentation of tertiary lymphoid structures and germinal centers in lung cancer. Weshow the superiority of HookNet when compared with single-resolution U-Net models working at different resolutions as well as with a recently published multi-resolution model for histopathology image segmentation"
Few-shot 3D Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation,"Many existing approaches for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation are fully supervised. These fully supervised approaches heavily rely on large amounts of labeled training data that are difficult to obtain and cannot segment new classes after training. To mitigate these limitations, we propose a novel attention-aware multi-prototype transductive few-shot point cloud semantic segmentation method to segment new classes given a few labeled examples. Specifically, each class is represented by multiple prototypes to model the complex data distribution of labeled points. Subsequently, we employ a transductive label propagation method to exploit the affinities between labeled multi-prototypes and unlabeled points, and among the unlabeled points. Furthermore, we design an attention-aware multi-level feature learning network to learn the discriminative features that capture the geometric dependencies and semantic correlations between points. Our proposed method shows significant and consistent improvements compared to baselines in different few-shot point cloud semantic segmentation settings (i.e., 2/3-way 1/5-shot) on two benchmark datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/Na-Z/attMPTI."
BEV-Seg: Bird's Eye View Semantic Segmentation Using Geometry and Semantic Point Cloud,"Bird's-eye-view (BEV) is a powerful and widely adopted representation for road scenes that captures surrounding objects and their spatial locations, along with overall context in the scene. In this work, we focus on bird's eye semantic segmentation, a task that predicts pixel-wise semantic segmentation in BEV from side RGB images. This task is made possible by simulators such as Carla, which allow for cheap data collection, arbitrary camera placements, and supervision in ways otherwise not possible in the real world. There are two main challenges to this task: the view transformation from side view to bird's eye view, as well as transfer learning to unseen domains. Existing work transforms between views through fully connected layers and transfer learns via GANs. This suffers from a lack of depth reasoning and performance degradation across domains. Our novel 2-staged perception pipeline explicitly predicts pixel depths and combines them with pixel semantics in an efficient manner, allowing the model to leverage depth information to infer objects' spatial locations in the BEV. In addition, we transfer learning by abstracting high-level geometric features and predicting an intermediate representation that is common across different domains. We publish a new dataset called BEVSEG-Carla and show that our approach improves state-of-the-art by 24% mIoU and performs well when transferred to a new domain."
Lookahead Adversarial Learning for Near Real-Time Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation is one of the most fundamental problems in computer vision with significant impact on a wide variety of applications. Adversarial learning is shown to be an effective approach for improving semantic segmentation quality by enforcing higher-level pixel correlations and structural information. However, state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models cannot be easily plugged into an adversarial setting because they are not designed to accommodate convergence and stability issues in adversarial networks. We bridge this gap by building a conditional adversarial network with a state-of-the-art segmentation model (DeepLabv3+) at its core. To battle the stability issues, we introduce a novel lookahead adversarial learning (LoAd) approach with an embedded label map aggregation module. We focus on semantic segmentation models that run fast at inference for near real-time field applications. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that the proposed solution can alleviate divergence issues in an adversarial semantic segmentation setting and results in considerable performance improvements (+5% in some classes) on the baseline for three standard datasets."
Adaptive feature recombination and recalibration for semantic segmentation with Fully Convolutional Networks,"Fully Convolutional Networks have been achieving remarkable results in image semantic segmentation, while being efficient. Such efficiency results from the capability of segmenting several voxels in a single forward pass. So, there is a direct spatial correspondence between a unit in a feature map and the voxel in the same location. In a convolutional layer, the kernel spans over all channels and extracts information from them. We observe that linear recombination of feature maps by increasing the number of channels followed by compression may enhance their discriminative power. Moreover, not all feature maps have the same relevance for the classes being predicted. In order to learn the inter-channel relationships and recalibrate the channels to suppress the less relevant ones, Squeeze and Excitation blocks were proposed in the context of image classification with Convolutional Neural Networks. However, this is not well adapted for segmentation with Fully Convolutional Networks since they segment several objects simultaneously, hence a feature map may contain relevant information only in some locations. In this paper, we propose recombination of features and a spatially adaptive recalibration block that is adapted for semantic segmentation with Fully Convolutional Networks - the SegSE block. Feature maps are recalibrated by considering the cross-channel information together with spatial relevance. Experimental results indicate that Recombination and Recalibration improve the results of a competitive baseline, and generalize across three different problems: brain tumor segmentation, stroke penumbra estimation, and ischemic stroke lesion outcome prediction. The obtained results are competitive or outperform the state of the art in the three applications."
SceneAdapt: Scene-based domain adaptation for semantic segmentation using adversarial learning,"Semantic segmentation methods have achieved outstanding performance thanks to deep learning. Nevertheless, when such algorithms are deployed to new contexts not seen during training, it is necessary to collect and label scene-specific data in order to adapt them to the new domain using fine-tuning. This process is required whenever an already installed camera is moved or a new camera is introduced in a camera network due to the different scene layouts induced by the different viewpoints. To limit the amount of additional training data to be collected, it would be ideal to train a semantic segmentation method using labeled data already available and only unlabeled data coming from the new camera. We formalize this problem as a domain adaptation task and introduce a novel dataset of urban scenes with the related semantic labels. As a first approach to address this challenging task, we propose SceneAdapt, a method for scene adaptation of semantic segmentation algorithms based on adversarial learning. Experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-art approaches to domain adaptation highlight that promising performance can be achieved using adversarial learning both when the two scenes have different but points of view, and when they comprise images of completely different scenes. To encourage research on this topic, we made our code available at our web page: https://iplab.dmi.unict.it/ParkSmartSceneAdaptation/."
Video Semantic Segmentation with Distortion-Aware Feature Correction,"Video semantic segmentation is active in recent years benefited from the great progress of image semantic segmentation. For such a task, the per-frame image segmentation is generally unacceptable in practice due to high computation cost. To tackle this issue, many works use the flow-based feature propagation to reuse the features of previous frames. However, the optical flow estimation inevitably suffers inaccuracy and then causes the propagated features distorted. In this paper, we propose distortion-aware feature correction to alleviate the issue, which improves video segmentation performance by correcting distorted propagated features. To be specific, we firstly propose to transfer distortion patterns from feature into image space and conduct effective distortion map prediction. Benefited from the guidance of distortion maps, we proposed Feature Correction Module (FCM) to rectify propagated features in the distorted areas. Our proposed method can significantly boost the accuracy of video semantic segmentation at a low price. The extensive experimental results on Cityscapes and CamVid show that our method outperforms the recent state-of-the-art methods."
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation of NIR Images through Generative Latent Search,"Segmentation of the pixels corresponding to human skin is an essential first step in multiple applications ranging from surveillance to heart-rate estimation from remote-photoplethysmography. However, the existing literature considers the problem only in the visible-range of the EM-spectrum which limits their utility in low or no light settings where the criticality of the application is higher. To alleviate this problem, we consider the problem of skin segmentation from the Near-infrared images. However, Deep learning based state-of-the-art segmentation techniques demands large amounts of labelled data that is unavailable for the current problem. Therefore we cast the skin segmentation problem as that of target-independent Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) where we use the data from the Red-channel of the visible-range to develop skin segmentation algorithm on NIR images. We propose a method for target-independent segmentation where the 'nearest-clone' of a target image in the source domain is searched and used as a proxy in the segmentation network trained only on the source domain. We prove the existence of 'nearest-clone' and propose a method to find it through an optimization algorithm over the latent space of a Deep generative model based on variational inference. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method for NIR skin segmentation over the state-of-the-art UDA segmentation methods on the two newly created skin segmentation datasets in NIR domain despite not having access to the target NIR data. Additionally, we report state-of-the-art results for adaption from Synthia to Cityscapes which is a popular setting in Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for semantic segmentation. The code and datasets are available at https://github.com/ambekarsameer96/GLSS."
ESL: Entropy-guided Self-supervised Learning for Domain Adaptation in Semantic Segmentation,"While fully-supervised deep learning yields good models for urban scene semantic segmentation, these models struggle to generalize to new environments with different lighting or weather conditions for instance. In addition, producing the extensive pixel-level annotations that the task requires comes at a great cost. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) is one approach that tries to address these issues in order to make such systems more scalable. In particular, self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently become an effective strategy for UDA in semantic segmentation. At the core of such methods lies `pseudo-labeling', that is, the practice of assigning high-confident class predictions as pseudo-labels, subsequently used as true labels, for target data. To collect pseudo-labels, previous works often rely on the highest softmax score, which we here argue as an unfavorable confidence measurement.  In this work, we propose Entropy-guided Self-supervised Learning (ESL), leveraging entropy as the confidence indicator for producing more accurate pseudo-labels. On different UDA benchmarks, ESL consistently outperforms strong SSL baselines and achieves state-of-the-art results."
Multi-Miner: Object-Adaptive Region Mining for Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Object region mining is a critical step for weakly-supervised semantic segmentation. Most recent methods mine the object regions by expanding the seed regions localized by class activation maps. They generally do not consider the sizes of objects and apply a monotonous procedure to mining all the object regions. Thus their mined regions are often insufficient in number and scale for large objects, and on the other hand easily contaminated by surrounding backgrounds for small objects. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-miner framework to perform a region mining process that adapts to diverse object sizes and is thus able to mine more integral and finer object regions. Specifically, our multi-miner leverages a parallel modulator to check whether there are remaining object regions for each single object, and guide a category-aware generator to mine the regions of each object independently. In this way, the multi-miner adaptively takes more steps for large objects and fewer steps for small objects. Experiment results demonstrate that the multi-miner offers better region mining results and helps achieve better segmentation performance than state-of-the-art weakly-supervised semantic segmentation methods."
NoPeopleAllowed: The Three-Step Approach to Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"We propose a novel approach to weakly supervised semantic segmentation, which consists of three consecutive steps. The first two steps extract high-quality pseudo masks from image-level annotated data, which are then used to train a segmentation model on the third step. The presented approach also addresses two problems in the data: class imbalance and missing labels. Using only image-level annotations as supervision, our method is capable of segmenting various classes and complex objects. It achieves 37.34 mean IoU on the test set, placing 3rd at the LID Challenge in the task of weakly supervised semantic segmentation."
Transferring and Regularizing Prediction for Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation often requires a large set of images with pixel-level annotations. In the view of extremely expensive expert labeling, recent research has shown that the models trained on photo-realistic synthetic data (e.g., computer games) with computer-generated annotations can be adapted to real images. Despite this progress, without constraining the prediction on real images, the models will easily overfit on synthetic data due to severe domain mismatch. In this paper, we novelly exploit the intrinsic properties of semantic segmentation to alleviate such problem for model transfer. Specifically, we present a Regularizer of Prediction Transfer (RPT) that imposes the intrinsic properties as constraints to regularize model transfer in an unsupervised fashion. These constraints include patch-level, cluster-level and context-level semantic prediction consistencies at different levels of image formation. As the transfer is label-free and data-driven, the robustness of prediction is addressed by selectively involving a subset of image regions for model regularization. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the proposal of RPT on the transfer of models trained on GTA5 and SYNTHIA (synthetic data) to Cityscapes dataset (urban street scenes). RPT shows consistent improvements when injecting the constraints on several neural networks for semantic segmentation. More remarkably, when integrating RPT into the adversarial-based segmentation framework, we report to-date the best results: mIoU of 53.2%/51.7% when transferring from GTA5/SYNTHIA to Cityscapes, respectively."
Are We Hungry for 3D LiDAR Data for Semantic Segmentation? A Survey and Experimental Study,"3D semantic segmentation is a fundamental task for robotic and autonomous driving applications. Recent works have been focused on using deep learning techniques, whereas developing fine-annotated 3D LiDAR datasets is extremely labor intensive and requires professional skills. The performance limitation caused by insufficient datasets is called data hunger problem. This research provides a comprehensive survey and experimental study on the question: are we hungry for 3D LiDAR data for semantic segmentation? The studies are conducted at three levels. First, a broad review to the main 3D LiDAR datasets is conducted, followed by a statistical analysis on three representative datasets to gain an in-depth view on the datasets' size and diversity, which are the critical factors in learning deep models. Second, a systematic review to the state-of-the-art 3D semantic segmentation is conducted, followed by experiments and cross examinations of three representative deep learning methods to find out how the size and diversity of the datasets affect deep models' performance. Finally, a systematic survey to the existing efforts to solve the data hunger problem is conducted on both methodological and dataset's viewpoints, followed by an insightful discussion of remaining problems and open questions To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to analyze the data hunger problem for 3D semantic segmentation using deep learning techniques that are addressed in the literature review, statistical analysis, and cross-dataset and cross-algorithm experiments. We share findings and discussions, which may lead to potential topics in future works."
Dilated Convolutions with Lateral Inhibitions for Semantic Image Segmentation,"Dilated convolutions are widely used in deep semantic segmentation models as they can enlarge the filters' receptive field without adding additional weights nor sacrificing spatial resolution. However, as dilated convolutional filters do not possess positional knowledge about the pixels on semantically meaningful contours, they could lead to ambiguous predictions on object boundaries. In addition, although dilating the filter can expand its receptive field, the total number of sampled pixels remains unchanged, which usually comprises a small fraction of the receptive field's total area. Inspired by the Lateral Inhibition (LI) mechanisms in human visual systems, we propose the dilated convolution with lateral inhibitions (LI-Convs) to overcome these limitations. Introducing LI mechanisms improves the convolutional filter's sensitivity to semantic object boundaries. Moreover, since LI-Convs also implicitly take the pixels from the laterally inhibited zones into consideration, they can also extract features at a denser scale. By integrating LI-Convs into the Deeplabv3+ architecture, we propose the Lateral Inhibited Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (LI-ASPP), the Lateral Inhibited MobileNet-V2 (LI-MNV2) and the Lateral Inhibited ResNet (LI-ResNet). Experimental results on three benchmark datasets (PASCAL VOC 2012, CelebAMask-HQ and ADE20K) show that our LI-based segmentation models outperform the baseline on all of them, thus verify the effectiveness and generality of the proposed LI-Convs."
LRNNet: A Light-Weighted Network with Efficient Reduced Non-Local Operation for Real-Time Semantic Segmentation,"The recent development of light-weighted neural networks has promoted the applications of deep learning under resource constraints and mobile applications. Many of these applications need to perform a real-time and efficient prediction for semantic segmentation with a light-weighted network. This paper introduces a light-weighted network with an efficient reduced non-local module (LRNNet) for efficient and realtime semantic segmentation. We proposed a factorized convolutional block in ResNet-Style encoder to achieve more lightweighted, efficient and powerful feature extraction. Meanwhile, our proposed reduced non-local module utilizes spatial regional dominant singular vectors to achieve reduced and more representative non-local feature integration with much lower computation and memory cost. Experiments demonstrate our superior trade-off among light-weight, speed, computation and accuracy. Without additional processing and pretraining, LRNNet achieves 72.2% mIoU on Cityscapes test dataset only using the fine annotation data for training with only 0.68M parameters and with 71 FPS on a GTX 1080Ti card."
Map-Guided Curriculum Domain Adaptation and Uncertainty-Aware Evaluation for Semantic Nighttime Image Segmentation,"We address the problem of semantic nighttime image segmentation and improve the state-of-the-art, by adapting daytime models to nighttime without using nighttime annotations. Moreover, we design a new evaluation framework to address the substantial uncertainty of semantics in nighttime images. Our central contributions are: 1) a curriculum framework to gradually adapt semantic segmentation models from day to night through progressively darker times of day, exploiting cross-time-of-day correspondences between daytime images from a reference map and dark images to guide the label inference in the dark domains; 2) a novel uncertainty-aware annotation and evaluation framework and metric for semantic segmentation, including image regions beyond human recognition capability in the evaluation in a principled fashion; 3) the Dark Zurich dataset, comprising 2416 unlabeled nighttime and 2920 unlabeled twilight images with correspondences to their daytime counterparts plus a set of 201 nighttime images with fine pixel-level annotations created with our protocol, which serves as a first benchmark for our novel evaluation. Experiments show that our map-guided curriculum adaptation significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on nighttime sets both for standard metrics and our uncertainty-aware metric. Furthermore, our uncertainty-aware evaluation reveals that selective invalidation of predictions can improve results on data with ambiguous content such as our benchmark and profit safety-oriented applications involving invalid inputs."
Visual Localization Using Semantic Segmentation and Depth Prediction,"In this paper, we propose a monocular visual localization pipeline leveraging semantic and depth cues. We apply semantic consistency evaluation to rank the image retrieval results and a practical clustering technique to reject estimation outliers. In addition, we demonstrate a substantial performance boost achieved with a combination of multiple feature extractors. Furthermore, by using depth prediction with a deep neural network, we show that a significant amount of falsely matched keypoints are identified and eliminated. The proposed pipeline outperforms most of the existing approaches at the Long-Term Visual Localization benchmark 2020."
Gleason Grading of Histology Prostate Images through Semantic Segmentation via Residual U-Net,"Worldwide, prostate cancer is one of the main cancers affecting men. The final diagnosis of prostate cancer is based on the visual detection of Gleason patterns in prostate biopsy by pathologists. Computer-aided-diagnosis systems allow to delineate and classify the cancerous patterns in the tissue via computer-vision algorithms in order to support the physicians' task. The methodological core of this work is a U-Net convolutional neural network for image segmentation modified with residual blocks able to segment cancerous tissue according to the full Gleason system. This model outperforms other well-known architectures, and reaches a pixel-level Cohen's quadratic Kappa of 0.52, at the level of previous image-level works in the literature, but providing also a detailed localisation of the patterns."
Real-time Semantic Segmentation via Spatial-detail Guided Context Propagation,"Nowadays, vision-based computing tasks play an important role in various real-world applications. However, many vision computing tasks, e.g. semantic segmentation, are usually computationally expensive, posing a challenge to the computing systems that are resource-constrained but require fast response speed. Therefore, it is valuable to develop accurate and real-time vision processing models that only require limited computational resources. To this end, we propose the Spatial-detail Guided Context Propagation Network (SGCPNet) for achieving real-time semantic segmentation. In SGCPNet, we propose the strategy of spatial-detail guided context propagation. It uses the spatial details of shallow layers to guide the propagation of the low-resolution global contexts, in which the lost spatial information can be effectively reconstructed. In this way, the need for maintaining high-resolution features along the network is freed, therefore largely improving the model efficiency. On the other hand, due to the effective reconstruction of spatial details, the segmentation accuracy can be still preserved. In the experiments, we validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed SGCPNet model. On the Citysacpes dataset, for example, our SGCPNet achieves 69.5% mIoU segmentation accuracy, while its speed reaches 178.5 FPS on 768x1536 images on a GeForce GTX 1080 Ti GPU card. In addition, SGCPNet is very lightweight and only contains 0.61 M parameters."
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation in Semantic Segmentation: a Review,"The aim of this paper is to give an overview of the recent advancements in the Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) of deep networks for semantic segmentation. This task is attracting a wide interest, since semantic segmentation models require a huge amount of labeled data and the lack of data fitting specific requirements is the main limitation in the deployment of these techniques. This problem has been recently explored and has rapidly grown with a large number of ad-hoc approaches. This motivates us to build a comprehensive overview of the proposed methodologies and to provide a clear categorization. In this paper, we start by introducing the problem, its formulation and the various scenarios that can be considered. Then, we introduce the different levels at which adaptation strategies may be applied: namely, at the input (image) level, at the internal features representation and at the output level. Furthermore, we present a detailed overview of the literature in the field, dividing previous methods based on the following (non mutually exclusive) categories: adversarial learning, generative-based, analysis of the classifier discrepancies, self-teaching, entropy minimization, curriculum learning and multi-task learning. Novel research directions are also briefly introduced to give a hint of interesting open problems in the field. Finally, a comparison of the performance of the various methods in the widely used autonomous driving scenario is presented."
Hierarchical Multi-Scale Attention for Semantic Segmentation,"Multi-scale inference is commonly used to improve the results of semantic segmentation. Multiple images scales are passed through a network and then the results are combined with averaging or max pooling. In this work, we present an attention-based approach to combining multi-scale predictions. We show that predictions at certain scales are better at resolving particular failures modes, and that the network learns to favor those scales for such cases in order to generate better predictions. Our attention mechanism is hierarchical, which enables it to be roughly 4x more memory efficient to train than other recent approaches. In addition to enabling faster training, this allows us to train with larger crop sizes which leads to greater model accuracy. We demonstrate the result of our method on two datasets: Cityscapes and Mapillary Vistas. For Cityscapes, which has a large number of weakly labelled images, we also leverage auto-labelling to improve generalization. Using our approach we achieve a new state-of-the-art results in both Mapillary (61.1 IOU val) and Cityscapes (85.1 IOU test)."
Unsupervised segmentation via semantic-apparent feature fusion,"Foreground segmentation is an essential task in the field of image understanding. Under unsupervised conditions, different images and instances always have variable expressions, which make it difficult to achieve stable segmentation performance based on fixed rules or single type of feature. In order to solve this problem, the research proposes an unsupervised foreground segmentation method based on semantic-apparent feature fusion (SAFF). Here, we found that key regions of foreground object can be accurately responded via semantic features, while apparent features (represented by saliency and edge) provide richer detailed expression. To combine the advantages of the two type of features, an encoding method for unary region features and binary context features is established, which realizes a comprehensive description of the two types of expressions. Then, a method for adaptive parameter learning is put forward to calculate the most suitable feature weights and generate foreground confidence score map. Furthermore, segmentation network is used to learn foreground common features from different instances. By fusing semantic and apparent features, as well as cascading the modules of intra-image adaptive feature weight learning and inter-image common feature learning, the research achieves performance that significantly exceeds baselines on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset."
Single-Stage Semantic Segmentation from Image Labels,"Recent years have seen a rapid growth in new approaches improving the accuracy of semantic segmentation in a weakly supervised setting, i.e. with only image-level labels available for training. However, this has come at the cost of increased model complexity and sophisticated multi-stage training procedures. This is in contrast to earlier work that used only a single stage - training one segmentation network on image labels - which was abandoned due to inferior segmentation accuracy. In this work, we first define three desirable properties of a weakly supervised method: local consistency, semantic fidelity, and completeness. Using these properties as guidelines, we then develop a segmentation-based network model and a self-supervised training scheme to train for semantic masks from image-level annotations in a single stage. We show that despite its simplicity, our method achieves results that are competitive with significantly more complex pipelines, substantially outperforming earlier single-stage methods."
Detection and Retrieval of Out-of-Distribution Objects in Semantic Segmentation,"When deploying deep learning technology in self-driving cars, deep neural networks are constantly exposed to domain shifts. These include, e.g., changes in weather conditions, time of day, and long-term temporal shift. In this work we utilize a deep neural network trained on the Cityscapes dataset containing urban street scenes and infer images from a different dataset, the A2D2 dataset, containing also countryside and highway images. We present a novel pipeline for semantic segmenation that detects out-of-distribution (OOD) segments by means of the deep neural network's prediction and performs image retrieval after feature extraction and dimensionality reduction on image patches. In our experiments we demonstrate that the deployed OOD approach is suitable for detecting out-of-distribution concepts. Furthermore, we evaluate the image patch retrieval qualitatively as well as quantitatively by means of the semi-compatible A2D2 ground truth and obtain mAP values of up to 52.2%."
Exploiting Multi-Layer Grid Maps for Surround-View Semantic Segmentation of Sparse LiDAR Data,"In this paper, we consider the transformation of laser range measurements into a top-view grid map representation to approach the task of LiDAR-only semantic segmentation. Since the recent publication of the SemanticKITTI data set, researchers are now able to study semantic segmentation of urban LiDAR sequences based on a reasonable amount of data. While other approaches propose to directly learn on the 3D point clouds, we are exploiting a grid map framework to extract relevant information and represent them by using multi-layer grid maps. This representation allows us to use well-studied deep learning architectures from the image domain to predict a dense semantic grid map using only the sparse input data of a single LiDAR scan. We compare single-layer and multi-layer approaches and demonstrate the benefit of a multi-layer grid map input. Since the grid map representation allows us to predict a dense, 360° semantic environment representation, we further develop a method to combine the semantic information from multiple scans and create dense ground truth grids. This method allows us to evaluate and compare the performance of our models not only based on grid cells with a detection, but on the full visible measurement range."
Super-Resolution Domain Adaptation Networks for Semantic Segmentation via Pixel and Output Level Aligning,"Recently, Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) has attracted increasing attention to address the domain shift problem in the semantic segmentation task. Although previous UDA methods have achieved promising performance, they still suffer from the distribution gaps between source and target domains, especially the resolution discrepany in the remote sensing images. To address this problem, this paper designs a novel end-to-end semantic segmentation network, namely Super-Resolution Domain Adaptation Network (SRDA-Net). SRDA-Net can simultaneously achieve the super-resolution task and the domain adaptation task, thus satisfying the requirement of semantic segmentation for remote sensing images which usually involve various resolution images. The proposed SRDA-Net includes three parts: a Super-Resolution and Segmentation (SRS) model which focuses on recovering high-resolution image and predicting segmentation map, a Pixel-level Domain Classifier (PDC) for determining which domain the pixel belongs to, and an Output-space Domain Classifier (ODC) for distinguishing which domain the pixel contribution is from. By jointly optimizing SRS with two classifiers, the proposed method can not only eliminates the resolution difference between source and target domains, but also improve the performance of the semantic segmentation task. Experimental results on two remote sensing datasets with different resolutions demonstrate that SRDA-Net performs favorably against some state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and visual quality. Code and models are available at https://github.com/tangzhenjie/SRDA-Net."
"DAugNet: Unsupervised, Multi-source, Multi-target, and Life-long Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation of Satellite Images","The domain adaptation of satellite images has recently gained an increasing attention to overcome the limited generalization abilities of machine learning models when segmenting large-scale satellite images. Most of the existing approaches seek for adapting the model from one domain to another. However, such single-source and single-target setting prevents the methods from being scalable solutions, since nowadays multiple source and target domains having different data distributions are usually available. Besides, the continuous proliferation of satellite images necessitates the classifiers to adapt to continuously increasing data. We propose a novel approach, coined DAugNet, for unsupervised, multi-source, multi-target, and life-long domain adaptation of satellite images. It consists of a classifier and a data augmentor. The data augmentor, which is a shallow network, is able to perform style transfer between multiple satellite images in an unsupervised manner, even when new data are added over the time. In each training iteration, it provides the classifier with diversified data, which makes the classifier robust to large data distribution difference between the domains. Our extensive experiments prove that DAugNet significantly better generalizes to new geographic locations than the existing approaches."
Class-Incremental Learning for Semantic Segmentation Re-Using Neither Old Data Nor Old Labels,"While neural networks trained for semantic segmentation are essential for perception in autonomous driving, most current algorithms assume a fixed number of classes, presenting a major limitation when developing new autonomous driving systems with the need of additional classes. In this paper we present a technique implementing class-incremental learning for semantic segmentation without using the labeled data the model was initially trained on. Previous approaches still either rely on labels for both old and new classes, or fail to properly distinguish between them. We show how to overcome these problems with a novel class-incremental learning technique, which nonetheless requires labels only for the new classes. Specifically, (i) we introduce a new loss function that neither relies on old data nor on old labels, (ii) we show how new classes can be integrated in a modular fashion into pretrained semantic segmentation models, and finally (iii) we re-implement previous approaches in a unified setting to compare them to ours. We evaluate our method on the Cityscapes dataset, where we exceed the mIoU performance of all baselines by 3.5% absolute reaching a result, which is only 2.2% absolute below the upper performance limit of single-stage training, relying on all data and labels simultaneously."
Probabilistic Semantic Segmentation Refinement by Monte Carlo Region Growing,"Semantic segmentation with fine-grained pixel-level accuracy is a fundamental component of a variety of computer vision applications. However, despite the large improvements provided by recent advances in the architectures of convolutional neural networks, segmentations provided by modern state-of-the-art methods still show limited boundary adherence. We introduce a fully unsupervised post-processing algorithm that exploits Monte Carlo sampling and pixel similarities to propagate high-confidence pixel labels into regions of low-confidence classification. Our algorithm, which we call probabilistic Region Growing Refinement (pRGR), is based on a rigorous mathematical foundation in which clusters are modelled as multivariate normally distributed sets of pixels. Exploiting concepts of Bayesian estimation and variance reduction techniques, pRGR performs multiple refinement iterations at varied receptive fields sizes, while updating cluster statistics to adapt to local image features. Experiments using multiple modern semantic segmentation networks and benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for the refinement of segmentation predictions at different levels of coarseness, as well as the suitability of the variance estimates obtained in the Monte Carlo iterations as uncertainty measures that are highly correlated with segmentation accuracy."
Progressive Adversarial Semantic Segmentation,"Medical image computing has advanced rapidly with the advent of deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks. Deep convolutional neural networks can perform exceedingly well given full supervision. However, the success of such fully-supervised models for various image analysis tasks (e.g., anatomy or lesion segmentation from medical images) is limited to the availability of massive amounts of labeled data. Given small sample sizes, such models are prohibitively data biased with large domain shift. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel end-to-end medical image segmentation model, namely Progressive Adversarial Semantic Segmentation (PASS), which can make improved segmentation predictions without requiring any domain-specific data during training time. Our extensive experimentation with 8 public diabetic retinopathy and chest X-ray datasets, confirms the effectiveness of PASS for accurate vascular and pulmonary segmentation, both for in-domain and cross-domain evaluations."
A Sim2Real Deep Learning Approach for the Transformation of Images from Multiple Vehicle-Mounted Cameras to a Semantically Segmented Image in Bird's Eye View,"Accurate environment perception is essential for automated driving. When using monocular cameras, the distance estimation of elements in the environment poses a major challenge. Distances can be more easily estimated when the camera perspective is transformed to a bird's eye view (BEV). For flat surfaces, Inverse Perspective Mapping (IPM) can accurately transform images to a BEV. Three-dimensional objects such as vehicles and vulnerable road users are distorted by this transformation making it difficult to estimate their position relative to the sensor. This paper describes a methodology to obtain a corrected 360° BEV image given images from multiple vehicle-mounted cameras. The corrected BEV image is segmented into semantic classes and includes a prediction of occluded areas. The neural network approach does not rely on manually labeled data, but is trained on a synthetic dataset in such a way that it generalizes well to real-world data. By using semantically segmented images as input, we reduce the reality gap between simulated and real-world data and are able to show that our method can be successfully applied in the real world. Extensive experiments conducted on the synthetic data demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to IPM. Source code and datasets are available at https://github.com/ika-rwth-aachen/Cam2BEV"
Scoring Root Necrosis in Cassava Using Semantic Segmentation,"Cassava a major food crop in many parts of Africa, has majorly been affected by Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD). The disease affects tuberous roots and presents symptoms that include a yellow/brown, dry, corky necrosis within the starch-bearing tissues. Cassava breeders currently depend on visual inspection to score necrosis in roots based on a qualitative score which is quite subjective. In this paper we present an approach to automate root necrosis scoring using deep convolutional neural networks with semantic segmentation. Our experiments show that the UNet model performs this task with high accuracy achieving a mean Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.90 on the test set. This method provides a means to use a quantitative measure for necrosis scoring on root cross-sections. This is done by segmentation and classifying the necrotized and non-necrotized pixels of cassava root cross-sections without any additional feature engineering."
How to Train Your Dragon: Tamed Warping Network for Semantic Video Segmentation,"Real-time semantic segmentation on high-resolution videos is challenging due to the strict requirements of speed. Recent approaches have utilized the inter-frame continuity to reduce redundant computation by warping the feature maps across adjacent frames, greatly speeding up the inference phase. However, their accuracy drops significantly owing to the imprecise motion estimation and error accumulation. In this paper, we propose to introduce a simple and effective correction stage right after the warping stage to form a framework named Tamed Warping Network (TWNet), aiming to improve the accuracy and robustness of warping-based models. The experimental results on the Cityscapes dataset show that with the correction, the accuracy (mIoU) significantly increases from 67.3% to 71.6%, and the speed edges down from 65.5 FPS to 61.8 FPS. For non-rigid categories such as ""human"" and ""object"", the improvements of IoU are even higher than 18 percentage points."
Improving Semantic Segmentation via Self-Training,"Deep learning usually achieves the best results with complete supervision. In the case of semantic segmentation, this means that large amounts of pixelwise annotations are required to learn accurate models. In this paper, we show that we can obtain state-of-the-art results using a semi-supervised approach, specifically a self-training paradigm. We first train a teacher model on labeled data, and then generate pseudo labels on a large set of unlabeled data. Our robust training framework can digest human-annotated and pseudo labels jointly and achieve top performances on Cityscapes, CamVid and KITTI datasets while requiring significantly less supervision. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of self-training on a challenging cross-domain generalization task, outperforming conventional finetuning method by a large margin. Lastly, to alleviate the computational burden caused by the large amount of pseudo labels, we propose a fast training schedule to accelerate the training of segmentation models by up to 2x without performance degradation."
Counting of Grapevine Berries in Images via Semantic Segmentation using Convolutional Neural Networks,"The extraction of phenotypic traits is often very time and labour intensive. Especially the investigation in viticulture is restricted to an on-site analysis due to the perennial nature of grapevine. Traditionally skilled experts examine small samples and extrapolate the results to a whole plot. Thereby different grapevine varieties and training systems, e.g. vertical shoot positioning (VSP) and semi minimal pruned hedges (SMPH) pose different challenges. In this paper we present an objective framework based on automatic image analysis which works on two different training systems. The images are collected semi automatic by a camera system which is installed in a modified grape harvester. The system produces overlapping images from the sides of the plants. Our framework uses a convolutional neural network to detect single berries in images by performing a semantic segmentation. Each berry is then counted with a connected component algorithm. We compare our results with the Mask-RCNN, a state-of-the-art network for instance segmentation and with a regression approach for counting. The experiments presented in this paper show that we are able to detect green berries in images despite of different training systems. We achieve an accuracy for the berry detection of 94.0% in the VSP and 85.6% in the SMPH."
Boosting Connectivity in Retinal Vessel Segmentation via a Recursive Semantics-Guided Network,"Many deep learning based methods have been proposed for retinal vessel segmentation, however few of them focus on the connectivity of segmented vessels, which is quite important for a practical computer-aided diagnosis system on retinal images. In this paper, we propose an efficient network to address this problem. A U-shape network is enhanced by introducing a semantics-guided module, which integrates the enriched semantics information to shallow layers for guiding the network to explore more powerful features. Besides, a recursive refinement iteratively applies the same network over the previous segmentation results for progressively boosting the performance while increasing no extra network parameters. The carefully designed recursive semantics-guided network has been extensively evaluated on several public datasets. Experimental results have shown the efficiency of the proposed method."
Distance Guided Channel Weighting for Semantic Segmentation,"Recent works have achieved great success in improving the performance of multiple computer vision tasks by capturing features with a high channel number utilizing deep neural networks. However, many channels of extracted features are not discriminative and contain a lot of redundant information. In this paper, we address above issue by introducing the Distance Guided Channel Weighting (DGCW) Module. The DGCW module is constructed in a pixel-wise context extraction manner, which enhances the discriminativeness of features by weighting different channels of each pixel's feature vector when modeling its relationship with other pixels. It can make full use of the high-discriminative information while ignore the low-discriminative information containing in feature maps, as well as capture the long-range dependencies. Furthermore, by incorporating the DGCW module with a baseline segmentation network, we propose the Distance Guided Channel Weighting Network (DGCWNet). We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of DGCWNet. In particular, it achieves 81.6% mIoU on Cityscapes with only fine annotated data for training, and also gains satisfactory performance on another two semantic segmentation datasets, i.e. Pascal Context and ADE20K. Code will be available soon at https://github.com/LanyunZhu/DGCWNet."
Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation in 3D Graph-Structured Point Clouds of Wild Scenes,"The deficiency of 3D segmentation labels is one of the main obstacles to effective point cloud segmentation, especially for scenes in the wild with varieties of different objects. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel deep graph convolutional network-based framework for large-scale semantic scene segmentation in point clouds with sole 2D supervision. Different with numerous preceding multi-view supervised approaches focusing on single object point clouds, we argue that 2D supervision is capable of providing sufficient guidance information for training 3D semantic segmentation models of natural scene point clouds while not explicitly capturing their inherent structures, even with only single view per training sample. Specifically, a Graph-based Pyramid Feature Network (GPFN) is designed to implicitly infer both global and local features of point sets and an Observability Network (OBSNet) is introduced to further solve object occlusion problem caused by complicated spatial relations of objects in 3D scenes. During the projection process, perspective rendering and semantic fusion modules are proposed to provide refined 2D supervision signals for training along with a 2D-3D joint optimization strategy. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our 2D supervised framework, which achieves comparable results with the state-of-the-art approaches trained with full 3D labels, for semantic point cloud segmentation on the popular SUNCG synthetic dataset and S3DIS real-world dataset."
DALES: A Large-scale Aerial LiDAR Data Set for Semantic Segmentation,"We present the Dayton Annotated LiDAR Earth Scan (DALES) data set, a new large-scale aerial LiDAR data set with over a half-billion hand-labeled points spanning 10 square kilometers of area and eight object categories. Large annotated point cloud data sets have become the standard for evaluating deep learning methods. However, most of the existing data sets focus on data collected from a mobile or terrestrial scanner with few focusing on aerial data. Point cloud data collected from an Aerial Laser Scanner (ALS) presents a new set of challenges and applications in areas such as 3D urban modeling and large-scale surveillance. DALES is the most extensive publicly available ALS data set with over 400 times the number of points and six times the resolution of other currently available annotated aerial point cloud data sets. This data set gives a critical number of expert verified hand-labeled points for the evaluation of new 3D deep learning algorithms, helping to expand the focus of current algorithms to aerial data. We describe the nature of our data, annotation workflow, and provide a benchmark of current state-of-the-art algorithm performance on the DALES data set."
Scan-based Semantic Segmentation of LiDAR Point Clouds: An Experimental Study,"Autonomous vehicles need to have a semantic understanding of the three-dimensional world around them in order to reason about their environment. State of the art methods use deep neural networks to predict semantic classes for each point in a LiDAR scan. A powerful and efficient way to process LiDAR measurements is to use two-dimensional, image-like projections. In this work, we perform a comprehensive experimental study of image-based semantic segmentation architectures for LiDAR point clouds. We demonstrate various techniques to boost the performance and to improve runtime as well as memory constraints.  First, we examine the effect of network size and suggest that much faster inference times can be achieved at a very low cost to accuracy. Next, we introduce an improved point cloud projection technique that does not suffer from systematic occlusions. We use a cyclic padding mechanism that provides context at the horizontal field-of-view boundaries. In a third part, we perform experiments with a soft Dice loss function that directly optimizes for the intersection-over-union metric. Finally, we propose a new kind of convolution layer with a reduced amount of weight-sharing along one of the two spatial dimensions, addressing the large difference in appearance along the vertical axis of a LiDAR scan. We propose a final set of the above methods with which the model achieves an increase of 3.2% in mIoU segmentation performance over the baseline while requiring only 42% of the original inference time."
Improved Noise and Attack Robustness for Semantic Segmentation by Using Multi-Task Training with Self-Supervised Depth Estimation,"While current approaches for neural network training often aim at improving performance, less focus is put on training methods aiming at robustness towards varying noise conditions or directed attacks by adversarial examples. In this paper, we propose to improve robustness by a multi-task training, which extends supervised semantic segmentation by a self-supervised monocular depth estimation on unlabeled videos. This additional task is only performed during training to improve the semantic segmentation model's robustness at test time under several input perturbations. Moreover, we even find that our joint training approach also improves the performance of the model on the original (supervised) semantic segmentation task. Our evaluation exhibits a particular novelty in that it allows to mutually compare the effect of input noises and adversarial attacks on the robustness of the semantic segmentation. We show the effectiveness of our method on the Cityscapes dataset, where our multi-task training approach consistently outperforms the single-task semantic segmentation baseline in terms of both robustness vs. noise and in terms of adversarial attacks, without the need for depth labels in training."
Multi-view Self-Constructing Graph Convolutional Networks with Adaptive Class Weighting Loss for Semantic Segmentation,"We propose a novel architecture called the Multi-view Self-Constructing Graph Convolutional Networks (MSCG-Net) for semantic segmentation. Building on the recently proposed Self-Constructing Graph (SCG) module, which makes use of learnable latent variables to self-construct the underlying graphs directly from the input features without relying on manually built prior knowledge graphs, we leverage multiple views in order to explicitly exploit the rotational invariance in airborne images. We further develop an adaptive class weighting loss to address the class imbalance. We demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed method on the Agriculture-Vision challenge dataset and our model achieves very competitive results (0.547 mIoU) with much fewer parameters and at a lower computational cost compared to related pure-CNN based work. Code will be available at: github.com/samleoqh/MSCG-Net"
Uncertainty-Aware Consistency Regularization for Cross-Domain Semantic Segmentation,"Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to adapt existing models of the source domain to a new target domain with only unlabeled data. Most existing methods suffer from noticeable negative transfer resulting from either the error-prone discriminator network or the unreasonable teacher model. Besides, the local regional consistency in UDA has been largely neglected, and only extracting the global-level pattern information is not powerful enough for feature alignment due to the abuse use of contexts. To this end, we propose an uncertainty-aware consistency regularization method for cross-domain semantic segmentation. Firstly, we introduce an uncertainty-guided consistency loss with a dynamic weighting scheme by exploiting the latent uncertainty information of the target samples. As such, more meaningful and reliable knowledge from the teacher model can be transferred to the student model. We further reveal the reason why the current consistency regularization is often unstable in minimizing the domain discrepancy. Besides, we design a ClassDrop mask generation algorithm to produce strong class-wise perturbations. Guided by this mask, we propose a ClassOut strategy to realize effective regional consistency in a fine-grained manner. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on four domain adaptation benchmarks, i.e., GTAV \rightarrow  Cityscapes and SYNTHIA \rightarrow  Cityscapes, Virtual KITTI \rightarrow KITTI and Cityscapes \rightarrow KITTI."
"Res-CR-Net, a residual network with a novel architecture optimized for the semantic segmentation of microscopy images","Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have been widely used to carry out segmentation tasks in both electron and light microscopy. Most DNNs developed for this purpose are based on some variation of the encoder-decoder type U-Net architecture, in combination with residual blocks to increase ease of training and resilience to gradient degradation. Here we introduce Res-CR-Net, a type of DNN that features residual blocks with either a bundle of separable atrous convolutions with different dilation rates or a convolutional LSTM. The number of filters used in each residual block and the number of blocks are the only hyperparameters that need to be modified in order to optimize the network training for a variety of different microscopy images."
Learning to Predict Context-adaptive Convolution for Semantic Segmentation,"Long-range contextual information is essential for achieving high-performance semantic segmentation. Previous feature re-weighting methods demonstrate that using global context for re-weighting feature channels can effectively improve the accuracy of semantic segmentation. However, the globally-sharing feature re-weighting vector might not be optimal for regions of different classes in the input image. In this paper, we propose a Context-adaptive Convolution Network (CaC-Net) to predict a spatially-varying feature weighting vector for each spatial location of the semantic feature maps. In CaC-Net, a set of context-adaptive convolution kernels are predicted from the global contextual information in a parameter-efficient manner. When used for convolution with the semantic feature maps, the predicted convolutional kernels can generate the spatially-varying feature weighting factors capturing both global and local contextual information. Comprehensive experimental results show that our CaC-Net achieves superior segmentation performance on three public datasets, PASCAL Context, PASCAL VOC 2012 and ADE20K."
Unsupervised Intra-domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation through Self-Supervision,"Convolutional neural network-based approaches have achieved remarkable progress in semantic segmentation. However, these approaches heavily rely on annotated data which are labor intensive. To cope with this limitation, automatically annotated data generated from graphic engines are used to train segmentation models. However, the models trained from synthetic data are difficult to transfer to real images. To tackle this issue, previous works have considered directly adapting models from the source data to the unlabeled target data (to reduce the inter-domain gap). Nonetheless, these techniques do not consider the large distribution gap among the target data itself (intra-domain gap). In this work, we propose a two-step self-supervised domain adaptation approach to minimize the inter-domain and intra-domain gap together. First, we conduct the inter-domain adaptation of the model; from this adaptation, we separate the target domain into an easy and hard split using an entropy-based ranking function. Finally, to decrease the intra-domain gap, we propose to employ a self-supervised adaptation technique from the easy to the hard split. Experimental results on numerous benchmark datasets highlight the effectiveness of our method against existing state-of-the-art approaches. The source code is available at https://github.com/feipan664/IntraDA.git."
Joint Semantic Segmentation and Boundary Detection using Iterative Pyramid Contexts,"In this paper, we present a joint multi-task learning framework for semantic segmentation and boundary detection. The critical component in the framework is the iterative pyramid context module (PCM), which couples two tasks and stores the shared latent semantics to interact between the two tasks. For semantic boundary detection, we propose the novel spatial gradient fusion to suppress nonsemantic edges. As semantic boundary detection is the dual task of semantic segmentation, we introduce a loss function with boundary consistency constraint to improve the boundary pixel accuracy for semantic segmentation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art works, not only in semantic segmentation but also in semantic boundary detection. In particular, a mean IoU score of 81:8% on Cityscapes test set is achieved without using coarse data or any external data for semantic segmentation. For semantic boundary detection, we improve over previous state-of-the-art works by 9.9% in terms of AP and 6:8% in terms of MF(ODS)."
StandardGAN: Multi-source Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation of Very High Resolution Satellite Images by Data Standardization,"Domain adaptation for semantic segmentation has recently been actively studied to increase the generalization capabilities of deep learning models. The vast majority of the domain adaptation methods tackle single-source case, where the model trained on a single source domain is adapted to a target domain. However, these methods have limited practical real world applications, since usually one has multiple source domains with different data distributions. In this work, we deal with the multi-source domain adaptation problem. Our method, namely StandardGAN, standardizes each source and target domains so that all the data have similar data distributions. We then use the standardized source domains to train a classifier and segment the standardized target domain. We conduct extensive experiments on two remote sensing data sets, in which the first one consists of multiple cities from a single country, and the other one contains multiple cities from different countries. Our experimental results show that the standardized data generated by StandardGAN allow the classifiers to generate significantly better segmentation."
FDA: Fourier Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation,"We describe a simple method for unsupervised domain adaptation, whereby the discrepancy between the source and target distributions is reduced by swapping the low-frequency spectrum of one with the other. We illustrate the method in semantic segmentation, where densely annotated images are aplenty in one domain (synthetic data), but difficult to obtain in another (real images). Current state-of-the-art methods are complex, some requiring adversarial optimization to render the backbone of a neural network invariant to the discrete domain selection variable. Our method does not require any training to perform the domain alignment, just a simple Fourier Transform and its inverse. Despite its simplicity, it achieves state-of-the-art performance in the current benchmarks, when integrated into a relatively standard semantic segmentation model. Our results indicate that even simple procedures can discount nuisance variability in the data that more sophisticated methods struggle to learn away."
Improving Semantic Segmentation through Spatio-Temporal Consistency Learned from Videos,"We leverage unsupervised learning of depth, egomotion, and camera intrinsics to improve the performance of single-image semantic segmentation, by enforcing 3D-geometric and temporal consistency of segmentation masks across video frames. The predicted depth, egomotion, and camera intrinsics are used to provide an additional supervision signal to the segmentation model, significantly enhancing its quality, or, alternatively, reducing the number of labels the segmentation model needs. Our experiments were performed on the ScanNet dataset."
Self-supervised Equivariant Attention Mechanism for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Image-level weakly supervised semantic segmentation is a challenging problem that has been deeply studied in recent years. Most of advanced solutions exploit class activation map (CAM). However, CAMs can hardly serve as the object mask due to the gap between full and weak supervisions. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised equivariant attention mechanism (SEAM) to discover additional supervision and narrow the gap. Our method is based on the observation that equivariance is an implicit constraint in fully supervised semantic segmentation, whose pixel-level labels take the same spatial transformation as the input images during data augmentation. However, this constraint is lost on the CAMs trained by image-level supervision. Therefore, we propose consistency regularization on predicted CAMs from various transformed images to provide self-supervision for network learning. Moreover, we propose a pixel correlation module (PCM), which exploits context appearance information and refines the prediction of current pixel by its similar neighbors, leading to further improvement on CAMs consistency. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset demonstrate our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods using the same level of supervision. The code is released online."
Spatial Information Guided Convolution for Real-Time RGBD Semantic Segmentation,"3D spatial information is known to be beneficial to the semantic segmentation task. Most existing methods take 3D spatial data as an additional input, leading to a two-stream segmentation network that processes RGB and 3D spatial information separately. This solution greatly increases the inference time and severely limits its scope for real-time applications. To solve this problem, we propose Spatial information guided Convolution (S-Conv), which allows efficient RGB feature and 3D spatial information integration. S-Conv is competent to infer the sampling offset of the convolution kernel guided by the 3D spatial information, helping the convolutional layer adjust the receptive field and adapt to geometric transformations. S-Conv also incorporates geometric information into the feature learning process by generating spatially adaptive convolutional weights. The capability of perceiving geometry is largely enhanced without much affecting the amount of parameters and computational cost. We further embed S-Conv into a semantic segmentation network, called Spatial information Guided convolutional Network (SGNet), resulting in real-time inference and state-of-the-art performance on NYUDv2 and SUNRGBD datasets."
RSS-Net: Weakly-Supervised Multi-Class Semantic Segmentation with FMCW Radar,"This paper presents an efficient annotation procedure and an application thereof to end-to-end, rich semantic segmentation of the sensed environment using FMCW scanning radar. We advocate radar over the traditional sensors used for this task as it operates at longer ranges and is substantially more robust to adverse weather and illumination conditions. We avoid laborious manual labelling by exploiting the largest radar-focused urban autonomy dataset collected to date, correlating radar scans with RGB cameras and LiDAR sensors, for which semantic segmentation is an already consolidated procedure. The training procedure leverages a state-of-the-art natural image segmentation system which is publicly available and as such, in contrast to previous approaches, allows for the production of copious labels for the radar stream by incorporating four camera and two LiDAR streams. Additionally, the losses are computed taking into account labels to the radar sensor horizon by accumulating LiDAR returns along a pose-chain ahead and behind of the current vehicle position. Finally, we present the network with multi-channel radar scan inputs in order to deal with ephemeral and dynamic scene objects."
Objectness-Aware Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation,"Few-shot semantic segmentation models aim to segment images after learning from only a few annotated examples. A key challenge for them is how to avoid overfitting because limited training data is available. While prior works usually limited the overall model capacity to alleviate overfitting, this hampers segmentation accuracy. We demonstrate how to increase overall model capacity to achieve improved performance, by introducing objectness, which is class-agnostic and so not prone to overfitting, for complementary use with class-specific features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the versatility of our simple approach of introducing objectness for different base architectures that rely on different data loaders and training schedules (DENet, PFENet) as well as with different backbone models (ResNet-50, ResNet-101 and HRNetV2-W48). Given only one annotated example of an unseen category, experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-art methods with respect to mIoU by at least 4.7% and 1.5% on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i respectively."
Semantic Segmentation of highly class imbalanced fully labelled 3D volumetric biomedical images and unsupervised Domain Adaptation of the pre-trained Segmentation Network to segment another fully unlabelled Biomedical 3D Image stack,"The goal of our work is to perform pixel label semantic segmentation on 3D biomedical volumetric data. Manual annotation is always difficult for a large bio-medical dataset. So, we consider two cases where one dataset is fully labeled and the other dataset is assumed to be fully unlabelled. We first perform Semantic Segmentation on the fully labeled isotropic biomedical source data (FIBSEM) and try to incorporate the the trained model for segmenting the target unlabelled dataset(SNEMI3D)which shares some similarities with the source dataset in the context of different types of cellular bodies and other cellular components. Although, the cellular components vary in size and shape. So in this paper, we have proposed a novel approach in the context of unsupervised domain adaptation while classifying each pixel of the target volumetric data into cell boundary and cell body. Also, we have proposed a novel approach to giving non-uniform weights to different pixels in the training images while performing the pixel-level semantic segmentation in the presence of the corresponding pixel-wise label map along with the training original images in the source domain. We have used the Entropy Map or a Distance Transform matrix retrieved from the given ground truth label map which has helped to overcome the class imbalance problem in the medical image data where the cell boundaries are extremely thin and hence, extremely prone to be misclassified as non-boundary."
BiSeNet V2: Bilateral Network with Guided Aggregation for Real-time Semantic Segmentation,"The low-level details and high-level semantics are both essential to the semantic segmentation task. However, to speed up the model inference, current approaches almost always sacrifice the low-level details, which leads to a considerable accuracy decrease. We propose to treat these spatial details and categorical semantics separately to achieve high accuracy and high efficiency for realtime semantic segmentation. To this end, we propose an efficient and effective architecture with a good trade-off between speed and accuracy, termed Bilateral Segmentation Network (BiSeNet V2). This architecture involves: (i) a Detail Branch, with wide channels and shallow layers to capture low-level details and generate high-resolution feature representation; (ii) a Semantic Branch, with narrow channels and deep layers to obtain high-level semantic context. The Semantic Branch is lightweight due to reducing the channel capacity and a fast-downsampling strategy. Furthermore, we design a Guided Aggregation Layer to enhance mutual connections and fuse both types of feature representation. Besides, a booster training strategy is designed to improve the segmentation performance without any extra inference cost. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that the proposed architecture performs favourably against a few state-of-the-art real-time semantic segmentation approaches. Specifically, for a 2,048x1,024 input, we achieve 72.6% Mean IoU on the Cityscapes test set with a speed of 156 FPS on one NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti card, which is significantly faster than existing methods, yet we achieve better segmentation accuracy."
Adversarial-Prediction Guided Multi-task Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation of Electron Microscopy Images,"Semantic segmentation is an essential step for electron microscopy (EM) image analysis. Although supervised models have achieved significant progress, the need for labor intensive pixel-wise annotation is a major limitation. To complicate matters further, supervised learning models may not generalize well on a novel dataset due to domain shift. In this study, we introduce an adversarial-prediction guided multi-task network to learn the adaptation of a well-trained model for use on a novel unlabeled target domain. Since no label is available on target domain, we learn an encoding representation not only for the supervised segmentation on source domain but also for unsupervised reconstruction of the target data. To improve the discriminative ability with geometrical cues, we further guide the representation learning by multi-level adversarial learning in semantic prediction space. Comparisons and ablation study on public benchmark demonstrated state-of-the-art performance and effectiveness of our approach."
Temporally Distributed Networks for Fast Video Semantic Segmentation,"We present TDNet, a temporally distributed network designed for fast and accurate video semantic segmentation. We observe that features extracted from a certain high-level layer of a deep CNN can be approximated by composing features extracted from several shallower sub-networks. Leveraging the inherent temporal continuity in videos, we distribute these sub-networks over sequential frames. Therefore, at each time step, we only need to perform a lightweight computation to extract a sub-features group from a single sub-network. The full features used for segmentation are then recomposed by application of a novel attention propagation module that compensates for geometry deformation between frames. A grouped knowledge distillation loss is also introduced to further improve the representation power at both full and sub-feature levels. Experiments on Cityscapes, CamVid, and NYUD-v2 demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with significantly faster speed and lower latency."
Semantic Segmentation of Underwater Imagery: Dataset and Benchmark,"In this paper, we present the first large-scale dataset for semantic Segmentation of Underwater IMagery (SUIM). It contains over 1500 images with pixel annotations for eight object categories: fish (vertebrates), reefs (invertebrates), aquatic plants, wrecks/ruins, human divers, robots, and sea-floor. The images have been rigorously collected during oceanic explorations and human-robot collaborative experiments, and annotated by human participants. We also present a benchmark evaluation of state-of-the-art semantic segmentation approaches based on standard performance metrics. In addition, we present SUIM-Net, a fully-convolutional encoder-decoder model that balances the trade-off between performance and computational efficiency. It offers competitive performance while ensuring fast end-to-end inference, which is essential for its use in the autonomy pipeline of visually-guided underwater robots. In particular, we demonstrate its usability benefits for visual servoing, saliency prediction, and detailed scene understanding. With a variety of use cases, the proposed model and benchmark dataset open up promising opportunities for future research in underwater robot vision."
Handling new target classes in semantic segmentation with domain adaptation,"In this work, we define and address a novel domain adaptation (DA) problem in semantic scene segmentation, where the target domain not only exhibits a data distribution shift w.r.t. the source domain, but also includes novel classes that do not exist in the latter. Different to ""open-set"" and ""universal domain adaptation"", which both regard all objects from new classes as ""unknown"", we aim at explicit test-time prediction for these new classes. To reach this goal, we propose a framework that leverages domain adaptation and zero-shot learning techniques to enable ""boundless"" adaptation in the target domain. It relies on a novel architecture, along with a dedicated learning scheme, to bridge the source-target domain gap while learning how to map new classes' labels to relevant visual representations. The performance is further improved using self-training on target-domain pseudo-labels. For validation, we consider different domain adaptation set-ups, namely synthetic-2-real, country-2-country and dataset-2-dataset. Our framework outperforms the baselines by significant margins, setting competitive standards on all benchmarks for the new task. Code and models are available at https://github.com/valeoai/buda."
Alleviating Semantic-level Shift: A Semi-supervised Domain Adaptation Method for Semantic Segmentation,"Learning segmentation from synthetic data and adapting to real data can significantly relieve human efforts in labelling pixel-level masks. A key challenge of this task is how to alleviate the data distribution discrepancy between the source and target domains, i.e. reducing domain shift. The common approach to this problem is to minimize the discrepancy between feature distributions from different domains through adversarial training. However, directly aligning the feature distribution globally cannot guarantee consistency from a local view (i.e. semantic-level), which prevents certain semantic knowledge learned on the source domain from being applied to the target domain. To tackle this issue, we propose a semi-supervised approach named Alleviating Semantic-level Shift (ASS), which can successfully promote the distribution consistency from both global and local views. Specifically, leveraging a small number of labeled data from the target domain, we directly extract semantic-level feature representations from both the source and the target domains by averaging the features corresponding to same categories advised by pixel-level masks. We then feed the produced features to the discriminator to conduct semantic-level adversarial learning, which collaborates with the adversarial learning from the global view to better alleviate the domain shift. We apply our ASS to two domain adaptation tasks, from GTA5 to Cityscapes and from Synthia to Cityscapes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that: (1) ASS can significantly outperform the current unsupervised state-of-the-arts by employing a small number of annotated samples from the target domain; (2) ASS can beat the oracle model trained on the whole target dataset by over 3 points by augmenting the synthetic source data with annotated samples from the target domain without suffering from the prevalent problem of overfitting to the source domain."
"Real-Time Semantic Segmentation via Auto Depth, Downsampling Joint Decision and Feature Aggregation","To satisfy the stringent requirements on computational resources in the field of real-time semantic segmentation, most approaches focus on the hand-crafted design of light-weight segmentation networks. Recently, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has been used to search for the optimal building blocks of networks automatically, but the network depth, downsampling strategy, and feature aggregation way are still set in advance by trial and error. In this paper, we propose a joint search framework, called AutoRTNet, to automate the design of these strategies. Specifically, we propose hyper-cells to jointly decide the network depth and downsampling strategy, and an aggregation cell to achieve automatic multi-scale feature aggregation. Experimental results show that AutoRTNet achieves 73.9% mIoU on the Cityscapes test set and 110.0 FPS on an NVIDIA TitanXP GPU card with 768x1536 input images."
PolarNet: An Improved Grid Representation for Online LiDAR Point Clouds Semantic Segmentation,"The need for fine-grained perception in autonomous driving systems has resulted in recently increased research on online semantic segmentation of single-scan LiDAR. Despite the emerging datasets and technological advancements, it remains challenging due to three reasons: (1) the need for near-real-time latency with limited hardware; (2) uneven or even long-tailed distribution of LiDAR points across space; and (3) an increasing number of extremely fine-grained semantic classes. In an attempt to jointly tackle all the aforementioned challenges, we propose a new LiDAR-specific, nearest-neighbor-free segmentation algorithm - PolarNet. Instead of using common spherical or bird's-eye-view projection, our polar bird's-eye-view representation balances the points across grid cells in a polar coordinate system, indirectly aligning a segmentation network's attention with the long-tailed distribution of the points along the radial axis. We find that our encoding scheme greatly increases the mIoU in three drastically different segmentation datasets of real urban LiDAR single scans while retaining near real-time throughput."
Scene Context Based Semantic Segmentation for 3D LiDAR Data in Dynamic Scene,"We propose a graph neural network(GNN) based method to incorporate scene context for the semantic segmentation of 3D LiDAR data. The problem is defined as building a graph to represent the topology of a center segment with its neighborhoods, then inferring the segment label. The node of graph is generated from the segment on range image, which is suitable for both sparse and dense point cloud. Edge weights that evaluate the correlations of center node and its neighborhoods are automatically encoded by a neural network, therefore the number of neighbor nodes is no longer a sensitive parameter. A system consists of segment generation, graph building, edge weight estimation, node updating, and node prediction is designed. Quantitative evaluation on a dataset of dynamic scene shows that our method has better performance than unary CNN with 8% improvement, as well as normal GNN with 17% improvement."
3D-MPA: Multi Proposal Aggregation for 3D Semantic Instance Segmentation,"We present 3D-MPA, a method for instance segmentation on 3D point clouds. Given an input point cloud, we propose an object-centric approach where each point votes for its object center. We sample object proposals from the predicted object centers. Then, we learn proposal features from grouped point features that voted for the same object center. A graph convolutional network introduces inter-proposal relations, providing higher-level feature learning in addition to the lower-level point features. Each proposal comprises a semantic label, a set of associated points over which we define a foreground-background mask, an objectness score and aggregation features. Previous works usually perform non-maximum-suppression (NMS) over proposals to obtain the final object detections or semantic instances. However, NMS can discard potentially correct predictions. Instead, our approach keeps all proposals and groups them together based on the learned aggregation features. We show that grouping proposals improves over NMS and outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on the tasks of 3D object detection and semantic instance segmentation on the ScanNetV2 benchmark and the S3DIS dataset."
TapLab: A Fast Framework for Semantic Video Segmentation Tapping into Compressed-Domain Knowledge,"Real-time semantic video segmentation is a challenging task due to the strict requirements of inference speed. Recent approaches mainly devote great efforts to reducing the model size for high efficiency. In this paper, we rethink this problem from a different viewpoint: using knowledge contained in compressed videos. We propose a simple and effective framework, dubbed TapLab, to tap into resources from the compressed domain. Specifically, we design a fast feature warping module using motion vectors for acceleration. To reduce the noise introduced by motion vectors, we design a residual-guided correction module and a residual-guided frame selection module using residuals. TapLab significantly reduces redundant computations of the state-of-the-art fast semantic image segmentation models, running 3 to 10 times faster with controllable accuracy degradation. The experimental results show that TapLab achieves 70.6% mIoU on the Cityscapes dataset at 99.8 FPS with a single GPU card for the 1024x2048 videos. A high-speed version even reaches the speed of 160+ FPS. Codes will be available soon at https://github.com/Sixkplus/TapLab."
Multi-Path Region Mining For Weakly Supervised 3D Semantic Segmentation on Point Clouds,"Point clouds provide intrinsic geometric information and surface context for scene understanding. Existing methods for point cloud segmentation require a large amount of fully labeled data. Using advanced depth sensors, collection of large scale 3D dataset is no longer a cumbersome process. However, manually producing point-level label on the large scale dataset is time and labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised approach to predict point-level results using weak labels on 3D point clouds. We introduce our multi-path region mining module to generate pseudo point-level label from a classification network trained with weak labels. It mines the localization cues for each class from various aspects of the network feature using different attention modules. Then, we use the point-level pseudo labels to train a point cloud segmentation network in a fully supervised manner. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method that uses cloud-level weak labels on raw 3D space to train a point cloud semantic segmentation network. In our setting, the 3D weak labels only indicate the classes that appeared in our input sample. We discuss both scene- and subcloud-level weakly labels on raw 3D point cloud data and perform in-depth experiments on them. On ScanNet dataset, our result trained with subcloud-level labels is compatible with some fully supervised methods."
Generalizable Model-agnostic Semantic Segmentation via Target-specific Normalization,"Semantic segmentation in a supervised learning manner has achieved significant progress in recent years. However, its performance usually drops dramatically due to the data-distribution discrepancy between seen and unseen domains when we directly deploy the trained model to segment the images of unseen (or new coming) domains. To this end, we propose a novel domain generalization framework for the generalizable semantic segmentation task, which enhances the generalization ability of the model from two different views, including the training paradigm and the test strategy. Concretely, we exploit the model-agnostic learning to simulate the domain shift problem, which deals with the domain generalization from the training scheme perspective. Besides, considering the data-distribution discrepancy between seen source and unseen target domains, we develop the target-specific normalization scheme to enhance the generalization ability. Furthermore, when images come one by one in the test stage, we design the image-based memory bank (Image Bank in short) with style-based selection policy to select similar images to obtain more accurate statistics of normalization. Extensive experiments highlight that the proposed method produces state-of-the-art performance for the domain generalization of semantic segmentation on multiple benchmark segmentation datasets, i.e., Cityscapes, Mapillary."
DCNAS: Densely Connected Neural Architecture Search for Semantic Image Segmentation,"Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has shown great potentials in automatically designing scalable network architectures for dense image predictions. However, existing NAS algorithms usually compromise on restricted search space and search on proxy task to meet the achievable computational demands. To allow as wide as possible network architectures and avoid the gap between target and proxy dataset, we propose a Densely Connected NAS (DCNAS) framework, which directly searches the optimal network structures for the multi-scale representations of visual information, over a large-scale target dataset. Specifically, by connecting cells with each other using learnable weights, we introduce a densely connected search space to cover an abundance of mainstream network designs. Moreover, by combining both path-level and channel-level sampling strategies, we design a fusion module to reduce the memory consumption of ample search space. We demonstrate that the architecture obtained from our DCNAS algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performances on public semantic image segmentation benchmarks, including 84.3% on Cityscapes, and 86.9% on PASCAL VOC 2012. We also retain leading performances when evaluating the architecture on the more challenging ADE20K and Pascal Context dataset."
A New Multiple Max-pooling Integration Module and Cross Multiscale Deconvolution Network Based on Image Semantic Segmentation,"To better retain the deep features of an image and solve the sparsity problem of the end-to-end segmentation model, we propose a new deep convolutional network model for medical image pixel segmentation, called MC-Net. The core of this network model consists of four parts, namely, an encoder network, a multiple max-pooling integration module, a cross multiscale deconvolution decoder network and a pixel-level classification layer. In the network structure of the encoder, we use multiscale convolution instead of the traditional single-channel convolution. The multiple max-pooling integration module first integrates the output features of each submodule of the encoder network and reduces the number of parameters by convolution using a kernel size of 1. At the same time, each max-pooling layer (the pooling size of each layer is different) is spliced after each convolution to achieve the translation invariance of the feature maps of each submodule. We use the output feature maps from the multiple max-pooling integration module as the input of the decoder network; the multiscale convolution of each submodule in the decoder network is cross-fused with the feature maps generated by the corresponding multiscale convolution in the encoder network. Using the above feature map processing methods solves the sparsity problem after the max-pooling layer-generating matrix and enhances the robustness of the classification. We compare our proposed model with the well-known Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation (FCNs), DecovNet, PSPNet, U-net, SgeNet and other state-of-the-art segmentation networks such as HyperDenseNet, MS-Dual, Espnetv2, Denseaspp using one binary Kaggle 2018 data science bowl dataset and two multiclass dataset and obtain encouraging experimental results."
Learning Dynamic Routing for Semantic Segmentation,"Recently, numerous handcrafted and searched networks have been applied for semantic segmentation. However, previous works intend to handle inputs with various scales in pre-defined static architectures, such as FCN, U-Net, and DeepLab series. This paper studies a conceptually new method to alleviate the scale variance in semantic representation, named dynamic routing. The proposed framework generates data-dependent routes, adapting to the scale distribution of each image. To this end, a differentiable gating function, called soft conditional gate, is proposed to select scale transform paths on the fly. In addition, the computational cost can be further reduced in an end-to-end manner by giving budget constraints to the gating function. We further relax the network level routing space to support multi-path propagations and skip-connections in each forward, bringing substantial network capacity. To demonstrate the superiority of the dynamic property, we compare with several static architectures, which can be modeled as special cases in the routing space. Extensive experiments are conducted on Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC 2012 to illustrate the effectiveness of the dynamic framework. Code is available at https://github.com/yanwei-li/DynamicRouting."
Spatial Pyramid Based Graph Reasoning for Semantic Segmentation,"The convolution operation suffers from a limited receptive filed, while global modeling is fundamental to dense prediction tasks, such as semantic segmentation. In this paper, we apply graph convolution into the semantic segmentation task and propose an improved Laplacian. The graph reasoning is directly performed in the original feature space organized as a spatial pyramid. Different from existing methods, our Laplacian is data-dependent and we introduce an attention diagonal matrix to learn a better distance metric. It gets rid of projecting and re-projecting processes, which makes our proposed method a light-weight module that can be easily plugged into current computer vision architectures. More importantly, performing graph reasoning directly in the feature space retains spatial relationships and makes spatial pyramid possible to explore multiple long-range contextual patterns from different scales. Experiments on Cityscapes, COCO Stuff, PASCAL Context and PASCAL VOC demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods on semantic segmentation. We achieve comparable performance with advantages in computational and memory overhead."
BiCANet: Bi-directional Contextual Aggregating Network for Image Semantic Segmentation,"Exploring contextual information in convolution neural networks (CNNs) has gained substantial attention in recent years for semantic segmentation. This paper introduces a Bi-directional Contextual Aggregating Network, called BiCANet, for semantic segmentation. Unlike previous approaches that encode context in feature space, BiCANet aggregates contextual cues from a categorical perspective, which is mainly consist of three parts: contextual condensed projection block (CCPB), bi-directional context interaction block (BCIB), and muti-scale contextual fusion block (MCFB). More specifically, CCPB learns a category-based mapping through a split-transform-merge architecture, which condenses contextual cues with different receptive fields from intermediate layer. BCIB, on the other hand, employs dense skipped-connections to enhance the class-level context exchanging. Finally, MCFB integrates multi-scale contextual cues by investigating short- and long-ranged spatial dependencies. To evaluate BiCANet, we have conducted extensive experiments on three semantic segmentation datasets: PASCAL VOC 2012, Cityscapes, and ADE20K. The experimental results demonstrate that BiCANet outperforms recent state-of-the-art networks without any postprocess techniques. Particularly, BiCANet achieves the mIoU score of 86.7%, 82.4% and 38.66% on PASCAL VOC 2012, Cityscapes and ADE20K testset, respectively."
Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation with Cross-Consistency Training,"In this paper, we present a novel cross-consistency based semi-supervised approach for semantic segmentation. Consistency training has proven to be a powerful semi-supervised learning framework for leveraging unlabeled data under the cluster assumption, in which the decision boundary should lie in low-density regions. In this work, we first observe that for semantic segmentation, the low-density regions are more apparent within the hidden representations than within the inputs. We thus propose cross-consistency training, where an invariance of the predictions is enforced over different perturbations applied to the outputs of the encoder. Concretely, a shared encoder and a main decoder are trained in a supervised manner using the available labeled examples. To leverage the unlabeled examples, we enforce a consistency between the main decoder predictions and those of the auxiliary decoders, taking as inputs different perturbed versions of the encoder's output, and consequently, improving the encoder's representations. The proposed method is simple and can easily be extended to use additional training signal, such as image-level labels or pixel-level labels across different domains. We perform an ablation study to tease apart the effectiveness of each component, and conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results in several datasets."
Real-Time High-Performance Semantic Image Segmentation of Urban Street Scenes,"Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) have recently shown outstanding performance in semantic image segmentation. However, state-of-the-art DCNN-based semantic segmentation methods usually suffer from high computational complexity due to the use of complex network architectures. This greatly limits their applications in the real-world scenarios that require real-time processing. In this paper, we propose a real-time high-performance DCNN-based method for robust semantic segmentation of urban street scenes, which achieves a good trade-off between accuracy and speed. Specifically, a Lightweight Baseline Network with Atrous convolution and Attention (LBN-AA) is firstly used as our baseline network to efficiently obtain dense feature maps. Then, the Distinctive Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (DASPP), which exploits the different sizes of pooling operations to encode the rich and distinctive semantic information, is developed to detect objects at multiple scales. Meanwhile, a Spatial detail-Preserving Network (SPN) with shallow convolutional layers is designed to generate high-resolution feature maps preserving the detailed spatial information. Finally, a simple but practical Feature Fusion Network (FFN) is used to effectively combine both shallow and deep features from the semantic branch (DASPP) and the spatial branch (SPN), respectively. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method respectively achieves the accuracy of 73.6% and 68.0% mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) with the inference speed of 51.0 fps and 39.3 fps on the challenging Cityscapes and CamVid test datasets (by only using a single NVIDIA TITAN X card). This demonstrates that the proposed method offers excellent performance at the real-time speed for semantic segmentation of urban street scenes."
Synthesize then Compare: Detecting Failures and Anomalies for Semantic Segmentation,"The ability to detect failures and anomalies are fundamental requirements for building reliable systems for computer vision applications, especially safety-critical applications of semantic segmentation, such as autonomous driving and medical image analysis. In this paper, we systematically study failure and anomaly detection for semantic segmentation and propose a unified framework, consisting of two modules, to address these two related problems. The first module is an image synthesis module, which generates a synthesized image from a segmentation layout map, and the second is a comparison module, which computes the difference between the synthesized image and the input image. We validate our framework on three challenging datasets and improve the state-of-the-arts by large margins, \emph{i.e.}, 6% AUPR-Error on Cityscapes, 7% Pearson correlation on pancreatic tumor segmentation in MSD and 20% AUPR on StreetHazards anomaly segmentation."
Toronto-3D: A Large-scale Mobile LiDAR Dataset for Semantic Segmentation of Urban Roadways,"Semantic segmentation of large-scale outdoor point clouds is essential for urban scene understanding in various applications, especially autonomous driving and urban high-definition (HD) mapping. With rapid developments of mobile laser scanning (MLS) systems, massive point clouds are available for scene understanding, but publicly accessible large-scale labeled datasets, which are essential for developing learning-based methods, are still limited. This paper introduces Toronto-3D, a large-scale urban outdoor point cloud dataset acquired by a MLS system in Toronto, Canada for semantic segmentation. This dataset covers approximately 1 km of point clouds and consists of about 78.3 million points with 8 labeled object classes. Baseline experiments for semantic segmentation were conducted and the results confirmed the capability of this dataset to train deep learning models effectively. Toronto-3D is released to encourage new research, and the labels will be improved and updated with feedback from the research community."
Differential Treatment for Stuff and Things: A Simple Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Method for Semantic Segmentation,"We consider the problem of unsupervised domain adaptation for semantic segmentation by easing the domain shift between the source domain (synthetic data) and the target domain (real data) in this work. State-of-the-art approaches prove that performing semantic-level alignment is helpful in tackling the domain shift issue. Based on the observation that stuff categories usually share similar appearances across images of different domains while things (i.e. object instances) have much larger differences, we propose to improve the semantic-level alignment with different strategies for stuff regions and for things: 1) for the stuff categories, we generate feature representation for each class and conduct the alignment operation from the target domain to the source domain; 2) for the thing categories, we generate feature representation for each individual instance and encourage the instance in the target domain to align with the most similar one in the source domain. In this way, the individual differences within thing categories will also be considered to alleviate over-alignment. In addition to our proposed method, we further reveal the reason why the current adversarial loss is often unstable in minimizing the distribution discrepancy and show that our method can help ease this issue by minimizing the most similar stuff and instance features between the source and the target domains. We conduct extensive experiments in two unsupervised domain adaptation tasks, i.e. GTA5 to Cityscapes and SYNTHIA to Cityscapes, and achieve the new state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy."
An End-to-end Framework For Low-Resolution Remote Sensing Semantic Segmentation,"High-resolution images for remote sensing applications are often not affordable or accessible, especially when in need of a wide temporal span of recordings. Given the easy access to low-resolution (LR) images from satellites, many remote sensing works rely on this type of data. The problem is that LR images are not appropriate for semantic segmentation, due to the need for high-quality data for accurate pixel prediction for this task. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end framework that unites a super-resolution and a semantic segmentation module in order to produce accurate thematic maps from LR inputs. It allows the semantic segmentation network to conduct the reconstruction process, modifying the input image with helpful textures. We evaluate the framework with three remote sensing datasets. The results show that the framework is capable of achieving a semantic segmentation performance close to native high-resolution data, while also surpassing the performance of a network trained with LR inputs."
Dynamic Divide-and-Conquer Adversarial Training for Robust Semantic Segmentation,"Adversarial training is promising for improving robustness of deep neural networks towards adversarial perturbations, especially on the classification task. The effect of this type of training on semantic segmentation, contrarily, just commences. We make the initial attempt to explore the defense strategy on semantic segmentation by formulating a general adversarial training procedure that can perform decently on both adversarial and clean samples. We propose a dynamic divide-and-conquer adversarial training (DDC-AT) strategy to enhance the defense effect, by setting additional branches in the target model during training, and dealing with pixels with diverse properties towards adversarial perturbation. Our dynamical division mechanism divides pixels into multiple branches automatically. Note all these additional branches can be abandoned during inference and thus leave no extra parameter and computation cost. Extensive experiments with various segmentation models are conducted on PASCAL VOC 2012 and Cityscapes datasets, in which DDC-AT yields satisfying performance under both white- and black-box attack."
Fusion-Aware Point Convolution for Online Semantic 3D Scene Segmentation,"Online semantic 3D segmentation in company with real-time RGB-D reconstruction poses special challenges such as how to perform 3D convolution directly over the progressively fused 3D geometric data, and how to smartly fuse information from frame to frame. We propose a novel fusion-aware 3D point convolution which operates directly on the geometric surface being reconstructed and exploits effectively the inter-frame correlation for high quality 3D feature learning. This is enabled by a dedicated dynamic data structure which organizes the online acquired point cloud with global-local trees. Globally, we compile the online reconstructed 3D points into an incrementally growing coordinate interval tree, enabling fast point insertion and neighborhood query. Locally, we maintain the neighborhood information for each point using an octree whose construction benefits from the fast query of the global tree.Both levels of trees update dynamically and help the 3D convolution effectively exploits the temporal coherence for effective information fusion across RGB-D frames."
EDC3: Ensemble of Deep-Classifiers using Class-specific Copula functions to Improve Semantic Image Segmentation,"In the literature, many fusion techniques are registered for the segmentation of images, but they primarily focus on observed output or belief score or probability score of the output classes. In the present work, we have utilized inter source statistical dependency among different classifiers for ensembling of different deep learning techniques for semantic segmentation of images. For this purpose, in the present work, a class-wise Copula-based ensembling method is newly proposed for solving the multi-class segmentation problem. Experimentally, it is observed that the performance has improved more for semantic image segmentation using the proposed class-specific Copula function than the traditionally used single Copula function for the problem. The performance is also compared with three state-of-the-art ensembling methods."
Bi-Directional Attention for Joint Instance and Semantic Segmentation in Point Clouds,"Instance segmentation in point clouds is one of the most fine-grained ways to understand the 3D scene. Due to its close relationship to semantic segmentation, many works approach these two tasks simultaneously and leverage the benefits of multi-task learning. However, most of them only considered simple strategies such as element-wise feature fusion, which may not lead to mutual promotion. In this work, we build a Bi-Directional Attention module on backbone neural networks for 3D point cloud perception, which uses similarity matrix measured from features for one task to help aggregate non-local information for the other task, avoiding the potential feature exclusion and task conflict. From comprehensive experiments and ablation studies on the S3DIS dataset and the PartNet dataset, the superiority of our method is verified. Moreover, the mechanism of how bi-directional attention module helps joint instance and semantic segmentation is also analyzed."
HeatNet: Bridging the Day-Night Domain Gap in Semantic Segmentation with Thermal Images,"The majority of learning-based semantic segmentation methods are optimized for daytime scenarios and favorable lighting conditions. Real-world driving scenarios, however, entail adverse environmental conditions such as nighttime illumination or glare which remain a challenge for existing approaches. In this work, we propose a multimodal semantic segmentation model that can be applied during daytime and nighttime. To this end, besides RGB images, we leverage thermal images, making our network significantly more robust. We avoid the expensive annotation of nighttime images by leveraging an existing daytime RGB-dataset and propose a teacher-student training approach that transfers the dataset's knowledge to the nighttime domain. We further employ a domain adaptation method to align the learned feature spaces across the domains and propose a novel two-stage training scheme. Furthermore, due to a lack of thermal data for autonomous driving, we present a new dataset comprising over 20,000 time-synchronized and aligned RGB-thermal image pairs. In this context, we also present a novel target-less calibration method that allows for automatic robust extrinsic and intrinsic thermal camera calibration. Among others, we employ our new dataset to show state-of-the-art results for nighttime semantic segmentation."
Label-Driven Reconstruction for Domain Adaptation in Semantic Segmentation,"Unsupervised domain adaptation enables to alleviate the need for pixel-wise annotation in the semantic segmentation. One of the most common strategies is to translate images from the source domain to the target domain and then align their marginal distributions in the feature space using adversarial learning. However, source-to-target translation enlarges the bias in translated images and introduces extra computations, owing to the dominant data size of the source domain. Furthermore, consistency of the joint distribution in source and target domains cannot be guaranteed through global feature alignment. Here, we present an innovative framework, designed to mitigate the image translation bias and align cross-domain features with the same category. This is achieved by 1) performing the target-to-source translation and 2) reconstructing both source and target images from their predicted labels. Extensive experiments on adapting from synthetic to real urban scene understanding demonstrate that our framework competes favorably against existing state-of-the-art methods."
FusionLane: Multi-Sensor Fusion for Lane Marking Semantic Segmentation Using Deep Neural Networks,"It is a crucial step to achieve effective semantic segmentation of lane marking during the construction of the lane level high-precision map. In recent years, many image semantic segmentation methods have been proposed. These methods mainly focus on the image from camera, due to the limitation of the sensor itself, the accurate three-dimensional spatial position of the lane marking cannot be obtained, so the demand for the lane level high-precision map construction cannot be met. This paper proposes a lane marking semantic segmentation method based on LIDAR and camera fusion deep neural network. Different from other methods, in order to obtain accurate position information of the segmentation results, the semantic segmentation object of this paper is a bird's eye view converted from a LIDAR points cloud instead of an image captured by a camera. This method first uses the deeplabv3+ [\ref{ref:1}] network to segment the image captured by the camera, and the segmentation result is merged with the point clouds collected by the LIDAR as the input of the proposed network. In this neural network, we also add a long short-term memory (LSTM) structure to assist the network for semantic segmentation of lane markings by using the the time series information. The experiments on more than 14,000 image datasets which we have manually labeled and expanded have shown the proposed method has better performance on the semantic segmentation of the points cloud bird's eye view. Therefore, the automation of high-precision map construction can be significantly improved. Our code is available at https://github.com/rolandying/FusionLane."
Context-Aware Domain Adaptation in Semantic Segmentation,"In this paper, we consider the problem of unsupervised domain adaptation in the semantic segmentation. There are two primary issues in this field, i.e., what and how to transfer domain knowledge across two domains. Existing methods mainly focus on adapting domain-invariant features (what to transfer) through adversarial learning (how to transfer). Context dependency is essential for semantic segmentation, however, its transferability is still not well understood. Furthermore, how to transfer contextual information across two domains remains unexplored. Motivated by this, we propose a cross-attention mechanism based on self-attention to capture context dependencies between two domains and adapt transferable context. To achieve this goal, we design two cross-domain attention modules to adapt context dependencies from both spatial and channel views. Specifically, the spatial attention module captures local feature dependencies between each position in the source and target image. The channel attention module models semantic dependencies between each pair of cross-domain channel maps. To adapt context dependencies, we further selectively aggregate the context information from two domains. The superiority of our method over existing state-of-the-art methods is empirically proved on ""GTA5 to Cityscapes"" and ""SYNTHIA to Cityscapes""."
FarSee-Net: Real-Time Semantic Segmentation by Efficient Multi-scale Context Aggregation and Feature Space Super-resolution,"Real-time semantic segmentation is desirable in many robotic applications with limited computation resources. One challenge of semantic segmentation is to deal with the object scale variations and leverage the context. How to perform multi-scale context aggregation within limited computation budget is important. In this paper, firstly, we introduce a novel and efficient module called Cascaded Factorized Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (CF-ASPP). It is a lightweight cascaded structure for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to efficiently leverage context information. On the other hand, for runtime efficiency, state-of-the-art methods will quickly decrease the spatial size of the inputs or feature maps in the early network stages. The final high-resolution result is usually obtained by non-parametric up-sampling operation (e.g. bilinear interpolation). Differently, we rethink this pipeline and treat it as a super-resolution process. We use optimized super-resolution operation in the up-sampling step and improve the accuracy, especially in sub-sampled input image scenario for real-time applications. By fusing the above two improvements, our methods provide better latency-accuracy trade-off than the other state-of-the-art methods. In particular, we achieve 68.4% mIoU at 84 fps on the Cityscapes test set with a single Nivida Titan X (Maxwell) GPU card. The proposed module can be plugged into any feature extraction CNN and benefits from the CNN structure development."
Rectifying Pseudo Label Learning via Uncertainty Estimation for Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation,"This paper focuses on the unsupervised domain adaptation of transferring the knowledge from the source domain to the target domain in the context of semantic segmentation. Existing approaches usually regard the pseudo label as the ground truth to fully exploit the unlabeled target-domain data. Yet the pseudo labels of the target-domain data are usually predicted by the model trained on the source domain. Thus, the generated labels inevitably contain the incorrect prediction due to the discrepancy between the training domain and the test domain, which could be transferred to the final adapted model and largely compromises the training process. To overcome the problem, this paper proposes to explicitly estimate the prediction uncertainty during training to rectify the pseudo label learning for unsupervised semantic segmentation adaptation. Given the input image, the model outputs the semantic segmentation prediction as well as the uncertainty of the prediction. Specifically, we model the uncertainty via the prediction variance and involve the uncertainty into the optimization objective. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we evaluate the proposed method on two prevalent synthetic-to-real semantic segmentation benchmarks, i.e., GTA5 -> Cityscapes and SYNTHIA -> Cityscapes, as well as one cross-city benchmark, i.e., Cityscapes -> Oxford RobotCar. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that the proposed approach (1) dynamically sets different confidence thresholds according to the prediction variance, (2) rectifies the learning from noisy pseudo labels, and (3) achieves significant improvements over the conventional pseudo label learning and yields competitive performance on all three benchmarks."
"SalsaNext: Fast, Uncertainty-aware Semantic Segmentation of LiDAR Point Clouds for Autonomous Driving","In this paper, we introduce SalsaNext for the uncertainty-aware semantic segmentation of a full 3D LiDAR point cloud in real-time. SalsaNext is the next version of SalsaNet [1] which has an encoder-decoder architecture where the encoder unit has a set of ResNet blocks and the decoder part combines upsampled features from the residual blocks. In contrast to SalsaNet, we introduce a new context module, replace the ResNet encoder blocks with a new residual dilated convolution stack with gradually increasing receptive fields and add the pixel-shuffle layer in the decoder. Additionally, we switch from stride convolution to average pooling and also apply central dropout treatment. To directly optimize the Jaccard index, we further combine the weighted cross-entropy loss with Lovasz-Softmax loss [2]. We finally inject a Bayesian treatment to compute the epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties for each point in the cloud. We provide a thorough quantitative evaluation on the Semantic-KITTI dataset [3], which demonstrates that the proposed SalsaNext outperforms other state-of-the-art semantic segmentation networks and ranks first on the Semantic-KITTI leaderboard. We also release our source code https://github.com/TiagoCortinhal/SalsaNext."
LiDARNet: A Boundary-Aware Domain Adaptation Model for Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation,"We present a boundary-aware domain adaptation model for LiDAR scan full-scene semantic segmentation (LiDARNet). Our model can extract both the domain private features and the domain shared features with a two-branch structure. We embedded Gated-SCNN into the segmentor component of LiDARNet to learn boundary information while learning to predict full-scene semantic segmentation labels. Moreover, we further reduce the domain gap by inducing the model to learn a mapping between two domains using the domain shared and private features. Additionally, we introduce a new dataset (SemanticUSL\footnote{The access address of SemanticUSL:\url{https://unmannedlab.github.io/research/SemanticUSL}}) for domain adaptation for LiDAR point cloud semantic segmentation. The dataset has the same data format and ontology as SemanticKITTI. We conducted experiments on real-world datasets SemanticKITTI, SemanticPOSS, and SemanticUSL, which have differences in channel distributions, reflectivity distributions, diversity of scenes, and sensors setup. Using our approach, we can get a single projection-based LiDAR full-scene semantic segmentation model working on both domains. Our model can keep almost the same performance on the source domain after adaptation and get an 8\%-22\% mIoU performance increase in the target domain."
Learning Texture Invariant Representation for Domain Adaptation of Semantic Segmentation,"Since annotating pixel-level labels for semantic segmentation is laborious, leveraging synthetic data is an attractive solution. However, due to the domain gap between synthetic domain and real domain, it is challenging for a model trained with synthetic data to generalize to real data. In this paper, considering the fundamental difference between the two domains as the texture, we propose a method to adapt to the texture of the target domain. First, we diversity the texture of synthetic images using a style transfer algorithm. The various textures of generated images prevent a segmentation model from overfitting to one specific (synthetic) texture. Then, we fine-tune the model with self-training to get direct supervision of the target texture. Our results achieve state-of-the-art performance and we analyze the properties of the model trained on the stylized dataset with extensive experiments."
GSANet: Semantic Segmentation with Global and Selective Attention,"This paper proposes a novel deep learning architecture for semantic segmentation. The proposed Global and Selective Attention Network (GSANet) features Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) with a novel sparsemax global attention and a novel selective attention that deploys a condensation and diffusion mechanism to aggregate the multi-scale contextual information from the extracted deep features. A selective attention decoder is also proposed to process the GSA-ASPP outputs for optimizing the softmax volume. We are the first to benchmark the performance of semantic segmentation networks with the low-complexity feature extraction network (FXN) MobileNetEdge, that is optimized for low latency on edge devices. We show that GSANet can result in more accurate segmentation with MobileNetEdge, as well as with strong FXNs, such as Xception. GSANet improves the state-of-art semantic segmentation accuracy on both the ADE20k and the Cityscapes datasets."
"SIP-SegNet: A Deep Convolutional Encoder-Decoder Network for Joint Semantic Segmentation and Extraction of Sclera, Iris and Pupil based on Periocular Region Suppression","The current developments in the field of machine vision have opened new vistas towards deploying multimodal biometric recognition systems in various real-world applications. These systems have the ability to deal with the limitations of unimodal biometric systems which are vulnerable to spoofing, noise, non-universality and intra-class variations. In addition, the ocular traits among various biometric traits are preferably used in these recognition systems. Such systems possess high distinctiveness, permanence, and performance while, technologies based on other biometric traits (fingerprints, voice etc.) can be easily compromised. This work presents a novel deep learning framework called SIP-SegNet, which performs the joint semantic segmentation of ocular traits (sclera, iris and pupil) in unconstrained scenarios with greater accuracy. The acquired images under these scenarios exhibit purkinje reflexes, specular reflections, eye gaze, off-angle shots, low resolution, and various occlusions particularly by eyelids and eyelashes. To address these issues, SIP-SegNet begins with denoising the pristine image using denoising convolutional neural network (DnCNN), followed by reflection removal and image enhancement based on contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE). Our proposed framework then extracts the periocular information using adaptive thresholding and employs the fuzzy filtering technique to suppress this information. Finally, the semantic segmentation of sclera, iris and pupil is achieved using the densely connected fully convolutional encoder-decoder network. We used five CASIA datasets to evaluate the performance of SIP-SegNet based on various evaluation metrics. The simulation results validate the optimal segmentation of the proposed SIP-SegNet, with the mean f1 scores of 93.35, 95.11 and 96.69 for the sclera, iris and pupil classes respectively."
Firearm Detection and Segmentation Using an Ensemble of Semantic Neural Networks,"In recent years we have seen an upsurge in terror attacks around the world. Such attacks usually happen in public places with large crowds to cause the most damage possible and get the most attention. Even though surveillance cameras are assumed to be a powerful tool, their effect in preventing crime is far from clear due to either limitation in the ability of humans to vigilantly monitor video surveillance or for the simple reason that they are operating passively. In this paper, we present a weapon detection system based on an ensemble of semantic Convolutional Neural Networks that decomposes the problem of detecting and locating a weapon into a set of smaller problems concerned with the individual component parts of a weapon. This approach has computational and practical advantages: a set of simpler neural networks dedicated to specific tasks requires less computational resources and can be trained in parallel; the overall output of the system given by the aggregation of the outputs of individual networks can be tuned by a user to trade-off false positives and false negatives; finally, according to ensemble theory, the output of the overall system will be robust and reliable even in the presence of weak individual models. We evaluated our system running simulations aimed at assessing the accuracy of individual networks and the whole system. The results on synthetic data and real-world data are promising, and they suggest that our approach may have advantages compared to the monolithic approach based on a single deep convolutional neural network."
SketchGNN: Semantic Sketch Segmentation with Graph Neural Networks,"We introduce SketchGNN, a convolutional graph neural network for semantic segmentation and labeling of freehand vector sketches. We treat an input stroke-based sketch as a graph, with nodes representing the sampled points along input strokes and edges encoding the stroke structure information. To predict the per-node labels, our SketchGNN uses graph convolution and a static-dynamic branching network architecture to extract the features at three levels, i.e., point-level, stroke-level, and sketch-level. SketchGNN significantly improves the accuracy of the state-of-the-art methods for semantic sketch segmentation (by 11.2% in the pixel-based metric and 18.2% in the component-based metric over a large-scale challenging SPG dataset) and has magnitudes fewer parameters than both image-based and sequence-based methods."
3DCFS: Fast and Robust Joint 3D Semantic-Instance Segmentation via Coupled Feature Selection,"We propose a novel fast and robust 3D point clouds segmentation framework via coupled feature selection, named 3DCFS, that jointly performs semantic and instance segmentation. Inspired by the human scene perception process, we design a novel coupled feature selection module, named CFSM, that adaptively selects and fuses the reciprocal semantic and instance features from two tasks in a coupled manner. To further boost the performance of the instance segmentation task in our 3DCFS, we investigate a loss function that helps the model learn to balance the magnitudes of the output embedding dimensions during training, which makes calculating the Euclidean distance more reliable and enhances the generalizability of the model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our 3DCFS outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets in terms of accuracy, speed and computational cost."
Attention-guided Chained Context Aggregation for Semantic Segmentation,"The way features propagate in Fully Convolutional Networks is of momentous importance to capture multi-scale contexts for obtaining precise segmentation masks. This paper proposes a novel series-parallel hybrid paradigm called the Chained Context Aggregation Module (CAM) to diversify feature propagation. CAM gains features of various spatial scales through chain-connected ladder-style information flows and fuses them in a two-stage process, namely pre-fusion and re-fusion. The serial flow continuously increases receptive fields of output neurons and those in parallel encode different region-based contexts. Each information flow is a shallow encoder-decoder with appropriate down-sampling scales to sufficiently capture contextual information. We further adopt an attention model in CAM to guide feature re-fusion. Based on these developments, we construct the Chained Context Aggregation Network (CANet), which employs an asymmetric decoder to recover precise spatial details of prediction maps. We conduct extensive experiments on six challenging datasets, including Pascal VOC 2012, Pascal Context, Cityscapes, CamVid, SUN-RGBD and GATECH. Results evidence that CANet achieves state-of-the-art performance."
Weak Supervision in Convolutional Neural Network for Semantic Segmentation of Diffuse Lung Diseases Using Partially Annotated Dataset,"Computer-aided diagnosis system for diffuse lung diseases (DLDs) is necessary for the objective assessment of the lung diseases. In this paper, we develop semantic segmentation model for 5 kinds of DLDs. DLDs considered in this work are consolidation, ground glass opacity, honeycombing, emphysema, and normal. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is one of the most promising technique for semantic segmentation among machine learning algorithms. While creating annotated dataset for semantic segmentation is laborious and time consuming, creating partially annotated dataset, in which only one chosen class is annotated for each image, is easier since annotators only need to focus on one class at a time during the annotation task. In this paper, we propose a new weak supervision technique that effectively utilizes partially annotated dataset. The experiments using partially annotated dataset composed 372 CT images demonstrated that our proposed technique significantly improved segmentation accuracy."
Towards Interpretable Semantic Segmentation via Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping,"Convolutional neural networks have become state-of-the-art in a wide range of image recognition tasks. The interpretation of their predictions, however, is an active area of research. Whereas various interpretation methods have been suggested for image classification, the interpretation of image segmentation still remains largely unexplored. To that end, we propose SEG-GRAD-CAM, a gradient-based method for interpreting semantic segmentation. Our method is an extension of the widely-used Grad-CAM method, applied locally to produce heatmaps showing the relevance of individual pixels for semantic segmentation."
Efficient Semantic Video Segmentation with Per-frame Inference,"For semantic segmentation, most existing real-time deep models trained with each frame independently may produce inconsistent results for a video sequence. Advanced methods take into considerations the correlations in the video sequence, e.g., by propagating the results to the neighboring frames using optical flow, or extracting the frame representations with other frames, which may lead to inaccurate results or unbalanced latency. In this work, we process efficient semantic video segmentation in a per-frame fashion during the inference process. Different from previous per-frame models, we explicitly consider the temporal consistency among frames as extra constraints during the training process and embed the temporal consistency into the segmentation network. Therefore, in the inference process, we can process each frame independently with no latency, and improve the temporal consistency with no extra computational cost and post-processing. We employ compact models for real-time execution. To narrow the performance gap between compact models and large models, new knowledge distillation methods are designed. Our results outperform previous keyframe based methods with a better trade-off between the accuracy and the inference speed on popular benchmarks, including the Cityscapes and Camvid. The temporal consistency is also improved compared with corresponding baselines which are trained with each frame independently. Code is available at: https://tinyurl.com/segment-video"
3D-MiniNet: Learning a 2D Representation from Point Clouds for Fast and Efficient 3D LIDAR Semantic Segmentation,"LIDAR semantic segmentation, which assigns a semantic label to each 3D point measured by the LIDAR, is becoming an essential task for many robotic applications such as autonomous driving. Fast and efficient semantic segmentation methods are needed to match the strong computational and temporal restrictions of many of these real-world applications.  This work presents 3D-MiniNet, a novel approach for LIDAR semantic segmentation that combines 3D and 2D learning layers. It first learns a 2D representation from the raw points through a novel projection which extracts local and global information from the 3D data. This representation is fed to an efficient 2D Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCNN) that produces a 2D semantic segmentation. These 2D semantic labels are re-projected back to the 3D space and enhanced through a post-processing module. The main novelty in our strategy relies on the projection learning module. Our detailed ablation study shows how each component contributes to the final performance of 3D-MiniNet. We validate our approach on well known public benchmarks (SemanticKITTI and KITTI), where 3D-MiniNet gets state-of-the-art results while being faster and more parameter-efficient than previous methods."
Fully-automated Body Composition Analysis in Routine CT Imaging Using 3D Semantic Segmentation Convolutional Neural Networks,"Body tissue composition is a long-known biomarker with high diagnostic and prognostic value in cardiovascular, oncological and orthopaedic diseases, but also in rehabilitation medicine or drug dosage. In this study, the aim was to develop a fully automated, reproducible and quantitative 3D volumetry of body tissue composition from standard CT examinations of the abdomen in order to be able to offer such valuable biomarkers as part of routine clinical imaging. Therefore an in-house dataset of 40 CTs for training and 10 CTs for testing were fully annotated on every fifth axial slice with five different semantic body regions: abdominal cavity, bones, muscle, subcutaneous tissue, and thoracic cavity. Multi-resolution U-Net 3D neural networks were employed for segmenting these body regions, followed by subclassifying adipose tissue and muscle using known hounsfield unit limits. The Sørensen Dice scores averaged over all semantic regions was 0.9553 and the intra-class correlation coefficients for subclassified tissues were above 0.99. Our results show that fully-automated body composition analysis on routine CT imaging can provide stable biomarkers across the whole abdomen and not just on L3 slices, which is historically the reference location for analysing body composition in the clinical routine."
Real-time Fusion Network for RGB-D Semantic Segmentation Incorporating Unexpected Obstacle Detection for Road-driving Images,"Semantic segmentation has made striking progress due to the success of deep convolutional neural networks. Considering the demands of autonomous driving, real-time semantic segmentation has become a research hotspot these years. However, few real-time RGB-D fusion semantic segmentation studies are carried out despite readily accessible depth information nowadays. In this paper, we propose a real-time fusion semantic segmentation network termed RFNet that effectively exploits complementary cross-modal information. Building on an efficient network architecture, RFNet is capable of running swiftly, which satisfies autonomous vehicles applications. Multi-dataset training is leveraged to incorporate unexpected small obstacle detection, enriching the recognizable classes required to face unforeseen hazards in the real world. A comprehensive set of experiments demonstrates the effectiveness of our framework. On Cityscapes, Our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art semantic segmenters, with excellent accuracy and 22Hz inference speed at the full 2048x1024 resolution, outperforming most existing RGB-D networks."
Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation of Satellite Images for Land Cover Mapping -- Challenges and Opportunities,"Fully automatic large-scale land cover mapping belongs to the core challenges addressed by the remote sensing community. Usually, the basis of this task is formed by (supervised) machine learning models. However, in spite of recent growth in the availability of satellite observations, accurate training data remains comparably scarce. On the other hand, numerous global land cover products exist and can be accessed often free-of-charge. Unfortunately, these maps are typically of a much lower resolution than modern day satellite imagery. Besides, they always come with a significant amount of noise, as they cannot be considered ground truth, but are products of previous (semi-)automatic prediction tasks. Therefore, this paper seeks to make a case for the application of weakly supervised learning strategies to get the most out of available data sources and achieve progress in high-resolution large-scale land cover mapping. Challenges and opportunities are discussed based on the SEN12MS dataset, for which also some baseline results are shown. These baselines indicate that there is still a lot of potential for dedicated approaches designed to deal with remote sensing-specific forms of weak supervision."
Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation by Iterative Affinity Learning,"Weakly-supervised semantic segmentation is a challenging task as no pixel-wise label information is provided for training. Recent methods have exploited classification networks to localize objects by selecting regions with strong response. While such response map provides sparse information, however, there exist strong pairwise relations between pixels in natural images, which can be utilized to propagate the sparse map to a much denser one. In this paper, we propose an iterative algorithm to learn such pairwise relations, which consists of two branches, a unary segmentation network which learns the label probabilities for each pixel, and a pairwise affinity network which learns affinity matrix and refines the probability map generated from the unary network. The refined results by the pairwise network are then used as supervision to train the unary network, and the procedures are conducted iteratively to obtain better segmentation progressively. To learn reliable pixel affinity without accurate annotation, we also propose to mine confident regions. We show that iteratively training this framework is equivalent to optimizing an energy function with convergence to a local minimum. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and COCO datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods."
Block Annotation: Better Image Annotation for Semantic Segmentation with Sub-Image Decomposition,"Image datasets with high-quality pixel-level annotations are valuable for semantic segmentation: labelling every pixel in an image ensures that rare classes and small objects are annotated. However, full-image annotations are expensive, with experts spending up to 90 minutes per image. We propose block sub-image annotation as a replacement for full-image annotation. Despite the attention cost of frequent task switching, we find that block annotations can be crowdsourced at higher quality compared to full-image annotation with equal monetary cost using existing annotation tools developed for full-image annotation. Surprisingly, we find that 50% pixels annotated with blocks allows semantic segmentation to achieve equivalent performance to 100% pixels annotated. Furthermore, as little as 12% of pixels annotated allows performance as high as 98% of the performance with dense annotation. In weakly-supervised settings, block annotation outperforms existing methods by 3-4% (absolute) given equivalent annotation time. To recover the necessary global structure for applications such as characterizing spatial context and affordance relationships, we propose an effective method to inpaint block-annotated images with high-quality labels without additional human effort. As such, fewer annotations can also be used for these applications compared to full-image annotation."
Combining Visual and Textual Features for Semantic Segmentation of Historical Newspapers,"The massive amounts of digitized historical documents acquired over the last decades naturally lend themselves to automatic processing and exploration. Research work seeking to automatically process facsimiles and extract information thereby are multiplying with, as a first essential step, document layout analysis. If the identification and categorization of segments of interest in document images have seen significant progress over the last years thanks to deep learning techniques, many challenges remain with, among others, the use of finer-grained segmentation typologies and the consideration of complex, heterogeneous documents such as historical newspapers. Besides, most approaches consider visual features only, ignoring textual signal. In this context, we introduce a multimodal approach for the semantic segmentation of historical newspapers that combines visual and textual features. Based on a series of experiments on diachronic Swiss and Luxembourgish newspapers, we investigate, among others, the predictive power of visual and textual features and their capacity to generalize across time and sources. Results show consistent improvement of multimodal models in comparison to a strong visual baseline, as well as better robustness to high material variance."
End-to-end semantic segmentation of personalized deep brain structures for non-invasive brain stimulation,"Electro-stimulation or modulation of deep brain regions is commonly used in clinical procedures for the treatment of several nervous system disorders. In particular, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is widely used as an affordable clinical application that is applied through electrodes attached to the scalp. However, it is difficult to determine the amount and distribution of the electric field (EF) in the different brain regions due to anatomical complexity and high inter-subject variability. Personalized tDCS is an emerging clinical procedure that is used to tolerate electrode montage for accurate targeting. This procedure is guided by computational head models generated from anatomical images such as MRI. Distribution of the EF in segmented head models can be calculated through simulation studies. Therefore, fast, accurate, and feasible segmentation of different brain structures would lead to a better adjustment for customized tDCS studies. In this study, a single-encoder multi-decoders convolutional neural network is proposed for deep brain segmentation. The proposed architecture is trained to segment seven deep brain structures using T1-weighted MRI. Network generated models are compared with a reference model constructed using a semi-automatic method, and it presents a high matching especially in Thalamus (Dice Coefficient (DC) = 94.70%), Caudate (DC = 91.98%) and Putamen (DC = 90.31%) structures. Electric field distribution during tDCS in generated and reference models matched well each other, suggesting its potential usefulness in clinical practice."
Edge-Gated CNNs for Volumetric Semantic Segmentation of Medical Images,"Textures and edges contribute different information to image recognition. Edges and boundaries encode shape information, while textures manifest the appearance of regions. Despite the success of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in computer vision and medical image analysis applications, predominantly only texture abstractions are learned, which often leads to imprecise boundary delineations. In medical imaging, expert manual segmentation often relies on organ boundaries; for example, to manually segment a liver, a medical practitioner usually identifies edges first and subsequently fills in the segmentation mask. Motivated by these observations, we propose a plug-and-play module, dubbed Edge-Gated CNNs (EG-CNNs), that can be used with existing encoder-decoder architectures to process both edge and texture information. The EG-CNN learns to emphasize the edges in the encoder, to predict crisp boundaries by an auxiliary edge supervision, and to fuse its output with the original CNN output. We evaluate the effectiveness of the EG-CNN with various mainstream CNNs on two publicly available datasets, BraTS 19 and KiTS 19 for brain tumor and kidney semantic segmentation. We demonstrate how the addition of EG-CNN consistently improves segmentation accuracy and generalization performance."
Universal Semantic Segmentation for Fisheye Urban Driving Images,"Semantic segmentation is a critical method in the field of autonomous driving. When performing semantic image segmentation, a wider field of view (FoV) helps to obtain more information about the surrounding environment, making automatic driving safer and more reliable, which could be offered by fisheye cameras. However, large public fisheye datasets are not available, and the fisheye images captured by the fisheye camera with large FoV comes with large distortion, so commonly-used semantic segmentation model cannot be directly utilized. In this paper, a seven degrees of freedom (DoF) augmentation method is proposed to transform rectilinear image to fisheye image in a more comprehensive way. In the training process, rectilinear images are transformed into fisheye images in seven DoF, which simulates the fisheye images taken by cameras of different positions, orientations and focal lengths. The result shows that training with the seven-DoF augmentation can improve the model's accuracy and robustness against different distorted fisheye data. This seven-DoF augmentation provides a universal semantic segmentation solution for fisheye cameras in different autonomous driving applications. Also, we provide specific parameter settings of the augmentation for autonomous driving. At last, we tested our universal semantic segmentation model on real fisheye images and obtained satisfactory results. The code and configurations are released at https://github.com/Yaozhuwa/FisheyeSeg."
SideInfNet: A Deep Neural Network for Semi-Automatic Semantic Segmentation with Side Information,"Fully-automatic execution is the ultimate goal for many Computer Vision applications. However, this objective is not always realistic in tasks associated with high failure costs, such as medical applications. For these tasks, semi-automatic methods allowing minimal effort from users to guide computer algorithms are often preferred due to desirable accuracy and performance. Inspired by the practicality and applicability of the semi-automatic approach, this paper proposes a novel deep neural network architecture, namely SideInfNet that effectively integrates features learnt from images with side information extracted from user annotations. To evaluate our method, we applied the proposed network to three semantic segmentation tasks and conducted extensive experiments on benchmark datasets. Experimental results and comparison with prior work have verified the superiority of our model, suggesting the generality and effectiveness of the model in semi-automatic semantic segmentation."
RGB-based Semantic Segmentation Using Self-Supervised Depth Pre-Training,"Although well-known large-scale datasets, such as ImageNet, have driven image understanding forward, most of these datasets require extensive manual annotation and are thus not easily scalable. This limits the advancement of image understanding techniques. The impact of these large-scale datasets can be observed in almost every vision task and technique in the form of pre-training for initialization. In this work, we propose an easily scalable and self-supervised technique that can be used to pre-train any semantic RGB segmentation method. In particular, our pre-training approach makes use of automatically generated labels that can be obtained using depth sensors. These labels, denoted by HN-labels, represent different height and normal patches, which allow mining of local semantic information that is useful in the task of semantic RGB segmentation. We show how our proposed self-supervised pre-training with HN-labels can be used to replace ImageNet pre-training, while using 25x less images and without requiring any manual labeling. We pre-train a semantic segmentation network with our HN-labels, which resembles our final task more than pre-training on a less related task, e.g. classification with ImageNet. We evaluate on two datasets (NYUv2 and CamVid), and we show how the similarity in tasks is advantageous not only in speeding up the pre-training process, but also in achieving better final semantic segmentation accuracy than ImageNet pre-training"
Modeling the Background for Incremental Learning in Semantic Segmentation,"Despite their effectiveness in a wide range of tasks, deep architectures suffer from some important limitations. In particular, they are vulnerable to catastrophic forgetting, i.e. they perform poorly when they are required to update their model as new classes are available but the original training set is not retained. This paper addresses this problem in the context of semantic segmentation. Current strategies fail on this task because they do not consider a peculiar aspect of semantic segmentation: since each training step provides annotation only for a subset of all possible classes, pixels of the background class (i.e. pixels that do not belong to any other classes) exhibit a semantic distribution shift. In this work we revisit classical incremental learning methods, proposing a new distillation-based framework which explicitly accounts for this shift. Furthermore, we introduce a novel strategy to initialize classifier's parameters, thus preventing biased predictions toward the background class. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with an extensive evaluation on the Pascal-VOC 2012 and ADE20K datasets, significantly outperforming state of the art incremental learning methods."
Robust Method for Semantic Segmentation of Whole-Slide Blood Cell Microscopic Image,"Previous works on segmentation of SEM (scanning electron microscope) blood cell image ignore the semantic segmentation approach of whole-slide blood cell segmentation. In the proposed work, we address the problem of whole-slide blood cell segmentation using the semantic segmentation approach. We design a novel convolutional encoder-decoder framework along with VGG-16 as the pixel-level feature extraction model. -e proposed framework comprises 3 main steps: First, all the original images along with manually generated ground truth masks of each blood cell type are passed through the preprocessing stage. In the preprocessing stage, pixel-level labeling, RGB to grayscale conversion of masked image and pixel fusing, and unity mask generation are performed. After that, VGG16 is loaded into the system, which acts as a pretrained pixel-level feature extraction model. In the third step, the training process is initiated on the proposed model. We have evaluated our network performance on three evaluation metrics. We obtained outstanding results with respect to classwise, as well as global and mean accuracies. Our system achieved classwise accuracies of 97.45%, 93.34%, and 85.11% for RBCs, WBCs, and platelets, respectively, while global and mean accuracies remain 97.18% and 91.96%, respectively."
Print Defect Mapping with Semantic Segmentation,"Efficient automated print defect mapping is valuable to the printing industry since such defects directly influence customer-perceived printer quality and manually mapping them is cost-ineffective. Conventional methods consist of complicated and hand-crafted feature engineering techniques, usually targeting only one type of defect. In this paper, we propose the first end-to-end framework to map print defects at pixel level, adopting an approach based on semantic segmentation. Our framework uses Convolutional Neural Networks, specifically DeepLab-v3+, and achieves promising results in the identification of defects in printed images. We use synthetic training data by simulating two types of print defects and a print-scan effect with image processing and computer graphic techniques. Compared with conventional methods, our framework is versatile, allowing two inference strategies, one being near real-time and providing coarser results, and the other focusing on offline processing with more fine-grained detection. Our model is evaluated on a dataset of real printed images."
Towards Open-Set Semantic Segmentation of Aerial Images,"Classical and more recently deep computer vision methods are optimized for visible spectrum images, commonly encoded in grayscale or RGB colorspaces acquired from smartphones or cameras. A more uncommon source of images exploited in the remote sensing field are satellite and aerial images. However, the development of pattern recognition approaches for these data is relatively recent, mainly due to the limited availability of this type of images, as until recently they were used exclusively for military purposes. Access to aerial imagery, including spectral information, has been increasing mainly due to the low cost of drones, cheapening of imaging satellite launch costs, and novel public datasets. Usually remote sensing applications employ computer vision techniques strictly modeled for classification tasks in closed set scenarios. However, real-world tasks rarely fit into closed set contexts, frequently presenting previously unknown classes, characterizing them as open set scenarios. Focusing on this problem, this is the first paper to study and develop semantic segmentation techniques for open set scenarios applied to remote sensing images. The main contributions of this paper are: 1) a discussion of related works in open set semantic segmentation, showing evidence that these techniques can be adapted for open set remote sensing tasks; 2) the development and evaluation of a novel approach for open set semantic segmentation. Our method yielded competitive results when compared to closed set methods for the same dataset."
Weakly Supervised Few-shot Object Segmentation using Co-Attention with Visual and Semantic Embeddings,"Significant progress has been made recently in developing few-shot object segmentation methods. Learning is shown to be successful in few-shot segmentation settings, using pixel-level, scribbles and bounding box supervision. This paper takes another approach, i.e., only requiring image-level label for few-shot object segmentation. We propose a novel multi-modal interaction module for few-shot object segmentation that utilizes a co-attention mechanism using both visual and word embedding. Our model using image-level labels achieves 4.8% improvement over previously proposed image-level few-shot object segmentation. It also outperforms state-of-the-art methods that use weak bounding box supervision on PASCAL-5i. Our results show that few-shot segmentation benefits from utilizing word embeddings, and that we are able to perform few-shot segmentation using stacked joint visual semantic processing with weak image-level labels. We further propose a novel setup, Temporal Object Segmentation for Few-shot Learning (TOSFL) for videos. TOSFL can be used on a variety of public video data such as Youtube-VOS, as demonstrated in both instance-level and category-level TOSFL experiments."
SceneEncoder: Scene-Aware Semantic Segmentation of Point Clouds with A Learnable Scene Descriptor,"Besides local features, global information plays an essential role in semantic segmentation, while recent works usually fail to explicitly extract the meaningful global information and make full use of it. In this paper, we propose a SceneEncoder module to impose a scene-aware guidance to enhance the effect of global information. The module predicts a scene descriptor, which learns to represent the categories of objects existing in the scene and directly guides the point-level semantic segmentation through filtering out categories not belonging to this scene. Additionally, to alleviate segmentation noise in local region, we design a region similarity loss to propagate distinguishing features to their own neighboring points with the same label, leading to the enhancement of the distinguishing ability of point-wise features. We integrate our methods into several prevailing networks and conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets ScanNet and ShapeNet. Results show that our methods greatly improve the performance of baselines and achieve state-of-the-art performance."
Learning to adapt class-specific features across domains for semantic segmentation,"Recent advances in unsupervised domain adaptation have shown the effectiveness of adversarial training to adapt features across domains, endowing neural networks with the capability of being tested on a target domain without requiring any training annotations in this domain. The great majority of existing domain adaptation models rely on image translation networks, which often contain a huge amount of domain-specific parameters. Additionally, the feature adaptation step often happens globally, at a coarse level, hindering its applicability to tasks such as semantic segmentation, where details are of crucial importance to provide sharp results. In this thesis, we present a novel architecture, which learns to adapt features across domains by taking into account per class information. To that aim, we design a conditional pixel-wise discriminator network, whose output is conditioned on the segmentation masks. Moreover, following recent advances in image translation, we adopt the recently introduced StarGAN architecture as image translation backbone, since it is able to perform translations across multiple domains by means of a single generator network. Preliminary results on a segmentation task designed to assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach highlight the potential of the model, improving upon strong baselines and alternative designs."
Joint Learning of Instance and Semantic Segmentation for Robotic Pick-and-Place with Heavy Occlusions in Clutter,"We present joint learning of instance and semantic segmentation for visible and occluded region masks. Sharing the feature extractor with instance occlusion segmentation, we introduce semantic occlusion segmentation into the instance segmentation model. This joint learning fuses the instance- and image-level reasoning of the mask prediction on the different segmentation tasks, which was missing in the previous work of learning instance segmentation only (instance-only). In the experiments, we evaluated the proposed joint learning comparing the instance-only learning on the test dataset. We also applied the joint learning model to 2 different types of robotic pick-and-place tasks (random and target picking) and evaluated its effectiveness to achieve real-world robotic tasks."
Gated Path Selection Network for Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation is a challenging task that needs to handle large scale variations, deformations and different viewpoints. In this paper, we develop a novel network named Gated Path Selection Network (GPSNet), which aims to learn adaptive receptive fields. In GPSNet, we first design a two-dimensional multi-scale network - SuperNet, which densely incorporates features from growing receptive fields. To dynamically select desirable semantic context, a gate prediction module is further introduced. In contrast to previous works that focus on optimizing sample positions on the regular grids, GPSNet can adaptively capture free form dense semantic contexts. The derived adaptive receptive fields are data-dependent, and are flexible that can model different object geometric transformations. On two representative semantic segmentation datasets, i.e., Cityscapes, and ADE20K, we show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms previous methods and achieves competitive performance without bells and whistles."
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Mobile Semantic Segmentation based on Cycle Consistency and Feature Alignment,"The supervised training of deep networks for semantic segmentation requires a huge amount of labeled real world data. To solve this issue, a commonly exploited workaround is to use synthetic data for training, but deep networks show a critical performance drop when analyzing data with slightly different statistical properties with respect to the training set. In this work, we propose a novel Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) strategy to address the domain shift issue between real world and synthetic representations. An adversarial model, based on the cycle consistency framework, performs the mapping between the synthetic and real domain. The data is then fed to a MobileNet-v2 architecture that performs the semantic segmentation task. An additional couple of discriminators, working at the feature level of the MobileNet-v2, allows to better align the features of the two domain distributions and to further improve the performance. Finally, the consistency of the semantic maps is exploited. After an initial supervised training on synthetic data, the whole UDA architecture is trained end-to-end considering all its components at once. Experimental results show how the proposed strategy is able to obtain impressive performance in adapting a segmentation network trained on synthetic data to real world scenarios. The usage of the lightweight MobileNet-v2 architecture allows its deployment on devices with limited computational resources as the ones employed in autonomous vehicles."
Structured Consistency Loss for semi-supervised semantic segmentation,"The consistency loss has played a key role in solving problems in recent studies on semi-supervised learning. Yet extant studies with the consistency loss are limited to its application to classification tasks; extant studies on semi-supervised semantic segmentation rely on pixel-wise classification, which does not reflect the structured nature of characteristics in prediction. We propose a structured consistency loss to address this limitation of extant studies. Structured consistency loss promotes consistency in inter-pixel similarity between teacher and student networks. Specifically, collaboration with CutMix optimizes the efficient performance of semi-supervised semantic segmentation with structured consistency loss by reducing computational burden dramatically. The superiority of proposed method is verified with the Cityscapes; The Cityscapes benchmark results with validation and with test data are 81.9 mIoU and 83.84 mIoU respectively. This ranks the first place on the pixel-level semantic labeling task of Cityscapes benchmark suite. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to present the superiority of state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning in semantic segmentation."
Adversarial Loss for Semantic Segmentation of Aerial Imagery,"Automatic building extraction from aerial imagery has several applications in urban planning, disaster management, and change detection. In recent years, several works have adopted deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for building extraction, since they produce rich features that are invariant against lighting conditions, shadows, etc. Although several advances have been made, building extraction from aerial imagery still presents multiple challenges. Most of the deep learning segmentation methods optimize the per-pixel loss with respect to the ground truth without knowledge of the context. This often leads to imperfect outputs that may lead to missing or unrefined regions. In this work, we propose a novel loss function combining both adversarial and cross-entropy losses that learn to understand both local and global contexts for semantic segmentation. The newly proposed loss function deployed on the DeepLab v3+ network obtains state-of-the-art results on the Massachusetts buildings dataset. The loss function improves the structure and refines the edges of buildings without requiring any of the commonly used post-processing methods, such as Conditional Random Fields. We also perform ablation studies to understand the impact of the adversarial loss. Finally, the proposed method achieves a relaxed F1 score of 95.59% on the Massachusetts buildings dataset compared to the previous best F1 of 94.88%."
Hybrid Multiple Attention Network for Semantic Segmentation in Aerial Images,"Semantic segmentation in very high resolution (VHR) aerial images is one of the most challenging tasks in remote sensing image understanding. Most of the current approaches are based on deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs). However, standard convolution with local receptive fields fails in modeling global dependencies. Prior researches have indicated that attention-based methods can capture long-range dependencies and further reconstruct the feature maps for better representation. Nevertheless, limited by the mere perspective of spacial and channel attention and huge computation complexity of self-attention mechanism, it is unlikely to model the effective semantic interdependencies between each pixel-pair of remote sensing data of complex spectra. In this work, we propose a novel attention-based framework named Hybrid Multiple Attention Network (HMANet) to adaptively capture global correlations from the perspective of space, channel and category in a more effective and efficient manner. Concretely, a class augmented attention (CAA) module embedded with a class channel attention (CCA) module can be used to compute category-based correlation and recalibrate the class-level information. Additionally, we introduce a simple yet effective region shuffle attention (RSA) module to reduce feature redundant and improve the efficiency of self-attention mechanism via region-wise representations. Extensive experimental results on the ISPRS Vaihingen and Potsdam benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our HMANet over other state-of-the-art methods."
Robust Semantic Segmentation of Brain Tumor Regions from 3D MRIs,"Multimodal brain tumor segmentation challenge (BraTS) brings together researchers to improve automated methods for 3D MRI brain tumor segmentation. Tumor segmentation is one of the fundamental vision tasks necessary for diagnosis and treatment planning of the disease. Previous years winning methods were all deep-learning based, thanks to the advent of modern GPUs, which allow fast optimization of deep convolutional neural network architectures. In this work, we explore best practices of 3D semantic segmentation, including conventional encoder-decoder architecture, as well combined loss functions, in attempt to further improve the segmentation accuracy. We evaluate the method on BraTS 2019 challenge."
Learning and Memorizing Representative Prototypes for 3D Point Cloud Semantic and Instance Segmentation,"3D point cloud semantic and instance segmentation is crucial and fundamental for 3D scene understanding. Due to the complex structure, point sets are distributed off balance and diversely, which appears as both category imbalance and pattern imbalance. As a result, deep networks can easily forget the non-dominant cases during the learning process, resulting in unsatisfactory performance. Although re-weighting can reduce the influence of the well-classified examples, they cannot handle the non-dominant patterns during the dynamic training. In this paper, we propose a memory-augmented network to learn and memorize the representative prototypes that cover diverse samples universally. Specifically, a memory module is introduced to alleviate the forgetting issue by recording the patterns seen in mini-batch training. The learned memory items consistently reflect the interpretable and meaningful information for both dominant and non-dominant categories and cases. The distorted observations and rare cases can thus be augmented by retrieving the stored prototypes, leading to better performances and generalization. Exhaustive experiments on the benchmarks, i.e. S3DIS and ScanNetV2, reflect the superiority of our method on both effectiveness and efficiency. Not only the overall accuracy but also nondominant classes have improved substantially."
Graph-FCN for image semantic segmentation,"Semantic segmentation with deep learning has achieved great progress in classifying the pixels in the image. However, the local location information is usually ignored in the high-level feature extraction by the deep learning, which is important for image semantic segmentation. To avoid this problem, we propose a graph model initialized by a fully convolutional network (FCN) named Graph-FCN for image semantic segmentation. Firstly, the image grid data is extended to graph structure data by a convolutional network, which transforms the semantic segmentation problem into a graph node classification problem. Then we apply graph convolutional network to solve this graph node classification problem. As far as we know, it is the first time that we apply the graph convolutional network in image semantic segmentation. Our method achieves competitive performance in mean intersection over union (mIOU) on the VOC dataset(about 1.34% improvement), compared to the original FCN model."
Discovering Latent Classes for Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"High annotation costs are a major bottleneck for the training of semantic segmentation systems. Therefore, methods working with less annotation effort are of special interest. This paper studies the problem of semi-supervised semantic segmentation. This means that only a small subset of the training images is annotated while the other training images do not contain any annotation. In order to leverage the information present in the unlabeled images, we propose to learn a second task that is related to semantic segmentation but easier. On labeled images, we learn latent classes consistent with semantic classes so that the variety of semantic classes assigned to a latent class is as low as possible. On unlabeled images, we predict a probability map for latent classes and use it as a supervision signal to learn semantic segmentation. The latent classes, as well as the semantic classes, are simultaneously predicted by a two-branch network. In our experiments on Pascal VOC and Cityscapes, we show that the latent classes learned this way have an intuitive meaning and that the proposed method achieves state of the art results for semi-supervised semantic segmentation."
The Semantic Mutex Watershed for Efficient Bottom-Up Semantic Instance Segmentation,"Semantic instance segmentation is the task of simultaneously partitioning an image into distinct segments while associating each pixel with a class label. In commonly used pipelines, segmentation and label assignment are solved separately since joint optimization is computationally expensive. We propose a greedy algorithm for joint graph partitioning and labeling derived from the efficient Mutex Watershed partitioning algorithm. It optimizes an objective function closely related to the Symmetric Multiway Cut objective and empirically shows efficient scaling behavior. Due to the algorithm's efficiency it can operate directly on pixels without prior over-segmentation of the image into superpixels. We evaluate the performance on the Cityscapes dataset (2D urban scenes) and on a 3D microscopy volume. In urban scenes, the proposed algorithm combined with current deep neural networks outperforms the strong baseline of `Panoptic Feature Pyramid Networks' by Kirillov et al. (2019). In the 3D electron microscopy images, we show explicitly that our joint formulation outperforms a separate optimization of the partitioning and labeling problems."
An Abstraction Model for Semantic Segmentation Algorithms,"Semantic segmentation classifies each pixel in the image. Due to its advantages, semantic segmentation is used in many tasks, such as cancer detection, robot-assisted surgery, satellite image analysis, and self-driving cars. Accuracy and efficiency are the two crucial goals for this purpose, and several state-of-the-art neural networks exist. By employing different techniques, new solutions have been presented in each method to increase efficiency and accuracy and reduce costs. However, the diversity of the implemented approaches for semantic segmentation makes it difficult for researchers to achieve a comprehensive view of the field. In this paper, an abstraction model for semantic segmentation offers a comprehensive view of the field. The proposed framework consists of four general blocks that cover the operation of the majority of semantic segmentation methods. We also compare different approaches and analyze each of the four abstraction blocks' importance in each method's operation."
Efficient Video Semantic Segmentation with Labels Propagation and Refinement,"This paper tackles the problem of real-time semantic segmentation of high definition videos using a hybrid GPU / CPU approach. We propose an Efficient Video Segmentation(EVS) pipeline that combines:  (i) On the CPU, a very fast optical flow method, that is used to exploit the temporal aspect of the video and propagate semantic information from one frame to the next. It runs in parallel with the GPU.  (ii) On the GPU, two Convolutional Neural Networks: A main segmentation network that is used to predict dense semantic labels from scratch, and a Refiner that is designed to improve predictions from previous frames with the help of a fast Inconsistencies Attention Module (IAM). The latter can identify regions that cannot be propagated accurately.  We suggest several operating points depending on the desired frame rate and accuracy. Our pipeline achieves accuracy levels competitive to the existing real-time methods for semantic image segmentation(mIoU above 60%), while achieving much higher frame rates. On the popular Cityscapes dataset with high resolution frames (2048 x 1024), the proposed operating points range from 80 to 1000 Hz on a single GPU and CPU."
Multi-Modal Attention-based Fusion Model for Semantic Segmentation of RGB-Depth Images,"The 3D scene understanding is mainly considered as a crucial requirement in computer vision and robotics applications. One of the high-level tasks in 3D scene understanding is semantic segmentation of RGB-Depth images. With the availability of RGB-D cameras, it is desired to improve the accuracy of the scene understanding process by exploiting the depth features along with the appearance features. As depth images are independent of illumination, they can improve the quality of semantic labeling alongside RGB images. Consideration of both common and specific features of these two modalities improves the performance of semantic segmentation. One of the main problems in RGB-Depth semantic segmentation is how to fuse or combine these two modalities to achieve more advantages of each modality while being computationally efficient. Recently, the methods that encounter deep convolutional neural networks have reached the state-of-the-art results by early, late, and middle fusion strategies. In this paper, an efficient encoder-decoder model with the attention-based fusion block is proposed to integrate mutual influences between feature maps of these two modalities. This block explicitly extracts the interdependences among concatenated feature maps of these modalities to exploit more powerful feature maps from RGB-Depth images. The extensive experimental results on three main challenging datasets of NYU-V2, SUN RGB-D, and Stanford 2D-3D-Semantic show that the proposed network outperforms the state-of-the-art models with respect to computational cost as well as model size. Experimental results also illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed lightweight attention-based fusion model in terms of accuracy."
A Comprehensive Analysis of Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation in Different Image Domains,"Recently proposed methods for weakly-supervised semantic segmentation have achieved impressive performance in predicting pixel classes despite being trained with only image labels which lack positional information. Because image annotations are cheaper and quicker to generate, weak supervision is more practical than full supervision for training segmentation algorithms. These methods have been predominantly developed to solve the background separation and partial segmentation problems presented by natural scene images and it is unclear whether they can be simply transferred to other domains with different characteristics, such as histopathology and satellite images, and still perform well. This paper evaluates state-of-the-art weakly-supervised semantic segmentation methods on natural scene, histopathology, and satellite image datasets and analyzes how to determine which method is most suitable for a given dataset. Our experiments indicate that histopathology and satellite images present a different set of problems for weakly-supervised semantic segmentation than natural scene images, such as ambiguous boundaries and class co-occurrence. Methods perform well for datasets they were developed on, but tend to perform poorly on other datasets. We present some practical techniques for these methods on unseen datasets and argue that more work is needed for a generalizable approach to weakly-supervised semantic segmentation. Our full code implementation is available on GitHub: https://github.com/lyndonchan/wsss-analysis."
FasterSeg: Searching for Faster Real-time Semantic Segmentation,"We present FasterSeg, an automatically designed semantic segmentation network with not only state-of-the-art performance but also faster speed than current methods. Utilizing neural architecture search (NAS), FasterSeg is discovered from a novel and broader search space integrating multi-resolution branches, that has been recently found to be vital in manually designed segmentation models. To better calibrate the balance between the goals of high accuracy and low latency, we propose a decoupled and fine-grained latency regularization, that effectively overcomes our observed phenomenons that the searched networks are prone to ""collapsing"" to low-latency yet poor-accuracy models. Moreover, we seamlessly extend FasterSeg to a new collaborative search (co-searching) framework, simultaneously searching for a teacher and a student network in the same single run. The teacher-student distillation further boosts the student model's accuracy. Experiments on popular segmentation benchmarks demonstrate the competency of FasterSeg. For example, FasterSeg can run over 30% faster than the closest manually designed competitor on Cityscapes, while maintaining comparable accuracy."
A Survey on Deep Learning-based Architectures for Semantic Segmentation on 2D images,"Semantic segmentation is the pixel-wise labelling of an image. Since the problem is defined at the pixel level, determining image class labels only is not acceptable, but localising them at the original image pixel resolution is necessary. Boosted by the extraordinary ability of convolutional neural networks (CNN) in creating semantic, high level and hierarchical image features; several deep learning-based 2D semantic segmentation approaches have been proposed within the last decade. In this survey, we mainly focus on the recent scientific developments in semantic segmentation, specifically on deep learning-based methods using 2D images. We started with an analysis of the public image sets and leaderboards for 2D semantic segmentation, with an overview of the techniques employed in performance evaluation. In examining the evolution of the field, we chronologically categorised the approaches into three main periods, namely pre-and early deep learning era, the fully convolutional era, and the post-FCN era. We technically analysed the solutions put forward in terms of solving the fundamental problems of the field, such as fine-grained localisation and scale invariance. Before drawing our conclusions, we present a table of methods from all mentioned eras, with a summary of each approach that explains their contribution to the field. We conclude the survey by discussing the current challenges of the field and to what extent they have been solved."
Segmentations-Leak: Membership Inference Attacks and Defenses in Semantic Image Segmentation,"Today's success of state of the art methods for semantic segmentation is driven by large datasets. Data is considered an important asset that needs to be protected, as the collection and annotation of such datasets comes at significant efforts and associated costs. In addition, visual data might contain private or sensitive information, that makes it equally unsuited for public release. Unfortunately, recent work on membership inference in the broader area of adversarial machine learning and inference attacks on machine learning models has shown that even black box classifiers leak information on the dataset that they were trained on. We show that such membership inference attacks can be successfully carried out on complex, state of the art models for semantic segmentation. In order to mitigate the associated risks, we also study a series of defenses against such membership inference attacks and find effective counter measures against the existing risks with little effect on the utility of the segmentation method. Finally, we extensively evaluate our attacks and defenses on a range of relevant real-world datasets: Cityscapes, BDD100K, and Mapillary Vistas."
JSNet: Joint Instance and Semantic Segmentation of 3D Point Clouds,"In this paper, we propose a novel joint instance and semantic segmentation approach, which is called JSNet, in order to address the instance and semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds simultaneously. Firstly, we build an effective backbone network to extract robust features from the raw point clouds. Secondly, to obtain more discriminative features, a point cloud feature fusion module is proposed to fuse the different layer features of the backbone network. Furthermore, a joint instance semantic segmentation module is developed to transform semantic features into instance embedding space, and then the transformed features are further fused with instance features to facilitate instance segmentation. Meanwhile, this module also aggregates instance features into semantic feature space to promote semantic segmentation. Finally, the instance predictions are generated by applying a simple mean-shift clustering on instance embeddings. As a result, we evaluate the proposed JSNet on a large-scale 3D indoor point cloud dataset S3DIS and a part dataset ShapeNet, and compare it with existing approaches. Experimental results demonstrate our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art method in 3D instance segmentation with a significant improvement in 3D semantic prediction and our method is also beneficial for part segmentation. The source code for this work is available at https://github.com/dlinzhao/JSNet."
Semantic Segmentation from Remote Sensor Data and the Exploitation of Latent Learning for Classification of Auxiliary Tasks,"In this paper we address three different aspects of semantic segmentation from remote sensor data using deep neural networks. Firstly, we focus on the semantic segmentation of buildings from remote sensor data and propose ICT-Net. The proposed network has been tested on the INRIA and AIRS benchmark datasets and is shown to outperform all other state of the art by more than 1.5% and 1.8% on the Jaccard index, respectively.  Secondly, as the building classification is typically the first step of the reconstruction process, we investigate the relationship of the classification accuracy to the reconstruction accuracy.  Finally, we present the simple yet compelling concept of latent learning and the implications it carries within the context of deep learning. We posit that a network trained on a primary task (i.e. building classification) is unintentionally learning about auxiliary tasks (e.g. the classification of road, tree, etc) which are complementary to the primary task. We extensively tested the proposed technique on the ISPRS benchmark dataset which contains multi-label ground truth, and report an average classification accuracy (F1 score) of 54.29% (SD=17.03) for roads, 10.15% (SD=2.54) for cars, 24.11% (SD=5.25) for trees, 42.74% (SD=6.62) for low vegetation, and 18.30% (SD=16.08) for clutter.  The source code and supplemental material is publicly available at http://www.theICTlab.org/lp/2019ICT-Net/."
SCAttNet: Semantic Segmentation Network with Spatial and Channel Attention Mechanism for High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images,"High-resolution remote sensing images (HRRSIs) contain substantial ground object information, such as texture, shape, and spatial location. Semantic segmentation, which is an important task for element extraction, has been widely used in processing mass HRRSIs. However, HRRSIs often exhibit large intraclass variance and small interclass variance due to the diversity and complexity of ground objects, thereby bringing great challenges to a semantic segmentation task. In this paper, we propose a new end-to-end semantic segmentation network, which integrates lightweight spatial and channel attention modules that can refine features adaptively. We compare our method with several classic methods on the ISPRS Vaihingen and Potsdam datasets. Experimental results show that our method can achieve better semantic segmentation results. The source codes are available at https://github.com/lehaifeng/SCAttNet."
An Adversarial Perturbation Oriented Domain Adaptation Approach for Semantic Segmentation,"We focus on Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) for the task of semantic segmentation. Recently, adversarial alignment has been widely adopted to match the marginal distribution of feature representations across two domains globally. However, this strategy fails in adapting the representations of the tail classes or small objects for semantic segmentation since the alignment objective is dominated by head categories or large objects. In contrast to adversarial alignment, we propose to explicitly train a domain-invariant classifier by generating and defensing against pointwise feature space adversarial perturbations. Specifically, we firstly perturb the intermediate feature maps with several attack objectives (i.e., discriminator and classifier) on each individual position for both domains, and then the classifier is trained to be invariant to the perturbations. By perturbing each position individually, our model treats each location evenly regardless of the category or object size and thus circumvents the aforementioned issue. Moreover, the domain gap in feature space is reduced by extrapolating source and target perturbed features towards each other with attack on the domain discriminator. Our approach achieves the state-of-the-art performance on two challenging domain adaptation tasks for semantic segmentation: GTA5 -> Cityscapes and SYNTHIA -> Cityscapes."
MetaFusion: Controlled False-Negative Reduction of Minority Classes in Semantic Segmentation,"In semantic segmentation datasets, classes of high importance are oftentimes underrepresented, e.g., humans in street scenes. Neural networks are usually trained to reduce the overall number of errors, attaching identical loss to errors of all kinds. However, this is not necessarily aligned with human intuition. For instance, an overlooked pedestrian seems more severe than an incorrectly detected one. One possible remedy is to deploy different decision rules by introducing class priors which assigns larger weight to underrepresented classes. While reducing the false-negatives of the underrepresented class, at the same time this leads to a considerable increase of false-positive indications. In this work, we combine decision rules with methods for false-positive detection. We therefore fuse false-negative detection with uncertainty based false-positive meta classification. We present proof-of-concept results for CIFAR-10, and prove the efficiency of our method for the semantic segmentation of street scenes on the Cityscapes dataset based on predicted instances of the 'human' class. In the latter we employ an advanced false-positive detection method using uncertainty measures aggregated over instances. We thereby achieve improved trade-offs between false-negative and false-positive samples of the underrepresented classes."
Semantic Segmentation for Compound figures,"Scientific literature contains large volumes of unstructured data,with over 30\% of figures constructed as a combination of multiple images, these compound figures cannot be analyzed directly with existing information retrieval tools. In this paper, we propose a semantic segmentation approach for compound figure separation, decomposing the compound figures into ""master images"". Each master image is one part of a compound figure governed by a subfigure label (typically ""(a), (b), (c), etc""). In this way, the separated subfigures can be easily associated with the description information in the caption. In particular, we propose an anchor-based master image detection algorithm, which leverages the correlation between master images and subfigure labels and locates the master images in a two-step manner. First, a subfigure label detector is built to extract the global layout information of the compound figure. Second, the layout information is combined with local features to locate the master images. We validate the effectiveness of proposed method on our labeled testing dataset both quantitatively and qualitatively."
LiteSeg: A Novel Lightweight ConvNet for Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic image segmentation plays a pivotal role in many vision applications including autonomous driving and medical image analysis. Most of the former approaches move towards enhancing the performance in terms of accuracy with a little awareness of computational efficiency. In this paper, we introduce LiteSeg, a lightweight architecture for semantic image segmentation. In this work, we explore a new deeper version of Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling module (ASPP) and apply short and long residual connections, and depthwise separable convolution, resulting in a faster and efficient model. LiteSeg architecture is introduced and tested with multiple backbone networks as Darknet19, MobileNet, and ShuffleNet to provide multiple trade-offs between accuracy and computational cost. The proposed model LiteSeg, with MobileNetV2 as a backbone network, achieves an accuracy of 67.81% mean intersection over union at 161 frames per second with 640 \times 360 resolution on the Cityscapes dataset."
Semantic segmentation of trajectories with improved agent models for pedestrian behavior analysis,"In this paper, we propose a method for semantic segmentation of pedestrian trajectories based on pedestrian behavior models, or agents. The agents model the dynamics of pedestrian movements in two-dimensional space using a linear dynamics model and common start and goal locations of trajectories. First, agent models are estimated from the trajectories obtained from image sequences. Our method is built on top of the Mixture model of Dynamic pedestrian Agents (MDA); however, the MDA's trajectory modeling and estimation are improved. Then, the trajectories are divided into semantically meaningful segments. The subsegments of a trajectory are modeled by applying a hidden Markov model using the estimated agent models. Experimental results with a real trajectory dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed method as compared to the well-known classical Ramer-Douglas-Peucker algorithm and also to the original MDA model."
Wide-Area Land Cover Mapping with Sentinel-1 Imagery using Deep Learning Semantic Segmentation Models,"Land cover mapping is essential to monitoring the environment and understanding the effects of human activities on it. The automatic approaches to land cover mapping (i.e., image segmentation) mostly used traditional machine learning that requires heuristic feature design. On natural images, deep learning has outperformed traditional machine learning approaches for image segmentation. On remote sensing images, recent studies demonstrate successful applications of specific deep learning models to small-scale land cover mapping tasks (e.g., to classify wetland complexes). However, it is not readily clear which of the existing models are the best candidates for which remote sensing task. In this study, we answer that question for mapping the fundamental land cover classes using satellite radar data. We took Sentinel-1 C-band SAR images available at no cost to users as representative data. CORINE land cover map was used as a reference, and the models were trained to distinguish between the 5 major CORINE classes. We selected seven among the state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models so that they cover a diverse set of approaches: U-Net, DeepLabV3+, PSPNet, BiSeNet, SegNet, FC-DenseNet, and FRRN-B. The models were pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset and further fine-tuned in this study. All the models demonstrated solid performance with overall accuracy between 87.9% and 93.1%, and with good to a very good agreement (kappa statistic between 0.75 and 0.86). The two best models were FC-DenseNet and SegNet, with the latter having a much smaller inference time. Overall, our results indicate that the semantic segmentation models are suitable for efficient wide-area mapping using satellite SAR imagery and also provide baseline accuracy against which the newly proposed models should be evaluated."
Detection of False Positive and False Negative Samples in Semantic Segmentation,"In recent years, deep learning methods have outperformed other methods in image recognition. This has fostered imagination of potential application of deep learning technology including safety relevant applications like the interpretation of medical images or autonomous driving. The passage from assistance of a human decision maker to ever more automated systems however increases the need to properly handle the failure modes of deep learning modules. In this contribution, we review a set of techniques for the self-monitoring of machine-learning algorithms based on uncertainty quantification. In particular, we apply this to the task of semantic segmentation, where the machine learning algorithm decomposes an image according to semantic categories. We discuss false positive and false negative error modes at instance-level and review techniques for the detection of such errors that have been recently proposed by the authors. We also give an outlook on future research directions."
Waterfall Atrous Spatial Pooling Architecture for Efficient Semantic Segmentation,"We propose a new efficient architecture for semantic segmentation, based on a ""Waterfall"" Atrous Spatial Pooling architecture, that achieves a considerable accuracy increase while decreasing the number of network parameters and memory footprint. The proposed Waterfall architecture leverages the efficiency of progressive filtering in the cascade architecture while maintaining multiscale fields-of-view comparable to spatial pyramid configurations. Additionally, our method does not rely on a postprocessing stage with Conditional Random Fields, which further reduces complexity and required training time. We demonstrate that the Waterfall approach with a ResNet backbone is a robust and efficient architecture for semantic segmentation obtaining state-of-the-art results with significant reduction in the number of parameters for the Pascal VOC dataset and the Cityscapes dataset."
RGPNet: A Real-Time General Purpose Semantic Segmentation,"We propose a real-time general purpose semantic segmentation architecture, RGPNet, which achieves significant performance gain in complex environments. RGPNet consists of a light-weight asymmetric encoder-decoder and an adaptor. The adaptor helps preserve and refine the abstract concepts from multiple levels of distributed representations between the encoder and decoder. It also facilitates the gradient flow from deeper layers to shallower layers. Our experiments demonstrate that RGPNet can generate segmentation results in real-time with comparable accuracy to the state-of-the-art non-real-time heavy models. Moreover, towards green AI, we show that using an optimized label-relaxation technique with progressive resizing can reduce the training time by up to 60% while preserving the performance. We conclude that RGPNet obtains a better speed-accuracy trade-off across multiple datasets."
Indirect Local Attacks for Context-aware Semantic Segmentation Networks,"Recently, deep networks have achieved impressive semantic segmentation performance, in particular thanks to their use of larger contextual information. In this paper, we show that the resulting networks are sensitive not only to global attacks, where perturbations affect the entire input image, but also to indirect local attacks where perturbations are confined to a small image region that does not overlap with the area that we aim to fool. To this end, we introduce several indirect attack strategies, including adaptive local attacks, aiming to find the best image location to perturb, and universal local attacks. Furthermore, we propose attack detection techniques both for the global image level and to obtain a pixel-wise localization of the fooled regions. Our results are unsettling: Because they exploit a larger context, more accurate semantic segmentation networks are more sensitive to indirect local attacks."
Investigations on the inference optimization techniques and their impact on multiple hardware platforms for Semantic Segmentation,"In this work, the task of pixel-wise semantic segmentation in the context of self-driving with a goal to reduce the inference time is explored. Fully Convolutional Network (FCN-8s, FCN-16s, and FCN-32s) with a VGG16 encoder architecture and skip connections is trained and validated on the Cityscapes dataset. Numerical investigations are carried out for several inference optimization techniques built into TensorFlow and TensorRT to quantify their impact on the inference time and network size. Finally, the trained network is ported on to an embedded platform (Nvidia Jetson TX1) and the inference time, as well as the total energy consumed for inference across hardware platforms, are compared."
Deep Object Co-segmentation via Spatial-Semantic Network Modulation,"Object co-segmentation is to segment the shared objects in multiple relevant images, which has numerous applications in computer vision. This paper presents a spatial and semantic modulated deep network framework for object co-segmentation. A backbone network is adopted to extract multi-resolution image features. With the multi-resolution features of the relevant images as input, we design a spatial modulator to learn a mask for each image. The spatial modulator captures the correlations of image feature descriptors via unsupervised learning. The learned mask can roughly localize the shared foreground object while suppressing the background. For the semantic modulator, we model it as a supervised image classification task. We propose a hierarchical second-order pooling module to transform the image features for classification use. The outputs of the two modulators manipulate the multi-resolution features by a shift-and-scale operation so that the features focus on segmenting co-object regions. The proposed model is trained end-to-end without any intricate post-processing. Extensive experiments on four image co-segmentation benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior accuracy of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art methods."
Land Cover Change Detection via Semantic Segmentation,"This paper presents a change detection method that identifies land cover changes from aerial imagery, using semantic segmentation, a machine learning approach. We present a land cover classification training pipeline with Deeplab v3+, state-of-the-art semantic segmentation technology, including data preparation, model training for seven land cover types, and model exporting modules. In the land cover change detection system, the inputs are images retrieved from Google Earth at the same location but from different times. The system then predicts semantic segmentation results on these images using the trained model and calculates the land cover class percentage for each input image. We see an improvement in the accuracy of the land cover semantic segmentation model, with a mean IoU of 0.756 compared to 0.433, as reported in the DeepGlobe land cover classification challenge. The land cover change detection system that leverages the state-of-the-art semantic segmentation technology is proposed and can be used for deforestation analysis, land management, and urban planning."
xMUDA: Cross-Modal Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for 3D Semantic Segmentation,"Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) is crucial to tackle the lack of annotations in a new domain. There are many multi-modal datasets, but most UDA approaches are uni-modal. In this work, we explore how to learn from multi-modality and propose cross-modal UDA (xMUDA) where we assume the presence of 2D images and 3D point clouds for 3D semantic segmentation. This is challenging as the two input spaces are heterogeneous and can be impacted differently by domain shift. In xMUDA, modalities learn from each other through mutual mimicking, disentangled from the segmentation objective, to prevent the stronger modality from adopting false predictions from the weaker one. We evaluate on new UDA scenarios including day-to-night, country-to-country and dataset-to-dataset, leveraging recent autonomous driving datasets. xMUDA brings large improvements over uni-modal UDA on all tested scenarios, and is complementary to state-of-the-art UDA techniques. Code is available at https://github.com/valeoai/xmuda."
Document Structure Extraction using Prior based High Resolution Hierarchical Semantic Segmentation,"Structure extraction from document images has been a long-standing research topic due to its high impact on a wide range of practical applications. In this paper, we share our findings on employing a hierarchical semantic segmentation network for this task of structure extraction. We propose a prior based deep hierarchical CNN network architecture that enables document structure extraction using very high resolution(1800 x 1000) images. We divide the document image into overlapping horizontal strips such that the network segments a strip and uses its prediction mask as prior for predicting the segmentation of the subsequent strip. We perform experiments establishing the effectiveness of our strip based network architecture through ablation methods and comparison with low-resolution variations. Further, to demonstrate our network's capabilities, we train it on only one type of documents (Forms) and achieve state-of-the-art results over other general document datasets. We introduce our new human-annotated forms dataset and show that our method significantly outperforms different segmentation baselines on this dataset in extracting hierarchical structures. Our method is currently being used in Adobe's AEM Forms for automated conversion of paper and PDF forms to modern HTML based forms."
Class-Conditional Domain Adaptation on Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation is an important sub-task for many applications, but pixel-level ground truth labeling is costly and there is a tendency to overfit the training data, limiting generalization. Unsupervised domain adaptation can potentially address these problems, allowing systems trained on labelled datasets from one or more source domains (including less expensive synthetic domains) to be adapted to novel target domains. The conventional approach is to automatically align the representational distributions of source and target domains. One limitation of this approach is that it tends to disadvantage lower probability classes. We address this problem by introducing a Class-Conditional Domain Adaptation method (CCDA). It includes a class-conditional multi-scale discriminator and the class-conditional loss. This novel CCDA method encourages the network to shift the domain in a class-conditional manner, and it equalizes loss over classes. We evaluate our CCDA method on two transfer tasks and demonstrate performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods."
ViewAL: Active Learning with Viewpoint Entropy for Semantic Segmentation,"We propose ViewAL, a novel active learning strategy for semantic segmentation that exploits viewpoint consistency in multi-view datasets. Our core idea is that inconsistencies in model predictions across viewpoints provide a very reliable measure of uncertainty and encourage the model to perform well irrespective of the viewpoint under which objects are observed. To incorporate this uncertainty measure, we introduce a new viewpoint entropy formulation, which is the basis of our active learning strategy. In addition, we propose uncertainty computations on a superpixel level, which exploits inherently localized signal in the segmentation task, directly lowering the annotation costs. This combination of viewpoint entropy and the use of superpixels allows to efficiently select samples that are highly informative for improving the network. We demonstrate that our proposed active learning strategy not only yields the best-performing models for the same amount of required labeled data, but also significantly reduces labeling effort. For instance, our method achieves 95% of maximum achievable network performance using only 7%, 17%, and 24% labeled data on SceneNet-RGBD, ScanNet, and Matterport3D, respectively. On these datasets, the best state-of-the-art method achieves the same performance with 14%, 27% and 33% labeled data. Finally, we demonstrate that labeling using superpixels yields the same quality of ground-truth compared to labeling whole images, but requires 25% less time."
On Symbiosis of Attribute Prediction and Semantic Segmentation,"In this paper, we propose to employ semantic segmentation to improve person-related attribute prediction. The core idea lies in the fact that the probability of an attribute to appear in an image is far from being uniform in the spatial domain. We build our attribute prediction model jointly with a deep semantic segmentation network. This harnesses the localization cues learned by the semantic segmentation to guide the attention of the attribute prediction to the regions where different attributes naturally show up. Therefore, in addition to prediction, we are able to localize the attributes despite merely having access to image-level labels (weak supervision) during training. We first propose semantic segmentation-based pooling and gating, respectively denoted as SSP and SSG. In the former, the estimated segmentation masks are used to pool the final activations of the attribute prediction network, from multiple semantically homogeneous regions. In SSG, the same idea is applied to the intermediate layers of the network. SSP and SSG, while effective, impose heavy memory utilization since each channel of the activations is pooled/gated with all the semantic segmentation masks. To circumvent this, we propose Symbiotic Augmentation (SA), where we learn only one mask per activation channel. SA allows the model to either pick one, or combine (weighted superposition) multiple semantic maps, in order to generate the proper mask for each channel. SA simultaneously applies the same mechanism to the reverse problem by leveraging output logits of attribute prediction to guide the semantic segmentation task. We evaluate our proposed methods for facial attributes on CelebA and LFWA datasets, while benchmarking WIDER Attribute and Berkeley Attributes of People for whole body attributes. Our proposed methods achieve superior results compared to the previous works."
RandLA-Net: Efficient Semantic Segmentation of Large-Scale Point Clouds,"We study the problem of efficient semantic segmentation for large-scale 3D point clouds. By relying on expensive sampling techniques or computationally heavy pre/post-processing steps, most existing approaches are only able to be trained and operate over small-scale point clouds. In this paper, we introduce RandLA-Net, an efficient and lightweight neural architecture to directly infer per-point semantics for large-scale point clouds. The key to our approach is to use random point sampling instead of more complex point selection approaches. Although remarkably computation and memory efficient, random sampling can discard key features by chance. To overcome this, we introduce a novel local feature aggregation module to progressively increase the receptive field for each 3D point, thereby effectively preserving geometric details. Extensive experiments show that our RandLA-Net can process 1 million points in a single pass with up to 200X faster than existing approaches. Moreover, our RandLA-Net clearly surpasses state-of-the-art approaches for semantic segmentation on two large-scale benchmarks Semantic3D and SemanticKITTI."
Differentiable Meta-learning Model for Few-shot Semantic Segmentation,"To address the annotation scarcity issue in some cases of semantic segmentation, there have been a few attempts to develop the segmentation model in the few-shot learning paradigm. However, most existing methods only focus on the traditional 1-way segmentation setting (i.e., one image only contains a single object). This is far away from practical semantic segmentation tasks where the K-way setting (K>1) is usually required by performing the accurate multi-object segmentation. To deal with this issue, we formulate the few-shot semantic segmentation task as a learning-based pixel classification problem and propose a novel framework called MetaSegNet based on meta-learning. In MetaSegNet, an architecture of embedding module consisting of the global and local feature branches is developed to extract the appropriate meta-knowledge for the few-shot segmentation. Moreover, we incorporate a linear model into MetaSegNet as a base learner to directly predict the label of each pixel for the multi-object segmentation. Furthermore, our MetaSegNet can be trained by the episodic training mechanism in an end-to-end manner from scratch. Experiments on two popular semantic segmentation datasets, i.e., PASCAL VOC and COCO, reveal the effectiveness of the proposed MetaSegNet in the K-way few-shot semantic segmentation task."
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation by Optical Flow Augmentation in Semantic Segmentation,"It is expensive to generate real-life image labels and there is a domain gap between real-life and simulated images, hence a model trained on the latter cannot adapt to the former. Solving this can totally eliminate the need for labeling real-life datasets completely. Class balanced self-training is one of the existing techniques that attempt to reduce the domain gap. Moreover, augmenting RGB with flow maps has improved performance in simple semantic segmentation and geometry is preserved across domains. Hence, by augmenting images with dense optical flow map, domain adaptation in semantic segmentation can be improved."
Semantic Segmentation of Thigh Muscle using 2.5D Deep Learning Network Trained with Limited Datasets,"Purpose: We propose a 2.5D deep learning neural network (DLNN) to automatically classify thigh muscle into 11 classes and evaluate its classification accuracy over 2D and 3D DLNN when trained with limited datasets. Enables operator invariant quantitative assessment of the thigh muscle volume change with respect to the disease progression. Materials and methods: Retrospective datasets consist of 48 thigh volume (TV) cropped from CT DICOM images. Cropped volumes were aligned with femur axis and resample in 2 mm voxel-spacing. Proposed 2.5D DLNN consists of three 2D U-Net trained with axial, coronal and sagittal muscle slices respectively. A voting algorithm was used to combine the output of U-Nets to create final segmentation. 2.5D U-Net was trained on PC with 38 TV and the remaining 10 TV were used to evaluate segmentation accuracy of 10 classes within Thigh. The result segmentation of both left and right thigh were de-cropped to original CT volume space. Finally, segmentation accuracies were compared between proposed DLNN and 2D/3D U-Net. Results: Average segmentation DSC score accuracy of all classes with 2.5D U-Net as 91.18% and Average Surface distance (ASD) accuracy as 0.84 mm. We found, mean DSC score for 2D U-Net was 3.3% lower than the that of 2.5D U-Net and mean DSC score of 3D U-Net was 5.7% lower than that of 2.5D U-Net when trained with same datasets. Conclusion: We achieved a faster computationally efficient and automatic segmentation of thigh muscle into 11 classes with reasonable accuracy. Enables quantitative evaluation of muscle atrophy with disease progression."
Improving Semantic Segmentation of Aerial Images Using Patch-based Attention,"The trade-off between feature representation power and spatial localization accuracy is crucial for the dense classification/semantic segmentation of aerial images. High-level features extracted from the late layers of a neural network are rich in semantic information, yet have blurred spatial details; low-level features extracted from the early layers of a network contain more pixel-level information, but are isolated and noisy. It is therefore difficult to bridge the gap between high and low-level features due to their difference in terms of physical information content and spatial distribution. In this work, we contribute to solve this problem by enhancing the feature representation in two ways. On the one hand, a patch attention module (PAM) is proposed to enhance the embedding of context information based on a patch-wise calculation of local attention. On the other hand, an attention embedding module (AEM) is proposed to enrich the semantic information of low-level features by embedding local focus from high-level features. Both of the proposed modules are light-weight and can be applied to process the extracted features of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Experiments show that, by integrating the proposed modules into the baseline Fully Convolutional Network (FCN), the resulting local attention network (LANet) greatly improves the performance over the baseline and outperforms other attention based methods on two aerial image datasets."
Reliability Does Matter: An End-to-End Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation Approach,"Weakly supervised semantic segmentation is a challenging task as it only takes image-level information as supervision for training but produces pixel-level predictions for testing. To address such a challenging task, most recent state-of-the-art approaches propose to adopt two-step solutions, \emph{i.e. } 1) learn to generate pseudo pixel-level masks, and 2) engage FCNs to train the semantic segmentation networks with the pseudo masks. However, the two-step solutions usually employ many bells and whistles in producing high-quality pseudo masks, making this kind of methods complicated and inelegant. In this work, we harness the image-level labels to produce reliable pixel-level annotations and design a fully end-to-end network to learn to predict segmentation maps. Concretely, we firstly leverage an image classification branch to generate class activation maps for the annotated categories, which are further pruned into confident yet tiny object/background regions. Such reliable regions are then directly served as ground-truth labels for the parallel segmentation branch, where a newly designed dense energy loss function is adopted for optimization. Despite its apparent simplicity, our one-step solution achieves competitive mIoU scores (\emph{val}: 62.6, \emph{test}: 62.9) on Pascal VOC compared with those two-step state-of-the-arts. By extending our one-step method to two-step, we get a new state-of-the-art performance on the Pascal VOC (\emph{val}: 66.3, \emph{test}: 66.5)."
Real-Time Semantic Segmentation via Multiply Spatial Fusion Network,"Real-time semantic segmentation plays a significant role in industry applications, such as autonomous driving, robotics and so on. It is a challenging task as both efficiency and performance need to be considered simultaneously. To address such a complex task, this paper proposes an efficient CNN called Multiply Spatial Fusion Network (MSFNet) to achieve fast and accurate perception. The proposed MSFNet uses Class Boundary Supervision to process the relevant boundary information based on our proposed Multi-features Fusion Module which can obtain spatial information and enlarge receptive field. Therefore, the final upsampling of the feature maps of 1/8 original image size can achieve impressive results while maintaining a high speed. Experiments on Cityscapes and Camvid datasets show an obvious advantage of the proposed approach compared with the existing approaches. Specifically, it achieves 77.1% Mean IOU on the Cityscapes test dataset with the speed of 41 FPS for a 1024*2048 input, and 75.4% Mean IOU with the speed of 91 FPS on the Camvid test dataset."
Exploiting Local and Global Structure for Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation with Contextual Point Representations,"In this paper, we propose one novel model for point cloud semantic segmentation, which exploits both the local and global structures within the point cloud based on the contextual point representations. Specifically, we enrich each point representation by performing one novel gated fusion on the point itself and its contextual points. Afterwards, based on the enriched representation, we propose one novel graph pointnet module, relying on the graph attention block to dynamically compose and update each point representation within the local point cloud structure. Finally, we resort to the spatial-wise and channel-wise attention strategies to exploit the point cloud global structure and thereby yield the resulting semantic label for each point. Extensive results on the public point cloud databases, namely the S3DIS and ScanNet datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model, outperforming the state-of-the-art approaches. Our code for this paper is available at https://github.com/fly519/ELGS."
Location-aware Upsampling for Semantic Segmentation,"Many successful learning targets such as minimizing dice loss and cross-entropy loss have enabled unprecedented breakthroughs in segmentation tasks. Beyond these semantic metrics, this paper aims to introduce location supervision into semantic segmentation. Based on this idea, we present a Location-aware Upsampling (LaU) that adaptively refines the interpolating coordinates with trainable offsets. Then, location-aware losses are established by encouraging pixels to move towards well-classified locations. An LaU is offset prediction coupled with interpolation, which is trained end-to-end to generate confidence score at each position from coarse to fine. Guided by location-aware losses, the new module can replace its plain counterpart (\textit{e.g.}, bilinear upsampling) in a plug-and-play manner to further boost the leading encoder-decoder approaches. Extensive experiments validate the consistent improvement over the state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/HolmesShuan/Location-aware-Upsampling-for-Semantic-Segmentation"
Time-Dynamic Estimates of the Reliability of Deep Semantic Segmentation Networks,"In the semantic segmentation of street scenes with neural networks, the reliability of predictions is of highest interest. The assessment of neural networks by means of uncertainties is a common ansatz to prevent safety issues. As in applications like automated driving, video streams of images are available, we present a time-dynamic approach to investigating uncertainties and assessing the prediction quality of neural networks. We track segments over time and gather aggregated metrics per segment, thus obtaining time series of metrics from which we assess prediction quality. This is done by either classifying between intersection over union equal to 0 and greater than 0 or predicting the intersection over union directly. We study different models for these two tasks and analyze the influence of the time series length on the predictive power of our metrics."
Knowledge Distillation for Incremental Learning in Semantic Segmentation,"Deep learning architectures have shown remarkable results in scene understanding problems, however they exhibit a critical drop of performances when they are required to learn incrementally new tasks without forgetting old ones. This catastrophic forgetting phenomenon impacts on the deployment of artificial intelligence in real world scenarios where systems need to learn new and different representations over time. Current approaches for incremental learning deal only with image classification and object detection tasks, while in this work we formally introduce incremental learning for semantic segmentation. We tackle the problem applying various knowledge distillation techniques on the previous model. In this way, we retain the information about learned classes, whilst updating the current model to learn the new ones. We developed four main methodologies of knowledge distillation working on both output layers and internal feature representations. We do not store any image belonging to previous training stages and only the last model is used to preserve high accuracy on previously learned classes. Extensive experimental results on the Pascal VOC2012 and MSRC-v2 datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed approaches in several incremental learning scenarios."
Efficacy of Pixel-Level OOD Detection for Semantic Segmentation,"The detection of out of distribution samples for image classification has been widely researched. Safety critical applications, such as autonomous driving, would benefit from the ability to localise the unusual objects causing the image to be out of distribution. This paper adapts state-of-the-art methods for detecting out of distribution images for image classification to the new task of detecting out of distribution pixels, which can localise the unusual objects. It further experimentally compares the adapted methods on two new datasets derived from existing semantic segmentation datasets using PSPNet and DeeplabV3+ architectures, as well as proposing a new metric for the task. The evaluation shows that the performance ranking of the compared methods does not transfer to the new task and every method performs significantly worse than their image-level counterparts."
Self-Supervised Difference Detection for Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"To minimize the annotation costs associated with the training of semantic segmentation models, researchers have extensively investigated weakly-supervised segmentation approaches. In the current weakly-supervised segmentation methods, the most widely adopted approach is based on visualization. However, the visualization results are not generally equal to semantic segmentation. Therefore, to perform accurate semantic segmentation under the weakly supervised condition, it is necessary to consider the mapping functions that convert the visualization results into semantic segmentation. For such mapping functions, the conditional random field and iterative re-training using the outputs of a segmentation model are usually used. However, these methods do not always guarantee improvements in accuracy; therefore, if we apply these mapping functions iteratively multiple times, eventually the accuracy will not improve or will decrease.  In this paper, to make the most of such mapping functions, we assume that the results of the mapping function include noise, and we improve the accuracy by removing noise. To achieve our aim, we propose the self-supervised difference detection module, which estimates noise from the results of the mapping functions by predicting the difference between the segmentation masks before and after the mapping. We verified the effectiveness of the proposed method by performing experiments on the PASCAL Visual Object Classes 2012 dataset, and we achieved 64.9\% in the val set and 65.5\% in the test set. Both of the results become new state-of-the-art under the same setting of weakly supervised semantic segmentation."
Singular points detection with semantic segmentation networks,"Singular points detection is one of the most classical and important problem in the field of fingerprint recognition. However, current detection rates of singular points are still unsatisfactory, especially for low-quality fingerprints. Compared with traditional image processing-based detection methods, methods based on deep learning only need the original fingerprint image but not the fingerprint orientation field. In this paper, different from other detection methods based on deep learning, we treat singular points detection as a semantic segmentation problem and just use few data for training. Furthermore, we propose a new convolutional neural network called SinNet to extract the singular regions of interest and then use a blob detection method called SimpleBlobDetector to locate the singular points. The experiments are carried out on the test dataset from SPD2010, and the proposed method has much better performance than the other advanced methods in most aspects. Compared with the state-of-art algorithms in SPD2010, our method achieves an increase of 11% in the percentage of correctly detected fingerprints and an increase of more than 18% in the core detection rate."
Eye Semantic Segmentation with a Lightweight Model,"In this paper, we present a multi-class eye segmentation method that can run the hardware limitations for real-time inference. Our approach includes three major stages: get a grayscale image from the input, segment three distinct eye region with a deep network, and remove incorrect areas with heuristic filters. Our model based on the encoder decoder structure with the key is the depthwise convolution operation to reduce the computation cost. We experiment on OpenEDS, a large scale dataset of eye images captured by a head-mounted display with two synchronized eye facing cameras. We achieved the mean intersection over union (mIoU) of 94.85% with a model of size 0.4 megabytes. The source code are available https://github.com/th2l/Eye_VR_Segmentation"
Cooperative Semantic Segmentation and Image Restoration in Adverse Environmental Conditions,"Most state-of-the-art semantic segmentation approaches only achieve high accuracy in good conditions. In practically-common but less-discussed adverse environmental conditions, their performance can decrease enormously. Existing studies usually cast the handling of segmentation in adverse conditions as a separate post-processing step after signal restoration, making the segmentation performance largely depend on the quality of restoration. In this paper, we propose a novel deep-learning framework to tackle semantic segmentation and image restoration in adverse environmental conditions in a holistic manner. The proposed approach contains two components: Semantically-Guided Adaptation, which exploits semantic information from degraded images to refine the segmentation; and Exemplar-Guided Synthesis, which restores images from semantic label maps given degraded exemplars as the guidance. Our method cooperatively leverages the complementarity and interdependence of low-level restoration and high-level segmentation in adverse environmental conditions. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate that our approach can not only improve the accuracy of semantic segmentation with degradation cues, but also boost the perceptual quality and structural similarity of image restoration with semantic guidance."
Semantic Feature Attention Network for Liver Tumor Segmentation in Large-scale CT database,"Liver tumor segmentation plays an important role in hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosis and surgical planning. In this paper, we propose a novel Semantic Feature Attention Network (SFAN) for liver tumor segmentation from Computed Tomography (CT) volumes, which exploits the impact of both low-level and high-level features. In the SFAN, a Semantic Attention Transmission (SAT) module is designed to select discriminative low-level localization details with the guidance of neighboring high-level semantic information. Furthermore, a Global Context Attention (GCA) module is proposed to effectively fuse the multi-level features with the guidance of global context. Our experiments are based on 2 challenging databases, the public Liver Tumor Segmentation (LiTS) Challenge database and a large-scale in-house clinical database with 912 CT volumes. Experimental results show that our proposed framework can not only achieve the state-of-the-art performance with the Dice per case on liver tumor segmentation in LiTS database, but also outperform some widely used segmentation algorithms in the large-scale clinical database."
Distilling Pixel-Wise Feature Similarities for Semantic Segmentation,"Among the neural network compression techniques, knowledge distillation is an effective one which forces a simpler student network to mimic the output of a larger teacher network. However, most of such model distillation methods focus on the image-level classification task. Directly adapting these methods to the task of semantic segmentation only brings marginal improvements. In this paper, we propose a simple, yet effective knowledge representation referred to as pixel-wise feature similarities (PFS) to tackle the challenging distillation problem of semantic segmentation. The developed PFS encodes spatial structural information for each pixel location of the high-level convolutional features, which helps guide the distillation process in an easier way. Furthermore, a novel weighted pixel-level soft prediction imitation approach is proposed to enable the student network to selectively mimic the teacher network's output, according to their pixel-wise knowledge-gaps. Extensive experiments are conducted on the challenging datasets of Pascal VOC 2012, ADE20K and Pascal Context. Our approach brings significant performance improvements compared to several strong baselines and achieves new state-of-the-art results."
Multi Modal Semantic Segmentation using Synthetic Data,"Semantic understanding of scenes in three-dimensional space (3D) is a quintessential part of robotics oriented applications such as autonomous driving as it provides geometric cues such as size, orientation and true distance of separation to objects which are crucial for taking mission critical decisions. As a first step, in this work we investigate the possibility of semantically classifying different parts of a given scene in 3D by learning the underlying geometric context in addition to the texture cues BUT in the absence of labelled real-world datasets. To this end we generate a large number of synthetic scenes, their pixel-wise labels and corresponding 3D representations using CARLA software framework. We then build a deep neural network that learns underlying category specific 3D representation and texture cues from color information of the rendered synthetic scenes. Further on we apply the learned model on different real world datasets to evaluate its performance. Our preliminary investigation of results show that the neural network is able to learn the geometric context from synthetic scenes and effectively apply this knowledge to classify each point of a 3D representation of a scene in real-world."
Sequential image processing methods for improving semantic video segmentation algorithms,"Recently, semantic video segmentation gained high attention especially for supporting autonomous driving systems. Deep learning methods made it possible to implement real time segmentation and object identification algorithms on videos. However, most of the available approaches process each video frame independently disregarding their sequential relation in time. Therefore their results suddenly miss some of the object segments in some of the frames even if they were detected properly in the earlier frames. Herein we propose two sequential probabilistic video frame analysis approaches to improve the segmentation performance of the existing algorithms. Our experiments show that using the information of the past frames we increase the performance and consistency of the state of the art algorithms."
PT-ResNet: Perspective Transformation-Based Residual Network for Semantic Road Image Segmentation,"Semantic road region segmentation is a high-level task, which paves the way towards road scene understanding. This paper presents a residual network trained for semantic road segmentation. Firstly, we represent the projections of road disparities in the v-disparity map as a linear model, which can be estimated by optimizing the v-disparity map using dynamic programming. This linear model is then utilized to reduce the redundant information in the left and right road images. The right image is also transformed into the left perspective view, which greatly enhances the road surface similarity between the two images. Finally, the processed stereo images and their disparity maps are concatenated to create a set of 3D images, which are then utilized to train our neural network. The experimental results illustrate that our network achieves a maximum F1-measure of approximately 91.19% when analyzing the images from the KITTI road dataset."
Category Anchor-Guided Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation,"Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to enhance the generalization capability of a certain model from a source domain to a target domain. UDA is of particular significance since no extra effort is devoted to annotating target domain samples. However, the different data distributions in the two domains, or \emph{domain shift/discrepancy}, inevitably compromise the UDA performance. Although there has been a progress in matching the marginal distributions between two domains, the classifier favors the source domain features and makes incorrect predictions on the target domain due to category-agnostic feature alignment. In this paper, we propose a novel category anchor-guided (CAG) UDA model for semantic segmentation, which explicitly enforces category-aware feature alignment to learn shared discriminative features and classifiers simultaneously. First, the category-wise centroids of the source domain features are used as guided anchors to identify the active features in the target domain and also assign them pseudo-labels. Then, we leverage an anchor-based pixel-level distance loss and a discriminative loss to drive the intra-category features closer and the inter-category features further apart, respectively. Finally, we devise a stagewise training mechanism to reduce the error accumulation and adapt the proposed model progressively. Experiments on both the GTA5\rightarrow Cityscapes and SYNTHIA\rightarrow Cityscapes scenarios demonstrate the superiority of our CAG-UDA model over the state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/RogerZhangzz/CAG_UDA}."
Multi-source Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation,"Simulation-to-real domain adaptation for semantic segmentation has been actively studied for various applications such as autonomous driving. Existing methods mainly focus on a single-source setting, which cannot easily handle a more practical scenario of multiple sources with different distributions. In this paper, we propose to investigate multi-source domain adaptation for semantic segmentation. Specifically, we design a novel framework, termed Multi-source Adversarial Domain Aggregation Network (MADAN), which can be trained in an end-to-end manner. First, we generate an adapted domain for each source with dynamic semantic consistency while aligning at the pixel-level cycle-consistently towards the target. Second, we propose sub-domain aggregation discriminator and cross-domain cycle discriminator to make different adapted domains more closely aggregated. Finally, feature-level alignment is performed between the aggregated domain and target domain while training the segmentation network. Extensive experiments from synthetic GTA and SYNTHIA to real Cityscapes and BDDS datasets demonstrate that the proposed MADAN model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Our source code is released at: https://github.com/Luodian/MADAN."
Region Mutual Information Loss for Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation is a fundamental problem in computer vision. It is considered as a pixel-wise classification problem in practice, and most segmentation models use a pixel-wise loss as their optimization riterion. However, the pixel-wise loss ignores the dependencies between pixels in an image. Several ways to exploit the relationship between pixels have been investigated, \eg, conditional random fields (CRF) and pixel affinity based methods. Nevertheless, these methods usually require additional model branches, large extra memories, or more inference time. In this paper, we develop a region mutual information (RMI) loss to model the dependencies among pixels more simply and efficiently. In contrast to the pixel-wise loss which treats the pixels as independent samples, RMI uses one pixel and its neighbour pixels to represent this pixel. Then for each pixel in an image, we get a multi-dimensional point that encodes the relationship between pixels, and the image is cast into a multi-dimensional distribution of these high-dimensional points. The prediction and ground truth thus can achieve high order consistency through maximizing the mutual information (MI) between their multi-dimensional distributions. Moreover, as the actual value of the MI is hard to calculate, we derive a lower bound of the MI and maximize the lower bound to maximize the real value of the MI. RMI only requires a few extra computational resources in the training stage, and there is no overhead during testing. Experimental results demonstrate that RMI can achieve substantial and consistent improvements in performance on PASCAL VOC 2012 and CamVid datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/ZJULearning/RMI."
When Segmentation is Not Enough: Rectifying Visual-Volume Discordance Through Multisensor Depth-Refined Semantic Segmentation for Food Intake Tracking in Long-Term Care,"Malnutrition is a multidomain problem affecting 54% of older adults in long-term care (LTC). Monitoring nutritional intake in LTC is laborious and subjective, limiting clinical inference capabilities. Recent advances in automatic image-based food estimation have not yet been evaluated in LTC settings. Here, we describe a fully automatic imaging system for quantifying food intake. We propose a novel deep convolutional encoder-decoder food network with depth-refinement (EDFN-D) using an RGB-D camera for quantifying a plate's remaining food volume relative to reference portions in whole and modified texture foods. We trained and validated the network on the pre-labelled UNIMIB2016 food dataset and tested on our two novel LTC-inspired plate datasets (689 plate images, 36 unique foods). EDFN-D performed comparably to depth-refined graph cut on IOU (0.879 vs. 0.887), with intake errors well below typical 50% (mean percent intake error: -4.2%). We identify how standard segmentation metrics are insufficient due to visual-volume discordance, and include volume disparity analysis to facilitate system trust. This system provides improved transparency, approximates human assessors with enhanced objectivity, accuracy, and precision while avoiding hefty semi-automatic method time requirements. This may help address short-comings currently limiting utility of automated early malnutrition detection in resource-constrained LTC and hospital settings."
Semantic Segmentation of Skin Lesions using a Small Data Set,"Early detection of melanoma is difficult for the human eye but a crucial step towards reducing its death rate. Computerized detection of these melanoma and other skin lesions is necessary. The central research question in this paper is ""How to segment skin lesion images using a neural network with low available data?"". This question is divided into three sub questions regarding best performing network structure, training data and training method. First theory associated with these questions is discussed. Literature states that U-net CNN structures have excellent performances on the segmentation task, more training data increases network performance and utilizing transfer learning enables networks to generalize to new data better.  To validate these findings in the literature two experiments are conducted. The first experiment trains a network on data sets of different size. The second experiment proposes twelve network structures and trains them on the same data set. The experimental results support the findings in the literature. The FCN16 and FCN32 networks perform best in the accuracy, intersection over union and mean BF1 Score metric. Concluding from these results the skin lesion segmentation network is a fully convolutional structure with a skip architecture and an encoder depth of either one or two. Weights of this network should be initialized using transfer learning from the pre trained VGG16 network. Training data should be cropped to reduce complexity and augmented during training to reduce the likelihood of overfitting."
Neural Ordinary Differential Equations for Semantic Segmentation of Individual Colon Glands,"Automated medical image segmentation plays a key role in quantitative research and diagnostics. Convolutional neural networks based on the U-Net architecture are the state-of-the-art. A key disadvantage is the hard-coding of the receptive field size, which requires architecture optimization for each segmentation task. Furthermore, increasing the receptive field results in an increasing number of weights. Recently, Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODE) have been proposed, a new type of continuous depth deep neural network. This framework allows for a dynamic receptive field at a fixed memory cost and a smaller amount of parameters. We show on a colon gland segmentation dataset (GlaS) that these NODEs can be used within the U-Net framework to improve segmentation results while reducing memory load and parameter counts."
Towards Automatic Annotation for Semantic Segmentation in Drone Videos,"Semantic segmentation is a crucial task for robot navigation and safety. However, it requires huge amounts of pixelwise annotations to yield accurate results. While recent progress in computer vision algorithms has been heavily boosted by large ground-level datasets, the labeling time has hampered progress in low altitude UAV applications, mostly due to the difficulty imposed by large object scales and pose variations. Motivated by the lack of a large video aerial dataset, we introduce a new one, with high resolution (4K) images and manually-annotated dense labels every 50 frames. To help the video labeling process, we make an important step towards automatic annotation and propose SegProp, an iterative flow-based method with geometric constrains to propagate the semantic labels to frames that lack human annotations. This results in a dataset with more than 50k annotated frames - the largest of its kind, to the best of our knowledge. Our experiments show that SegProp surpasses current state-of-the-art label propagation methods by a significant margin. Furthermore, when training a semantic segmentation deep neural net using the automatically annotated frames, we obtain a compelling overall performance boost at test time of 16.8% mean F-measure over a baseline trained only with manually-labeled frames.  Our Ruralscapes dataset, the label propagation code and a fast segmentation tool are available at our website: https://sites.google.com/site/aerialimageunderstanding/"
Correlation Maximized Structural Similarity Loss for Semantic Segmentation,"Most semantic segmentation models treat semantic segmentation as a pixel-wise classification task and use a pixel-wise classification error as their optimization criterions. However, the pixel-wise error ignores the strong dependencies among the pixels in an image, which limits the performance of the model. Several ways to incorporate the structure information of the objects have been investigated, \eg, conditional random fields (CRF), image structure priors based methods, and generative adversarial network (GAN). Nevertheless, these methods usually require extra model branches or additional memories, and some of them show limited improvements. In contrast, we propose a simple yet effective structural similarity loss (SSL) to encode the structure information of the objects, which only requires a few additional computational resources in the training phase. Inspired by the widely-used structural similarity (SSIM) index in image quality assessment, we use the linear correlation between two images to quantify their structural similarity. And the goal of the proposed SSL is to pay more attention to the positions, whose associated predictions lead to a low degree of linear correlation between two corresponding regions in the ground truth map and the predicted map. Thus the model can achieve a strong structural similarity between the two maps through minimizing the SSL over the whole map. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve substantial and consistent improvements in performance on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and Cityscapes datasets. The code will be released soon."
Deep Semantic Segmentation of Natural and Medical Images: A Review,"The semantic image segmentation task consists of classifying each pixel of an image into an instance, where each instance corresponds to a class. This task is a part of the concept of scene understanding or better explaining the global context of an image. In the medical image analysis domain, image segmentation can be used for image-guided interventions, radiotherapy, or improved radiological diagnostics. In this review, we categorize the leading deep learning-based medical and non-medical image segmentation solutions into six main groups of deep architectural, data synthesis-based, loss function-based, sequenced models, weakly supervised, and multi-task methods and provide a comprehensive review of the contributions in each of these groups. Further, for each group, we analyze each variant of these groups and discuss the limitations of the current approaches and present potential future research directions for semantic image segmentation."
Saliency Guided Self-attention Network for Weakly and Semi-supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) using only image-level labels can greatly reduce the annotation cost and therefore has attracted considerable research interest. However, its performance is still inferior to the fully supervised counterparts. To mitigate the performance gap, we propose a saliency guided self-attention network (SGAN) to address the WSSS problem. The introduced self-attention mechanism is able to capture rich and extensive contextual information but may mis-spread attentions to unexpected regions. In order to enable this mechanism to work effectively under weak supervision, we integrate class-agnostic saliency priors into the self-attention mechanism and utilize class-specific attention cues as an additional supervision for SGAN. Our SGAN is able to produce dense and accurate localization cues so that the segmentation performance is boosted. Moreover, by simply replacing the additional supervisions with partially labeled ground-truth, SGAN works effectively for semi-supervised semantic segmentation as well. Experiments on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and COCO datasets show that our approach outperforms all other state-of-the-art methods in both weakly and semi-supervised settings."
Multi-Stage Pathological Image Classification using Semantic Segmentation,"Histopathological image analysis is an essential process for the discovery of diseases such as cancer. However, it is challenging to train CNN on whole slide images (WSIs) of gigapixel resolution considering the available memory capacity. Most of the previous works divide high resolution WSIs into small image patches and separately input them into the model to classify it as a tumor or a normal tissue. However, patch-based classification uses only patch-scale local information but ignores the relationship between neighboring patches. If we consider the relationship of neighboring patches and global features, we can improve the classification performance. In this paper, we propose a new model structure combining the patch-based classification model and whole slide-scale segmentation model in order to improve the prediction performance of automatic pathological diagnosis. We extract patch features from the classification model and input them into the segmentation model to obtain a whole slide tumor probability heatmap. The classification model considers patch-scale local features, and the segmentation model can take global information into account. We also propose a new optimization method that retains gradient information and trains the model partially for end-to-end learning with limited GPU memory capacity. We apply our method to the tumor/normal prediction on WSIs and the classification performance is improved compared with the conventional patch-based method."
AdvSPADE: Realistic Unrestricted Attacks for Semantic Segmentation,"Due to the inherent robustness of segmentation models, traditional norm-bounded attack methods show limited effect on such type of models. In this paper, we focus on generating unrestricted adversarial examples for semantic segmentation models. We demonstrate a simple and effective method to generate unrestricted adversarial examples using conditional generative adversarial networks (CGAN) without any hand-crafted metric. The naïve implementation of CGAN, however, yields inferior image quality and low attack success rate. Instead, we leverage the SPADE (Spatially-adaptive denormalization) structure with an additional loss item to generate effective adversarial attacks in a single step. We validate our approach on the popular Cityscapes and ADE20K datasets, and demonstrate that our synthetic adversarial examples are not only realistic, but also improve the attack success rate by up to 41.0\% compared with the state of the art adversarial attack methods including PGD."
3D Neighborhood Convolution: Learning Depth-Aware Features for RGB-D and RGB Semantic Segmentation,"A key challenge for RGB-D segmentation is how to effectively incorporate 3D geometric information from the depth channel into 2D appearance features. We propose to model the effective receptive field of 2D convolution based on the scale and locality from the 3D neighborhood. Standard convolutions are local in the image space (u, v), often with a fixed receptive field of 3x3 pixels. We propose to define convolutions local with respect to the corresponding point in the 3D real-world space (x, y, z), where the depth channel is used to adapt the receptive field of the convolution, which yields the resulting filters invariant to scale and focusing on the certain range of depth. We introduce 3D Neighborhood Convolution (3DN-Conv), a convolutional operator around 3D neighborhoods. Further, we can use estimated depth to use our RGB-D based semantic segmentation model from RGB input. Experimental results validate that our proposed 3DN-Conv operator improves semantic segmentation, using either ground-truth depth (RGB-D) or estimated depth (RGB)."
CNN-based Semantic Segmentation using Level Set Loss,"Thesedays, Convolutional Neural Networks are widely used in semantic segmentation. However, since CNN-based segmentation networks produce low-resolution outputs with rich semantic information, it is inevitable that spatial details (e.g., small bjects and fine boundary information) of segmentation results will be lost. To address this problem, motivated by a variational approach to image segmentation (i.e., level set theory), we propose a novel loss function called the level set loss which is designed to refine spatial details of segmentation results. To deal with multiple classes in an image, we first decompose the ground truth into binary images. Note that each binary image consists of background and regions belonging to a class. Then we convert level set functions into class probability maps and calculate the energy for each class. The network is trained to minimize the weighted sum of the level set loss and the cross-entropy loss. The proposed level set loss improves the spatial details of segmentation results in a time and memory efficient way. Furthermore, our experimental results show that the proposed loss function achieves better performance than previous approaches."
RITnet: Real-time Semantic Segmentation of the Eye for Gaze Tracking,"Accurate eye segmentation can improve eye-gaze estimation and support interactive computing based on visual attention; however, existing eye segmentation methods suffer from issues such as person-dependent accuracy, lack of robustness, and an inability to be run in real-time. Here, we present the RITnet model, which is a deep neural network that combines U-Net and DenseNet. RITnet is under 1 MB and achieves 95.3\% accuracy on the 2019 OpenEDS Semantic Segmentation challenge. Using a GeForce GTX 1080 Ti, RITnet tracks at > 300Hz, enabling real-time gaze tracking applications. Pre-trained models and source code are available https://bitbucket.org/eye-ush/ritnet/."
Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation with Maximum Squares Loss,"Deep neural networks for semantic segmentation always require a large number of samples with pixel-level labels, which becomes the major difficulty in their real-world applications. To reduce the labeling cost, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) approaches are proposed to transfer knowledge from labeled synthesized datasets to unlabeled real-world datasets. Recently, some semi-supervised learning methods have been applied to UDA and achieved state-of-the-art performance. One of the most popular approaches in semi-supervised learning is the entropy minimization method. However, when applying the entropy minimization to UDA for semantic segmentation, the gradient of the entropy is biased towards samples that are easy to transfer. To balance the gradient of well-classified target samples, we propose the maximum squares loss. Our maximum squares loss prevents the training process being dominated by easy-to-transfer samples in the target domain. Besides, we introduce the image-wise weighting ratio to alleviate the class imbalance in the unlabeled target domain. Both synthetic-to-real and cross-city adaptation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. The code is released at https://github. com/ZJULearning/MaxSquareLoss."
Distributed Iterative Gating Networks for Semantic Segmentation,"In this paper, we present a canonical structure for controlling information flow in neural networks with an efficient feedback routing mechanism based on a strategy of Distributed Iterative Gating (DIGNet). The structure of this mechanism derives from a strong conceptual foundation and presents a light-weight mechanism for adaptive control of computation similar to recurrent convolutional neural networks by integrating feedback signals with a feed-forward architecture. In contrast to other RNN formulations, DIGNet generates feedback signals in a cascaded manner that implicitly carries information from all the layers above. This cascaded feedback propagation by means of the propagator gates is found to be more effective compared to other feedback mechanisms that use feedback from the output of either the corresponding stage or from the previous stage. Experiments reveal the high degree of capability that this recurrent approach with cascaded feedback presents over feed-forward baselines and other recurrent models for pixel-wise labeling problems on three challenging datasets, PASCAL VOC 2012, COCO-Stuff, and ADE20K."
Point Attention Network for Semantic Segmentation of 3D Point Clouds,"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have performed extremely well on data represented by regularly arranged grids such as images. However, directly leveraging the classic convolution kernels or parameter sharing mechanisms on sparse 3D point clouds is inefficient due to their irregular and unordered nature. We propose a point attention network that learns rich local shape features and their contextual correlations for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation. Since the geometric distribution of the neighboring points is invariant to the point ordering, we propose a Local Attention-Edge Convolution (LAE Conv) to construct a local graph based on the neighborhood points searched in multi-directions. We assign attention coefficients to each edge and then aggregate the point features as a weighted sum of its neighbors. The learned LAE-Conv layer features are then given to a point-wise spatial attention module to generate an interdependency matrix of all points regardless of their distances, which captures long-range spatial contextual features contributing to more precise semantic information. The proposed point attention network consists of an encoder and decoder which, together with the LAE-Conv layers and the point-wise spatial attention modules, make it an end-to-end trainable network for predicting dense labels for 3D point cloud segmentation. Experiments on challenging benchmarks of 3D point clouds show that our algorithm can perform at par or better than the existing state of the art methods."
Adaptive Class Weight based Dual Focal Loss for Improved Semantic Segmentation,"In this paper, we propose a Dual Focal Loss (DFL) function, as a replacement for the standard cross entropy (CE) function to achieve a better treatment of the unbalanced classes in a dataset. Our DFL method is an improvement on the recently reported Focal Loss (FL) cross-entropy function, which proposes a scaling method that puts more weight on the examples that are difficult to classify over those that are easy. However, the scaling parameter of FL is empirically set, which is problem-dependent. In addition, like other CE variants, FL only focuses on the loss of true classes. Therefore, no loss feedback is gained from the false classes. Although focusing only on true examples increases probability on true classes and correspondingly reduces probability on false classes due to the nature of the softmax function, it does not achieve the best convergence due to avoidance of the loss on false classes. Our DFL method improves on the simple FL in two ways. Firstly, it takes the idea of FL to focus more on difficult examples than the easy ones, but evaluates loss on both true and negative classes with equal importance. Secondly, the scaling parameter of DFL has been made learnable so that it can tune itself by backpropagation rather than being dependent on manual tuning. In this way, our proposed DFL method offers an auto-tunable loss function that can reduce the class imbalance effect as well as put more focus on both true difficult examples and negative easy examples."
Segmentation Transformer: Object-Contextual Representations for Semantic Segmentation,"In this paper, we address the semantic segmentation problem with a focus on the context aggregation strategy. Our motivation is that the label of a pixel is the category of the object that the pixel belongs to. We present a simple yet effective approach, object-contextual representations, characterizing a pixel by exploiting the representation of the corresponding object class. First, we learn object regions under the supervision of ground-truth segmentation. Second, we compute the object region representation by aggregating the representations of the pixels lying in the object region. Last, % the representation similarity we compute the relation between each pixel and each object region and augment the representation of each pixel with the object-contextual representation which is a weighted aggregation of all the object region representations according to their relations with the pixel. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves competitive performance on various challenging semantic segmentation benchmarks: Cityscapes, ADE20K, LIP, PASCAL-Context, and COCO-Stuff. Cityscapes, ADE20K, LIP, PASCAL-Context, and COCO-Stuff. Our submission ""HRNet + OCR + SegFix"" achieves 1-st place on the Cityscapes leaderboard by the time of submission. Code is available at: https://git.io/openseg and https://git.io/HRNet.OCR. We rephrase the object-contextual representation scheme using the Transformer encoder-decoder framework. The details are presented in~Section3.3."
Hierarchical Point-Edge Interaction Network for Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation,"We achieve 3D semantic scene labeling by exploring semantic relation between each point and its contextual neighbors through edges. Besides an encoder-decoder branch for predicting point labels, we construct an edge branch to hierarchically integrate point features and generate edge features. To incorporate point features in the edge branch, we establish a hierarchical graph framework, where the graph is initialized from a coarse layer and gradually enriched along the point decoding process. For each edge in the final graph, we predict a label to indicate the semantic consistency of the two connected points to enhance point prediction. At different layers, edge features are also fed into the corresponding point module to integrate contextual information for message passing enhancement in local regions. The two branches interact with each other and cooperate in segmentation. Decent experimental results on several 3D semantic labeling datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our work."
RAUNet: Residual Attention U-Net for Semantic Segmentation of Cataract Surgical Instruments,"Semantic segmentation of surgical instruments plays a crucial role in robot-assisted surgery. However, accurate segmentation of cataract surgical instruments is still a challenge due to specular reflection and class imbalance issues. In this paper, an attention-guided network is proposed to segment the cataract surgical instrument. A new attention module is designed to learn discriminative features and address the specular reflection issue. It captures global context and encodes semantic dependencies to emphasize key semantic features, boosting the feature representation. This attention module has very few parameters, which helps to save memory. Thus, it can be flexibly plugged into other networks. Besides, a hybrid loss is introduced to train our network for addressing the class imbalance issue, which merges cross entropy and logarithms of Dice loss. A new dataset named Cata7 is constructed to evaluate our network. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first cataract surgical instrument dataset for semantic segmentation. Based on this dataset, RAUNet achieves state-of-the-art performance 97.71% mean Dice and 95.62% mean IOU."
Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation Using Constrained Dominant Sets,"The availability of large-scale data sets is an essential pre-requisite for deep learning based semantic segmentation schemes. Since obtaining pixel-level labels is extremely expensive, supervising deep semantic segmentation networks using low-cost weak annotations has been an attractive research problem in recent years. In this work, we explore the potential of Constrained Dominant Sets (CDS) for generating multi-labeled full mask predictions to train a fully convolutional network (FCN) for semantic segmentation. Our experimental results show that using CDS's yields higher-quality mask predictions compared to methods that have been adopted in the literature for the same purpose."
ACFNet: Attentional Class Feature Network for Semantic Segmentation,"Recent works have made great progress in semantic segmentation by exploiting richer context, most of which are designed from a spatial perspective. In contrast to previous works, we present the concept of class center which extracts the global context from a categorical perspective. This class-level context describes the overall representation of each class in an image. We further propose a novel module, named Attentional Class Feature (ACF) module, to calculate and adaptively combine different class centers according to each pixel. Based on the ACF module, we introduce a coarse-to-fine segmentation network, called Attentional Class Feature Network (ACFNet), which can be composed of an ACF module and any off-the-shell segmentation network (base network). In this paper, we use two types of base networks to evaluate the effectiveness of ACFNet. We achieve new state-of-the-art performance of 81.85% mIoU on Cityscapes dataset with only finely annotated data used for training."
Feature Pyramid Encoding Network for Real-time Semantic Segmentation,"Although current deep learning methods have achieved impressive results for semantic segmentation, they incur high computational costs and have a huge number of parameters. For real-time applications, inference speed and memory usage are two important factors. To address the challenge, we propose a lightweight feature pyramid encoding network (FPENet) to make a good trade-off between accuracy and speed. Specifically, we use a feature pyramid encoding block to encode multi-scale contextual features with depthwise dilated convolutions in all stages of the encoder. A mutual embedding upsample module is introduced in the decoder to aggregate the high-level semantic features and low-level spatial details efficiently. The proposed network outperforms existing real-time methods with fewer parameters and improved inference speed on the Cityscapes and CamVid benchmark datasets. Specifically, FPENet achieves 68.0\% mean IoU on the Cityscapes test set with only 0.4M parameters and 102 FPS speed on an NVIDIA TITAN V GPU."
Extremely Weak Supervised Image-to-Image Translation for Semantic Segmentation,"Recent advances in generative models and adversarial training have led to a flourishing image-to-image (I2I) translation literature. The current I2I translation approaches require training images from the two domains that are either all paired (supervised) or all unpaired (unsupervised). In practice, obtaining paired training data in sufficient quantities is often very costly and cumbersome. Therefore solutions that employ unpaired data, while less accurate, are largely preferred. In this paper, we aim to bridge the gap between supervised and unsupervised I2I translation, with application to semantic image segmentation. We build upon pix2pix and CycleGAN, state-of-the-art seminal I2I translation techniques. We propose a method to select (very few) paired training samples and achieve significant improvements in both supervised and unsupervised I2I translation settings over random selection. Further, we boost the performance by incorporating both (selected) paired and unpaired samples in the training process. Our experiments show that an extremely weak supervised I2I translation solution using only one paired training sample can achieve a quantitative performance much better than the unsupervised CycleGAN model, and comparable to that of the supervised pix2pix model trained on thousands of pairs."
DS-PASS: Detail-Sensitive Panoramic Annular Semantic Segmentation through SwaftNet for Surrounding Sensing,"Semantically interpreting the traffic scene is crucial for autonomous transportation and robotics systems. However, state-of-the-art semantic segmentation pipelines are dominantly designed to work with pinhole cameras and train with narrow Field-of-View (FoV) images. In this sense, the perception capacity is severely limited to offer higher-level confidence for upstream navigation tasks. In this paper, we propose a network adaptation framework to achieve Panoramic Annular Semantic Segmentation (PASS), which allows to re-use conventional pinhole-view image datasets, enabling modern segmentation networks to comfortably adapt to panoramic images. Specifically, we adapt our proposed SwaftNet to enhance the sensitivity to details by implementing attention-based lateral connections between the detail-critical encoder layers and the context-critical decoder layers. We benchmark the performance of efficient segmenters on panoramic segmentation with our extended PASS dataset, demonstrating that the proposed real-time SwaftNet outperforms state-of-the-art efficient networks. Furthermore, we assess real-world performance when deploying the Detail-Sensitive PASS (DS-PASS) system on a mobile robot and an instrumented vehicle, as well as the benefit of panoramic semantics for visual odometry, showing the robustness and potential to support diverse navigational applications."
Graph-guided Architecture Search for Real-time Semantic Segmentation,"Designing a lightweight semantic segmentation network often requires researchers to find a trade-off between performance and speed, which is always empirical due to the limited interpretability of neural networks. In order to release researchers from these tedious mechanical trials, we propose a Graph-guided Architecture Search (GAS) pipeline to automatically search real-time semantic segmentation networks. Unlike previous works that use a simplified search space and stack a repeatable cell to form a network, we introduce a novel search mechanism with new search space where a lightweight model can be effectively explored through the cell-level diversity and latencyoriented constraint. Specifically, to produce the cell-level diversity, the cell-sharing constraint is eliminated through the cell-independent manner. Then a graph convolution network (GCN) is seamlessly integrated as a communication mechanism between cells. Finally, a latency-oriented constraint is endowed into the search process to balance the speed and performance. Extensive experiments on Cityscapes and CamVid datasets demonstrate that GAS achieves the new state-of-the-art trade-off between accuracy and speed. In particular, on Cityscapes dataset, GAS achieves the new best performance of 73.5% mIoU with speed of 108.4 FPS on Titan Xp."
3D Kidneys and Kidney Tumor Semantic Segmentation using Boundary-Aware Networks,"Automated segmentation of kidneys and kidney tumors is an important step in quantifying the tumor's morphometrical details to monitor the progression of the disease and accurately compare decisions regarding the kidney tumor treatment. Manual delineation techniques are often tedious, error-prone and require expert knowledge for creating unambiguous representation of kidneys and kidney tumors segmentation. In this work, we propose an end-to-end boundary aware fully Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for reliable kidney and kidney tumor semantic segmentation from arterial phase abdominal 3D CT scans. We propose a segmentation network consisting of an encoder-decoder architecture that specifically accounts for organ and tumor edge information by devising a dedicated boundary branch supervised by edge-aware loss terms. We have evaluated our model on 2019 MICCAI KiTS Kidney Tumor Segmentation Challenge dataset and our method has achieved dice scores of 0.9742 and 0.8103 for kidney and tumor repetitively and an overall composite dice score of 0.8923."
Fuzzy Semantic Segmentation of Breast Ultrasound Image with Breast Anatomy Constraints,"Breast cancer is one of the most serious disease affecting women's health. Due to low cost, portable, no radiation, and high efficiency, breast ultrasound (BUS) imaging is the most popular approach for diagnosing early breast cancer. However, ultrasound images are low resolution and poor quality. Thus, developing accurate detection system is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a fully automatic segmentation algorithm consisting of two parts: fuzzy fully convolutional network and accurately fine-tuning post-processing based on breast anatomy constraints. In the first part, the image is preprocessed by contrast enhancement, and wavelet features are employed for image augmentation. A fuzzy membership function transforms the augmented BUS images into fuzzy domain. The features from convolutional layers are processed using fuzzy logic as well. The conditional random fields (CRFs) post-process the segmentation result. The location relation among the breast anatomy layers is utilized to improve the performance. The proposed method is applied to the dataset with 325 BUS images, and achieves state-of-art performance compared with that of existing methods with true positive rate 90.33%, false positive rate 9.00%, and intersection over union (IoU) 81.29% on tumor category, and overall intersection over union (mIoU) 80.47% over five categories: fat layer, mammary layer, muscle layer, background, and tumor."
Sem-LSD: A Learning-based Semantic Line Segment Detector,"In this paper, we introduces a new type of line-shaped image representation, named semantic line segment (Sem-LS) and focus on solving its detection problem. Sem-LS contains high-level semantics and is a compact scene representation where only visually salient line segments with stable semantics are preserved. Combined with high-level semantics, Sem-LS is more robust under cluttered environment compared with existing line-shaped representations. The compactness of Sem-LS facilitates its use in large-scale applications, such as city-scale SLAM (simultaneously localization and mapping) and LCD (loop closure detection). Sem-LS detection is a challenging task due to its significantly different appearance from existing learning-based image representations such as wireframes and objects. For further investigation, we first label Sem-LS on two well-known datasets, KITTI and KAIST URBAN, as new benchmarks. Then, we propose a learning-based Sem-LS detector (Sem-LSD) and devise new module as well as metrics to address unique challenges in Sem-LS detection. Experimental results have shown both the efficacy and efficiency of Sem-LSD. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed Sem-LS is supported by two experiments on detector repeatability and a city-scale LCD problem. Labeled datasets and code will be released shortly."
Dual Graph Convolutional Network for Semantic Segmentation,"Exploiting long-range contextual information is key for pixel-wise prediction tasks such as semantic segmentation. In contrast to previous work that uses multi-scale feature fusion or dilated convolutions, we propose a novel graph-convolutional network (GCN) to address this problem. Our Dual Graph Convolutional Network (DGCNet) models the global context of the input feature by modelling two orthogonal graphs in a single framework. The first component models spatial relationships between pixels in the image, whilst the second models interdependencies along the channel dimensions of the network's feature map. This is done efficiently by projecting the feature into a new, lower-dimensional space where all pairwise interactions can be modelled, before reprojecting into the original space. Our simple method provides substantial benefits over a strong baseline and achieves state-of-the-art results on both Cityscapes (82.0% mean IoU) and Pascal Context (53.7% mean IoU) datasets. Code and models are made available to foster any further research (\url{https://github.com/lxtGH/GALD-DGCNet})."
Joint Learning of Saliency Detection and Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Existing weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) methods usually utilize the results of pre-trained saliency detection (SD) models without explicitly modeling the connections between the two tasks, which is not the most efficient configuration. Here we propose a unified multi-task learning framework to jointly solve WSSS and SD using a single network, \ie saliency, and segmentation network (SSNet). SSNet consists of a segmentation network (SN) and a saliency aggregation module (SAM). For an input image, SN generates the segmentation result and, SAM predicts the saliency of each category and aggregating the segmentation masks of all categories into a saliency map. The proposed network is trained end-to-end with image-level category labels and class-agnostic pixel-level saliency labels. Experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 segmentation dataset and four saliency benchmark datasets show the performance of our method compares favorably against state-of-the-art weakly supervised segmentation methods and fully supervised saliency detection methods."
Self-supervised Scale Equivariant Network for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Weakly supervised semantic segmentation has attracted much research interest in recent years considering its advantage of low labeling cost. Most of the advanced algorithms follow the design principle that expands and constrains the seed regions from class activation maps (CAM). As well-known, conventional CAM tends to be incomplete or over-activated due to weak supervision. Fortunately, we find that semantic segmentation has a characteristic of spatial transformation equivariance, which can form a few self-supervisions to help weakly supervised learning. This work mainly explores the advantages of scale equivariant constrains for CAM generation, formulated as a self-supervised scale equivariant network (SSENet). Specifically, a novel scale equivariant regularization is elaborately designed to ensure consistency of CAMs from the same input image with different resolutions. This novel scale equivariant regularization can guide the whole network to learn more accurate class activation. This regularized CAM can be embedded in most recent advanced weakly supervised semantic segmentation framework. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 datasets demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance both quantitatively and qualitatively for weakly supervised semantic segmentation. Code has been made available."
Squeeze-and-Attention Networks for Semantic Segmentation,"The recent integration of attention mechanisms into segmentation networks improves their representational capabilities through a great emphasis on more informative features. However, these attention mechanisms ignore an implicit sub-task of semantic segmentation and are constrained by the grid structure of convolution kernels. In this paper, we propose a novel squeeze-and-attention network (SANet) architecture that leverages an effective squeeze-and-attention (SA) module to account for two distinctive characteristics of segmentation: i) pixel-group attention, and ii) pixel-wise prediction. Specifically, the proposed SA modules impose pixel-group attention on conventional convolution by introducing an 'attention' convolutional channel, thus taking into account spatial-channel inter-dependencies in an efficient manner. The final segmentation results are produced by merging outputs from four hierarchical stages of a SANet to integrate multi-scale contexts for obtaining an enhanced pixel-wise prediction. Empirical experiments on two challenging public datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed SANets, which achieves 83.2% mIoU (without COCO pre-training) on PASCAL VOC and a state-of-the-art mIoU of 54.4% on PASCAL Context."
Semantic Correlation Promoted Shape-Variant Context for Segmentation,"Context is essential for semantic segmentation. Due to the diverse shapes of objects and their complex layout in various scene images, the spatial scales and shapes of contexts for different objects have very large variation. It is thus ineffective or inefficient to aggregate various context information from a predefined fixed region. In this work, we propose to generate a scale- and shape-variant semantic mask for each pixel to confine its contextual region. To this end, we first propose a novel paired convolution to infer the semantic correlation of the pair and based on that to generate a shape mask. Using the inferred spatial scope of the contextual region, we propose a shape-variant convolution, of which the receptive field is controlled by the shape mask that varies with the appearance of input. In this way, the proposed network aggregates the context information of a pixel from its semantic-correlated region instead of a predefined fixed region. Furthermore, this work also proposes a labeling denoising model to reduce wrong predictions caused by the noisy low-level features. Without bells and whistles, the proposed segmentation network achieves new state-of-the-arts consistently on the six public segmentation datasets."
Distance transform regression for spatially-aware deep semantic segmentation,"Understanding visual scenes relies more and more on dense pixel-wise classification obtained via deep fully convolutional neural networks. However, due to the nature of the networks, predictions often suffer from blurry boundaries and ill-segmented shapes, fueling the need for post-processing. This work introduces a new semantic segmentation regularization based on the regression of a distance transform. After computing the distance transform on the label masks, we train a FCN in a multi-task setting in both discrete and continuous spaces by learning jointly classification and distance regression. This requires almost no modification of the network structure and adds a very low overhead to the training process. Learning to approximate the distance transform back-propagates spatial cues that implicitly regularizes the segmentation. We validate this technique with several architectures on various datasets, and we show significant improvements compared to competitive baselines."
PASS3D: Precise and Accelerated Semantic Segmentation for 3D Point Cloud,"In this paper, we propose PASS3D to achieve point-wise semantic segmentation for 3D point cloud. Our framework combines the efficiency of traditional geometric methods with robustness of deep learning methods, consisting of two stages: At stage-1, our accelerated cluster proposal algorithm will generate refined cluster proposals by segmenting point clouds without ground, capable of generating less redundant proposals with higher recall in an extremely short time; stage-2 we will amplify and further process these proposals by a neural network to estimate semantic label for each point and meanwhile propose a novel data augmentation method to enhance the network's recognition capability for all categories especially for non-rigid objects. Evaluated on KITTI raw dataset, PASS3D stands out against the state-of-the-art on some results, making itself competent to 3D perception in autonomous driving system. Our source code will be open-sourced. A video demonstration is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cukEqDuP_Qw."
Adversarial Learning and Self-Teaching Techniques for Domain Adaptation in Semantic Segmentation,"Deep learning techniques have been widely used in autonomous driving systems for the semantic understanding of urban scenes. However, they need a huge amount of labeled data for training, which is difficult and expensive to acquire. A recently proposed workaround is to train deep networks using synthetic data, but the domain shift between real world and synthetic representations limits the performance. In this work, a novel Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) strategy is introduced to solve this issue. The proposed learning strategy is driven by three components: a standard supervised learning loss on labeled synthetic data; an adversarial learning module that exploits both labeled synthetic data and unlabeled real data; finally, a self-teaching strategy applied to unlabeled data. The last component exploits a region growing framework guided by the segmentation confidence. Furthermore, we weighted this component on the basis of the class frequencies to enhance the performance on less common classes. Experimental results prove the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in adapting a segmentation network trained on synthetic datasets, like GTA5 and SYNTHIA, to real world datasets like Cityscapes and Mapillary."
This is not what I imagined: Error Detection for Semantic Segmentation through Visual Dissimilarity,"There has been a remarkable progress in the accuracy of semantic segmentation due to the capabilities of deep learning. Unfortunately, these methods are not able to generalize much further than the distribution of their training data and fail to handle out-of-distribution classes appropriately. This limits the applicability to autonomous or safety critical systems. We propose a novel method leveraging generative models to detect wrongly segmented or out-of-distribution instances. Conditioned on the predicted semantic segmentation, an RGB image is generated. We then learn a dissimilarity metric that compares the generated image with the original input and detects inconsistencies introduced by the semantic segmentation. We present test cases for outlier and misclassification detection and evaluate our method qualitatively and quantitatively on multiple datasets."
Self-Ensembling with GAN-based Data Augmentation for Domain Adaptation in Semantic Segmentation,"Deep learning-based semantic segmentation methods have an intrinsic limitation that training a model requires a large amount of data with pixel-level annotations. To address this challenging issue, many researchers give attention to unsupervised domain adaptation for semantic segmentation. Unsupervised domain adaptation seeks to adapt the model trained on the source domain to the target domain. In this paper, we introduce a self-ensembling technique, one of the successful methods for domain adaptation in classification. However, applying self-ensembling to semantic segmentation is very difficult because heavily-tuned manual data augmentation used in self-ensembling is not useful to reduce the large domain gap in the semantic segmentation. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel framework consisting of two components, which are complementary to each other. First, we present a data augmentation method based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which is computationally efficient and effective to facilitate domain alignment. Given those augmented images, we apply self-ensembling to enhance the performance of the segmentation network on the target domain. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art semantic segmentation methods on unsupervised domain adaptation benchmarks."
Semantic Segmentation of Panoramic Images Using a Synthetic Dataset,"Panoramic images have advantages in information capacity and scene stability due to their large field of view (FoV). In this paper, we propose a method to synthesize a new dataset of panoramic image. We managed to stitch the images taken from different directions into panoramic images, together with their labeled images, to yield the panoramic semantic segmentation dataset denominated as SYNTHIA-PANO. For the purpose of finding out the effect of using panoramic images as training dataset, we designed and performed a comprehensive set of experiments. Experimental results show that using panoramic images as training data is beneficial to the segmentation result. In addition, it has been shown that by using panoramic images with a 180 degree FoV as training data the model has better performance. Furthermore, the model trained with panoramic images also has a better capacity to resist the image distortion."
Small Obstacle Avoidance Based on RGB-D Semantic Segmentation,"This paper presents a novel obstacle avoidance system for road robots equipped with RGB-D sensor that captures scenes of its way forward. The purpose of the system is to have road robots move around autonomously and constantly without any collision even with small obstacles, which are often missed by existing solutions. For each input RGB-D image, the system uses a new two-stage semantic segmentation network followed by the morphological processing to generate the accurate semantic map containing road and obstacles. Based on the map, the local path planning is applied to avoid possible collision. Additionally, optical flow supervision and motion blurring augmented training scheme is applied to improve temporal consistency between adjacent frames and overcome the disturbance caused by camera shake. Various experiments are conducted to show that the proposed architecture obtains high performance both in indoor and outdoor scenarios."
LU-Net: An Efficient Network for 3D LiDAR Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation Based on End-to-End-Learned 3D Features and U-Net,"We propose LU-Net -- for LiDAR U-Net, a new method for the semantic segmentation of a 3D LiDAR point cloud. Instead of applying some global 3D segmentation method such as PointNet, we propose an end-to-end architecture for LiDAR point cloud semantic segmentation that efficiently solves the problem as an image processing problem. We first extract high-level 3D features for each point given its 3D neighbors. Then, these features are projected into a 2D multichannel range-image by considering the topology of the sensor. Thanks to these learned features and this projection, we can finally perform the segmentation using a simple U-Net segmentation network, which performs very well while being very efficient. In this way, we can exploit both the 3D nature of the data and the specificity of the LiDAR sensor. This approach outperforms the state-of-the-art by a large margin on the KITTI dataset, as our experiments show. Moreover, this approach operates at 24fps on a single GPU. This is above the acquisition rate of common LiDAR sensors which makes it suitable for real-time applications."
Class-Based Styling: Real-time Localized Style Transfer with Semantic Segmentation,"We propose a Class-Based Styling method (CBS) that can map different styles for different object classes in real-time. CBS achieves real-time performance by carrying out two steps simultaneously. While a semantic segmentation method is used to obtain the mask of each object class in a video frame, a styling method is used to style that frame globally. Then an object class can be styled by combining the segmentation mask and the styled image. The user can also select multiple styles so that different object classes can have different styles in a single frame. For semantic segmentation, we leverage DABNet that achieves high accuracy, yet only has 0.76 million parameters and runs at 104 FPS. For the style transfer step, we use a popular real-time method proposed by Johnson et al. [7]. We evaluated CBS on a video of the CityScapes dataset and observed high-quality localized style transfer results for different object classes and real-time performance."
Customizable Architecture Search for Semantic Segmentation,"In this paper, we propose a Customizable Architecture Search (CAS) approach to automatically generate a network architecture for semantic image segmentation. The generated network consists of a sequence of stacked computation cells. A computation cell is represented as a directed acyclic graph, in which each node is a hidden representation (i.e., feature map) and each edge is associated with an operation (e.g., convolution and pooling), which transforms data to a new layer. During the training, the CAS algorithm explores the search space for an optimized computation cell to build a network. The cells of the same type share one architecture but with different weights. In real applications, however, an optimization may need to be conducted under some constraints such as GPU time and model size. To this end, a cost corresponding to the constraint will be assigned to each operation. When an operation is selected during the search, its associated cost will be added to the objective. As a result, our CAS is able to search an optimized architecture with customized constraints. The approach has been thoroughly evaluated on Cityscapes and CamVid datasets, and demonstrates superior performance over several state-of-the-art techniques. More remarkably, our CAS achieves 72.3% mIoU on the Cityscapes dataset with speed of 108 FPS on an Nvidia TitanXp GPU."
Constructing Self-motivated Pyramid Curriculums for Cross-Domain Semantic Segmentation: A Non-Adversarial Approach,"We propose a new approach, called self-motivated pyramid curriculum domain adaptation (PyCDA), to facilitate the adaptation of semantic segmentation neural networks from synthetic source domains to real target domains. Our approach draws on an insight connecting two existing works: curriculum domain adaptation and self-training. Inspired by the former, PyCDA constructs a pyramid curriculum which contains various properties about the target domain. Those properties are mainly about the desired label distributions over the target domain images, image regions, and pixels. By enforcing the segmentation neural network to observe those properties, we can improve the network's generalization capability to the target domain. Motivated by the self-training, we infer this pyramid of properties by resorting to the semantic segmentation network itself. Unlike prior work, we do not need to maintain any additional models (e.g., logistic regression or discriminator networks) or to solve minmax problems which are often difficult to optimize. We report state-of-the-art results for the adaptation from both GTAV and SYNTHIA to Cityscapes, two popular settings in unsupervised domain adaptation for semantic segmentation."
See More Than Once -- Kernel-Sharing Atrous Convolution for Semantic Segmentation,"The state-of-the-art semantic segmentation solutions usually leverage different receptive fields via multiple parallel branches to handle objects with different sizes. However, employing separate kernels for individual branches degrades the generalization and representation abilities of the network, and the number of parameters increases linearly in the number of branches. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel network structure namely Kernel-Sharing Atrous Convolution (KSAC), where branches of different receptive fields share the same kernel, i.e., let a single kernel see the input feature maps more than once with different receptive fields, to facilitate communication among branches and perform feature augmentation inside the network. Experiments conducted on the benchmark PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset show that the proposed sharing strategy can not only boost a network s generalization and representation abilities but also reduce the model complexity significantly. Specifically, on the validation set, whe compared with DeepLabV3+ equipped with MobileNetv2 backbone, 33% of parameters are reduced together with an mIOU improvement of 0.6%. When Xception is used as the backbone, the mIOU is elevated from 83.34% to 85.96% with about 10M parameters saved. In addition, different from the widely used ASPP structure, our proposed KSAC is able to further improve the mIOU by taking benefit of wider context with larger atrous rates. Finally, our KSAC achieves mIOUs of 88.1% and 45.47% on the PASCAL VOC 2012 test set and ADE20K dataset, respectively. Our full code will be released on the Github."
Linking Points With Labels in 3D: A Review of Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation,"3D Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation (PCSS) is attracting increasing interest, due to its applicability in remote sensing, computer vision and robotics, and due to the new possibilities offered by deep learning techniques. In order to provide a needed up-to-date review of recent developments in PCSS, this article summarizes existing studies on this topic. Firstly, we outline the acquisition and evolution of the 3D point cloud from the perspective of remote sensing and computer vision, as well as the published benchmarks for PCSS studies. Then, traditional and advanced techniques used for Point Cloud Segmentation (PCS) and PCSS are reviewed and compared. Finally, important issues and open questions in PCSS studies are discussed."
Feedbackward Decoding for Semantic Segmentation,"We propose a novel approach for semantic segmentation that uses an encoder in the reverse direction to decode. Many semantic segmentation networks adopt a feedforward encoder-decoder architecture. Typically, an input is first downsampled by the encoder to extract high-level semantic features and continues to be fed forward through the decoder module to recover low-level spatial clues. Our method works in an alternative direction that lets information flow backward from the last layer of the encoder towards the first. The encoder performs encoding in the forward pass and the same network performs decoding in the backward pass. Therefore, the encoder itself is also the decoder. Compared to conventional encoder-decoder architectures, ours doesn't require additional layers for decoding and further reuses the encoder weights thereby reducing the total number of parameters required for processing. We show by using only the 13 convolutional layers from VGG-16 plus one tiny classification layer, our model significantly outperforms other frequently cited models that are also adapted from VGG-16. On the Cityscapes semantic segmentation benchmark, our model uses 50.0% less parameters than SegNet and achieves an 18.1% higher ""IoU class"" score; it uses 28.3% less parameters than DeepLab LargeFOV and the achieved ""IoU class"" score is 3.9% higher; it uses 89.1% fewer parameters than FCN-8s and the achieved ""IoU class"" score is 3.1% higher. Our code will be publicly available on Github later."
Asymmetric Non-local Neural Networks for Semantic Segmentation,"The non-local module works as a particularly useful technique for semantic segmentation while criticized for its prohibitive computation and GPU memory occupation. In this paper, we present Asymmetric Non-local Neural Network to semantic segmentation, which has two prominent components: Asymmetric Pyramid Non-local Block (APNB) and Asymmetric Fusion Non-local Block (AFNB). APNB leverages a pyramid sampling module into the non-local block to largely reduce the computation and memory consumption without sacrificing the performance. AFNB is adapted from APNB to fuse the features of different levels under a sufficient consideration of long range dependencies and thus considerably improves the performance. Extensive experiments on semantic segmentation benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our work. In particular, we report the state-of-the-art performance of 81.3 mIoU on the Cityscapes test set. For a 256x128 input, APNB is around 6 times faster than a non-local block on GPU while 28 times smaller in GPU running memory occupation. Code is available at: https://github.com/MendelXu/ANN.git."
Semantic-Transferable Weakly-Supervised Endoscopic Lesions Segmentation,"Weakly-supervised learning under image-level labels supervision has been widely applied to semantic segmentation of medical lesions regions. However, 1) most existing models rely on effective constraints to explore the internal representation of lesions, which only produces inaccurate and coarse lesions regions; 2) they ignore the strong probabilistic dependencies between target lesions dataset (e.g., enteroscopy images) and well-to-annotated source diseases dataset (e.g., gastroscope images). To better utilize these dependencies, we present a new semantic lesions representation transfer model for weakly-supervised endoscopic lesions segmentation, which can exploit useful knowledge from relevant fully-labeled diseases segmentation task to enhance the performance of target weakly-labeled lesions segmentation task. More specifically, a pseudo label generator is proposed to leverage seed information to generate highly-confident pseudo pixel labels by incorporating class balance and super-pixel spatial prior. It can iteratively include more hard-to-transfer samples from weakly-labeled target dataset into training set. Afterwards, dynamically searched feature centroids for same class among different datasets are aligned by accumulating previously-learned features. Meanwhile, adversarial learning is also employed in this paper, to narrow the gap between the lesions among different datasets in output space. Finally, we build a new medical endoscopic dataset with 3659 images collected from more than 1100 volunteers. Extensive experiments on our collected dataset and several benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our model."
PANet: Few-Shot Image Semantic Segmentation with Prototype Alignment,"Despite the great progress made by deep CNNs in image semantic segmentation, they typically require a large number of densely-annotated images for training and are difficult to generalize to unseen object categories. Few-shot segmentation has thus been developed to learn to perform segmentation from only a few annotated examples. In this paper, we tackle the challenging few-shot segmentation problem from a metric learning perspective and present PANet, a novel prototype alignment network to better utilize the information of the support set. Our PANet learns class-specific prototype representations from a few support images within an embedding space and then performs segmentation over the query images through matching each pixel to the learned prototypes. With non-parametric metric learning, PANet offers high-quality prototypes that are representative for each semantic class and meanwhile discriminative for different classes. Moreover, PANet introduces a prototype alignment regularization between support and query. With this, PANet fully exploits knowledge from the support and provides better generalization on few-shot segmentation. Significantly, our model achieves the mIoU score of 48.1% and 55.7% on PASCAL-5i for 1-shot and 5-shot settings respectively, surpassing the state-of-the-art method by 1.8% and 8.6%."
See Clearer at Night: Towards Robust Nighttime Semantic Segmentation through Day-Night Image Conversion,"Currently, semantic segmentation shows remarkable efficiency and reliability in standard scenarios such as daytime scenes with favorable illumination conditions. However, in face of adverse conditions such as the nighttime, semantic segmentation loses its accuracy significantly. One of the main causes of the problem is the lack of sufficient annotated segmentation datasets of nighttime scenes. In this paper, we propose a framework to alleviate the accuracy decline when semantic segmentation is taken to adverse conditions by using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). To bridge the daytime and nighttime image domains, we made key observation that compared to datasets in adverse conditions, there are considerable amount of segmentation datasets in standard conditions such as BDD and our collected ZJU datasets. Our GAN-based nighttime semantic segmentation framework includes two methods. In the first method, GANs were used to translate nighttime images to the daytime, thus semantic segmentation can be performed using robust models already trained on daytime datasets. In another method, we use GANs to translate different ratio of daytime images in the dataset to the nighttime but still with their labels. In this sense, synthetic nighttime segmentation datasets can be generated to yield models prepared to operate at nighttime conditions robustly. In our experiment, the later method significantly boosts the performance at the nighttime evidenced by quantitative results using Intersection over Union (IoU) and Pixel Accuracy (Acc). We show that the performance varies with respect to the proportion of synthetic nighttime images in the dataset, where the sweet spot corresponds to most robust performance across the day and night."
Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation with High- and Low-level Consistency,"The ability to understand visual information from limited labeled data is an important aspect of machine learning. While image-level classification has been extensively studied in a semi-supervised setting, dense pixel-level classification with limited data has only drawn attention recently. In this work, we propose an approach for semi-supervised semantic segmentation that learns from limited pixel-wise annotated samples while exploiting additional annotation-free images. It uses two network branches that link semi-supervised classification with semi-supervised segmentation including self-training. The dual-branch approach reduces both the low-level and the high-level artifacts typical when training with few labels. The approach attains significant improvement over existing methods, especially when trained with very few labeled samples. On several standard benchmarks - PASCAL VOC 2012, PASCAL-Context, and Cityscapes - the approach achieves new state-of-the-art in semi-supervised learning."
Bayesian Generative Models for Knowledge Transfer in MRI Semantic Segmentation Problems,"Automatic segmentation methods based on deep learning have recently demonstrated state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the ordinary methods. Nevertheless, these methods are inapplicable for small datasets, which are very common in medical problems. To this end, we propose a knowledge transfer method between diseases via the Generative Bayesian Prior network. Our approach is compared to a pre-train approach and random initialization and obtains the best results in terms of Dice Similarity Coefficient metric for the small subsets of the Brain Tumor Segmentation 2018 database (BRATS2018)."
PS^2-Net: A Locally and Globally Aware Network for Point-Based Semantic Segmentation,"In this paper, we present the PS^2-Net -- a locally and globally aware deep learning framework for semantic segmentation on 3D scene-level point clouds. In order to deeply incorporate local structures and global context to support 3D scene segmentation, our network is built on four repeatedly stacked encoders, where each encoder has two basic components: EdgeConv that captures local structures and NetVLAD that models global context. Different from existing start-of-the-art methods for point-based scene semantic segmentation that either violate or do not achieve permutation invariance, our PS^2-Net is designed to be permutation invariant which is an essential property of any deep network used to process unordered point clouds. We further provide theoretical proof to guarantee the permutation invariance property of our network. We perform extensive experiments on two large-scale 3D indoor scene datasets and demonstrate that our PS2-Net is able to achieve state-of-the-art performances as compared to existing approaches."
DAPAS : Denoising Autoencoder to Prevent Adversarial attack in Semantic Segmentation,"Nowadays, Deep learning techniques show dramatic performance on computer vision area, and they even outperform human. But it is also vulnerable to some small perturbation called an adversarial attack. This is a problem combined with the safety of artificial intelligence, which has recently been studied a lot. These attacks have shown that they can fool models of image classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection. We point out this attack can be protected by denoise autoencoder, which is used for denoising the perturbation and restoring the original images. We experiment with various noise distributions and verify the effect of denoise autoencoder against adversarial attack in semantic segmentation."
Benchmarking the Robustness of Semantic Segmentation Models,"When designing a semantic segmentation module for a practical application, such as autonomous driving, it is crucial to understand the robustness of the module with respect to a wide range of image corruptions. While there are recent robustness studies for full-image classification, we are the first to present an exhaustive study for semantic segmentation, based on the state-of-the-art model DeepLabv3+. To increase the realism of our study, we utilize almost 400,000 images generated from Cityscapes, PASCAL VOC 2012, and ADE20K. Based on the benchmark study, we gain several new insights. Firstly, contrary to full-image classification, model robustness increases with model performance, in most cases. Secondly, some architecture properties affect robustness significantly, such as a Dense Prediction Cell, which was designed to maximize performance on clean data only."
Frame-to-Frame Aggregation of Active Regions in Web Videos for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"When a deep neural network is trained on data with only image-level labeling, the regions activated in each image tend to identify only a small region of the target object. We propose a method of using videos automatically harvested from the web to identify a larger region of the target object by using temporal information, which is not present in the static image. The temporal variations in a video allow different regions of the target object to be activated. We obtain an activated region in each frame of a video, and then aggregate the regions from successive frames into a single image, using a warping technique based on optical flow. The resulting localization maps cover more of the target object, and can then be used as proxy ground-truth to train a segmentation network. This simple approach outperforms existing methods under the same level of supervision, and even approaches relying on extra annotations. Based on VGG-16 and ResNet 101 backbones, our method achieves the mIoU of 65.0 and 67.4, respectively, on PASCAL VOC 2012 test images, which represents a new state-of-the-art."
Distance Map Loss Penalty Term for Semantic Segmentation,"Convolutional neural networks for semantic segmentation suffer from low performance at object boundaries. In medical imaging, accurate representation of tissue surfaces and volumes is important for tracking of disease biomarkers such as tissue morphology and shape features. In this work, we propose a novel distance map derived loss penalty term for semantic segmentation. We propose to use distance maps, derived from ground truth masks, to create a penalty term, guiding the network's focus towards hard-to-segment boundary regions. We investigate the effects of this penalizing factor against cross-entropy, Dice, and focal loss, among others, evaluating performance on a 3D MRI bone segmentation task from the publicly available Osteoarthritis Initiative dataset. We observe a significant improvement in the quality of segmentation, with better shape preservation at bone boundaries and areas affected by partial volume. We ultimately aim to use our loss penalty term to improve the extraction of shape biomarkers and derive metrics to quantitatively evaluate the preservation of shape."
I Bet You Are Wrong: Gambling Adversarial Networks for Structured Semantic Segmentation,"Adversarial training has been recently employed for realizing structured semantic segmentation, in which the aim is to preserve higher-level scene structural consistencies in dense predictions. However, as we show, value-based discrimination between the predictions from the segmentation network and ground-truth annotations can hinder the training process from learning to improve structural qualities as well as disabling the network from properly expressing uncertainties. In this paper, we rethink adversarial training for semantic segmentation and propose to formulate the fake/real discrimination framework with a correct/incorrect training objective. More specifically, we replace the discriminator with a ""gambler"" network that learns to spot and distribute its budget in areas where the predictions are clearly wrong, while the segmenter network tries to leave no clear clues for the gambler where to bet. Empirical evaluation on two road-scene semantic segmentation tasks shows that not only does the proposed method re-enable expressing uncertainties, it also improves pixel-wise and structure-based metrics."
SqueezeNAS: Fast neural architecture search for faster semantic segmentation,"For real time applications utilizing Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), it is critical that the models achieve high-accuracy on the target task and low-latency inference on the target computing platform. While Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has been effectively used to develop low-latency networks for image classification, there has been relatively little effort to use NAS to optimize DNN architectures for other vision tasks. In this work, we present what we believe to be the first proxyless hardware-aware search targeted for dense semantic segmentation. With this approach, we advance the state-of-the-art accuracy for latency-optimized networks on the Cityscapes semantic segmentation dataset. Our latency-optimized small SqueezeNAS network achieves 68.02% validation class mIOU with less than 35 ms inference times on the NVIDIA AGX Xavier. Our latency-optimized large SqueezeNAS network achieves 73.62% class mIOU with less than 100 ms inference times. We demonstrate that significant performance gains are possible by utilizing NAS to find networks optimized for both the specific task and inference hardware. We also present detailed analysis comparing our networks to recent state-of-the-art architectures."
Adversarially Trained Convolutional Neural Networks for Semantic Segmentation of Ischaemic Stroke Lesion using Multisequence Magnetic Resonance Imaging,"Ischaemic stroke is a medical condition caused by occlusion of blood supply to the brain tissue thus forming a lesion. A lesion is zoned into a core associated with irreversible necrosis typically located at the center of the lesion, while reversible hypoxic changes in the outer regions of the lesion are termed as the penumbra. Early estimation of core and penumbra in ischaemic stroke is crucial for timely intervention with thrombolytic therapy to reverse the damage and restore normalcy. Multisequence magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is commonly employed for clinical diagnosis. However, a sequence singly has not been found to be sufficiently able to differentiate between core and penumbra, while a combination of sequences is required to determine the extent of the damage. The challenge, however, is that with an increase in the number of sequences, it cognitively taxes the clinician to discover symptomatic biomarkers in these images. In this paper, we present a data-driven fully automated method for estimation of core and penumbra in ischaemic lesions using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) sequence maps of MRI. The method employs recent developments in convolutional neural networks (CNN) for semantic segmentation in medical images. In the absence of availability of a large amount of labeled data, the CNN is trained using an adversarial approach employing cross-entropy as a segmentation loss along with losses aggregated from three discriminators of which two employ relativistic visual Turing test. This method is experimentally validated on the ISLES-2015 dataset through three-fold cross-validation to obtain with an average Dice score of 0.82 and 0.73 for segmentation of penumbra and core respectively."
Simultaneous Semantic Segmentation and Outlier Detection in Presence of Domain Shift,"Recent success on realistic road driving datasets has increased interest in exploring robust performance in real-world applications. One of the major unsolved problems is to identify image content which can not be reliably recognized with a given inference engine. We therefore study approaches to recover a dense outlier map alongside the primary task with a single forward pass, by relying on shared convolutional features. We consider semantic segmentation as the primary task and perform extensive validation on WildDash val (inliers), LSUN val (outliers), and pasted objects from Pascal VOC 2007 (outliers). We achieve the best validation performance by training to discriminate inliers from pasted ImageNet-1k content, even though ImageNet-1k contains many road-driving pixels, and, at least nominally, fails to account for the full diversity of the visual world. The proposed two-head model performs comparably to the C-way multi-class model trained to predict uniform distribution in outliers, while outperforming several other validated approaches. We evaluate our best two models on the WildDash test dataset and set a new state of the art on the WildDash benchmark."
Expectation-Maximization Attention Networks for Semantic Segmentation,"Self-attention mechanism has been widely used for various tasks. It is designed to compute the representation of each position by a weighted sum of the features at all positions. Thus, it can capture long-range relations for computer vision tasks. However, it is computationally consuming. Since the attention maps are computed w.r.t all other positions. In this paper, we formulate the attention mechanism into an expectation-maximization manner and iteratively estimate a much more compact set of bases upon which the attention maps are computed. By a weighted summation upon these bases, the resulting representation is low-rank and deprecates noisy information from the input. The proposed Expectation-Maximization Attention (EMA) module is robust to the variance of input and is also friendly in memory and computation. Moreover, we set up the bases maintenance and normalization methods to stabilize its training procedure. We conduct extensive experiments on popular semantic segmentation benchmarks including PASCAL VOC, PASCAL Context and COCO Stuff, on which we set new records."
Incremental Learning Techniques for Semantic Segmentation,"Deep learning architectures exhibit a critical drop of performance due to catastrophic forgetting when they are required to incrementally learn new tasks. Contemporary incremental learning frameworks focus on image classification and object detection while in this work we formally introduce the incremental learning problem for semantic segmentation in which a pixel-wise labeling is considered. To tackle this task we propose to distill the knowledge of the previous model to retain the information about previously learned classes, whilst updating the current model to learn the new ones. We propose various approaches working both on the output logits and on intermediate features. In opposition to some recent frameworks, we do not store any image from previously learned classes and only the last model is needed to preserve high accuracy on these classes. The experimental evaluation on the Pascal VOC2012 dataset shows the effectiveness of the proposed approaches."
Grid Saliency for Context Explanations of Semantic Segmentation,"Recently, there has been a growing interest in developing saliency methods that provide visual explanations of network predictions. Still, the usability of existing methods is limited to image classification models. To overcome this limitation, we extend the existing approaches to generate grid saliencies, which provide spatially coherent visual explanations for (pixel-level) dense prediction networks. As the proposed grid saliency allows to spatially disentangle the object and its context, we specifically explore its potential to produce context explanations for semantic segmentation networks, discovering which context most influences the class predictions inside a target object area. We investigate the effectiveness of grid saliency on a synthetic dataset with an artificially induced bias between objects and their context as well as on the real-world Cityscapes dataset using state-of-the-art segmentation networks. Our results show that grid saliency can be successfully used to provide easily interpretable context explanations and, moreover, can be employed for detecting and localizing contextual biases present in the data."
ColorMapGAN: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation Using Color Mapping Generative Adversarial Networks,"Due to the various reasons such as atmospheric effects and differences in acquisition, it is often the case that there exists a large difference between spectral bands of satellite images collected from different geographic locations. The large shift between spectral distributions of training and test data causes the current state of the art supervised learning approaches to output unsatisfactory maps. We present a novel semantic segmentation framework that is robust to such shift. The key component of the proposed framework is Color Mapping Generative Adversarial Networks (ColorMapGAN), which can generate fake training images that are semantically exactly the same as training images, but whose spectral distribution is similar to the distribution of the test images. We then use the fake images and the ground-truth for the training images to fine-tune the already trained classifier. Contrary to the existing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), the generator in ColorMapGAN does not have any convolutional or pooling layers. It learns to transform the colors of the training data to the colors of the test data by performing only one element-wise matrix multiplication and one matrix addition operations. Thanks to the architecturally simple but powerful design of ColorMapGAN, the proposed framework outperforms the existing approaches with a large margin in terms of both accuracy and computational complexity."
Orientation-aware Semantic Segmentation on Icosahedron Spheres,"We address semantic segmentation on omnidirectional images, to leverage a holistic understanding of the surrounding scene for applications like autonomous driving systems. For the spherical domain, several methods recently adopt an icosahedron mesh, but systems are typically rotation invariant or require significant memory and parameters, thus enabling execution only at very low resolutions. In our work, we propose an orientation-aware CNN framework for the icosahedron mesh. Our representation allows for fast network operations, as our design simplifies to standard network operations of classical CNNs, but under consideration of north-aligned kernel convolutions for features on the sphere. We implement our representation and demonstrate its memory efficiency up-to a level-8 resolution mesh (equivalent to 640 x 1024 equirectangular images). Finally, since our kernels operate on the tangent of the sphere, standard feature weights, pretrained on perspective data, can be directly transferred with only small need for weight refinement. In our evaluation our orientation-aware CNN becomes a new state of the art for the recent 2D3DS dataset, and our Omni-SYNTHIA version of SYNTHIA. Rotation invariant classification and segmentation tasks are additionally presented for comparison to prior art."
Regularizing Proxies with Multi-Adversarial Training for Unsupervised Domain-Adaptive Semantic Segmentation,"Training a semantic segmentation model requires a large amount of pixel-level annotation, hampering its application at scale. With computer graphics, we can generate almost unlimited training data with precise annotation. However,a deep model trained with synthetic data usually cannot directly generalize well to realistic images due to domain shift. It has been observed that highly confident labels for the unlabeled real images may be predicted relying on the labeled synthetic data. To tackle the unsupervised domain adaptation problem, we explore the possibilities to generate high-quality labels as proxy labels to supervise the training on target data. Specifically, we propose a novel proxy-based method using multi-adversarial training. We first train the model using synthetic data (source domain). Multiple discriminators are used to align the features be-tween the source and target domain (real images) at different levels. Then we focus on obtaining and selecting high-quality proxy labels by incorporating both the confidence of the class predictor and that from the adversarial discriminators. Our discriminators not only work as a regularizer to encourage feature alignment but also provide an alternative confidence measure for generating proxy labels. Relying on the generated high-quality proxies, our model can be trained in a ""supervised manner"" on the target do-main. On two major tasks, GTA5->Cityscapes and SYNTHIA->Cityscapes, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming the previous by a large margin."
Interlaced Sparse Self-Attention for Semantic Segmentation,"In this paper, we present a so-called interlaced sparse self-attention approach to improve the efficiency of the \emph{self-attention} mechanism for semantic segmentation. The main idea is that we factorize the dense affinity matrix as the product of two sparse affinity matrices. There are two successive attention modules each estimating a sparse affinity matrix. The first attention module is used to estimate the affinities within a subset of positions that have long spatial interval distances and the second attention module is used to estimate the affinities within a subset of positions that have short spatial interval distances. These two attention modules are designed so that each position is able to receive the information from all the other positions. In contrast to the original self-attention module, our approach decreases the computation and memory complexity substantially especially when processing high-resolution feature maps. We empirically verify the effectiveness of our approach on six challenging semantic segmentation benchmarks."
DAR-Net: Dynamic Aggregation Network for Semantic Scene Segmentation,"Traditional grid/neighbor-based static pooling has become a constraint for point cloud geometry analysis. In this paper, we propose DAR-Net, a novel network architecture that focuses on dynamic feature aggregation. The central idea of DAR-Net is generating a self-adaptive pooling skeleton that considers both scene complexity and local geometry features. Providing variable semi-local receptive fields and weights, the skeleton serves as a bridge that connect local convolutional feature extractors and a global recurrent feature integrator. Experimental results on indoor scene datasets show advantages of the proposed approach compared to state-of-the-art architectures that adopt static pooling methods."
A Comparative Study of High-Recall Real-Time Semantic Segmentation Based on Swift Factorized Network,"Semantic Segmentation (SS) is the task to assign a semantic label to each pixel of the observed images, which is of crucial significance for autonomous vehicles, navigation assistance systems for the visually impaired, and augmented reality devices. However, there is still a long way for SS to be put into practice as there are two essential challenges that need to be addressed: efficiency and evaluation criterions for practical application. For specific application scenarios, different criterions need to be adopted. Recall rate is an important criterion for many tasks like autonomous vehicles. For autonomous vehicles, we need to focus on the detection of the traffic objects like cars, buses, and pedestrians, which should be detected with high recall rates. In other words, it is preferable to detect it wrongly than miss it, because the other traffic objects will be dangerous if the algorithm miss them and segment them as safe roadways. In this paper, our main goal is to explore possible methods to attain high recall rate. Firstly, we propose a real-time SS network named Swift Factorized Network (SFN). The proposed network is adapted from SwiftNet, whose structure is a typical U-shape structure with lateral connections. Inspired by ERFNet and Global convolution Networks (GCNet), we propose two different blocks to enlarge valid receptive field. They do not take up too much calculation resources, but significantly enhance the performance compared with the baseline network. Secondly, we explore three ways to achieve higher recall rate, i.e. loss function, classifier and decision rules. We perform a comprehensive set of experiments on state-of-the-art datasets including CamVid and Cityscapes. We demonstrate that our SS convolutional neural networks reach excellent performance. Furthermore, we make a detailed analysis and comparison of the three proposed methods on the promotion of recall rate."
DABNet: Depth-wise Asymmetric Bottleneck for Real-time Semantic Segmentation,"As a pixel-level prediction task, semantic segmentation needs large computational cost with enormous parameters to obtain high performance. Recently, due to the increasing demand for autonomous systems and robots, it is significant to make a tradeoff between accuracy and inference speed. In this paper, we propose a novel Depthwise Asymmetric Bottleneck (DAB) module to address this dilemma, which efficiently adopts depth-wise asymmetric convolution and dilated convolution to build a bottleneck structure. Based on the DAB module, we design a Depth-wise Asymmetric Bottleneck Network (DABNet) especially for real-time semantic segmentation, which creates sufficient receptive field and densely utilizes the contextual information. Experiments on Cityscapes and CamVid datasets demonstrate that the proposed DABNet achieves a balance between speed and precision. Specifically, without any pretrained model and postprocessing, it achieves 70.1% Mean IoU on the Cityscapes test dataset with only 0.76 million parameters and a speed of 104 FPS on a single GTX 1080Ti card."
Importance-Aware Semantic Segmentation with Efficient Pyramidal Context Network for Navigational Assistant Systems,"Semantic Segmentation (SS) is a task to assign semantic label to each pixel of the images, which is of immense significance for autonomous vehicles, robotics and assisted navigation of vulnerable road users. It is obvious that in different application scenarios, different objects possess hierarchical importance and safety-relevance, but conventional loss functions like cross entropy have not taken the different levels of importance of diverse traffic elements into consideration. To address this dilemma, we leverage and re-design an importance-aware loss function, throwing insightful hints on how importance of semantics are assigned for real-world applications. To customize semantic segmentation networks for different navigational tasks, we extend ERF-PSPNet, a real-time segmenter designed for wearable device aiding visually impaired pedestrians, and propose BiERF-PSPNet, which can yield high-quality segmentation maps with finer spatial details exceptionally suitable for autonomous vehicles. A comprehensive variety of experiments with these efficient pyramidal context networks on CamVid and Cityscapes datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposal to support diverse navigational assistant systems."
Cross Attention Network for Semantic Segmentation,"In this paper, we address the semantic segmentation task with a deep network that combines contextual features and spatial information. The proposed Cross Attention Network is composed of two branches and a Feature Cross Attention (FCA) module. Specifically, a shallow branch is used to preserve low-level spatial information and a deep branch is employed to extract high-level contextual features. Then the FCA module is introduced to combine these two branches. Different from most existing attention mechanisms, the FCA module obtains spatial attention map and channel attention map from two branches separately, and then fuses them. The contextual features are used to provide global contextual guidance in fused feature maps, and spatial features are used to refine localizations. The proposed network outperforms other real-time methods with improved speed on the Cityscapes and CamVid datasets with lightweight backbones, and achieves state-of-the-art performance with a deep backbone."
Segmenting Objects in Day and Night:Edge-Conditioned CNN for Thermal Image Semantic Segmentation,"Despite much research progress in image semantic segmentation, it remains challenging under adverse environmental conditions caused by imaging limitations of visible spectrum. While thermal infrared cameras have several advantages over cameras for the visible spectrum, such as operating in total darkness, insensitive to illumination variations, robust to shadow effects and strong ability to penetrate haze and smog. These advantages of thermal infrared cameras make the segmentation of semantic objects in day and night. In this paper, we propose a novel network architecture, called edge-conditioned convolutional neural network (EC-CNN), for thermal image semantic segmentation. Particularly, we elaborately design a gated feature-wise transform layer in EC-CNN to adaptively incorporate edge prior knowledge. The whole EC-CNN is end-to-end trained, and can generate high-quality segmentation results with the edge guidance. Meanwhile, we also introduce a new benchmark dataset named ""Segment Objects in Day And night""(SODA) for comprehensive evaluations in thermal image semantic segmentation. SODA contains over 7,168 manually annotated and synthetically generated thermal images with 20 semantic region labels and from a broad range of viewpoints and scene complexities. Extensive experiments on SODA demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed EC-CNN against the state-of-the-art methods."
Exploring Semantic Segmentation on the DCT Representation,"Typical convolutional networks are trained and conducted on RGB images. However, images are often compressed for memory savings and efficient transmission in real-world applications. In this paper, we explore methods for performing semantic segmentation on the discrete cosine transform (DCT) representation defined by the JPEG standard. We first rearrange the DCT coefficients to form a preferred input type, then we tailor an existing network to the DCT inputs. The proposed method has an accuracy close to the RGB model at about the same network complexity. Moreover, we investigate the impact of selecting different DCT components on segmentation performance. With a proper selection, one can achieve the same level accuracy using only 36% of the DCT coefficients. We further show the robustness of our method under the quantization errors. To our knowledge, this paper is the first to explore semantic segmentation on the DCT representation."
Incremental Class Discovery for Semantic Segmentation with RGBD Sensing,"This work addresses the task of open world semantic segmentation using RGBD sensing to discover new semantic classes over time. Although there are many types of objects in the real-word, current semantic segmentation methods make a closed world assumption and are trained only to segment a limited number of object classes. Towards a more open world approach, we propose a novel method that incrementally learns new classes for image segmentation. The proposed system first segments each RGBD frame using both color and geometric information, and then aggregates that information to build a single segmented dense 3D map of the environment. The segmented 3D map representation is a key component of our approach as it is used to discover new object classes by identifying coherent regions in the 3D map that have no semantic label. The use of coherent region in the 3D map as a primitive element, rather than traditional elements such as surfels or voxels, also significantly reduces the computational complexity and memory use of our method. It thus leads to semi-real-time performance at {10.7}Hz when incrementally updating the dense 3D map at every frame. Through experiments on the NYUDv2 dataset, we demonstrate that the proposed method is able to correctly cluster objects of both known and unseen classes. We also show the quantitative comparison with the state-of-the-art supervised methods, the processing time of each step, and the influences of each component."
Multi-Class Lane Semantic Segmentation using Efficient Convolutional Networks,"Lane detection plays an important role in a self-driving vehicle. Several studies leverage a semantic segmentation network to extract robust lane features, but few of them can distinguish different types of lanes. In this paper, we focus on the problem of multi-class lane semantic segmentation. Based on the observation that the lane is a small-size and narrow-width object in a road scene image, we propose two techniques, Feature Size Selection (FSS) and Degressive Dilation Block (DD Block). The FSS allows a network to extract thin lane features using appropriate feature sizes. To acquire fine-grained spatial information, the DD Block is made of a series of dilated convolutions with degressive dilation rates. Experimental results show that the proposed techniques provide obvious improvement in accuracy, while they achieve the same or faster inference speed compared to the baseline system, and can run at real-time on high-resolution images."
FD-FCN: 3D Fully Dense and Fully Convolutional Network for Semantic Segmentation of Brain Anatomy,"In this paper, a 3D patch-based fully dense and fully convolutional network (FD-FCN) is proposed for fast and accurate segmentation of subcortical structures in T1-weighted magnetic resonance images. Developed from the seminal FCN with an end-to-end learning-based approach and constructed by newly designed dense blocks including a dense fully-connected layer, the proposed FD-FCN is different from other FCN-based methods and leads to an outperformance in the perspective of both efficiency and accuracy. Compared with the U-shaped architecture, FD-FCN discards the upsampling path for model fitness. To alleviate the problem of parameter explosion, the inputs of dense blocks are no longer directly passed to subsequent layers. This architecture of FD-FCN brings a great reduction on both memory and time consumption in training process. Although FD-FCN is slimmed down, in model competence it gains better capability of dense inference than other conventional networks. This benefits from the construction of network architecture and the incorporation of redesigned dense blocks. The multi-scale FD-FCN models both local and global context by embedding intermediate-layer outputs in the final prediction, which encourages consistency between features extracted at different scales and embeds fine-grained information directly in the segmentation process. In addition, dense blocks are rebuilt to enlarge the receptive fields without significantly increasing parameters, and spectral coordinates are exploited for spatial context of the original input patch. The experiments were performed over the IBSR dataset, and FD-FCN produced an accurate segmentation result of overall Dice overlap value of 89.81% for 11 brain structures in 53 seconds, with at least 3.66% absolute improvement of dice accuracy than state-of-the-art 3D FCN-based methods."
Efficient Segmentation: Learning Downsampling Near Semantic Boundaries,"Many automated processes such as auto-piloting rely on a good semantic segmentation as a critical component. To speed up performance, it is common to downsample the input frame. However, this comes at the cost of missed small objects and reduced accuracy at semantic boundaries. To address this problem, we propose a new content-adaptive downsampling technique that learns to favor sampling locations near semantic boundaries of target classes. Cost-performance analysis shows that our method consistently outperforms the uniform sampling improving balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. Our adaptive sampling gives segmentation with better quality of boundaries and more reliable support for smaller-size objects."
Data Selection for training Semantic Segmentation CNNs with cross-dataset weak supervision,"Training convolutional networks for semantic segmentation with strong (per-pixel) and weak (per-bounding-box) supervision requires a large amount of weakly labeled data. We propose two methods for selecting the most relevant data with weak supervision. The first method is designed for finding visually similar images without the need of labels and is based on modeling image representations with a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). As a byproduct of GMM modeling, we present useful insights on characterizing the data generating distribution. The second method aims at finding images with high object diversity and requires only the bounding box labels. Both methods are developed in the context of automated driving and experimentation is conducted on Cityscapes and Open Images datasets. We demonstrate performance gains by reducing the amount of employed weakly labeled images up to 100 times for Open Images and up to 20 times for Cityscapes."
Improving Semantic Segmentation via Dilated Affinity,"Introducing explicit constraints on the structural predictions has been an effective way to improve the performance of semantic segmentation models. Existing methods are mainly based on insufficient hand-crafted rules that only partially capture the image structure, and some methods can also suffer from the efficiency issue. As a result, most of the state-of-the-art fully convolutional networks did not adopt these techniques. In this work, we propose a simple, fast yet effective method that exploits structural information through direct supervision with minor additional expense. To be specific, our method explicitly requires the network to predict semantic segmentation as well as dilated affinity, which is a sparse version of pair-wise pixel affinity. The capability of telling the relationships between pixels are directly built into the model and enhance the quality of segmentation in two stages. 1) Joint training with dilated affinity can provide robust feature representations and thus lead to finer segmentation results. 2) The extra output of affinity information can be further utilized to refine the original segmentation with a fast propagation process. Consistent improvements are observed on various benchmark datasets when applying our framework to the existing state-of-the-art model. Codes will be released soon."
Mango Tree Net -- A fully convolutional network for semantic segmentation and individual crown detection of mango trees,"This work presents a method for semantic segmentation of mango trees in high resolution aerial imagery, and, a novel method for individual crown detection of mango trees using segmentation output. Mango Tree Net, a fully convolutional neural network (FCN), is trained using supervised learning to perform semantic segmentation of mango trees in imagery acquired using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The proposed network is retrained to separate touching/overlapping tree crowns in segmentation output. Contour based connected object detection is performed on the segmentation output from retrained network. Bounding boxes are drawn on the original images using coordinates of connected objects to achieve individual crown detection. The training dataset consists of 8,824 image patches of size 240 x 240. The approach is tested for performance on segmentation and individual crown detection tasks using test datasets containing 36 and 4 images respectively. The performance is analyzed using standard metrics precision, recall, f1-score and accuracy. Results obtained demonstrate the robustness of the proposed methods despite variations in factors such as scale, occlusion, lighting conditions and surrounding vegetation."
Adaptive Context Encoding Module for Semantic Segmentation,"The object sizes in images are diverse, therefore, capturing multiple scale context information is essential for semantic segmentation. Existing context aggregation methods such as pyramid pooling module (PPM) and atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) design different pooling size or atrous rate, such that multiple scale information is captured. However, the pooling sizes and atrous rates are chosen manually and empirically. In order to capture object context information adaptively, in this paper, we propose an adaptive context encoding (ACE) module based on deformable convolution operation to argument multiple scale information. Our ACE module can be embedded into other Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) easily for context aggregation. The effectiveness of the proposed module is demonstrated on Pascal-Context and ADE20K datasets. Although our proposed ACE only consists of three deformable convolution blocks, it outperforms PPM and ASPP in terms of mean Intersection of Union (mIoU) on both datasets. All the experiment study confirms that our proposed module is effective as compared to the state-of-the-art methods."
Gated-SCNN: Gated Shape CNNs for Semantic Segmentation,"Current state-of-the-art methods for image segmentation form a dense image representation where the color, shape and texture information are all processed together inside a deep CNN. This however may not be ideal as they contain very different type of information relevant for recognition. Here, we propose a new two-stream CNN architecture for semantic segmentation that explicitly wires shape information as a separate processing branch, i.e. shape stream, that processes information in parallel to the classical stream. Key to this architecture is a new type of gates that connect the intermediate layers of the two streams. Specifically, we use the higher-level activations in the classical stream to gate the lower-level activations in the shape stream, effectively removing noise and helping the shape stream to only focus on processing the relevant boundary-related information. This enables us to use a very shallow architecture for the shape stream that operates on the image-level resolution. Our experiments show that this leads to a highly effective architecture that produces sharper predictions around object boundaries and significantly boosts performance on thinner and smaller objects. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Cityscapes benchmark, in terms of both mask (mIoU) and boundary (F-score) quality, improving by 2% and 4% over strong baselines."
A Regularized Convolutional Neural Network for Semantic Image Segmentation,"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) show outstanding performance in many image processing problems, such as image recognition, object detection and image segmentation. Semantic segmentation is a very challenging task that requires recognizing, understanding what's in the image in pixel level. Though the state of the art has been greatly improved by CNNs, there is no explicit connections between prediction of neighbouring pixels. That is, spatial regularity of the segmented objects is still a problem for CNNs. In this paper, we propose a method to add spatial regularization to the segmented objects. In our method, the spatial regularization such as total variation (TV) can be easily integrated into CNN network. It can help CNN find a better local optimum and make the segmentation results more robust to noise. We apply our proposed method to Unet and Segnet, which are well established CNNs for image segmentation, and test them on WBC, CamVid and SUN-RGBD datasets, respectively. The results show that the regularized networks not only could provide better segmentation results with regularization effect than the original ones but also have certain robustness to noise."
Deep Learning-Based Semantic Segmentation of Microscale Objects,"Accurate estimation of the positions and shapes of microscale objects is crucial for automated imaging-guided manipulation using a non-contact technique such as optical tweezers. Perception methods that use traditional computer vision algorithms tend to fail when the manipulation environments are crowded. In this paper, we present a deep learning model for semantic segmentation of the images representing such environments. Our model successfully performs segmentation with a high mean Intersection Over Union score of 0.91."
SAN: Scale-Aware Network for Semantic Segmentation of High-Resolution Aerial Images,"High-resolution aerial images have a wide range of applications, such as military exploration, and urban planning. Semantic segmentation is a fundamental method extensively used in the analysis of high-resolution aerial images. However, the ground objects in high-resolution aerial images have the characteristics of inconsistent scales, and this feature usually leads to unexpected predictions. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel scale-aware module (SAM). In SAM, we employ the re-sampling method aimed to make pixels adjust their positions to fit the ground objects with different scales, and it implicitly introduces spatial attention by employing a re-sampling map as the weighted map. As a result, the network with the proposed module named scale-aware network (SANet) has a stronger ability to distinguish the ground objects with inconsistent scale. Other than this, our proposed modules can easily embed in most of the existing network to improve their performance. We evaluate our modules on the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing Vaihingen Dataset, and the experimental results and comprehensive analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed module."
The Ethical Dilemma when (not) Setting up Cost-based Decision Rules in Semantic Segmentation,"Neural networks for semantic segmentation can be seen as statistical models that provide for each pixel of one image a probability distribution on predefined classes. The predicted class is then usually obtained by the maximum a-posteriori probability (MAP) which is known as Bayes rule in decision theory. From decision theory we also know that the Bayes rule is optimal regarding the simple symmetric cost function. Therefore, it weights each type of confusion between two different classes equally, e.g., given images of urban street scenes there is no distinction in the cost function if the network confuses a person with a street or a building with a tree. Intuitively, there might be confusions of classes that are more important to avoid than others. In this work, we want to raise awareness of the possibility of explicitly defining confusion costs and the associated ethical difficulties if it comes down to providing numbers. We define two cost functions from different extreme perspectives, an egoistic and an altruistic one, and show how safety relevant quantities like precision / recall and (segment-wise) false positive / negative rate change when interpolating between MAP, egoistic and altruistic decision rules."
RFBNet: Deep Multimodal Networks with Residual Fusion Blocks for RGB-D Semantic Segmentation,"RGB-D semantic segmentation methods conventionally use two independent encoders to extract features from the RGB and depth data. However, there lacks an effective fusion mechanism to bridge the encoders, for the purpose of fully exploiting the complementary information from multiple modalities. This paper proposes a novel bottom-up interactive fusion structure to model the interdependencies between the encoders. The structure introduces an interaction stream to interconnect the encoders. The interaction stream not only progressively aggregates modality-specific features from the encoders but also computes complementary features for them. To instantiate this structure, the paper proposes a residual fusion block (RFB) to formulate the interdependences of the encoders. The RFB consists of two residual units and one fusion unit with gate mechanism. It learns complementary features for the modality-specific encoders and extracts modality-specific features as well as cross-modal features. Based on the RFB, the paper presents the deep multimodal networks for RGB-D semantic segmentation called RFBNet. The experiments on two datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of modeling the interdependencies and that the RFBNet achieved state-of-the-art performance."
VolMap: A Real-time Model for Semantic Segmentation of a LiDAR surrounding view,"This paper introduces VolMap, a real-time approach for the semantic segmentation of a 3D LiDAR surrounding view system in autonomous vehicles. We designed an optimized deep convolution neural network that can accurately segment the point cloud produced by a 360\degree{} LiDAR setup, where the input consists of a volumetric bird-eye view with LiDAR height layers used as input channels. We further investigated the usage of multi-LiDAR setup and its effect on the performance of the semantic segmentation task. Our evaluations are carried out on a large scale 3D object detection benchmark containing a LiDAR cocoon setup, along with KITTI dataset, where the per-point segmentation labels are derived from 3D bounding boxes. We show that VolMap achieved an excellent balance between high accuracy and real-time running on CPU."
Hard Pixel Mining for Depth Privileged Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation has achieved remarkable progress but remains challenging due to the complex scene, object occlusion, and so on. Some research works have attempted to use extra information such as a depth map to help RGB based semantic segmentation because the depth map could provide complementary geometric cues. However, due to the inaccessibility of depth sensors, depth information is usually unavailable for the test images. In this paper, we leverage only the depth of training images as the privileged information to mine the hard pixels in semantic segmentation, in which depth information is only available for training images but not available for test images. Specifically, we propose a novel Loss Weight Module, which outputs a loss weight map by employing two depth-related measurements of hard pixels: Depth Prediction Error and Depthaware Segmentation Error. The loss weight map is then applied to segmentation loss, with the goal of learning a more robust model by paying more attention to the hard pixels. Besides, we also explore a curriculum learning strategy based on the loss weight map. Meanwhile, to fully mine the hard pixels on different scales, we apply our loss weight module to multi-scale side outputs. Our hard pixels mining method achieves the state-of-the-art results on two benchmark datasets, and even outperforms the methods which need depth input during testing."
ELKPPNet: An Edge-aware Neural Network with Large Kernel Pyramid Pooling for Learning Discriminative Features in Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation has been a hot topic across diverse research fields. Along with the success of deep convolutional neural networks, semantic segmentation has made great achievements and improvements, in terms of both urban scene parsing and indoor semantic segmentation. However, most of the state-of-the-art models are still faced with a challenge in discriminative feature learning, which limits the ability of a model to detect multi-scale objects and to guarantee semantic consistency inside one object or distinguish different adjacent objects with similar appearance. In this paper, a practical and efficient edge-aware neural network is presented for semantic segmentation. This end-to-end trainable engine consists of a new encoder-decoder network, a large kernel spatial pyramid pooling (LKPP) block, and an edge-aware loss function. The encoder-decoder network was designed as a balanced structure to narrow the semantic and resolution gaps in multi-level feature aggregation, while the LKPP block was constructed with a densely expanding receptive field for multi-scale feature extraction and fusion. Furthermore, the new powerful edge-aware loss function is proposed to refine the boundaries directly from the semantic segmentation prediction for more robust and discriminative features. The effectiveness of the proposed model was demonstrated using Cityscapes, CamVid, and NYUDv2 benchmark datasets. The performance of the two structures and the edge-aware loss function in ELKPPNet was validated on the Cityscapes dataset, while the complete ELKPPNet was evaluated on the CamVid and NYUDv2 datasets. A comparative analysis with the state-of-the-art methods under the same conditions confirmed the superiority of the proposed algorithm."
End-to-End 3D-PointCloud Semantic Segmentation for Autonomous Driving,"3D semantic scene labeling is a fundamental task for Autonomous Driving. Recent work shows the capability of Deep Neural Networks in labeling 3D point sets provided by sensors like LiDAR, and Radar. Imbalanced distribution of classes in the dataset is one of the challenges that face 3D semantic scene labeling task. This leads to misclassifying for the non-dominant classes which suffer from two main problems: a) rare appearance in the dataset, and b) few sensor points reflected from one object of these classes. This paper proposes a Weighted Self-Incremental Transfer Learning as a generalized methodology that solves the imbalanced training dataset problems. It re-weights the components of the loss function computed from individual classes based on their frequencies in the training dataset, and applies Self-Incremental Transfer Learning by running the Neural Network model on non-dominant classes first, then dominant classes one-by-one are added. The experimental results introduce a new 3D point cloud semantic segmentation benchmark for KITTI dataset."
ESNet: An Efficient Symmetric Network for Real-time Semantic Segmentation,"The recent years have witnessed great advances for semantic segmentation using deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs). However, a large number of convolutional layers and feature channels lead to semantic segmentation as a computationally heavy task, which is disadvantage to the scenario with limited resources. In this paper, we design an efficient symmetric network, called (ESNet), to address this problem. The whole network has nearly symmetric architecture, which is mainly composed of a series of factorized convolution unit (FCU) and its parallel counterparts (PFCU). On one hand, the FCU adopts a widely-used 1D factorized convolution in residual layers. On the other hand, the parallel version employs a transform-split-transform-merge strategy in the designment of residual module, where the split branch adopts dilated convolutions with different rate to enlarge receptive field. Our model has nearly 1.6M parameters, and is able to be performed over 62 FPS on a single GTX 1080Ti GPU. The experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of speed and accuracy trade-off for real-time semantic segmentation on CityScapes dataset."
4D CNN for semantic segmentation of cardiac volumetric sequences,"We propose a 4D convolutional neural network (CNN) for the segmentation of retrospective ECG-gated cardiac CT, a series of single-channel volumetric data over time. While only a small subset of volumes in the temporal sequence is annotated, we define a sparse loss function on available labels to allow the network to leverage unlabeled images during training and generate a fully segmented sequence. We investigate the accuracy of the proposed 4D network to predict temporally consistent segmentations and compare with traditional 3D segmentation approaches. We demonstrate the feasibility of the 4D CNN and establish its performance on cardiac 4D CCTA."
DeepTemporalSeg: Temporally Consistent Semantic Segmentation of 3D LiDAR Scans,"Understanding the semantic characteristics of the environment is a key enabler for autonomous robot operation. In this paper, we propose a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) for the semantic segmentation of a LiDAR scan into the classes car, pedestrian or bicyclist. This architecture is based on dense blocks and efficiently utilizes depth separable convolutions to limit the number of parameters while still maintaining state-of-the-art performance. To make the predictions from the DCNN temporally consistent, we propose a Bayes filter based method. This method uses the predictions from the neural network to recursively estimate the current semantic state of a point in a scan. This recursive estimation uses the knowledge gained from previous scans, thereby making the predictions temporally consistent and robust towards isolated erroneous predictions. We compare the performance of our proposed architecture with other state-of-the-art neural network architectures and report substantial improvement. For the proposed Bayes filter approach, we show results on various sequences in the KITTI tracking benchmark."
IMP: Instance Mask Projection for High Accuracy Semantic Segmentation of Things,"In this work, we present a new operator, called Instance Mask Projection (IMP), which projects a predicted Instance Segmentation as a new feature for semantic segmentation. It also supports back propagation so is trainable end-to-end. Our experiments show the effectiveness of IMP on both Clothing Parsing (with complex layering, large deformations, and non-convex objects), and on Street Scene Segmentation (with many overlapping instances and small objects). On the Varied Clothing Parsing dataset (VCP), we show instance mask projection can improve 3 points on mIOU from a state-of-the-art Panoptic FPN segmentation approach. On the ModaNet clothing parsing dataset, we show a dramatic improvement of 20.4% absolutely compared to existing baseline semantic segmentation results. In addition, the instance mask projection operator works well on other (non-clothing) datasets, providing an improvement of 3 points in mIOU on Thing classes of Cityscapes, a self-driving dataset, on top of a state-of-the-art approach."
Universal Barcode Detector via Semantic Segmentation,"Barcodes are used in many commercial applications, thus fast and robust reading is important. There are many different types of barcodes, some of them look similar while others are completely different. In this paper we introduce new fast and robust deep learning detector based on semantic segmentation approach. It is capable of detecting barcodes of any type simultaneously both in the document scans and in the wild by means of a single model. The detector achieves state-of-the-art results on the ArTe-Lab 1D Medium Barcode Dataset with detection rate 0.995. Moreover, developed detector can deal with more complicated object shapes like very long but narrow or very small barcodes. The proposed approach can also identify types of detected barcodes and performs at real-time speed on CPU environment being much faster than previous state-of-the-art approaches."
"Show, Match and Segment: Joint Weakly Supervised Learning of Semantic Matching and Object Co-segmentation","We present an approach for jointly matching and segmenting object instances of the same category within a collection of images. In contrast to existing algorithms that tackle the tasks of semantic matching and object co-segmentation in isolation, our method exploits the complementary nature of the two tasks. The key insights of our method are two-fold. First, the estimated dense correspondence fields from semantic matching provide supervision for object co-segmentation by enforcing consistency between the predicted masks from a pair of images. Second, the predicted object masks from object co-segmentation in turn allow us to reduce the adverse effects due to background clutters for improving semantic matching. Our model is end-to-end trainable and does not require supervision from manually annotated correspondences and object masks. We validate the efficacy of our approach on five benchmark datasets: TSS, Internet, PF-PASCAL, PF-WILLOW, and SPair-71k, and show that our algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods on both semantic matching and object co-segmentation tasks."
Gated CRF Loss for Weakly Supervised Semantic Image Segmentation,"State-of-the-art approaches for semantic segmentation rely on deep convolutional neural networks trained on fully annotated datasets, that have been shown to be notoriously expensive to collect, both in terms of time and money. To remedy this situation, weakly supervised methods leverage other forms of supervision that require substantially less annotation effort, but they typically present an inability to predict precise object boundaries due to approximate nature of the supervisory signals in those regions. While great progress has been made in improving the performance, many of these weakly supervised methods are highly tailored to their own specific settings. This raises challenges in reusing algorithms and making steady progress. In this paper, we intentionally avoid such practices when tackling weakly supervised semantic segmentation. In particular, we train standard neural networks with partial cross-entropy loss function for the labeled pixels and our proposed Gated CRF loss for the unlabeled pixels. The Gated CRF loss is designed to deliver several important assets: 1) it enables flexibility in the kernel construction to mask out influence from undesired pixel positions; 2) it offloads learning contextual relations to CNN and concentrates on semantic boundaries; 3) it does not rely on high-dimensional filtering and thus has a simple implementation. Throughout the paper we present the advantages of the loss function, analyze several aspects of weakly supervised training, and show that our `purist' approach achieves state-of-the-art performance for both click-based and scribble-based annotations."
Movable-Object-Aware Visual SLAM via Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Moving objects can greatly jeopardize the performance of a visual simultaneous localization and mapping (vSLAM) system which relies on the static-world assumption. Motion removal have seen successful on solving this problem. Two main streams of solutions are based on either geometry constraints or deep semantic segmentation neural network. The former rely on static majority assumption, and the latter require labor-intensive pixel-wise annotations. In this paper we propose to adopt a novel weakly-supervised semantic segmentation method. The segmentation mask is obtained from a CNN pre-trained with image-level class labels only. Thus, we leverage the power of deep semantic segmentation CNNs, while avoid requiring expensive annotations for training. We integrate our motion removal approach with the ORB-SLAM2 system. Experimental results on the TUM RGB-D and the KITTI stereo datasets demonstrate our superiority over the state-of-the-art."
Cross-view Semantic Segmentation for Sensing Surroundings,"Sensing surroundings plays a crucial role in human spatial perception, as it extracts the spatial configuration of objects as well as the free space from the observations. To facilitate the robot perception with such a surrounding sensing capability, we introduce a novel visual task called Cross-view Semantic Segmentation as well as a framework named View Parsing Network (VPN) to address it. In the cross-view semantic segmentation task, the agent is trained to parse the first-view observations into a top-down-view semantic map indicating the spatial location of all the objects at pixel-level. The main issue of this task is that we lack the real-world annotations of top-down-view data. To mitigate this, we train the VPN in 3D graphics environment and utilize the domain adaptation technique to transfer it to handle real-world data. We evaluate our VPN on both synthetic and real-world agents. The experimental results show that our model can effectively make use of the information from different views and multi-modalities to understanding spatial information. Our further experiment on a LoCoBot robot shows that our model enables the surrounding sensing capability from 2D image input. Code and demo videos can be found at \url{https://view-parsing-network.github.io}."
"Pattern-Affinitive Propagation across Depth, Surface Normal and Semantic Segmentation","In this paper, we propose a novel Pattern-Affinitive Propagation (PAP) framework to jointly predict depth, surface normal and semantic segmentation. The motivation behind it comes from the statistic observation that pattern-affinitive pairs recur much frequently across different tasks as well as within a task. Thus, we can conduct two types of propagations, cross-task propagation and task-specific propagation, to adaptively diffuse those similar patterns. The former integrates cross-task affinity patterns to adapt to each task therein through the calculation on non-local relationships. Next the latter performs an iterative diffusion in the feature space so that the cross-task affinity patterns can be widely-spread within the task. Accordingly, the learning of each task can be regularized and boosted by the complementary task-level affinities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and the superiority of our method on the joint three tasks. Meanwhile, we achieve the state-of-the-art or competitive results on the three related datasets, NYUD-v2, SUN-RGBD and KITTI."
Seeing Behind Things: Extending Semantic Segmentation to Occluded Regions,"Semantic segmentation and instance level segmentation made substantial progress in recent years due to the emergence of deep neural networks (DNNs). A number of deep architectures with Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) were proposed that surpass the traditional machine learning approaches for segmentation by a large margin. These architectures predict the directly observable semantic category of each pixel by usually optimizing a cross entropy loss. In this work we push the limit of semantic segmentation towards predicting semantic labels of directly visible as well as occluded objects or objects parts, where the network's input is a single depth image. We group the semantic categories into one background and multiple foreground object groups, and we propose a modification of the standard cross-entropy loss to cope with the settings. In our experiments we demonstrate that a CNN trained by minimizing the proposed loss is able to predict semantic categories for visible and occluded object parts without requiring to increase the network size (compared to a standard segmentation task). The results are validated on a newly generated dataset (augmented from SUNCG) dataset."
Nail Polish Try-On: Realtime Semantic Segmentation of Small Objects for Native and Browser Smartphone AR Applications,"We provide a system for semantic segmentation of small objects that enables nail polish try-on AR applications to run client-side in realtime in native and web mobile applications. By adjusting input resolution and neural network depth, our model design enables a smooth trade-off of performance and runtime, with the highest performance setting achieving~\num{94.5} mIoU at 29.8ms runtime in native applications on an iPad Pro. We also provide a postprocessing and rendering algorithm for nail polish try-on, which integrates with our semantic segmentation and fingernail base-tip direction predictions."
"Semi-supervised semantic segmentation needs strong, varied perturbations","Consistency regularization describes a class of approaches that have yielded ground breaking results in semi-supervised classification problems. Prior work has established the cluster assumption - under which the data distribution consists of uniform class clusters of samples separated by low density regions - as important to its success. We analyze the problem of semantic segmentation and find that its' distribution does not exhibit low density regions separating classes and offer this as an explanation for why semi-supervised segmentation is a challenging problem, with only a few reports of success. We then identify choice of augmentation as key to obtaining reliable performance without such low-density regions. We find that adapted variants of the recently proposed CutOut and CutMix augmentation techniques yield state-of-the-art semi-supervised semantic segmentation results in standard datasets. Furthermore, given its challenging nature we propose that semantic segmentation acts as an effective acid test for evaluating semi-supervised regularizers. Implementation at: https://github.com/Britefury/cutmix-semisup-seg."
Zero-Shot Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation models are limited in their ability to scale to large numbers of object classes. In this paper, we introduce the new task of zero-shot semantic segmentation: learning pixel-wise classifiers for never-seen object categories with zero training examples. To this end, we present a novel architecture, ZS3Net, combining a deep visual segmentation model with an approach to generate visual representations from semantic word embeddings. By this way, ZS3Net addresses pixel classification tasks where both seen and unseen categories are faced at test time (so called ""generalized"" zero-shot classification). Performance is further improved by a self-training step that relies on automatic pseudo-labeling of pixels from unseen classes. On the two standard segmentation datasets, Pascal-VOC and Pascal-Context, we propose zero-shot benchmarks and set competitive baselines. For complex scenes as ones in the Pascal-Context dataset, we extend our approach by using a graph-context encoding to fully leverage spatial context priors coming from class-wise segmentation maps."
RGB and LiDAR fusion based 3D Semantic Segmentation for Autonomous Driving,"LiDAR has become a standard sensor for autonomous driving applications as they provide highly precise 3D point clouds. LiDAR is also robust for low-light scenarios at night-time or due to shadows where the performance of cameras is degraded. LiDAR perception is gradually becoming mature for algorithms including object detection and SLAM. However, semantic segmentation algorithm remains to be relatively less explored. Motivated by the fact that semantic segmentation is a mature algorithm on image data, we explore sensor fusion based 3D segmentation. Our main contribution is to convert the RGB image to a polar-grid mapping representation used for LiDAR and design early and mid-level fusion architectures. Additionally, we design a hybrid fusion architecture that combines both fusion algorithms. We evaluate our algorithm on KITTI dataset which provides segmentation annotation for cars, pedestrians and cyclists. We evaluate two state-of-the-art architectures namely SqueezeSeg and PointSeg and improve the mIoU score by 10 % in both cases relative to the LiDAR only baseline."
Implicit Background Estimation for Semantic Segmentation,"Scene understanding and semantic segmentation are at the core of many computer vision tasks, many of which, involve interacting with humans in potentially dangerous ways. It is therefore paramount that techniques for principled design of robust models be developed. In this paper, we provide analytic and empirical evidence that correcting potentially errant non-distinct mappings that result from the softmax function can result in improving robustness characteristics on a state-of-the-art semantic segmentation model with minimal impact to performance and minimal changes to the code base."
Learning Semantics-aware Distance Map with Semantics Layering Network for Amodal Instance Segmentation,"In this work, we demonstrate yet another approach to tackle the amodal segmentation problem. Specifically, we first introduce a new representation, namely a semantics-aware distance map (sem-dist map), to serve as our target for amodal segmentation instead of the commonly used masks and heatmaps. The sem-dist map is a kind of level-set representation, of which the different regions of an object are placed into different levels on the map according to their visibility. It is a natural extension of masks and heatmaps, where modal, amodal segmentation, as well as depth order information, are all well-described. Then we also introduce a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, which we refer to as semantic layering network, to estimate sem-dist maps layer by layer, from the global-level to the instance-level, for all objects in an image. Extensive experiments on the COCOA and D2SA datasets have demonstrated that our framework can predict amodal segmentation, occlusion and depth order with state-of-the-art performance."
Closed-Loop Adaptation for Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Weakly-supervised semantic segmentation aims to assign each pixel a semantic category under weak supervisions, such as image-level tags. Most of existing weakly-supervised semantic segmentation methods do not use any feedback from segmentation output and can be considered as open-loop systems. They are prone to accumulated errors because of the static seeds and the sensitive structure information. In this paper, we propose a generic self-adaptation mechanism for existing weakly-supervised semantic segmentation methods by introducing two feedback chains, thus constituting a closed-loop system. Specifically, the first chain iteratively produces dynamic seeds by incorporating cross-image structure information, whereas the second chain further expands seed regions by a customized random walk process to reconcile inner-image structure information characterized by superpixels. Experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 suggest that our network outperforms state-of-the-art methods with significantly less computational and memory burden."
A Comparison and Strategy of Semantic Segmentation on Remote Sensing Images,"In recent years, with the development of aerospace technology, we use more and more images captured by satellites to obtain information. But a large number of useless raw images, limited data storage resource and poor transmission capability on satellites hinder our use of valuable images. Therefore, it is necessary to deploy an on-orbit semantic segmentation model to filter out useless images before data transmission. In this paper, we present a detailed comparison on the recent deep learning models. Considering the computing environment of satellites, we compare methods from accuracy, parameters and resource consumption on the same public dataset. And we also analyze the relation between them. Based on experimental results, we further propose a viable on-orbit semantic segmentation strategy. It will be deployed on the TianZhi-2 satellite which supports deep learning methods and will be lunched soon."
Robust Semantic Segmentation in Adverse Weather Conditions by means of Sensor Data Fusion,"A robust and reliable semantic segmentation in adverse weather conditions is very important for autonomous cars, but most state-of-the-art approaches only achieve high accuracy rates in optimal weather conditions. The reason is that they are only optimized for good weather conditions and given noise models. However, most of them fail, if data with unknown disturbances occur, and their performance decrease enormously. One possibility to still obtain reliable results is to observe the environment with different sensor types, such as camera and lidar, and to fuse the sensor data by means of neural networks, since different sensors behave differently in diverse weather conditions. Hence, the sensors can complement each other by means of an appropriate sensor data fusion. Nevertheless, the fusion-based approaches are still susceptible to disturbances and fail to classify disturbed image areas correctly. This problem can be solved by means of a special training method, the so called Robust Learning Method (RLM), a method by which the neural network learns to handle unknown noise. In this work, two different sensor fusion architectures for semantic segmentation are compared and evaluated on several datasets. Furthermore, it is shown that the RLM increases the robustness in adverse weather conditions enormously, and achieve good results although no disturbance model has been learned by the neural network."
ACNet: Attention Based Network to Exploit Complementary Features for RGBD Semantic Segmentation,"Compared to RGB semantic segmentation, RGBD semantic segmentation can achieve better performance by taking depth information into consideration. However, it is still problematic for contemporary segmenters to effectively exploit RGBD information since the feature distributions of RGB and depth (D) images vary significantly in different scenes. In this paper, we propose an Attention Complementary Network (ACNet) that selectively gathers features from RGB and depth branches. The main contributions lie in the Attention Complementary Module (ACM) and the architecture with three parallel branches. More precisely, ACM is a channel attention-based module that extracts weighted features from RGB and depth branches. The architecture preserves the inference of the original RGB and depth branches, and enables the fusion branch at the same time. Based on the above structures, ACNet is capable of exploiting more high-quality features from different channels. We evaluate our model on SUN-RGBD and NYUDv2 datasets, and prove that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods. In particular, a mIoU score of 48.3\% on NYUDv2 test set is achieved with ResNet50. We will release our source code based on PyTorch and the trained segmentation model at https://github.com/anheidelonghu/ACNet."
Incorporating Human Domain Knowledge in 3D LiDAR-based Semantic Segmentation,"This work studies semantic segmentation using 3D LiDAR data. Popular deep learning methods applied for this task require a large number of manual annotations to train the parameters. We propose a new method that makes full use of the advantages of traditional methods and deep learning methods via incorporating human domain knowledge into the neural network model to reduce the demand for large numbers of manual annotations and improve the training efficiency. We first pretrain a model with autogenerated samples from a rule-based classifier so that human knowledge can be propagated into the network. Based on the pretrained model, only a small set of annotations is required for further fine-tuning. Quantitative experiments show that the pretrained model achieves better performance than random initialization in almost all cases; furthermore, our method can achieve similar performance with fewer manual annotations."
Learning Fully Dense Neural Networks for Image Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation is pixel-wise classification which retains critical spatial information. The ""feature map reuse"" has been commonly adopted in CNN based approaches to take advantage of feature maps in the early layers for the later spatial reconstruction. Along this direction, we go a step further by proposing a fully dense neural network with an encoder-decoder structure that we abbreviate as FDNet. For each stage in the decoder module, feature maps of all the previous blocks are adaptively aggregated to feed-forward as input. On the one hand, it reconstructs the spatial boundaries accurately. On the other hand, it learns more efficiently with the more efficient gradient backpropagation. In addition, we propose the boundary-aware loss function to focus more attention on the pixels near the boundary, which boosts the ""hard examples"" labeling. We have demonstrated the best performance of the FDNet on the two benchmark datasets: PASCAL VOC 2012, NYUDv2 over previous works when not considering training on other datasets."
RIU-Net: Embarrassingly simple semantic segmentation of 3D LiDAR point cloud,"This paper proposes RIU-Net (for Range-Image U-Net), the adaptation of a popular semantic segmentation network for the semantic segmentation of a 3D LiDAR point cloud. The point cloud is turned into a 2D range-image by exploiting the topology of the sensor. This image is then used as input to a U-net. This architecture has already proved its efficiency for the task of semantic segmentation of medical images. We demonstrate how it can also be used for the accurate semantic segmentation of a 3D LiDAR point cloud and how it represents a valid bridge between image processing and 3D point cloud processing. Our model is trained on range-images built from KITTI 3D object detection dataset. Experiments show that RIU-Net, despite being very simple, offers results that are comparable to the state-of-the-art of range-image based methods. Finally, we demonstrate that this architecture is able to operate at 90fps on a single GPU, which enables deployment for real-time segmentation."
Task Decomposition and Synchronization for Semantic Biomedical Image Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation is essentially important to biomedical image analysis. Many recent works mainly focus on integrating the Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) architecture with sophisticated convolution implementation and deep supervision. In this paper, we propose to decompose the single segmentation task into three subsequent sub-tasks, including (1) pixel-wise image segmentation, (2) prediction of the class labels of the objects within the image, and (3) classification of the scene the image belonging to. While these three sub-tasks are trained to optimize their individual loss functions of different perceptual levels, we propose to let them interact by the task-task context ensemble. Moreover, we propose a novel sync-regularization to penalize the deviation between the outputs of the pixel-wise segmentation and the class prediction tasks. These effective regularizations help FCN utilize context information comprehensively and attain accurate semantic segmentation, even though the number of the images for training may be limited in many biomedical applications. We have successfully applied our framework to three diverse 2D/3D medical image datasets, including Robotic Scene Segmentation Challenge 18 (ROBOT18), Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge 18 (BRATS18), and Retinal Fundus Glaucoma Challenge (REFUGE18). We have achieved top-tier performance in all three challenges."
Boundary Loss for Remote Sensing Imagery Semantic Segmentation,"In response to the growing importance of geospatial data, its analysis including semantic segmentation becomes an increasingly popular task in computer vision today. Convolutional neural networks are powerful visual models that yield hierarchies of features and practitioners widely use them to process remote sensing data. When performing remote sensing image segmentation, multiple instances of one class with precisely defined boundaries are often the case, and it is crucial to extract those boundaries accurately. The accuracy of segments boundaries delineation influences the quality of the whole segmented areas explicitly. However, widely-used segmentation loss functions such as BCE, IoU loss or Dice loss do not penalize misalignment of boundaries sufficiently. In this paper, we propose a novel loss function, namely a differentiable surrogate of a metric accounting accuracy of boundary detection. We can use the loss function with any neural network for binary segmentation. We performed validation of our loss function with various modifications of UNet on a synthetic dataset, as well as using real-world data (ISPRS Potsdam, INRIA AIL). Trained with the proposed loss function, models outperform baseline methods in terms of IoU score."
Harvesting Information from Captions for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Since acquiring pixel-wise annotations for training convolutional neural networks for semantic image segmentation is time-consuming, weakly supervised approaches that only require class tags have been proposed. In this work, we propose another form of supervision, namely image captions as they can be found on the Internet. These captions have two advantages. They do not require additional curation as it is the case for the clean class tags used by current weakly supervised approaches and they provide textual context for the classes present in an image. To leverage such textual context, we deploy a multi-modal network that learns a joint embedding of the visual representation of the image and the textual representation of the caption. The network estimates text activation maps (TAMs) for class names as well as compound concepts, i.e. combinations of nouns and their attributes. The TAMs of compound concepts describing classes of interest substantially improve the quality of the estimated class activation maps which are then used to train a network for semantic segmentation. We evaluate our method on the COCO dataset where it achieves state of the art results for weakly supervised image segmentation."
Budget-aware Semi-Supervised Semantic and Instance Segmentation,"Methods that move towards less supervised scenarios are key for image segmentation, as dense labels demand significant human intervention. Generally, the annotation burden is mitigated by labeling datasets with weaker forms of supervision, e.g. image-level labels or bounding boxes. Another option are semi-supervised settings, that commonly leverage a few strong annotations and a huge number of unlabeled/weakly-labeled data. In this paper, we revisit semi-supervised segmentation schemes and narrow down significantly the annotation budget (in terms of total labeling time of the training set) compared to previous approaches. With a very simple pipeline, we demonstrate that at low annotation budgets, semi-supervised methods outperform by a wide margin weakly-supervised ones for both semantic and instance segmentation. Our approach also outperforms previous semi-supervised works at a much reduced labeling cost. We present results for the Pascal VOC benchmark and unify weakly and semi-supervised approaches by considering the total annotation budget, thus allowing a fairer comparison between methods."
Efficient Ladder-style DenseNets for Semantic Segmentation of Large Images,"Recent progress of deep image classification models has provided great potential to improve state-of-the-art performance in related computer vision tasks. However, the transition to semantic segmentation is hampered by strict memory limitations of contemporary GPUs. The extent of feature map caching required by convolutional backprop poses significant challenges even for moderately sized Pascal images, while requiring careful architectural considerations when the source resolution is in the megapixel range. To address these concerns, we propose a novel DenseNet-based ladder-style architecture which features high modelling power and a very lean upsampling datapath. We also propose to substantially reduce the extent of feature map caching by exploiting inherent spatial efficiency of the DenseNet feature extractor. The resulting models deliver high performance with fewer parameters than competitive approaches, and allow training at megapixel resolution on commodity hardware. The presented experimental results outperform the state-of-the-art in terms of prediction accuracy and execution speed on Cityscapes, Pascal VOC 2012, CamVid and ROB 2018 datasets. Source code will be released upon publication."
Semantic Segmentation of Seismic Images,"Almost all work to understand Earth's subsurface on a large scale relies on the interpretation of seismic surveys by experts who segment the survey (usually a cube) into layers; a process that is very time demanding. In this paper, we present a new deep neural network architecture specially designed to semantically segment seismic images with a minimal amount of training data. To achieve this, we make use of a transposed residual unit that replaces the traditional dilated convolution for the decode block. Also, instead of using a predefined shape for up-scaling, our network learns all the steps to upscale the features from the encoder. We train our neural network using the Penobscot 3D dataset; a real seismic dataset acquired offshore Nova Scotia, Canada. We compare our approach with two well-known deep neural network topologies: Fully Convolutional Network and U-Net. In our experiments, we show that our approach can achieve more than 99 percent of the mean intersection over union (mIOU) metric, outperforming the existing topologies. Moreover, our qualitative results show that the obtained model can produce masks very close to human interpretation with very little discontinuity."
EdgeSegNet: A Compact Network for Semantic Segmentation,"In this study, we introduce EdgeSegNet, a compact deep convolutional neural network for the task of semantic segmentation. A human-machine collaborative design strategy is leveraged to create EdgeSegNet, where principled network design prototyping is coupled with machine-driven design exploration to create networks with customized module-level macroarchitecture and microarchitecture designs tailored for the task. Experimental results showed that EdgeSegNet can achieve semantic segmentation accuracy comparable with much larger and computationally complex networks (>20x} smaller model size than RefineNet) as well as achieving an inference speed of ~38.5 FPS on an NVidia Jetson AGX Xavier. As such, the proposed EdgeSegNet is well-suited for low-power edge scenarios."
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation using Generative Adversarial Networks for Semantic Segmentation of Aerial Images,"Segmenting aerial images is being of great potential in surveillance and scene understanding of urban areas. It provides a mean for automatic reporting of the different events that happen in inhabited areas. This remarkably promotes public safety and traffic management applications. After the wide adoption of convolutional neural networks methods, the accuracy of semantic segmentation algorithms could easily surpass 80% if a robust dataset is provided. Despite this success, the deployment of a pre-trained segmentation model to survey a new city that is not included in the training set significantly decreases the accuracy. This is due to the domain shift between the source dataset on which the model is trained and the new target domain of the new city images. In this paper, we address this issue and consider the challenge of domain adaptation in semantic segmentation of aerial images. We design an algorithm that reduces the domain shift impact using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). In the experiments, we test the proposed methodology on the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS) semantic segmentation dataset and found that our method improves the overall accuracy from 35% to 52% when passing from Potsdam domain (considered as source domain) to Vaihingen domain (considered as target domain). In addition, the method allows recovering efficiently the inverted classes due to sensor variation. In particular, it improves the average segmentation accuracy of the inverted classes due to sensor variation from 14% to 61%."
LEDNet: A Lightweight Encoder-Decoder Network for Real-Time Semantic Segmentation,"The extensive computational burden limits the usage of CNNs in mobile devices for dense estimation tasks. In this paper, we present a lightweight network to address this problem,namely LEDNet, which employs an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture for the task of real-time semantic segmentation.More specifically, the encoder adopts a ResNet as backbone network, where two new operations, channel split and shuffle, are utilized in each residual block to greatly reduce computation cost while maintaining higher segmentation accuracy. On the other hand, an attention pyramid network (APN) is employed in the decoder to further lighten the entire network complexity. Our model has less than 1M parameters,and is able to run at over 71 FPS in a single GTX 1080Ti GPU. The comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of speed and accuracy trade-off on CityScapes dataset."
Simultaneous Object Detection and Semantic Segmentation,"Both object detection in and semantic segmentation of camera images are important tasks for automated vehicles. Object detection is necessary so that the planning and behavior modules can reason about other road users. Semantic segmentation provides for example free space information and information about static and dynamic parts of the environment. There has been a lot of research to solve both tasks using Convolutional Neural Networks. These approaches give good results but are computationally demanding. In practice, a compromise has to be found between detection performance, detection quality and the number of tasks. Otherwise it is not possible to meet the real-time requirements of automated vehicles. In this work, we propose a neural network architecture to solve both tasks simultaneously. This architecture was designed to run with around 10 Hz on 1 MP images on current hardware. Our approach achieves a mean IoU of 61.2% for the semantic segmentation task on the challenging Cityscapes benchmark. It also achieves an average precision of 69.3% for cars and 67.7% on the moderate difficulty level of the KITTI benchmark."
SEMEDA: Enhancing Segmentation Precision with Semantic Edge Aware Loss,"While nowadays deep neural networks achieve impressive performances on semantic segmentation tasks, they are usually trained by optimizing pixel-wise losses such as cross-entropy. As a result, the predictions outputted by such networks usually struggle to accurately capture the object boundaries and exhibit holes inside the objects. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to improve the structure of the predicted segmentation masks. We introduce a novel semantic edge detection network, which allows to match the predicted and ground truth segmentation masks. This Semantic Edge-Aware strategy (SEMEDA) can be combined with any backbone deep network in an end-to-end training framework. Through thorough experimental validation on Pascal VOC 2012 and Cityscapes datasets, we show that the proposed SEMEDA approach enhances the structure of the predicted segmentation masks by enforcing sharp boundaries and avoiding discontinuities inside objects, improving the segmentation performance. In addition, our semantic edge-aware loss can be integrated into any popular segmentation network without requiring any additional annotation and with negligible computational load, as compared to standard pixel-wise cross-entropy loss."
Semantic Segmentation of Video Sequences with Convolutional LSTMs,"Most of the semantic segmentation approaches have been developed for single image segmentation, and hence, video sequences are currently segmented by processing each frame of the video sequence separately. The disadvantage of this is that temporal image information is not considered, which improves the performance of the segmentation approach. One possibility to include temporal information is to use recurrent neural networks. However, there are only a few approaches using recurrent networks for video segmentation so far. These approaches extend the encoder-decoder network architecture of well-known segmentation approaches and place convolutional LSTM layers between encoder and decoder. However, in this paper it is shown that this position is not optimal, and that other positions in the network exhibit better performance. Nowadays, state-of-the-art segmentation approaches rarely use the classical encoder-decoder structure, but use multi-branch architectures. These architectures are more complex, and hence, it is more difficult to place the recurrent units at a proper position. In this work, the multi-branch architectures are extended by convolutional LSTM layers at different positions and evaluated on two different datasets in order to find the best one. It turned out that the proposed approach outperforms the pure CNN-based approach for up to 1.6 percent."
Detecting Reflections by Combining Semantic and Instance Segmentation,"Reflections in natural images commonly cause false positives in automated detection systems. These false positives can lead to significant impairment of accuracy in the tasks of detection, counting and segmentation. Here, inspired by the recent panoptic approach to segmentation, we show how fusing instance and semantic segmentation can automatically identify reflection false positives, without explicitly needing to have the reflective regions labelled. We explore in detail how state of the art two-stage detectors suffer a loss of broader contextual features, and hence are unable to learn to ignore these reflections. We then present an approach to fuse instance and semantic segmentations for this application, and subsequently show how this reduces false positive detections in a real world surveillance data with a large number of reflective surfaces. This demonstrates how panoptic segmentation and related work, despite being in its infancy, can already be useful in real world computer vision problems."
Semantic Referee: A Neural-Symbolic Framework for Enhancing Geospatial Semantic Segmentation,"Understanding why machine learning algorithms may fail is usually the task of the human expert that uses domain knowledge and contextual information to discover systematic shortcomings in either the data or the algorithm. In this paper, we propose a semantic referee, which is able to extract qualitative features of the errors emerging from deep machine learning frameworks and suggest corrections. The semantic referee relies on ontological reasoning about spatial knowledge in order to characterize errors in terms of their spatial relations with the environment. Using semantics, the reasoner interacts with the learning algorithm as a supervisor. In this paper, the proposed method of the interaction between a neural network classifier and a semantic referee shows how to improve the performance of semantic segmentation for satellite imagery data."
Casting Geometric Constraints in Semantic Segmentation as Semi-Supervised Learning,"We propose a simple yet effective method to learn to segment new indoor scenes from video frames: State-of-the-art methods trained on one dataset, even as large as the SUNRGB-D dataset, can perform poorly when applied to images that are not part of the dataset, because of the dataset bias, a common phenomenon in computer vision. To make semantic segmentation more useful in practice, one can exploit geometric constraints. Our main contribution is to show that these constraints can be cast conveniently as semi-supervised terms, which enforce the fact that the same class should be predicted for the projections of the same 3D location in different images. This is interesting as we can exploit general existing techniques developed for semi-supervised learning to efficiently incorporate the constraints. We show that this approach can efficiently and accurately learn to segment target sequences of ScanNet and our own target sequences using only annotations from SUNRGB-D, and geometric relations between the video frames of target sequences."
Box-driven Class-wise Region Masking and Filling Rate Guided Loss for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation has achieved huge progress via adopting deep Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN). However, the performance of FCN based models severely rely on the amounts of pixel-level annotations which are expensive and time-consuming. To address this problem, it is a good choice to learn to segment with weak supervision from bounding boxes. How to make full use of the class-level and region-level supervisions from bounding boxes is the critical challenge for the weakly supervised learning task. In this paper, we first introduce a box-driven class-wise masking model (BCM) to remove irrelevant regions of each class. Moreover, based on the pixel-level segment proposal generated from the bounding box supervision, we could calculate the mean filling rates of each class to serve as an important prior cue, then we propose a filling rate guided adaptive loss (FR-Loss) to help the model ignore the wrongly labeled pixels in proposals. Unlike previous methods directly training models with the fixed individual segment proposals, our method can adjust the model learning with global statistical information. Thus it can help reduce the negative impacts from wrongly labeled proposals. We evaluate the proposed method on the challenging PASCAL VOC 2012 benchmark and compare with other methods. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method is effective and achieves the state-of-the-art results."
Sensor Fusion for Joint 3D Object Detection and Semantic Segmentation,"In this paper, we present an extension to LaserNet, an efficient and state-of-the-art LiDAR based 3D object detector. We propose a method for fusing image data with the LiDAR data and show that this sensor fusion method improves the detection performance of the model especially at long ranges. The addition of image data is straightforward and does not require image labels. Furthermore, we expand the capabilities of the model to perform 3D semantic segmentation in addition to 3D object detection. On a large benchmark dataset, we demonstrate our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on both object detection and semantic segmentation while maintaining a low runtime."
Bidirectional Learning for Domain Adaptation of Semantic Segmentation,"Domain adaptation for semantic image segmentation is very necessary since manually labeling large datasets with pixel-level labels is expensive and time consuming. Existing domain adaptation techniques either work on limited datasets, or yield not so good performance compared with supervised learning. In this paper, we propose a novel bidirectional learning framework for domain adaptation of segmentation. Using the bidirectional learning, the image translation model and the segmentation adaptation model can be learned alternatively and promote to each other. Furthermore, we propose a self-supervised learning algorithm to learn a better segmentation adaptation model and in return improve the image translation model. Experiments show that our method is superior to the state-of-the-art methods in domain adaptation of segmentation with a big margin. The source code is available at https://github.com/liyunsheng13/BDL."
Weakly Supervised Adversarial Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation in Urban Scenes,"Semantic segmentation, a pixel-level vision task, is developed rapidly by using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Training CNNs requires a large amount of labeled data, but manually annotating data is difficult. For emancipating manpower, in recent years, some synthetic datasets are released. However, they are still different from real scenes, which causes that training a model on the synthetic data (source domain) cannot achieve a good performance on real urban scenes (target domain). In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised adversarial domain adaptation to improve the segmentation performance from synthetic data to real scenes, which consists of three deep neural networks. To be specific, a detection and segmentation (""DS"" for short) model focuses on detecting objects and predicting segmentation map; a pixel-level domain classifier (""PDC"" for short) tries to distinguish the image features from which domains; an object-level domain classifier (""ODC"" for short) discriminates the objects from which domains and predicts the objects classes. PDC and ODC are treated as the discriminators, and DS is considered as the generator. By adversarial learning, DS is supposed to learn domain-invariant features. In experiments, our proposed method yields the new record of mIoU metric in the same problem."
ACE: Adapting to Changing Environments for Semantic Segmentation,"Deep neural networks exhibit exceptional accuracy when they are trained and tested on the same data distributions. However, neural classifiers are often extremely brittle when confronted with domain shift---changes in the input distribution that occur over time. We present ACE, a framework for semantic segmentation that dynamically adapts to changing environments over the time. By aligning the distribution of labeled training data from the original source domain with the distribution of incoming data in a shifted domain, ACE synthesizes labeled training data for environments as it sees them. This stylized data is then used to update a segmentation model so that it performs well in new environments. To avoid forgetting knowledge from past environments, we introduce a memory that stores feature statistics from previously seen domains. These statistics can be used to replay images in any of the previously observed domains, thus preventing catastrophic forgetting. In addition to standard batch training using stochastic gradient decent (SGD), we also experiment with fast adaptation methods based on adaptive meta-learning. Extensive experiments are conducted on two datasets from SYNTHIA, the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach when adapting to a number of tasks."
Adaptive Weighting Multi-Field-of-View CNN for Semantic Segmentation in Pathology,"Automated digital histopathology image segmentation is an important task to help pathologists diagnose tumors and cancer subtypes. For pathological diagnosis of cancer subtypes, pathologists usually change the magnification of whole-slide images (WSI) viewers. A key assumption is that the importance of the magnifications depends on the characteristics of the input image, such as cancer subtypes. In this paper, we propose a novel semantic segmentation method, called Adaptive-Weighting-Multi-Field-of-View-CNN (AWMF-CNN), that can adaptively use image features from images with different magnifications to segment multiple cancer subtype regions in the input image. The proposed method aggregates several expert CNNs for images of different magnifications by adaptively changing the weight of each expert depending on the input image. It leverages information in the images with different magnifications that might be useful for identifying the subtypes. It outperformed other state-of-the-art methods in experiments."
A Relation-Augmented Fully Convolutional Network for Semantic Segmentation in Aerial Scenes,"Most current semantic segmentation approaches fall back on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, their use of convolution operations with local receptive fields causes failures in modeling contextual spatial relations. Prior works have sought to address this issue by using graphical models or spatial propagation modules in networks. But such models often fail to capture long-range spatial relationships between entities, which leads to spatially fragmented predictions. Moreover, recent works have demonstrated that channel-wise information also acts a pivotal part in CNNs. In this work, we introduce two simple yet effective network units, the spatial relation module and the channel relation module, to learn and reason about global relationships between any two spatial positions or feature maps, and then produce relation-augmented feature representations. The spatial and channel relation modules are general and extensible, and can be used in a plug-and-play fashion with the existing fully convolutional network (FCN) framework. We evaluate relation module-equipped networks on semantic segmentation tasks using two aerial image datasets, which fundamentally depend on long-range spatial relational reasoning. The networks achieve very competitive results, bringing significant improvements over baselines."
Instance Segmentation based Semantic Matting for Compositing Applications,"Image compositing is a key step in film making and image editing that aims to segment a foreground object and combine it with a new background. Automatic image compositing can be done easily in a studio using chroma-keying when the background is pure blue or green. However, image compositing in natural scenes with complex backgrounds remains a tedious task, requiring experienced artists to hand-segment. In order to achieve automatic compositing in natural scenes, we propose a fully automated method that integrates instance segmentation and image matting processes to generate high-quality semantic mattes that can be used for image editing task. Our approach can be seen both as a refinement of existing instance segmentation algorithms and as a fully automated semantic image matting method. It extends automatic image compositing techniques such as chroma-keying to scenes with complex natural backgrounds without the need for any kind of user interaction. The output of our approach can be considered as both refined instance segmentations and alpha mattes with semantic meanings. We provide experimental results which show improved performance results as compared to existing approaches."
Uncertainty Measures and Prediction Quality Rating for the Semantic Segmentation of Nested Multi Resolution Street Scene Images,"In the semantic segmentation of street scenes the reliability of the prediction and therefore uncertainty measures are of highest interest. We present a method that generates for each input image a hierarchy of nested crops around the image center and presents these, all re-scaled to the same size, to a neural network for semantic segmentation. The resulting softmax outputs are then post processed such that we can investigate mean and variance over all image crops as well as mean and variance of uncertainty heat maps obtained from pixel-wise uncertainty measures, like the entropy, applied to each crop's softmax output. In our tests, we use the publicly available DeepLabv3+ MobilenetV2 network (trained on the Cityscapes dataset) and demonstrate that the incorporation of crops improves the quality of the prediction and that we obtain more reliable uncertainty measures. These are then aggregated over predicted segments for either classifying between IoU=0 and IoU>0 (meta classification) or predicting the IoU via linear regression (meta regression). The latter yields reliable performance estimates for segmentation networks, in particular useful in the absence of ground truth. For the task of meta classification we obtain a classification accuracy of 81.93\% and an AUROC of 89.89\%. For meta regression we obtain an R^2 value of 84.77\%. These results yield significant improvements compared to other approaches."
Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation of Satellite Images,"When one wants to train a neural network to perform semantic segmentation, creating pixel-level annotations for each of the images in the database is a tedious task. If he works with aerial or satellite images, which are usually very large, it is even worse. With that in mind, we investigate how to use image-level annotations in order to perform semantic segmentation. Image-level annotations are much less expensive to acquire than pixel-level annotations, but we lose a lot of information for the training of the model. From the annotations of the images, the model must find by itself how to classify the different regions of the image. In this work, we use the method proposed by Anh and Kwak [1] to produce pixel-level annotation from image level annotation. We compare the overall quality of our generated dataset with the original dataset. In addition, we propose an adaptation of the AffinityNet that allows us to directly perform a semantic segmentation. Our results show that the generated labels lead to the same performances for the training of several segmentation networks. Also, the quality of semantic segmentation performed directly by the AffinityNet and the Random Walk is close to the one of the best fully-supervised approaches."
The Fishyscapes Benchmark: Measuring Blind Spots in Semantic Segmentation,"Deep learning has enabled impressive progress in the accuracy of semantic segmentation. Yet, the ability to estimate uncertainty and detect failure is key for safety-critical applications like autonomous driving. Existing uncertainty estimates have mostly been evaluated on simple tasks, and it is unclear whether these methods generalize to more complex scenarios. We present Fishyscapes, the first public benchmark for uncertainty estimation in a real-world task of semantic segmentation for urban driving. It evaluates pixel-wise uncertainty estimates towards the detection of anomalous objects in front of the vehicle. We~adapt state-of-the-art methods to recent semantic segmentation models and compare approaches based on softmax confidence, Bayesian learning, and embedding density. Our results show that anomaly detection is far from solved even for ordinary situations, while our benchmark allows measuring advancements beyond the state-of-the-art."
Architecture Search of Dynamic Cells for Semantic Video Segmentation,"In semantic video segmentation the goal is to acquire consistent dense semantic labelling across image frames. To this end, recent approaches have been reliant on manually arranged operations applied on top of static semantic segmentation networks - with the most prominent building block being the optical flow able to provide information about scene dynamics. Related to that is the line of research concerned with speeding up static networks by approximating expensive parts of them with cheaper alternatives, while propagating information from previous frames. In this work we attempt to come up with generalisation of those methods, and instead of manually designing contextual blocks that connect per-frame outputs, we propose a neural architecture search solution, where the choice of operations together with their sequential arrangement are being predicted by a separate neural network. We showcase that such generalisation leads to stable and accurate results across common benchmarks, such as CityScapes and CamVid datasets. Importantly, the proposed methodology takes only 2 GPU-days, finds high-performing cells and does not rely on the expensive optical flow computation."
Template-Based Automatic Search of Compact Semantic Segmentation Architectures,"Automatic search of neural architectures for various vision and natural language tasks is becoming a prominent tool as it allows to discover high-performing structures on any dataset of interest. Nevertheless, on more difficult domains, such as dense per-pixel classification, current automatic approaches are limited in their scope - due to their strong reliance on existing image classifiers they tend to search only for a handful of additional layers with discovered architectures still containing a large number of parameters. In contrast, in this work we propose a novel solution able to find light-weight and accurate segmentation architectures starting from only few blocks of a pre-trained classification network. To this end, we progressively build up a methodology that relies on templates of sets of operations, predicts which template and how many times should be applied at each step, while also generating the connectivity structure and downsampling factors. All these decisions are being made by a recurrent neural network that is rewarded based on the score of the emitted architecture on the holdout set and trained using reinforcement learning. One discovered architecture achieves 63.2% mean IoU on CamVid and 67.8% on CityScapes having only 270K parameters. Pre-trained models and the search code are available at https://github.com/DrSleep/nas-segm-pytorch."
DFANet: Deep Feature Aggregation for Real-Time Semantic Segmentation,"This paper introduces an extremely efficient CNN architecture named DFANet for semantic segmentation under resource constraints. Our proposed network starts from a single lightweight backbone and aggregates discriminative features through sub-network and sub-stage cascade respectively. Based on the multi-scale feature propagation, DFANet substantially reduces the number of parameters, but still obtains sufficient receptive field and enhances the model learning ability, which strikes a balance between the speed and segmentation performance. Experiments on Cityscapes and CamVid datasets demonstrate the superior performance of DFANet with 8\times less FLOPs and 2\times faster than the existing state-of-the-art real-time semantic segmentation methods while providing comparable accuracy. Specifically, it achieves 70.3\% Mean IOU on the Cityscapes test dataset with only 1.7 GFLOPs and a speed of 160 FPS on one NVIDIA Titan X card, and 71.3\% Mean IOU with 3.4 GFLOPs while inferring on a higher resolution image."
DADA: Depth-aware Domain Adaptation in Semantic Segmentation,"Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) is important for applications where large scale annotation of representative data is challenging. For semantic segmentation in particular, it helps deploy on real ""target domain"" data models that are trained on annotated images from a different ""source domain"", notably a virtual environment. To this end, most previous works consider semantic segmentation as the only mode of supervision for source domain data, while ignoring other, possibly available, information like depth. In this work, we aim at exploiting at best such a privileged information while training the UDA model. We propose a unified depth-aware UDA framework that leverages in several complementary ways the knowledge of dense depth in the source domain. As a result, the performance of the trained semantic segmentation model on the target domain is boosted. Our novel approach indeed achieves state-of-the-art performance on different challenging synthetic-2-real benchmarks."
GFF: Gated Fully Fusion for Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation generates comprehensive understanding of scenes through densely predicting the category for each pixel. High-level features from Deep Convolutional Neural Networks already demonstrate their effectiveness in semantic segmentation tasks, however the coarse resolution of high-level features often leads to inferior results for small/thin objects where detailed information is important. It is natural to consider importing low level features to compensate for the lost detailed information in high-level features.Unfortunately, simply combining multi-level features suffers from the semantic gap among them. In this paper, we propose a new architecture, named Gated Fully Fusion (GFF), to selectively fuse features from multiple levels using gates in a fully connected way. Specifically, features at each level are enhanced by higher-level features with stronger semantics and lower-level features with more details, and gates are used to control the propagation of useful information which significantly reduces the noises during fusion. We achieve the state of the art results on four challenging scene parsing datasets including Cityscapes, Pascal Context, COCO-stuff and ADE20K."
MAVNet: an Effective Semantic Segmentation Micro-Network for MAV-based Tasks,"Real-time semantic image segmentation on platforms subject to size, weight and power (SWaP) constraints is a key area of interest for air surveillance and inspection. In this work, we propose MAVNet: a small, light-weight, deep neural network for real-time semantic segmentation on micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs). MAVNet, inspired by ERFNet, features 400 times fewer parameters and achieves comparable performance with some reference models in empirical experiments. Our model achieves a trade-off between speed and accuracy, achieving up to 48 FPS on an NVIDIA 1080Ti and 9 FPS on the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier when processing high resolution imagery. Additionally, we provide two novel datasets that represent challenges in semantic segmentation for real-time MAV tracking and infrastructure inspection tasks and verify MAVNet on these datasets. Our algorithm and datasets are made publicly available."
Fully Using Classifiers for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation with Modified Cues,"This paper proposes a novel weakly-supervised semantic segmentation method using image-level label only. The class-specific activation maps from the well-trained classifiers are used as cues to train a segmentation network. The well-known defects of these cues are coarseness and incompleteness. We use super-pixel to refine them, and fuse the cues extracted from both a color image trained classifier and a gray image trained classifier to compensate for their incompleteness. The conditional random field is adapted to regulate the training process and to refine the outputs further. Besides initializing the segmentation network, the previously trained classifier is also used in the testing phase to suppress the non-existing classes. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset illustrate the effectiveness of our method."
Significance-aware Information Bottleneck for Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation,"For unsupervised domain adaptation problems, the strategy of aligning the two domains in latent feature space through adversarial learning has achieved much progress in image classification, but usually fails in semantic segmentation tasks in which the latent representations are overcomplex. In this work, we equip the adversarial network with a ""significance-aware information bottleneck (SIB)"", to address the above problem. The new network structure, called SIBAN, enables a significance-aware feature purification before the adversarial adaptation, which eases the feature alignment and stabilizes the adversarial training course. In two domain adaptation tasks, i.e., GTA5 -> Cityscapes and SYNTHIA -> Cityscapes, we validate that the proposed method can yield leading results compared with other feature-space alternatives. Moreover, SIBAN can even match the state-of-the-art output-space methods in segmentation accuracy, while the latter are often considered to be better choices for domain adaptive segmentation task."
JSIS3D: Joint Semantic-Instance Segmentation of 3D Point Clouds with Multi-Task Pointwise Networks and Multi-Value Conditional Random Fields,"Deep learning techniques have become the to-go models for most vision-related tasks on 2D images. However, their power has not been fully realised on several tasks in 3D space, e.g., 3D scene understanding. In this work, we jointly address the problems of semantic and instance segmentation of 3D point clouds. Specifically, we develop a multi-task pointwise network that simultaneously performs two tasks: predicting the semantic classes of 3D points and embedding the points into high-dimensional vectors so that points of the same object instance are represented by similar embeddings. We then propose a multi-value conditional random field model to incorporate the semantic and instance labels and formulate the problem of semantic and instance segmentation as jointly optimising labels in the field model. The proposed method is thoroughly evaluated and compared with existing methods on different indoor scene datasets including S3DIS and SceneNN. Experimental results showed the robustness of the proposed joint semantic-instance segmentation scheme over its single components. Our method also achieved state-of-the-art performance on semantic segmentation."
ResUNet-a: a deep learning framework for semantic segmentation of remotely sensed data,"Scene understanding of high resolution aerial images is of great importance for the task of automated monitoring in various remote sensing applications. Due to the large within-class and small between-class variance in pixel values of objects of interest, this remains a challenging task. In recent years, deep convolutional neural networks have started being used in remote sensing applications and demonstrate state of the art performance for pixel level classification of objects. \textcolor{black}{Here we propose a reliable framework for performant results for the task of semantic segmentation of monotemporal very high resolution aerial images. Our framework consists of a novel deep learning architecture, ResUNet-a, and a novel loss function based on the Dice loss. ResUNet-a uses a UNet encoder/decoder backbone, in combination with residual connections, atrous convolutions, pyramid scene parsing pooling and multi-tasking inference. ResUNet-a infers sequentially the boundary of the objects, the distance transform of the segmentation mask, the segmentation mask and a colored reconstruction of the input. Each of the tasks is conditioned on the inference of the previous ones, thus establishing a conditioned relationship between the various tasks, as this is described through the architecture's computation graph. We analyse the performance of several flavours of the Generalized Dice loss for semantic segmentation, and we introduce a novel variant loss function for semantic segmentation of objects that has excellent convergence properties and behaves well even under the presence of highly imbalanced classes.} The performance of our modeling framework is evaluated on the ISPRS 2D Potsdam dataset. Results show state-of-the-art performance with an average F1 score of 92.9\% over all classes for our best model."
"The KiTS19 Challenge Data: 300 Kidney Tumor Cases with Clinical Context, CT Semantic Segmentations, and Surgical Outcomes","The morphometry of a kidney tumor revealed by contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) imaging is an important factor in clinical decision making surrounding the lesion's diagnosis and treatment. Quantitative study of the relationship between kidney tumor morphology and clinical outcomes is difficult due to data scarcity and the laborious nature of manually quantifying imaging predictors. Automatic semantic segmentation of kidneys and kidney tumors is a promising tool towards automatically quantifying a wide array of morphometric features, but no sizeable annotated dataset is currently available to train models for this task. We present the KiTS19 challenge dataset: A collection of multi-phase CT imaging, segmentation masks, and comprehensive clinical outcomes for 300 patients who underwent nephrectomy for kidney tumors at our center between 2010 and 2018. 210 (70%) of these patients were selected at random as the training set for the 2019 MICCAI KiTS Kidney Tumor Segmentation Challenge and have been released publicly. With the presence of clinical context and surgical outcomes, this data can serve not only for benchmarking semantic segmentation models, but also for developing and studying biomarkers which make use of the imaging and semantic segmentation masks."
Road Scene Understanding by Occupancy Grid Learning from Sparse Radar Clusters using Semantic Segmentation,"Occupancy grid mapping is an important component in road scene understanding for autonomous driving. It encapsulates information of the drivable area, road obstacles and enables safe autonomous driving. Radars are an emerging sensor in autonomous vehicle vision, becoming more widely used due to their long range sensing, low cost, and robustness to severe weather conditions. Despite recent advances in deep learning technology, occupancy grid mapping from radar data is still mostly done using classical filtering approaches.In this work, we propose learning the inverse sensor model used for occupancy grid mapping from clustered radar data. This is done in a data driven approach that leverages computer vision techniques. This task is very challenging due to data sparsity and noise characteristics of the radar sensor. The problem is formulated as a semantic segmentation task and we show how it can be learned using lidar data for generating ground truth. We show both qualitatively and quantitatively that our learned occupancy net outperforms classic methods by a large margin using the recently released NuScenes real-world driving data."
All about Structure: Adapting Structural Information across Domains for Boosting Semantic Segmentation,"In this paper we tackle the problem of unsupervised domain adaptation for the task of semantic segmentation, where we attempt to transfer the knowledge learned upon synthetic datasets with ground-truth labels to real-world images without any annotation. With the hypothesis that the structural content of images is the most informative and decisive factor to semantic segmentation and can be readily shared across domains, we propose a Domain Invariant Structure Extraction (DISE) framework to disentangle images into domain-invariant structure and domain-specific texture representations, which can further realize image-translation across domains and enable label transfer to improve segmentation performance. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our proposed DISE model and demonstrate its superiority over several state-of-the-art approaches."
FastFCN: Rethinking Dilated Convolution in the Backbone for Semantic Segmentation,"Modern approaches for semantic segmentation usually employ dilated convolutions in the backbone to extract high-resolution feature maps, which brings heavy computation complexity and memory footprint. To replace the time and memory consuming dilated convolutions, we propose a novel joint upsampling module named Joint Pyramid Upsampling (JPU) by formulating the task of extracting high-resolution feature maps into a joint upsampling problem. With the proposed JPU, our method reduces the computation complexity by more than three times without performance loss. Experiments show that JPU is superior to other upsampling modules, which can be plugged into many existing approaches to reduce computation complexity and improve performance. By replacing dilated convolutions with the proposed JPU module, our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance in Pascal Context dataset (mIoU of 53.13%) and ADE20K dataset (final score of 0.5584) while running 3 times faster."
Residual Pyramid Learning for Single-Shot Semantic Segmentation,"Pixel-level semantic segmentation is a challenging task with a huge amount of computation, especially if the size of input is large. In the segmentation model, apart from the feature extraction, the extra decoder structure is often employed to recover spatial information. In this paper, we put forward a method for single-shot segmentation in a feature residual pyramid network (RPNet), which learns the main and residuals of segmentation by decomposing the label at different levels of residual blocks. Specifically speaking, we use the residual features to learn the edges and details, and the identity features to learn the main part of targets. At testing time, the predicted residuals are used to enhance the details of the top-level prediction. Residual learning blocks split the network into several shallow sub-networks which facilitates the training of the RPNet. We then evaluate the proposed method and compare it with recent state-of-the-art methods on CamVid and Cityscapes. The proposed single-shot segmentation based on RPNet achieves impressive results with high efficiency on pixel-level segmentation."
In Defense of Pre-trained ImageNet Architectures for Real-time Semantic Segmentation of Road-driving Images,"Recent success of semantic segmentation approaches on demanding road driving datasets has spurred interest in many related application fields. Many of these applications involve real-time prediction on mobile platforms such as cars, drones and various kinds of robots. Real-time setup is challenging due to extraordinary computational complexity involved. Many previous works address the challenge with custom lightweight architectures which decrease computational complexity by reducing depth, width and layer capacity with respect to general purpose architectures. We propose an alternative approach which achieves a significantly better performance across a wide range of computing budgets. First, we rely on a light-weight general purpose architecture as the main recognition engine. Then, we leverage light-weight upsampling with lateral connections as the most cost-effective solution to restore the prediction resolution. Finally, we propose to enlarge the receptive field by fusing shared features at multiple resolutions in a novel fashion. Experiments on several road driving datasets show a substantial advantage of the proposed approach, either with ImageNet pre-trained parameters or when we learn from scratch. Our Cityscapes test submission entitled SwiftNetRN-18 delivers 75.5% MIoU and achieves 39.9 Hz on 1024x2048 images on GTX1080Ti."
Real time backbone for semantic segmentation,"The rapid development of autonomous driving in recent years presents lots of challenges for scene understanding. As an essential step towards scene understanding, semantic segmentation thus received lots of attention in past few years. Although deep learning based state-of-the-arts have achieved great success in improving the segmentation accuracy, most of them suffer from an inefficiency problem and can hardly applied to practical applications. In this paper, we systematically analyze the computation cost of Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) and found that the inefficiency of CNN is mainly caused by its wide structure rather than the deep structure. In addition, the success of pruning based model compression methods proved that there are many redundant channels in CNN. Thus, we designed a very narrow while deep backbone network to improve the efficiency of semantic segmentation. By casting our network to FCN32 segmentation architecture, the basic structure of most segmentation methods, we achieved 60.6\% mIoU on Cityscape val dataset with 54 frame per seconds(FPS) on 1024\times2048 inputs, which already outperforms one of the earliest real time deep learning based segmentation methods: ENet."
A Cross-Season Correspondence Dataset for Robust Semantic Segmentation,"In this paper, we present a method to utilize 2D-2D point matches between images taken during different image conditions to train a convolutional neural network for semantic segmentation. Enforcing label consistency across the matches makes the final segmentation algorithm robust to seasonal changes. We describe how these 2D-2D matches can be generated with little human interaction by geometrically matching points from 3D models built from images. Two cross-season correspondence datasets are created providing 2D-2D matches across seasonal changes as well as from day to night. The datasets are made publicly available to facilitate further research. We show that adding the correspondences as extra supervision during training improves the segmentation performance of the convolutional neural network, making it more robust to seasonal changes and weather conditions."
Knowledge Adaptation for Efficient Semantic Segmentation,"Both accuracy and efficiency are of significant importance to the task of semantic segmentation. Existing deep FCNs suffer from heavy computations due to a series of high-resolution feature maps for preserving the detailed knowledge in dense estimation. Although reducing the feature map resolution (i.e., applying a large overall stride) via subsampling operations (e.g., pooling and convolution striding) can instantly increase the efficiency, it dramatically decreases the estimation accuracy. To tackle this dilemma, we propose a knowledge distillation method tailored for semantic segmentation to improve the performance of the compact FCNs with large overall stride. To handle the inconsistency between the features of the student and teacher network, we optimize the feature similarity in a transferred latent domain formulated by utilizing a pre-trained autoencoder. Moreover, an affinity distillation module is proposed to capture the long-range dependency by calculating the non-local interactions across the whole image. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, extensive experiments have been conducted on three popular benchmarks: Pascal VOC, Cityscapes and Pascal Context. Built upon a highly competitive baseline, our proposed method can improve the performance of a student network by 2.5\% (mIOU boosts from 70.2 to 72.7 on the cityscapes test set) and can train a better compact model with only 8\% float operations (FLOPS) of a model that achieves comparable performances."
On Boosting Semantic Street Scene Segmentation with Weak Supervision,"Training convolutional networks for semantic segmentation requires per-pixel ground truth labels, which are very time consuming and hence costly to obtain. Therefore, in this work, we research and develop a hierarchical deep network architecture and the corresponding loss for semantic segmentation that can be trained from weak supervision, such as bounding boxes or image level labels, as well as from strong per-pixel supervision. We demonstrate that the hierarchical structure and the simultaneous training on strong (per-pixel) and weak (bounding boxes) labels, even from separate datasets, constantly increases the performance against per-pixel only training. Moreover, we explore the more challenging case of adding weak image-level labels. We collect street scene images and weak labels from the immense Open Images dataset to generate the OpenScapes dataset, and we use this novel dataset to increase segmentation performance on two established per-pixel labeled datasets, Cityscapes and Vistas. We report performance gains up to +13.2% mIoU on crucial street scene classes, and inference speed of 20 fps on a Titan V GPU for Cityscapes at 512 x 1024 resolution. Our network and OpenScapes dataset are shared with the research community."
Robust Semantic Segmentation By Dense Fusion Network On Blurred VHR Remote Sensing Images,"Robust semantic segmentation of VHR remote sensing images from UAV sensors is critical for earth observation, land use, land cover or mapping applications. Several factors such as shadows, weather disruption and camera shakes making this problem highly challenging, especially only using RGB images. In this paper, we propose the use of multi-modality data including NIR, RGB and DSM to increase robustness of segmentation in blurred or partially damaged VHR remote sensing images. By proposing a cascaded dense encoder-decoder network and the SELayer based fusion and assembling techniques, the proposed RobustDenseNet achieves steady performance when the image quality is decreasing, compared with the state-of-the-art semantic segmentation model."
Decoders Matter for Semantic Segmentation: Data-Dependent Decoding Enables Flexible Feature Aggregation,"Recent semantic segmentation methods exploit encoder-decoder architectures to produce the desired pixel-wise segmentation prediction. The last layer of the decoders is typically a bilinear upsampling procedure to recover the final pixel-wise prediction. We empirically show that this oversimple and data-independent bilinear upsampling may lead to sub-optimal results.  In this work, we propose a data-dependent upsampling (DUpsampling) to replace bilinear, which takes advantages of the redundancy in the label space of semantic segmentation and is able to recover the pixel-wise prediction from low-resolution outputs of CNNs. The main advantage of the new upsampling layer lies in that with a relatively lower-resolution feature map such as \frac{1}{16} or \frac{1}{32} of the input size, we can achieve even better segmentation accuracy, significantly reducing computation complexity. This is made possible by 1) the new upsampling layer's much improved reconstruction capability; and more importantly 2) the DUpsampling based decoder's flexibility in leveraging almost arbitrary combinations of the CNN encoders' features. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed decoder outperforms the state-of-the-art decoder, with only \sim20\% of computation. Finally, without any post-processing, the framework equipped with our proposed decoder achieves new state-of-the-art performance on two datasets: 88.1\% mIOU on PASCAL VOC with 30\% computation of the previously best model; and 52.5\% mIOU on PASCAL Context."
Fine-Grained Semantic Segmentation of Motion Capture Data using Dilated Temporal Fully-Convolutional Networks,"Human motion capture data has been widely used in data-driven character animation. In order to generate realistic, natural-looking motions, most data-driven approaches require considerable efforts of pre-processing, including motion segmentation and annotation. Existing (semi-) automatic solutions either require hand-crafted features for motion segmentation or do not produce the semantic annotations required for motion synthesis and building large-scale motion databases. In addition, human labeled annotation data suffers from inter- and intra-labeler inconsistencies by design. We propose a semi-automatic framework for semantic segmentation of motion capture data based on supervised machine learning techniques. It first transforms a motion capture sequence into a ``motion image'' and applies a convolutional neural network for image segmentation. Dilated temporal convolutions enable the extraction of temporal information from a large receptive field. Our model outperforms two state-of-the-art models for action segmentation, as well as a popular network for sequence modeling. Most of all, our method is very robust under noisy and inaccurate training labels and thus can handle human errors during the labeling process."
FickleNet: Weakly and Semi-supervised Semantic Image Segmentation using Stochastic Inference,"The main obstacle to weakly supervised semantic image segmentation is the difficulty of obtaining pixel-level information from coarse image-level annotations. Most methods based on image-level annotations use localization maps obtained from the classifier, but these only focus on the small discriminative parts of objects and do not capture precise boundaries. FickleNet explores diverse combinations of locations on feature maps created by generic deep neural networks. It selects hidden units randomly and then uses them to obtain activation scores for image classification. FickleNet implicitly learns the coherence of each location in the feature maps, resulting in a localization map which identifies both discriminative and other parts of objects. The ensemble effects are obtained from a single network by selecting random hidden unit pairs, which means that a variety of localization maps are generated from a single image. Our approach does not require any additional training steps and only adds a simple layer to a standard convolutional neural network; nevertheless it outperforms recent comparable techniques on the Pascal VOC 2012 benchmark in both weakly and semi-supervised settings."
Associatively Segmenting Instances and Semantics in Point Clouds,"A 3D point cloud describes the real scene precisely and intuitively.To date how to segment diversified elements in such an informative 3D scene is rarely discussed. In this paper, we first introduce a simple and flexible framework to segment instances and semantics in point clouds simultaneously. Then, we propose two approaches which make the two tasks take advantage of each other, leading to a win-win situation. Specifically, we make instance segmentation benefit from semantic segmentation through learning semantic-aware point-level instance embedding. Meanwhile, semantic features of the points belonging to the same instance are fused together to make more accurate per-point semantic predictions. Our method largely outperforms the state-of-the-art method in 3D instance segmentation along with a significant improvement in 3D semantic segmentation. Code has been made available at: https://github.com/WXinlong/ASIS."
U-NetPlus: A Modified Encoder-Decoder U-Net Architecture for Semantic and Instance Segmentation of Surgical Instrument,"Conventional therapy approaches limit surgeons' dexterity control due to limited field-of-view. With the advent of robot-assisted surgery, there has been a paradigm shift in medical technology for minimally invasive surgery. However, it is very challenging to track the position of the surgical instruments in a surgical scene, and accurate detection & identification of surgical tools is paramount. Deep learning-based semantic segmentation in frames of surgery videos has the potential to facilitate this task. In this work, we modify the U-Net architecture named U-NetPlus, by introducing a pre-trained encoder and re-design the decoder part, by replacing the transposed convolution operation with an upsampling operation based on nearest-neighbor (NN) interpolation. To further improve performance, we also employ a very fast and flexible data augmentation technique. We trained the framework on 8 x 225 frame sequences of robotic surgical videos, available through the MICCAI 2017 EndoVis Challenge dataset and tested it on 8 x 75 frame and 2 x 300 frame videos. Using our U-NetPlus architecture, we report a 90.20% DICE for binary segmentation, 76.26% DICE for instrument part segmentation, and 46.07% for instrument type (i.e., all instruments) segmentation, outperforming the results of previous techniques implemented and tested on these data."
"Deep Multi-modal Object Detection and Semantic Segmentation for Autonomous Driving: Datasets, Methods, and Challenges","Recent advancements in perception for autonomous driving are driven by deep learning. In order to achieve robust and accurate scene understanding, autonomous vehicles are usually equipped with different sensors (e.g. cameras, LiDARs, Radars), and multiple sensing modalities can be fused to exploit their complementary properties. In this context, many methods have been proposed for deep multi-modal perception problems. However, there is no general guideline for network architecture design, and questions of ""what to fuse"", ""when to fuse"", and ""how to fuse"" remain open. This review paper attempts to systematically summarize methodologies and discuss challenges for deep multi-modal object detection and semantic segmentation in autonomous driving. To this end, we first provide an overview of on-board sensors on test vehicles, open datasets, and background information for object detection and semantic segmentation in autonomous driving research. We then summarize the fusion methodologies and discuss challenges and open questions. In the appendix, we provide tables that summarize topics and methods. We also provide an interactive online platform to navigate each reference: https://boschresearch.github.io/multimodalperception/."
An efficient solution for semantic segmentation: ShuffleNet V2 with atrous separable convolutions,"Assigning a label to each pixel in an image, namely semantic segmentation, has been an important task in computer vision, and has applications in autonomous driving, robotic navigation, localization, and scene understanding. Fully convolutional neural networks have proved to be a successful solution for the task over the years but most of the work being done focuses primarily on accuracy. In this paper, we present a computationally efficient approach to semantic segmentation, while achieving a high mean intersection over union (mIOU), 70.33% on Cityscapes challenge. The network proposed is capable of running real-time on mobile devices. In addition, we make our code and model weights publicly available."
BusyHands: A Hand-Tool Interaction Database for Assembly Tasks Semantic Segmentation,"Visual segmentation has seen tremendous advancement recently with ready solutions for a wide variety of scene types, including human hands and other body parts. However, focus on segmentation of human hands while performing complex tasks, such as manual assembly, is still severely lacking. Segmenting hands from tools, work pieces, background and other body parts is extremely difficult because of self-occlusions and intricate hand grips and poses. In this paper we introduce BusyHands, a large open dataset of pixel-level annotated images of hands performing 13 different tool-based assembly tasks, from both real-world captures and virtual-world renderings. A total of 7906 samples are included in our first-in-kind dataset, with both RGB and depth images as obtained from a Kinect V2 camera and Blender. We evaluate several state-of-the-art semantic segmentation methods on our dataset as a proposed performance benchmark."
3D Graph Embedding Learning with a Structure-aware Loss Function for Point Cloud Semantic Instance Segmentation,"This paper introduces a novel approach for 3D semantic instance segmentation on point clouds. A 3D convolutional neural network called submanifold sparse convolutional network is used to generate semantic predictions and instance embeddings simultaneously. To obtain discriminative embeddings for each 3D instance, a structure-aware loss function is proposed which considers both the structure information and the embedding information. To get more consistent embeddings for each 3D instance, attention-based k nearest neighbour (KNN) is proposed to assign different weights for different neighbours. Based on the attention-based KNN, we add a graph convolutional network after the sparse convolutional network to get refined embeddings. Our network can be trained end-to-end. A simple mean-shift algorithm is utilized to cluster refined embeddings to get final instance predictions. As a result, our framework can output both the semantic prediction and the instance prediction. Experiments show that our approach outperforms all state-of-art methods on ScanNet benchmark and NYUv2 dataset."
Network Semantic Segmentation with Application to GitHub,In this paper we introduce the concept of network semantic segmentation for social network analysis. We consider the GitHub social coding network which has been a center of attention for both researchers and software developers. Network semantic segmentation describes the process of associating each user with a class label such as a topic of interest. We augment node attributes with network significant connections and then employ machine learning approaches to cluster the users. We compare the results with a network segmentation performed using community detection algorithms and one executed by clustering with node attributes. Results are compared in terms of community diversity within the semantic segments along with topic
Progressively Growing Generative Adversarial Networks for High Resolution Semantic Segmentation of Satellite Images,"Machine learning has proven to be useful in classification and segmentation of images. In this paper, we evaluate a training methodology for pixel-wise segmentation on high resolution satellite images using progressive growing of generative adversarial networks. We apply our model to segmenting building rooftops and compare these results to conventional methods for rooftop segmentation. We present our findings using the SpaceNet version 2 dataset. Progressive GAN training achieved a test accuracy of 93% compared to 89% for traditional GAN training."
Fast-SCNN: Fast Semantic Segmentation Network,"The encoder-decoder framework is state-of-the-art for offline semantic image segmentation. Since the rise in autonomous systems, real-time computation is increasingly desirable. In this paper, we introduce fast segmentation convolutional neural network (Fast-SCNN), an above real-time semantic segmentation model on high resolution image data (1024x2048px) suited to efficient computation on embedded devices with low memory. Building on existing two-branch methods for fast segmentation, we introduce our `learning to downsample' module which computes low-level features for multiple resolution branches simultaneously. Our network combines spatial detail at high resolution with deep features extracted at lower resolution, yielding an accuracy of 68.0% mean intersection over union at 123.5 frames per second on Cityscapes. We also show that large scale pre-training is unnecessary. We thoroughly validate our metric in experiments with ImageNet pre-training and the coarse labeled data of Cityscapes. Finally, we show even faster computation with competitive results on subsampled inputs, without any network modifications."
The effect of scene context on weakly supervised semantic segmentation,"Image semantic segmentation is parsing image into several partitions in such a way that each region of which involves a semantic concept. In a weakly supervised manner, since only image-level labels are available, discriminating objects from the background is challenging, and in some cases, much more difficult. More specifically, some objects which are commonly seen in one specific scene (e.g. 'train' typically is seen on 'railroad track') are much more likely to be confused. In this paper, we propose a method to add the target-specific scenes in order to overcome the aforementioned problem. Actually, we propose a scene recommender which suggests to add some specific scene contexts to the target dataset in order to train the model more accurately. It is notable that this idea could be a complementary part of the baselines of many other methods. The experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method for the objects for which the scene context is added."
GAN- vs. JPEG2000 Image Compression for Distributed Automotive Perception: Higher Peak SNR Does Not Mean Better Semantic Segmentation,"The high amount of sensors required for autonomous driving poses enormous challenges on the capacity of automotive bus systems. There is a need to understand tradeoffs between bitrate and perception performance. In this paper, we compare the image compression standards JPEG, JPEG2000, and WebP to a modern encoder/decoder image compression approach based on generative adversarial networks (GANs). We evaluate both the pure compression performance using typical metrics such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity (SSIM) and others, but also the performance of a subsequent perception function, namely a semantic segmentation (characterized by the mean intersection over union (mIoU) measure). Not surprisingly, for all investigated compression methods, a higher bitrate means better results in all investigated quality metrics. Interestingly, however, we show that the semantic segmentation mIoU of the GAN autoencoder in the highly relevant low-bitrate regime (at 0.0625 bit/pixel) is better by 3.9% absolute than JPEG2000, although the latter still is considerably better in terms of PSNR (5.91 dB difference). This effect can greatly be enlarged by training the semantic segmentation model with images originating from the decoder, so that the mIoU using the segmentation model trained by GAN reconstructions exceeds the use of the model trained with original images by almost 20% absolute. We conclude that distributed perception in future autonomous driving will most probably not provide a solution to the automotive bus capacity bottleneck by using standard compression schemes such as JPEG2000, but requires modern coding approaches, with the GAN encoder/decoder method being a promising candidate."
Fully Convolutional Neural Network for Semantic Segmentation of Anatomical Structure and Pathologies in Colour Fundus Images Associated with Diabetic Retinopathy,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the most common form of diabetic eye disease. Retinopathy can affect all diabetic patients and becomes particularly dangerous, increasing the risk of blindness, if it is left untreated. The success rate of its curability solemnly depends on diagnosis at an early stage. The development of automated computer aided disease diagnosis tools could help in faster detection of symptoms with a wider reach and reasonable cost. This paper proposes a method for the automated segmentation of retinal lesions and optic disk in fundus images using a deep fully convolutional neural network for semantic segmentation. This trainable segmentation pipeline consists of an encoder network, a corresponding decoder network followed by pixel-wise classification to segment microaneurysms, hemorrhages, hard exudates, soft exudates, optic disk from background. The network was trained using Binary cross entropy criterion with Sigmoid as the last layer, while during an additional SoftMax layer was used for boosting response of single class. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using sensitivity, positive prediction value (PPV) and accuracy as the metrices. Further, the position of the Optic disk is localised using the segmented output map."
Technical Considerations for Semantic Segmentation in MRI using Convolutional Neural Networks,"High-fidelity semantic segmentation of magnetic resonance volumes is critical for estimating tissue morphometry and relaxation parameters in both clinical and research applications. While manual segmentation is accepted as the gold-standard, recent advances in deep learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promise for efficient automatic segmentation of soft tissues. However, due to the stochastic nature of deep learning and the multitude of hyperparameters in training networks, predicting network behavior is challenging. In this paper, we quantify the impact of three factors associated with CNN segmentation performance: network architecture, training loss functions, and training data characteristics. We evaluate the impact of these variations on the segmentation of femoral cartilage and propose potential modifications to CNN architectures and training protocols to train these models with confidence."
Application of Decision Rules for Handling Class Imbalance in Semantic Segmentation,"As part of autonomous car driving systems, semantic segmentation is an essential component to obtain a full understanding of the car's environment. One difficulty, that occurs while training neural networks for this purpose, is class imbalance of training data. Consequently, a neural network trained on unbalanced data in combination with maximum a-posteriori classification may easily ignore classes that are rare in terms of their frequency in the dataset. However, these classes are often of highest interest. We approach such potential misclassifications by weighting the posterior class probabilities with the prior class probabilities which in our case are the inverse frequencies of the corresponding classes in the training dataset. More precisely, we adopt a localized method by computing the priors pixel-wise such that the impact can be analyzed at pixel level as well. In our experiments, we train one network from scratch using a proprietary dataset containing 20,000 annotated frames of video sequences recorded from street scenes. The evaluation on our test set shows an increase of average recall with regard to instances of pedestrians and info signs by 25\% and 23.4\%, respectively. In addition, we significantly reduce the non-detection rate for instances of the same classes by 61\% and 38\%."
Random Forest with Learned Representations for Semantic Segmentation,"In this work, we present a random forest framework that learns the weights, shapes, and sparsities of feature representations for real-time semantic segmentation. Typical filters (kernels) have predetermined shapes and sparsities and learn only weights. A few feature extraction methods fix weights and learn only shapes and sparsities. These predetermined constraints restrict learning and extracting optimal features. To overcome this limitation, we propose an unconstrained representation that is able to extract optimal features by learning weights, shapes, and sparsities. We, then, present the random forest framework that learns the flexible filters using an iterative optimization algorithm and segments input images using the learned representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method using a hand segmentation dataset for hand-object interaction and using two semantic segmentation datasets. The results show that the proposed method achieves real-time semantic segmentation using limited computational and memory resources."
Optical Flow augmented Semantic Segmentation networks for Automated Driving,"Motion is a dominant cue in automated driving systems. Optical flow is typically computed to detect moving objects and to estimate depth using triangulation. In this paper, our motivation is to leverage the existing dense optical flow to improve the performance of semantic segmentation. To provide a systematic study, we construct four different architectures which use RGB only, flow only, RGBF concatenated and two-stream RGB + flow. We evaluate these networks on two automotive datasets namely Virtual KITTI and Cityscapes using the state-of-the-art flow estimator FlowNet v2. We also make use of the ground truth optical flow in Virtual KITTI to serve as an ideal estimator and a standard Farneback optical flow algorithm to study the effect of noise. Using the flow ground truth in Virtual KITTI, two-stream architecture achieves the best results with an improvement of 4% IoU. As expected, there is a large improvement for moving objects like trucks, vans and cars with 38%, 28% and 6% increase in IoU. FlowNet produces an improvement of 2.4% in average IoU with larger improvement in the moving objects corresponding to 26%, 11% and 5% in trucks, vans and cars. In Cityscapes, flow augmentation provided an improvement for moving objects like motorcycle and train with an increase of 17% and 7% in IoU."
Design of Real-time Semantic Segmentation Decoder for Automated Driving,"Semantic segmentation remains a computationally intensive algorithm for embedded deployment even with the rapid growth of computation power. Thus efficient network design is a critical aspect especially for applications like automated driving which requires real-time performance. Recently, there has been a lot of research on designing efficient encoders that are mostly task agnostic. Unlike image classification and bounding box object detection tasks, decoders are computationally expensive as well for semantic segmentation task. In this work, we focus on efficient design of the segmentation decoder and assume that an efficient encoder is already designed to provide shared features for a multi-task learning system. We design a novel efficient non-bottleneck layer and a family of decoders which fit into a small run-time budget using VGG10 as efficient encoder. We demonstrate in our dataset that experimentation with various design choices led to an improvement of 10\% from a baseline performance."
Guided Curriculum Model Adaptation and Uncertainty-Aware Evaluation for Semantic Nighttime Image Segmentation,"Most progress in semantic segmentation reports on daytime images taken under favorable illumination conditions. We instead address the problem of semantic segmentation of nighttime images and improve the state-of-the-art, by adapting daytime models to nighttime without using nighttime annotations. Moreover, we design a new evaluation framework to address the substantial uncertainty of semantics in nighttime images. Our central contributions are: 1) a curriculum framework to gradually adapt semantic segmentation models from day to night via labeled synthetic images and unlabeled real images, both for progressively darker times of day, which exploits cross-time-of-day correspondences for the real images to guide the inference of their labels; 2) a novel uncertainty-aware annotation and evaluation framework and metric for semantic segmentation, designed for adverse conditions and including image regions beyond human recognition capability in the evaluation in a principled fashion; 3) the Dark Zurich dataset, which comprises 2416 unlabeled nighttime and 2920 unlabeled twilight images with correspondences to their daytime counterparts plus a set of 151 nighttime images with fine pixel-level annotations created with our protocol, which serves as a first benchmark to perform our novel evaluation. Experiments show that our guided curriculum adaptation significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on real nighttime sets both for standard metrics and our uncertainty-aware metric. Furthermore, our uncertainty-aware evaluation reveals that selective invalidation of predictions can lead to better results on data with ambiguous content such as our nighttime benchmark and profit safety-oriented applications which involve invalid inputs."
AuxNet: Auxiliary tasks enhanced Semantic Segmentation for Automated Driving,"Decision making in automated driving is highly specific to the environment and thus semantic segmentation plays a key role in recognizing the objects in the environment around the car. Pixel level classification once considered a challenging task which is now becoming mature to be productized in a car. However, semantic annotation is time consuming and quite expensive. Synthetic datasets with domain adaptation techniques have been used to alleviate the lack of large annotated datasets. In this work, we explore an alternate approach of leveraging the annotations of other tasks to improve semantic segmentation. Recently, multi-task learning became a popular paradigm in automated driving which demonstrates joint learning of multiple tasks improves overall performance of each tasks. Motivated by this, we use auxiliary tasks like depth estimation to improve the performance of semantic segmentation task. We propose adaptive task loss weighting techniques to address scale issues in multi-task loss functions which become more crucial in auxiliary tasks. We experimented on automotive datasets including SYNTHIA and KITTI and obtained 3% and 5% improvement in accuracy respectively."
Real-time Joint Object Detection and Semantic Segmentation Network for Automated Driving,"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are successfully used for various visual perception tasks including bounding box object detection, semantic segmentation, optical flow, depth estimation and visual SLAM. Generally these tasks are independently explored and modeled. In this paper, we present a joint multi-task network design for learning object detection and semantic segmentation simultaneously. The main motivation is to achieve real-time performance on a low power embedded SOC by sharing of encoder for both the tasks. We construct an efficient architecture using a small ResNet10 like encoder which is shared for both decoders. Object detection uses YOLO v2 like decoder and semantic segmentation uses FCN8 like decoder. We evaluate the proposed network in two public datasets (KITTI, Cityscapes) and in our private fisheye camera dataset, and demonstrate that joint network provides the same accuracy as that of separate networks. We further optimize the network to achieve 30 fps for 1280x384 resolution image."
Auto-DeepLab: Hierarchical Neural Architecture Search for Semantic Image Segmentation,"Recently, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has successfully identified neural network architectures that exceed human designed ones on large-scale image classification. In this paper, we study NAS for semantic image segmentation. Existing works often focus on searching the repeatable cell structure, while hand-designing the outer network structure that controls the spatial resolution changes. This choice simplifies the search space, but becomes increasingly problematic for dense image prediction which exhibits a lot more network level architectural variations. Therefore, we propose to search the network level structure in addition to the cell level structure, which forms a hierarchical architecture search space. We present a network level search space that includes many popular designs, and develop a formulation that allows efficient gradient-based architecture search (3 P100 GPU days on Cityscapes images). We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on the challenging Cityscapes, PASCAL VOC 2012, and ADE20K datasets. Auto-DeepLab, our architecture searched specifically for semantic image segmentation, attains state-of-the-art performance without any ImageNet pretraining."
TraceCaps: A Capsule-based Neural Network for Semantic Segmentation,"In this paper, we propose a capsule-based neural network model to solve the semantic segmentation problem. By taking advantage of the extractable part-whole dependencies available in capsule layers, we derive the probabilities of the class labels for individual capsules through a recursive, layer-by-layer procedure. We model this procedure as a traceback pipeline and take it as a central piece to build an end-to-end segmentation network. Under the proposed framework, image-level class labels and object boundaries are jointly sought in an explicit manner, which poses a significant advantage over the state-of-the-art fully convolutional network (FCN) solutions. With the capability to extracted part-whole information, our traceback pipeline can potentially be utilized as the building blocks to design interpretable neural networks. Experiments conducted on modified MNIST and neuroimages demonstrate that our model considerably enhance the segmentation performance compared to the leading FCN variants."
Multi-stream CNN based Video Semantic Segmentation for Automated Driving,"Majority of semantic segmentation algorithms operate on a single frame even in the case of videos. In this work, the goal is to exploit temporal information within the algorithm model for leveraging motion cues and temporal consistency. We propose two simple high-level architectures based on Recurrent FCN (RFCN) and Multi-Stream FCN (MSFCN) networks. In case of RFCN, a recurrent network namely LSTM is inserted between the encoder and decoder. MSFCN combines the encoders of different frames into a fused encoder via 1x1 channel-wise convolution. We use a ResNet50 network as the baseline encoder and construct three networks namely MSFCN of order 2 & 3 and RFCN of order 2. MSFCN-3 produces the best results with an accuracy improvement of 9% and 15% for Highway and New York-like city scenarios in the SYNTHIA-CVPR'16 dataset using mean IoU metric. MSFCN-3 also produced 11% and 6% for SegTrack V2 and DAVIS datasets over the baseline FCN network. We also designed an efficient version of MSFCN-2 and RFCN-2 using weight sharing among the two encoders. The efficient MSFCN-2 provided an improvement of 11% and 5% for KITTI and SYNTHIA with negligible increase in computational complexity compared to the baseline version."
Fully Convolutional Deep Network Architectures for Automatic Short Glass Fiber Semantic Segmentation from CT scans,We present the first attempt to perform short glass fiber semantic segmentation from X-ray computed tomography volumetric datasets at medium (3.9 μm isotropic) and low (8.3 μm isotropic) resolution using deep learning architectures. We performed experiments on both synthetic and real CT scans and evaluated deep fully convolutional architectures with both 2D and 3D kernels. Our artificial neural networks outperform existing methods at both medium and low resolution scans.
Impact of Ground Truth Annotation Quality on Performance of Semantic Image Segmentation of Traffic Conditions,"Preparation of high-quality datasets for the urban scene understanding is a labor-intensive task, especially, for datasets designed for the autonomous driving applications. The application of the coarse ground truth (GT) annotations of these datasets without detriment to the accuracy of semantic image segmentation (by the mean intersection over union - mIoU) could simplify and speedup the dataset preparation and model fine tuning before its practical application. Here the results of the comparative analysis for semantic segmentation accuracy obtained by PSPNet deep learning architecture are presented for fine and coarse annotated images from Cityscapes dataset. Two scenarios were investigated: scenario 1 - the fine GT images for training and prediction, and scenario 2 - the fine GT images for training and the coarse GT images for prediction. The obtained results demonstrated that for the most important classes the mean accuracy values of semantic image segmentation for coarse GT annotations are higher than for the fine GT ones, and the standard deviation values are vice versa. It means that for some applications some unimportant classes can be excluded and the model can be tuned further for some classes and specific regions on the coarse GT dataset without loss of the accuracy even. Moreover, this opens the perspectives to use deep neural networks for the preparation of such coarse GT datasets."
Coarse-to-fine Semantic Segmentation from Image-level Labels,"Deep neural network-based semantic segmentation generally requires large-scale cost extensive annotations for training to obtain better performance. To avoid pixel-wise segmentation annotations which are needed for most methods, recently some researchers attempted to use object-level labels (e.g. bounding boxes) or image-level labels (e.g. image categories). In this paper, we propose a novel recursive coarse-to-fine semantic segmentation framework based on only image-level category labels. For each image, an initial coarse mask is first generated by a convolutional neural network-based unsupervised foreground segmentation model and then is enhanced by a graph model. The enhanced coarse mask is fed to a fully convolutional neural network to be recursively refined. Unlike existing image-level label-based semantic segmentation methods which require to label all categories for images contain multiple types of objects, our framework only needs one label for each image and can handle images contains multi-category objects. With only trained on ImageNet, our framework achieves comparable performance on PASCAL VOC dataset as other image-level label-based state-of-the-arts of semantic segmentation. Furthermore, our framework can be easily extended to foreground object segmentation task and achieves comparable performance with the state-of-the-art supervised methods on the Internet Object dataset."
Future semantic segmentation of time-lapsed videos with large temporal displacement,"An important aspect of video understanding is the ability to predict the evolution of its content in the future. This paper presents a future frame semantic segmentation technique for predicting semantic masks of the current and future frames in a time-lapsed video. We specifically focus on time-lapsed videos with large temporal displacement to highlight the model's ability to capture large motions in time. We first introduce a unique semantic segmentation prediction dataset with over 120,000 time-lapsed sky-video frames and all corresponding semantic masks captured over a span of five years in North America region. The dataset has immense practical value for cloud cover analysis, which are treated as non-rigid objects of interest. %Here the model provides both semantic segmentation of cloud region and solar irradiance emitted from a region from the sky-videos. Next, our proposed recurrent network architecture departs from existing trend of using temporal convolutional networks (TCN) (or feed-forward networks), by explicitly learning an internal representations for the evolution of video content with time. Experimental evaluation shows an improvement of mean IoU over TCNs in the segmentation task by 10.8% for 10 mins (21% over 60 mins) ahead of time predictions. Further, our model simultaneously measures both the current and future solar irradiance from the same video frames with a normalized-MAE of 10.5% over two years. These results indicate that recurrent memory networks with attention mechanism are able to capture complex advective and diffused flow characteristic of dense fluids even with sparse temporal sampling and are more suitable for future frame prediction tasks for longer duration videos."
Finite State Machines for Semantic Scene Parsing and Segmentation,"We introduce in this work a novel stochastic inference process, for scene annotation and object class segmentation, based on finite state machines (FSMs). The design principle of our framework is generative and based on building, for a given scene, finite state machines that encode annotation lattices, and inference consists in finding and scoring the best configurations in these lattices. Different novel operations are defined using our FSM framework including reordering, segmentation, visual transduction, and label dependency modeling. All these operations are combined together in order to achieve annotation as well as object class segmentation."
S4-Net: Geometry-Consistent Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"We show that it is possible to learn semantic segmentation from very limited amounts of manual annotations, by enforcing geometric 3D constraints between multiple views. More exactly, image locations corresponding to the same physical 3D point should all have the same label. We show that introducing such constraints during learning is very effective, even when no manual label is available for a 3D point, and can be done simply by employing techniques from 'general' semi-supervised learning to the context of semantic segmentation. To demonstrate this idea, we use RGB-D image sequences of rigid scenes, for a 4-class segmentation problem derived from the ScanNet dataset. Starting from RGB-D sequences with a few annotated frames, we show that we can incorporate RGB-D sequences without any manual annotations to improve the performance, which makes our approach very convenient. Furthermore, we demonstrate our approach for semantic segmentation of objects on the LabelFusion dataset, where we show that one manually labeled image in a scene is sufficient for high performance on the whole scene."
A Unified Framework for Mutual Improvement of SLAM and Semantic Segmentation,"This paper presents a novel framework for simultaneously implementing localization and segmentation, which are two of the most important vision-based tasks for robotics. While the goals and techniques used for them were considered to be different previously, we show that by making use of the intermediate results of the two modules, their performance can be enhanced at the same time. Our framework is able to handle both the instantaneous motion and long-term changes of instances in localization with the help of the segmentation result, which also benefits from the refined 3D pose information. We conduct experiments on various datasets, and prove that our framework works effectively on improving the precision and robustness of the two tasks and outperforms existing localization and segmentation algorithms."
A Curriculum Domain Adaptation Approach to the Semantic Segmentation of Urban Scenes,"During the last half decade, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have triumphed over semantic segmentation, which is one of the core tasks in many applications such as autonomous driving and augmented reality. However, to train CNNs requires a considerable amount of data, which is difficult to collect and laborious to annotate. Recent advances in computer graphics make it possible to train CNNs on photo-realistic synthetic imagery with computer-generated annotations. Despite this, the domain mismatch between the real images and the synthetic data hinders the models' performance. Hence, we propose a curriculum-style learning approach to minimizing the domain gap in urban scene semantic segmentation. The curriculum domain adaptation solves easy tasks first to infer necessary properties about the target domain; in particular, the first task is to learn global label distributions over images and local distributions over landmark superpixels. These are easy to estimate because images of urban scenes have strong idiosyncrasies (e.g., the size and spatial relations of buildings, streets, cars, etc.). We then train a segmentation network, while regularizing its predictions in the target domain to follow those inferred properties. In experiments, our method outperforms the baselines on two datasets and two backbone networks. We also report extensive ablation studies about our approach."
Holistic Decomposition Convolution for Effective Semantic Segmentation of 3D MR Images,"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many different 2D medical image analysis tasks. In clinical practice, however, a large part of the medical imaging data available is in 3D. This has motivated the development of 3D CNNs for volumetric image segmentation in order to benefit from more spatial context. Due to GPU memory restrictions caused by moving to fully 3D, state-of-the-art methods depend on subvolume/patch processing and the size of the input patch is usually small, limiting the incorporation of larger context information for a better performance. In this paper, we propose a novel Holistic Decomposition Convolution (HDC), for an effective and efficient semantic segmentation of volumetric images. HDC consists of a periodic down-shuffling operation followed by a conventional 3D convolution. HDC has the advantage of significantly reducing the size of the data for sub-sequential processing while using all the information available in the input irrespective of the down-shuffling factors. Results obtained from comprehensive experiments conducted on hip T1 MR images and intervertebral disc T2 MR images demonstrate the efficacy of the present approach."
DSNet for Real-Time Driving Scene Semantic Segmentation,"We focus on the very challenging task of semantic segmentation for autonomous driving system. It must deliver decent semantic segmentation result for traffic critical objects real-time. In this paper, we propose a very efficient yet powerful deep neural network for driving scene semantic segmentation termed as Driving Segmentation Network (DSNet). DSNet achieves state-of-the-art balance between accuracy and inference speed through efficient units and architecture design inspired by ShuffleNet V2 and ENet. More importantly, DSNet highlights classes most critical with driving decision making through our novel Driving Importance-weighted Loss. We evaluate DSNet on Cityscapes dataset, our DSNet achieves 71.8% mean Intersection-over-Union (IoU) on validation set and 69.3% on test set. Class-wise IoU scores show that Driving Importance-weighted Loss could improve most driving critical classes by a large margin. Compared with ENet, DSNet is 18.9% more accurate and 1.1+ times faster which implies great potential for autonomous driving application."
3D-SIS: 3D Semantic Instance Segmentation of RGB-D Scans,"We introduce 3D-SIS, a novel neural network architecture for 3D semantic instance segmentation in commodity RGB-D scans. The core idea of our method is to jointly learn from both geometric and color signal, thus enabling accurate instance predictions. Rather than operate solely on 2D frames, we observe that most computer vision applications have multi-view RGB-D input available, which we leverage to construct an approach for 3D instance segmentation that effectively fuses together these multi-modal inputs. Our network leverages high-resolution RGB input by associating 2D images with the volumetric grid based on the pose alignment of the 3D reconstruction. For each image, we first extract 2D features for each pixel with a series of 2D convolutions; we then backproject the resulting feature vector to the associated voxel in the 3D grid. This combination of 2D and 3D feature learning allows significantly higher accuracy object detection and instance segmentation than state-of-the-art alternatives. We show results on both synthetic and real-world public benchmarks, achieving an improvement in mAP of over 13 on real-world data."
Multi-hypothesis contextual modeling for semantic segmentation,"Semantic segmentation (i.e. image parsing) aims to annotate each image pixel with its corresponding semantic class label. Spatially consistent labeling of the image requires an accurate description and modeling of the local contextual information. Segmentation result is typically improved by Markov Random Field (MRF) optimization on the initial labels. However this improvement is limited by the accuracy of initial result and how the contextual neighborhood is defined. In this paper, we develop generalized and flexible contextual models for segmentation neighborhoods in order to improve parsing accuracy. Instead of using a fixed segmentation and neighborhood definition, we explore various contextual models for fusion of complementary information available in alternative segmentations of the same image. In other words, we propose a novel MRF framework that describes and optimizes the contextual dependencies between multiple segmentations. Simulation results on two common datasets demonstrate significant improvement in parsing accuracy over the baseline approaches."
Learning Semantic Segmentation from Synthetic Data: A Geometrically Guided Input-Output Adaptation Approach,"Recently, increasing attention has been drawn to training semantic segmentation models using synthetic data and computer-generated annotation. However, domain gap remains a major barrier and prevents models learned from synthetic data from generalizing well to real-world applications. In this work, we take the advantage of additional geometric information from synthetic data, a powerful yet largely neglected cue, to bridge the domain gap. Such geometric information can be generated easily from synthetic data, and is proven to be closely coupled with semantic information. With the geometric information, we propose a model to reduce domain shift on two levels: on the input level, we augment the traditional image translation network with the additional geometric information to translate synthetic images into realistic styles; on the output level, we build a task network which simultaneously performs depth estimation and semantic segmentation on the synthetic data. Meanwhile, we encourage the network to preserve correlation between depth and semantics by adversarial training on the output space. We then validate our method on two pairs of synthetic to real dataset: Virtual KITTI to KITTI, and SYNTHIA to Cityscapes, where we achieve a significant performance gain compared to the non-adapt baseline and methods using only semantic label. This demonstrates the usefulness of geometric information from synthetic data for cross-domain semantic segmentation."
Tree-structured Kronecker Convolutional Network for Semantic Segmentation,"Most existing semantic segmentation methods employ atrous convolution to enlarge the receptive field of filters, but neglect partial information. To tackle this issue, we firstly propose a novel Kronecker convolution which adopts Kronecker product to expand the standard convolutional kernel for taking into account the partial feature neglected by atrous convolutions. Therefore, it can capture partial information and enlarge the receptive field of filters simultaneously without introducing extra parameters. Secondly, we propose Tree-structured Feature Aggregation (TFA) module which follows a recursive rule to expand and forms a hierarchical structure. Thus, it can naturally learn representations of multi-scale objects and encode hierarchical contextual information in complex scenes. Finally, we design Tree-structured Kronecker Convolutional Networks (TKCN) which employs Kronecker convolution and TFA module. Extensive experiments on three datasets, PASCAL VOC 2012, PASCAL-Context and Cityscapes, verify the effectiveness of our proposed approach. We make the code and the trained model publicly available at https://github.com/wutianyiRosun/TKCN."
C3: Concentrated-Comprehensive Convolution and its application to semantic segmentation,"One of the practical choices for making a lightweight semantic segmentation model is to combine a depth-wise separable convolution with a dilated convolution. However, the simple combination of these two methods results in an over-simplified operation which causes severe performance degradation due to loss of information contained in the feature map. To resolve this problem, we propose a new block called Concentrated-Comprehensive Convolution (C3) which applies the asymmetric convolutions before the depth-wise separable dilated convolution to compensate for the information loss due to dilated convolution. The C3 block consists of a concentration stage and a comprehensive convolution stage. The first stage uses two depth-wise asymmetric convolutions for compressed information from the neighboring pixels to alleviate the information loss. The second stage increases the receptive field by using a depth-wise separable dilated convolution from the feature map of the first stage. We applied the C3 block to various segmentation frameworks (ESPNet, DRN, ERFNet, ENet) for proving the beneficial properties of our proposed method. Experimental results show that the proposed method preserves the original accuracies on Cityscapes dataset while reducing the complexity. Furthermore, we modified ESPNet to achieve about 2% better performance while reducing the number of parameters by half and the number of FLOPs by 35% compared with the original ESPNet. Finally, experiments on ImageNet classification task show that C3 block can successfully replace dilated convolutions."
Multichannel Semantic Segmentation with Unsupervised Domain Adaptation,"Most contemporary robots have depth sensors, and research on semantic segmentation with RGBD images has shown that depth images boost the accuracy of segmentation. Since it is time-consuming to annotate images with semantic labels per pixel, it would be ideal if we could avoid this laborious work by utilizing an existing dataset or a synthetic dataset which we can generate on our own. Robot motions are often tested in a synthetic environment, where multichannel (eg, RGB + depth + instance boundary) images plus their pixel-level semantic labels are available. However, models trained simply on synthetic images tend to demonstrate poor performance on real images. In order to address this, we propose two approaches that can efficiently exploit multichannel inputs combined with an unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) algorithm. One is a fusion-based approach that uses depth images as inputs. The other is a multitask learning approach that uses depth images as outputs. We demonstrated that the segmentation results were improved by using a multitask learning approach with a post-process and created a benchmark for this task."
Multiview Cross-supervision for Semantic Segmentation,"This paper presents a semi-supervised learning framework for a customized semantic segmentation task using multiview image streams. A key challenge of the customized task lies in the limited accessibility of the labeled data due to the requirement of prohibitive manual annotation effort. We hypothesize that it is possible to leverage multiview image streams that are linked through the underlying 3D geometry, which can provide an additional supervisionary signal to train a segmentation model. We formulate a new cross-supervision method using a shape belief transfer---the segmentation belief in one image is used to predict that of the other image through epipolar geometry analogous to shape-from-silhouette. The shape belief transfer provides the upper and lower bounds of the segmentation for the unlabeled data where its gap approaches asymptotically to zero as the number of the labeled views increases. We integrate this theory to design a novel network that is agnostic to camera calibration, network model, and semantic category and bypasses the intermediate process of suboptimal 3D reconstruction. We validate this network by recognizing a customized semantic category per pixel from realworld visual data including non-human species and a subject of interest in social videos where attaining large-scale annotation data is infeasible."
Improving Semantic Segmentation via Video Propagation and Label Relaxation,"Semantic segmentation requires large amounts of pixel-wise annotations to learn accurate models. In this paper, we present a video prediction-based methodology to scale up training sets by synthesizing new training samples in order to improve the accuracy of semantic segmentation networks. We exploit video prediction models' ability to predict future frames in order to also predict future labels. A joint propagation strategy is also proposed to alleviate mis-alignments in synthesized samples. We demonstrate that training segmentation models on datasets augmented by the synthesized samples leads to significant improvements in accuracy. Furthermore, we introduce a novel boundary label relaxation technique that makes training robust to annotation noise and propagation artifacts along object boundaries. Our proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art mIoUs of 83.5% on Cityscapes and 82.9% on CamVid. Our single model, without model ensembles, achieves 72.8% mIoU on the KITTI semantic segmentation test set, which surpasses the winning entry of the ROB challenge 2018. Our code and videos can be found at https://nv-adlr.github.io/publication/2018-Segmentation."
ADVENT: Adversarial Entropy Minimization for Domain Adaptation in Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation is a key problem for many computer vision tasks. While approaches based on convolutional neural networks constantly break new records on different benchmarks, generalizing well to diverse testing environments remains a major challenge. In numerous real world applications, there is indeed a large gap between data distributions in train and test domains, which results in severe performance loss at run-time. In this work, we address the task of unsupervised domain adaptation in semantic segmentation with losses based on the entropy of the pixel-wise predictions. To this end, we propose two novel, complementary methods using (i) entropy loss and (ii) adversarial loss respectively. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in semantic segmentation on two challenging ""synthetic-2-real"" set-ups and show that the approach can also be used for detection."
Evaluating Bayesian Deep Learning Methods for Semantic Segmentation,"Deep learning has been revolutionary for computer vision and semantic segmentation in particular, with Bayesian Deep Learning (BDL) used to obtain uncertainty maps from deep models when predicting semantic classes. This information is critical when using semantic segmentation for autonomous driving for example. Standard semantic segmentation systems have well-established evaluation metrics. However, with BDL's rising popularity in computer vision we require new metrics to evaluate whether a BDL method produces better uncertainty estimates than another method. In this work we propose three such metrics to evaluate BDL models designed specifically for the task of semantic segmentation. We modify DeepLab-v3+, one of the state-of-the-art deep neural networks, and create its Bayesian counterpart using MC dropout and Concrete dropout as inference techniques. We then compare and test these two inference techniques on the well-known Cityscapes dataset using our suggested metrics. Our results provide new benchmarks for researchers to compare and evaluate their improved uncertainty quantification in pursuit of safer semantic segmentation."
EV-SegNet: Semantic Segmentation for Event-based Cameras,"Event cameras, or Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS), are very promising sensors which have shown several advantages over frame based cameras. However, most recent work on real applications of these cameras is focused on 3D reconstruction and 6-DOF camera tracking. Deep learning based approaches, which are leading the state-of-the-art in visual recognition tasks, could potentially take advantage of the benefits of DVS, but some adaptations are needed still needed in order to effectively work on these cameras. This work introduces a first baseline for semantic segmentation with this kind of data. We build a semantic segmentation CNN based on state-of-the-art techniques which takes event information as the only input. Besides, we propose a novel representation for DVS data that outperforms previously used event representations for related tasks. Since there is no existing labeled dataset for this task, we propose how to automatically generate approximated semantic segmentation labels for some sequences of the DDD17 dataset, which we publish together with the model, and demonstrate they are valid to train a model for DVS data only. We compare our results on semantic segmentation from DVS data with results using corresponding grayscale images, demonstrating how they are complementary and worth combining."
Efficient Semantic Segmentation for Visual Bird's-eye View Interpretation,"The ability to perform semantic segmentation in real-time capable applications with limited hardware is of great importance. One such application is the interpretation of the visual bird's-eye view, which requires the semantic segmentation of the four omnidirectional camera images. In this paper, we present an efficient semantic segmentation that sets new standards in terms of runtime and hardware requirements. Our two main contributions are the decrease of the runtime by parallelizing the ArgMax layer and the reduction of hardware requirements by applying the channel pruning method to the ENet model."
CCNet: Criss-Cross Attention for Semantic Segmentation,"Contextual information is vital in visual understanding problems, such as semantic segmentation and object detection. We propose a Criss-Cross Network (CCNet) for obtaining full-image contextual information in a very effective and efficient way. Concretely, for each pixel, a novel criss-cross attention module harvests the contextual information of all the pixels on its criss-cross path. By taking a further recurrent operation, each pixel can finally capture the full-image dependencies. Besides, a category consistent loss is proposed to enforce the criss-cross attention module to produce more discriminative features. Overall, CCNet is with the following merits: 1) GPU memory friendly. Compared with the non-local block, the proposed recurrent criss-cross attention module requires 11x less GPU memory usage. 2) High computational efficiency. The recurrent criss-cross attention significantly reduces FLOPs by about 85% of the non-local block. 3) The state-of-the-art performance. We conduct extensive experiments on semantic segmentation benchmarks including Cityscapes, ADE20K, human parsing benchmark LIP, instance segmentation benchmark COCO, video segmentation benchmark CamVid. In particular, our CCNet achieves the mIoU scores of 81.9%, 45.76% and 55.47% on the Cityscapes test set, the ADE20K validation set and the LIP validation set respectively, which are the new state-of-the-art results. The source codes are available at \url{https://github.com/speedinghzl/CCNet}."
ShelfNet for Fast Semantic Segmentation,"In this paper, we present ShelfNet, a novel architecture for accurate fast semantic segmentation. Different from the single encoder-decoder structure, ShelfNet has multiple encoder-decoder branch pairs with skip connections at each spatial level, which looks like a shelf with multiple columns. The shelf-shaped structure can be viewed as an ensemble of multiple deep and shallow paths, thus improving accuracy. We significantly reduce computation burden by reducing channel number, at the same time achieving high accuracy with this unique structure. In addition, we propose a shared-weight strategy in the residual block which reduces parameter number without sacrificing performance. Compared with popular non real-time methods such as PSPNet, our ShelfNet achieves 4\times faster inference speed with similar accuracy on PASCAL VOC dataset. Compared with real-time segmentation models such as BiSeNet, our model achieves higher accuracy at comparable speed on the Cityscapes Dataset, enabling the application in speed-demanding tasks such as street-scene understanding for autonomous driving. Furthermore, our ShelfNet achieves 79.0\% mIoU on Cityscapes Dataset with ResNet34 backbone, outperforming PSPNet and BiSeNet with large backbones such as ResNet101. Through extensive experiments, we validated the superior performance of ShelfNet. We provide link to the implementation \url{https://github.com/juntang-zhuang/ShelfNet-lw-cityscapes}."
CIAN: Cross-Image Affinity Net for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Weakly supervised semantic segmentation with only image-level labels saves large human effort to annotate pixel-level labels. Cutting-edge approaches rely on various innovative constraints and heuristic rules to generate the masks for every single image. Although great progress has been achieved by these methods, they treat each image independently and do not take account of the relationships across different images. In this paper, however, we argue that the cross-image relationship is vital for weakly supervised segmentation. Because it connects related regions across images, where supplementary representations can be propagated to obtain more consistent and integral regions. To leverage this information, we propose an end-to-end cross-image affinity module, which exploits pixel-level cross-image relationships with only image-level labels. By means of this, our approach achieves 64.3% and 65.3% mIoU on Pascal VOC 2012 validation and test set respectively, which is a new state-of-the-art result by only using image-level labels for weakly supervised semantic segmentation, demonstrating the superiority of our approach."
Structured Binary Neural Networks for Accurate Image Classification and Semantic Segmentation,"In this paper, we propose to train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with both binarized weights and activations, leading to quantized models specifically} for mobile devices with limited power capacity and computation resources. Previous works on quantizing CNNs seek to approximate the floating-point information using a set of discrete values, which we call value approximation, but typically assume the same architecture as the full-precision networks. In this paper, however, we take a novel 'structure approximation' view for quantization---it is very likely that a different architecture may be better for best performance. In particular, we propose a `network decomposition' strategy, named \textbf{Group-Net}, in which we divide the network into groups. In this way, each full-precision group can be effectively reconstructed by aggregating a set of homogeneous binary branches.  In addition, we learn effective connections among groups to improve the representational capability. Moreover, the proposed Group-Net shows strong generalization to other tasks. For instance, we extend Group-Net for highly accurate semantic segmentation by embedding rich context into the binary structure.  Experiments on both classification and semantic segmentation tasks demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed methods over various popular architectures. In particular, we outperform the previous best binary neural networks in terms of accuracy and major computation savings."
Universal Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"In recent years, the need for semantic segmentation has arisen across several different applications and environments. However, the expense and redundancy of annotation often limits the quantity of labels available for training in any domain, while deployment is easier if a single model works well across domains. In this paper, we pose the novel problem of universal semi-supervised semantic segmentation and propose a solution framework, to meet the dual needs of lower annotation and deployment costs. In contrast to counterpoints such as fine tuning, joint training or unsupervised domain adaptation, universal semi-supervised segmentation ensures that across all domains: (i) a single model is deployed, (ii) unlabeled data is used, (iii) performance is improved, (iv) only a few labels are needed and (v) label spaces may differ. To address this, we minimize supervised as well as within and cross-domain unsupervised losses, introducing a novel feature alignment objective based on pixel-aware entropy regularization for the latter. We demonstrate quantitative advantages over other approaches on several combinations of segmentation datasets across different geographies (Germany, England, India) and environments (outdoors, indoors), as well as qualitative insights on the aligned representations."
Background Subtraction with Real-time Semantic Segmentation,"Accurate and fast foreground object extraction is very important for object tracking and recognition in video surveillance. Although many background subtraction (BGS) methods have been proposed in the recent past, it is still regarded as a tough problem due to the variety of challenging situations that occur in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we explore this problem from a new perspective and propose a novel background subtraction framework with real-time semantic segmentation (RTSS). Our proposed framework consists of two components, a traditional BGS segmenter \mathcal{B} and a real-time semantic segmenter \mathcal{S}. The BGS segmenter \mathcal{B} aims to construct background models and segments foreground objects. The real-time semantic segmenter \mathcal{S} is used to refine the foreground segmentation outputs as feedbacks for improving the model updating accuracy. \mathcal{B} and \mathcal{S} work in parallel on two threads. For each input frame I_t, the BGS segmenter \mathcal{B} computes a preliminary foreground/background (FG/BG) mask B_t. At the same time, the real-time semantic segmenter \mathcal{S} extracts the object-level semantics {S}_t. Then, some specific rules are applied on {B}_t and {S}_t to generate the final detection {D}_t. Finally, the refined FG/BG mask {D}_t is fed back to update the background model. Comprehensive experiments evaluated on the CDnet 2014 dataset demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance among all unsupervised background subtraction methods while operating at real-time, and even performs better than some deep learning based supervised algorithms. In addition, our proposed framework is very flexible and has the potential for generalization."
Sensor Adaptation for Improved Semantic Segmentation of Overhead Imagery,Semantic segmentation is a powerful method to facilitate visual scene understanding. Each pixel is assigned a label according to a pre-defined list of object classes and semantic entities. This becomes very useful as a means to summarize large scale overhead imagery. In this paper we present our work on semantic segmentation with applications to overhead imagery. We propose an algorithm that builds and extends upon the DeepLab framework to be able to refine and resolve small objects (relative to the image size) such as vehicles. We have also investigated sensor adaptation as a means to augment available training data to be able to reduce some of the shortcomings of neural networks when deployed in new environments and to new sensors. We report results on several datasets and compare performance with other state-of-the-art architectures.
CGNet: A Light-weight Context Guided Network for Semantic Segmentation,"The demand of applying semantic segmentation model on mobile devices has been increasing rapidly. Current state-of-the-art networks have enormous amount of parameters hence unsuitable for mobile devices, while other small memory footprint models follow the spirit of classification network and ignore the inherent characteristic of semantic segmentation. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel Context Guided Network (CGNet), which is a light-weight and efficient network for semantic segmentation. We first propose the Context Guided (CG) block, which learns the joint feature of both local feature and surrounding context, and further improves the joint feature with the global context. Based on the CG block, we develop CGNet which captures contextual information in all stages of the network and is specially tailored for increasing segmentation accuracy. CGNet is also elaborately designed to reduce the number of parameters and save memory footprint. Under an equivalent number of parameters, the proposed CGNet significantly outperforms existing segmentation networks. Extensive experiments on Cityscapes and CamVid datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Specifically, without any post-processing and multi-scale testing, the proposed CGNet achieves 64.8% mean IoU on Cityscapes with less than 0.5 M parameters. The source code for the complete system can be found at https://github.com/wutianyiRosun/CGNet."
Recurrent Iterative Gating Networks for Semantic Segmentation,"In this paper, we present an approach for Recurrent Iterative Gating called RIGNet. The core elements of RIGNet involve recurrent connections that control the flow of information in neural networks in a top-down manner, and different variants on the core structure are considered. The iterative nature of this mechanism allows for gating to spread in both spatial extent and feature space. This is revealed to be a powerful mechanism with broad compatibility with common existing networks. Analysis shows how gating interacts with different network characteristics, and we also show that more shallow networks with gating may be made to perform better than much deeper networks that do not include RIGNet modules."
OrthoSeg: A Deep Multimodal Convolutional Neural Network for Semantic Segmentation of Orthoimagery,"This paper addresses the task of semantic segmentation of orthoimagery using multimodal data e.g. optical RGB, infrared and digital surface model. We propose a deep convolutional neural network architecture termed OrthoSeg for semantic segmentation using multimodal, orthorectified and coregistered data. We also propose a training procedure for supervised training of OrthoSeg. The training procedure complements the inherent architectural characteristics of OrthoSeg for preventing complex co-adaptations of learned features, which may arise due to probable high dimensionality and spatial correlation in multimodal and/or multispectral coregistered data. OrthoSeg consists of parallel encoding networks for independent encoding of multimodal feature maps and a decoder designed for efficiently fusing independently encoded multimodal feature maps. A softmax layer at the end of the network uses the features generated by the decoder for pixel-wise classification. The decoder fuses feature maps from the parallel encoders locally as well as contextually at multiple scales to generate per-pixel feature maps for final pixel-wise classification resulting in segmented output. We experimentally show the merits of OrthoSeg by demonstrating state-of-the-art accuracy on the ISPRS Potsdam 2D Semantic Segmentation dataset. Adaptability is one of the key motivations behind OrthoSeg so that it serves as a useful architectural option for a wide range of problems involving the task of semantic segmentation of coregistered multimodal and/or multispectral imagery. Hence, OrthoSeg is designed to enable independent scaling of parallel encoder networks and decoder network to better match application requirements, such as the number of input channels, the effective field-of-view, and model capacity."
Semi-Supervised Semantic Image Segmentation with Self-correcting Networks,"Building a large image dataset with high-quality object masks for semantic segmentation is costly and time consuming. In this paper, we introduce a principled semi-supervised framework that only uses a small set of fully supervised images (having semantic segmentation labels and box labels) and a set of images with only object bounding box labels (we call it the weak set). Our framework trains the primary segmentation model with the aid of an ancillary model that generates initial segmentation labels for the weak set and a self-correction module that improves the generated labels during training using the increasingly accurate primary model. We introduce two variants of the self-correction module using either linear or convolutional functions. Experiments on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and Cityscape datasets show that our models trained with a small fully supervised set perform similar to, or better than, models trained with a large fully supervised set while requiring ~7x less annotation effort."
An End-to-end Approach to Semantic Segmentation with 3D CNN and Posterior-CRF in Medical Images,"Fully-connected Conditional Random Field (CRF) is often used as post-processing to refine voxel classification results by encouraging spatial coherence. In this paper, we propose a new end-to-end training method called Posterior-CRF. In contrast with previous approaches which use the original image intensity in the CRF, our approach applies 3D, fully connected CRF to the posterior probabilities from a CNN and optimizes both CNN and CRF together. The experiments on white matter hyperintensities segmentation demonstrate that our method outperforms CNN, post-processing CRF and different end-to-end training CRF approaches."
Adaptive Semantic Segmentation with a Strategic Curriculum of Proxy Labels,"Training deep networks for semantic segmentation requires annotation of large amounts of data, which can be time-consuming and expensive. Unfortunately, these trained networks still generalize poorly when tested in domains not consistent with the training data. In this paper, we show that by carefully presenting a mixture of labeled source domain and proxy-labeled target domain data to a network, we can achieve state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation results. With our design, the network progressively learns features specific to the target domain using annotation from only the source domain. We generate proxy labels for the target domain using the network's own predictions. Our architecture then allows selective mining of easy samples from this set of proxy labels, and hard samples from the annotated source domain. We conduct a series of experiments with the GTA5, Cityscapes and BDD100k datasets on synthetic-to-real domain adaptation and geographic domain adaptation, showing the advantages of our method over baselines and existing approaches."
Deep Semantic Instance Segmentation of Tree-like Structures Using Synthetic Data,"Tree-like structures, such as blood vessels, often express complexity at very fine scales, requiring high-resolution grids to adequately describe their shape. Such sparse morphology can alternately be represented by locations of centreline points, but learning from this type of data with deep learning is challenging due to it being unordered, and permutation invariant. In this work, we propose a deep neural network that directly consumes unordered points along the centreline of a branching structure, to identify the topology of the represented structure in a single-shot. Key to our approach is the use of a novel multi-task loss function, enabling instance segmentation of arbitrarily complex branching structures. We train the network solely using synthetically generated data, utilizing domain randomization to facilitate the transfer to real 2D and 3D data. Results show that our network can reliably extract meaningful information about branch locations, bifurcations and endpoints, and sets a new benchmark for semantic instance segmentation in branching structures."
Prediction Error Meta Classification in Semantic Segmentation: Detection via Aggregated Dispersion Measures of Softmax Probabilities,"We present a method that ""meta"" classifies whether seg-ments predicted by a semantic segmentation neural networkintersect with the ground truth. For this purpose, we employ measures of dispersion for predicted pixel-wise class probability distributions, like classification entropy, that yield heat maps of the input scene's size. We aggregate these dispersion measures segment-wise and derive metrics that are well-correlated with the segment-wise IoU of prediction and ground truth. This procedure yields an almost plug and play post-processing tool to rate the prediction quality of semantic segmentation networks on segment level. This is especially relevant for monitoring neural networks in online applications like automated driving or medical imaging where reliability is of utmost importance. In our tests, we use publicly available state-of-the-art networks trained on the Cityscapes dataset and the BraTS2017 dataset and analyze the predictive power of different metrics as well as different sets of metrics. To this end, we compute logistic LASSO regression fits for the task of classifying IoU=0 vs. IoU>0 per segment and obtain AUROC values of up to 91.55%. We complement these tests with linear regression fits to predict the segment-wise IoU and obtain prediction standard deviations of down to 0.130 as well as R^2 values of up to 84.15%. We show that these results clearly outperform standard approaches."
Pixel Level Data Augmentation for Semantic Image Segmentation using Generative Adversarial Networks,"Semantic segmentation is one of the basic topics in computer vision, it aims to assign semantic labels to every pixel of an image. Unbalanced semantic label distribution could have a negative influence on segmentation accuracy. In this paper, we investigate using data augmentation approach to balance the semantic label distribution in order to improve segmentation performance. We propose using generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate realistic images for improving the performance of semantic segmentation networks. Experimental results show that the proposed method can not only improve segmentation performance on those classes with low accuracy, but also obtain 1.3% to 2.1% increase in average segmentation accuracy. It shows that this augmentation method can boost accuracy and be easily applicable to any other segmentation models."
Contextual Hourglass Network for Semantic Segmentation of High Resolution Aerial Imagery,"Semantic segmentation for aerial imagery is a challenging and important problem in remotely sensed imagery analysis. In recent years, with the success of deep learning, various convolutional neural network (CNN) based models have been developed. However, due to the varying sizes of the objects and imbalanced class labels, it can be challenging to obtain accurate pixel-wise semantic segmentation results. To address those challenges, we develop a novel semantic segmentation method and call it Contextual Hourglass Network. In our method, in order to improve the robustness of the prediction, we design a new contextual hourglass module which incorporates attention mechanism on processed low-resolution featuremaps to exploit the contextual semantics. We further exploit the stacked encoder-decoder structure by connecting multiple contextual hourglass modules from end to end. This architecture can effectively extract rich multi-scale features and add more feedback loops for better learning contextual semantics through intermediate supervision. To demonstrate the efficacy of our semantic segmentation method, we test it on Potsdam and Vaihingen datasets. Through the comparisons to other baseline methods, our method yields the best results on overall performance."
Incremental Learning for Semantic Segmentation of Large-Scale Remote Sensing Data,"In spite of remarkable success of the convolutional neural networks on semantic segmentation, they suffer from catastrophic forgetting: a significant performance drop for the already learned classes when new classes are added on the data, having no annotations for the old classes. We propose an incremental learning methodology, enabling to learn segmenting new classes without hindering dense labeling abilities for the previous classes, although the entire previous data are not accessible. The key points of the proposed approach are adapting the network to learn new as well as old classes on the new training data, and allowing it to remember the previously learned information for the old classes. For adaptation, we keep a frozen copy of the previously trained network, which is used as a memory for the updated network in absence of annotations for the former classes. The updated network minimizes a loss function, which balances the discrepancy between outputs for the previous classes from the memory and updated networks, and the mis-classification rate between outputs for the new classes from the updated network and the new ground-truth. For remembering, we either regularly feed samples from the stored, little fraction of the previous data or use the memory network, depending on whether the new data are collected from completely different geographic areas or from the same city. Our experimental results prove that it is possible to add new classes to the network, while maintaining its performance for the previous classes, despite the whole previous training data are not available."
A Miniaturized Semantic Segmentation Method for Remote Sensing Image,"In order to save the memory, we propose a miniaturization method for neural network to reduce the parameter quantity existed in remote sensing (RS) image semantic segmentation model. The compact convolution optimization method is first used for standard U-Net to reduce the weights quantity. With the purpose of decreasing model performance loss caused by miniaturization and based on the characteristics of remote sensing image, fewer down-samplings and improved cascade atrous convolution are then used to improve the performance of the miniaturized U-Net. Compared with U-Net, our proposed Micro-Net not only achieves 29.26 times model compression, but also basically maintains the performance unchanged on the public dataset. We provide a Keras and Tensorflow hybrid programming implementation for our model: https://github.com/Isnot2bad/Micro-Net"
Fast Neural Architecture Search of Compact Semantic Segmentation Models via Auxiliary Cells,"Automated design of neural network architectures tailored for a specific task is an extremely promising, albeit inherently difficult, avenue to explore. While most results in this domain have been achieved on image classification and language modelling problems, here we concentrate on dense per-pixel tasks, in particular, semantic image segmentation using fully convolutional networks. In contrast to the aforementioned areas, the design choices of a fully convolutional network require several changes, ranging from the sort of operations that need to be used---e.g., dilated convolutions---to a solving of a more difficult optimisation problem. In this work, we are particularly interested in searching for high-performance compact segmentation architectures, able to run in real-time using limited resources. To achieve that, we intentionally over-parameterise the architecture during the training time via a set of auxiliary cells that provide an intermediate supervisory signal and can be omitted during the evaluation phase. The design of the auxiliary cell is emitted by a controller, a neural network with the fixed structure trained using reinforcement learning. More crucially, we demonstrate how to efficiently search for these architectures within limited time and computational budgets. In particular, we rely on a progressive strategy that terminates non-promising architectures from being further trained, and on Polyak averaging coupled with knowledge distillation to speed-up the convergence. Quantitatively, in 8 GPU-days our approach discovers a set of architectures performing on-par with state-of-the-art among compact models on the semantic segmentation, pose estimation and depth prediction tasks. Code will be made available here: https://github.com/drsleep/nas-segm-pytorch"
UAVid: A Semantic Segmentation Dataset for UAV Imagery,"Semantic segmentation has been one of the leading research interests in computer vision recently. It serves as a perception foundation for many fields, such as robotics and autonomous driving. The fast development of semantic segmentation attributes enormously to the large scale datasets, especially for the deep learning related methods. There already exist several semantic segmentation datasets for comparison among semantic segmentation methods in complex urban scenes, such as the Cityscapes and CamVid datasets, where the side views of the objects are captured with a camera mounted on the driving car. There also exist semantic labeling datasets for the airborne images and the satellite images, where the top views of the objects are captured. However, only a few datasets capture urban scenes from an oblique Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) perspective, where both of the top view and the side view of the objects can be observed, providing more information for object recognition. In this paper, we introduce our UAVid dataset, a new high-resolution UAV semantic segmentation dataset as a complement, which brings new challenges, including large scale variation, moving object recognition and temporal consistency preservation. Our UAV dataset consists of 30 video sequences capturing 4K high-resolution images in slanted views. In total, 300 images have been densely labeled with 8 classes for the semantic labeling task. We have provided several deep learning baseline methods with pre-training, among which the proposed Multi-Scale-Dilation net performs the best via multi-scale feature extraction. Our UAVid website and the labeling tool have been published https://uavid.nl/."
Automated Evaluation of Semantic Segmentation Robustness for Autonomous Driving,"One of the fundamental challenges in the design of perception systems for autonomous vehicles is validating the performance of each algorithm under a comprehensive variety of operating conditions. In the case of vision-based semantic segmentation, there are known issues when encountering new scenarios that are sufficiently different to the training data. In addition, even small variations in environmental conditions such as illumination and precipitation can affect the classification performance of the segmentation model. Given the reliance on visual information, these effects often translate into poor semantic pixel classification which can potentially lead to catastrophic consequences when driving autonomously. This paper presents a novel method for analysing the robustness of semantic segmentation models and provides a number of metrics to evaluate the classification performance over a variety of environmental conditions. The process incorporates an additional sensor (lidar) to automate the process, eliminating the need for labour-intensive hand labelling of validation data. The system integrity can be monitored as the performance of the vision sensors are validated against a different sensor modality. This is necessary for detecting failures that are inherent to vision technology. Experimental results are presented based on multiple datasets collected at different times of the year with different environmental conditions. These results show that the semantic segmentation performance varies depending on the weather, camera parameters, existence of shadows, etc.. The results also demonstrate how the metrics can be used to compare and validate the performance after making improvements to a model, and compare the performance of different networks."
CEREALS - Cost-Effective REgion-based Active Learning for Semantic Segmentation,"State of the art methods for semantic image segmentation are trained in a supervised fashion using a large corpus of fully labeled training images. However, gathering such a corpus is expensive, due to human annotation effort, in contrast to gathering unlabeled data. We propose an active learning-based strategy, called CEREALS, in which a human only has to hand-label a few, automatically selected, regions within an unlabeled image corpus. This minimizes human annotation effort while maximizing the performance of a semantic image segmentation method. The automatic selection procedure is achieved by: a) using a suitable information measure combined with an estimate about human annotation effort, which is inferred from a learned cost model, and b) exploiting the spatial coherency of an image. The performance of CEREALS is demonstrated on Cityscapes, where we are able to reduce the annotation effort to 17%, while keeping 95% of the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of a model that was trained with the fully annotated training set of Cityscapes."
SG-One: Similarity Guidance Network for One-Shot Semantic Segmentation,"One-shot image semantic segmentation poses a challenging task of recognizing the object regions from unseen categories with only one annotated example as supervision. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective Similarity Guidance network to tackle the One-shot (SG-One) segmentation problem. We aim at predicting the segmentation mask of a query image with the reference to one densely labeled support image of the same category. To obtain the robust representative feature of the support image, we firstly adopt a masked average pooling strategy for producing the guidance features by only taking the pixels belonging to the support image into account. We then leverage the cosine similarity to build the relationship between the guidance features and features of pixels from the query image. In this way, the possibilities embedded in the produced similarity maps can be adapted to guide the process of segmenting objects. Furthermore, our SG-One is a unified framework which can efficiently process both support and query images within one network and be learned in an end-to-end manner. We conduct extensive experiments on Pascal VOC 2012. In particular, our SGOne achieves the mIoU score of 46.3%, surpassing the baseline methods."
Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation via Class-Balanced Self-Training,"Recent deep networks achieved state of the art performance on a variety of semantic segmentation tasks. Despite such progress, these models often face challenges in real world `wild tasks' where large difference between labeled training/source data and unseen test/target data exists. In particular, such difference is often referred to as `domain gap', and could cause significantly decreased performance which cannot be easily remedied by further increasing the representation power. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) seeks to overcome such problem without target domain labels. In this paper, we propose a novel UDA framework based on an iterative self-training procedure, where the problem is formulated as latent variable loss minimization, and can be solved by alternatively generating pseudo labels on target data and re-training the model with these labels. On top of self-training, we also propose a novel class-balanced self-training framework to avoid the gradual dominance of large classes on pseudo-label generation, and introduce spatial priors to refine generated labels. Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed methods achieve state of the art semantic segmentation performance under multiple major UDA settings."
Generating Self-Guided Dense Annotations for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Learning semantic segmentation models under image-level supervision is far more challenging than under fully supervised setting. Without knowing the exact pixel-label correspondence, most weakly-supervised methods rely on external models to infer pseudo pixel-level labels for training semantic segmentation models. In this paper, we aim to develop a single neural network without resorting to any external models. We propose a novel self-guided strategy to fully utilize features learned across multiple levels to progressively generate the dense pseudo labels. First, we use high-level features as class-specific localization maps to roughly locate the classes. Next, we propose an affinity-guided method to encourage each localization map to be consistent with their intermediate level features. Third, we adopt the training image itself as guidance and propose a self-guided refinement to further transfer the image's inherent structure into the maps. Finally, we derive pseudo pixel-level labels from these localization maps and use the pseudo labels as ground truth to train the semantic segmentation model. Our proposed self-guided strategy is a unified framework, which is built on a single network and alternatively updates the feature representation and refines localization maps during the training procedure. Experimental results on PASCAL VOC 2012 segmentation benchmark demonstrate that our method outperforms other weakly-supervised methods under the same setting."
Semantic Aware Attention Based Deep Object Co-segmentation,"Object co-segmentation is the task of segmenting the same objects from multiple images. In this paper, we propose the Attention Based Object Co-Segmentation for object co-segmentation that utilize a novel attention mechanism in the bottleneck layer of deep neural network for the selection of semantically related features. Furthermore, we take the benefit of attention learner and propose an algorithm to segment multi-input images in linear time complexity. Experiment results demonstrate that our model achieves state of the art performance on multiple datasets, with a significant reduction of computational time."
Characterizing Adversarial Examples Based on Spatial Consistency Information for Semantic Segmentation,"Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been widely applied in various recognition tasks. However, recently DNNs have been shown to be vulnerable against adversarial examples, which can mislead DNNs to make arbitrary incorrect predictions. While adversarial examples are well studied in classification tasks, other learning problems may have different properties. For instance, semantic segmentation requires additional components such as dilated convolutions and multiscale processing. In this paper, we aim to characterize adversarial examples based on spatial context information in semantic segmentation. We observe that spatial consistency information can be potentially leveraged to detect adversarial examples robustly even when a strong adaptive attacker has access to the model and detection strategies. We also show that adversarial examples based on attacks considered within the paper barely transfer among models, even though transferability is common in classification. Our observations shed new light on developing adversarial attacks and defenses to better understand the vulnerabilities of DNNs."
Inter-BMV: Interpolation with Block Motion Vectors for Fast Semantic Segmentation on Video,"Models optimized for accuracy on single images are often prohibitively slow to run on each frame in a video. Recent work exploits the use of optical flow to warp image features forward from select keyframes, as a means to conserve computation on video. This approach, however, achieves only limited speedup, even when optimized, due to the accuracy degradation introduced by repeated forward warping, and the inference cost of optical flow estimation. To address these problems, we propose a new scheme that propagates features using the block motion vectors (BMV) present in compressed video (e.g. H.264 codecs), instead of optical flow, and bi-directionally warps and fuses features from enclosing keyframes to capture scene context on each video frame. Our technique, interpolation-BMV, enables us to accurately estimate the features of intermediate frames, while keeping inference costs low. We evaluate our system on the CamVid and Cityscapes datasets, comparing to both a strong single-frame baseline and related work. We find that we are able to substantially accelerate segmentation on video, achieving near real-time frame rates (20+ frames per second) on large images (e.g. 960 x 720 pixels), while maintaining competitive accuracy. This represents an improvement of almost 6x over the single-frame baseline and 2.5x over the fastest prior work."
Conditional Generative Refinement Adversarial Networks for Unbalanced Medical Image Semantic Segmentation,"We propose a new generative adversarial architecture to mitigate imbalance data problem in medical image semantic segmentation where the majority of pixels belongs to a healthy region and few belong to lesion or non-health region. A model trained with imbalanced data tends to bias toward healthy data which is not desired in clinical applications and predicted outputs by these networks have high precision and low sensitivity. We propose a new conditional generative refinement network with three components: a generative, a discriminative, and a refinement network to mitigate unbalanced data problem through ensemble learning. The generative network learns to a segment at the pixel level by getting feedback from the discriminative network according to the true positive and true negative maps. On the other hand, the refinement network learns to predict the false positive and the false negative masks produced by the generative network that has significant value, especially in medical application. The final semantic segmentation masks are then composed by the output of the three networks. The proposed architecture shows state-of-the-art results on LiTS-2017 for liver lesion segmentation, and two microscopic cell segmentation datasets MDA231, PhC-HeLa. We have achieved competitive results on BraTS-2017 for brain tumour segmentation."
Robust 6D Object Pose Estimation in Cluttered Scenes using Semantic Segmentation and Pose Regression Networks,"Object pose estimation is a crucial prerequisite for robots to perform autonomous manipulation in clutter. Real-world bin-picking settings such as warehouses present additional challenges, e.g., new objects are added constantly. Most of the existing object pose estimation methods assume that 3D models of the objects is available beforehand. We present a pipeline that requires minimal human intervention and circumvents the reliance on the availability of 3D models by a fast data acquisition method and a synthetic data generation procedure. This work builds on previous work on semantic segmentation of cluttered bin-picking scenes to isolate individual objects in clutter. An additional network is trained on synthetic scenes to estimate object poses from a cropped object-centered encoding extracted from the segmentation results. The proposed method is evaluated on a synthetic validation dataset and cluttered real-world scenes."
Light-Weight RefineNet for Real-Time Semantic Segmentation,"We consider an important task of effective and efficient semantic image segmentation. In particular, we adapt a powerful semantic segmentation architecture, called RefineNet, into the more compact one, suitable even for tasks requiring real-time performance on high-resolution inputs. To this end, we identify computationally expensive blocks in the original setup, and propose two modifications aimed to decrease the number of parameters and floating point operations. By doing that, we achieve more than twofold model reduction, while keeping the performance levels almost intact. Our fastest model undergoes a significant speed-up boost from 20 FPS to 55 FPS on a generic GPU card on 512x512 inputs with solid 81.1% mean iou performance on the test set of PASCAL VOC, while our slowest model with 32 FPS (from original 17 FPS) shows 82.7% mean iou on the same dataset. Alternatively, we showcase that our approach is easily mixable with light-weight classification networks: we attain 79.2% mean iou on PASCAL VOC using a model that contains only 3.3M parameters and performs only 9.3B floating point operations."
Dark Model Adaptation: Semantic Image Segmentation from Daytime to Nighttime,"This work addresses the problem of semantic image segmentation of nighttime scenes. Although considerable progress has been made in semantic image segmentation, it is mainly related to daytime scenarios. This paper proposes a novel method to progressive adapt the semantic models trained on daytime scenes, along with large-scale annotations therein, to nighttime scenes via the bridge of twilight time -- the time between dawn and sunrise, or between sunset and dusk. The goal of the method is to alleviate the cost of human annotation for nighttime images by transferring knowledge from standard daytime conditions. In addition to the method, a new dataset of road scenes is compiled; it consists of 35,000 images ranging from daytime to twilight time and to nighttime. Also, a subset of the nighttime images are densely annotated for method evaluation. Our experiments show that our method is effective for model adaptation from daytime scenes to nighttime scenes, without using extra human annotation."
Know What Your Neighbors Do: 3D Semantic Segmentation of Point Clouds,"In this paper, we present a deep learning architecture which addresses the problem of 3D semantic segmentation of unstructured point clouds. Compared to previous work, we introduce grouping techniques which define point neighborhoods in the initial world space and the learned feature space. Neighborhoods are important as they allow to compute local or global point features depending on the spatial extend of the neighborhood. Additionally, we incorporate dedicated loss functions to further structure the learned point feature space: the pairwise distance loss and the centroid loss. We show how to apply these mechanisms to the task of 3D semantic segmentation of point clouds and report state-of-the-art performance on indoor and outdoor datasets."
RGB-D Object Detection and Semantic Segmentation for Autonomous Manipulation in Clutter,"Autonomous robotic manipulation in clutter is challenging. A large variety of objects must be perceived in complex scenes, where they are partially occluded and embedded among many distractors, often in restricted spaces. To tackle these challenges, we developed a deep-learning approach that combines object detection and semantic segmentation. The manipulation scenes are captured with RGB-D cameras, for which we developed a depth fusion method. Employing pretrained features makes learning from small annotated robotic data sets possible. We evaluate our approach on two challenging data sets: one captured for the Amazon Picking Challenge 2016, where our team NimbRo came in second in the Stowing and third in the Picking task, and one captured in disaster-response scenarios. The experiments show that object detection and semantic segmentation complement each other and can be combined to yield reliable object perception."
Semantic Segmentation for Urban Planning Maps based on U-Net,"The automatic digitizing of paper maps is a significant and challenging task for both academia and industry. As an important procedure of map digitizing, the semantic segmentation section mainly relies on manual visual interpretation with low efficiency. In this study, we select urban planning maps as a representative sample and investigate the feasibility of utilizing U-shape fully convolutional based architecture to perform end-to-end map semantic segmentation. The experimental results obtained from the test area in Shibuya district, Tokyo, demonstrate that our proposed method could achieve a very high Jaccard similarity coefficient of 93.63% and an overall accuracy of 99.36%. For implementation on GPGPU and cuDNN, the required processing time for the whole Shibuya district can be less than three minutes. The results indicate the proposed method can serve as a viable tool for urban planning map semantic segmentation task with high accuracy and efficiency."
Diagnostics in Semantic Segmentation,"Over the past years, computer vision community has contributed to enormous progress in semantic image segmentation, a per-pixel classification task, crucial for dense scene understanding and rapidly becoming vital in lots of real-world applications, including driverless cars and medical imaging. Most recent models are now reaching previously unthinkable numbers (e.g., 89% mean iou on PASCAL VOC, 83% on CityScapes), and, while intersection-over-union and a range of other metrics provide the general picture of model performance, in this paper we aim to extend them into other meaningful and important for applications characteristics, answering such questions as 'how accurate the model segmentation is on small objects in the general scene?', or 'what are the sources of uncertainty that cause the model to make an erroneous prediction?'. Besides establishing a methodology that covers the performance of a single model from different perspectives, we also showcase several extensions that can be worth pursuing in order to further improve current results in semantic segmentation."
Cylindrical Transform: 3D Semantic Segmentation of Kidneys With Limited Annotated Images,"In this paper, we propose a novel technique for sampling sequential images using a cylindrical transform in a cylindrical coordinate system for kidney semantic segmentation in abdominal computed tomography (CT). The images generated from a cylindrical transform augment a limited annotated set of images in three dimensions. This approach enables us to train contemporary classification deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) instead of fully convolutional networks (FCNs) for semantic segmentation. Typical semantic segmentation models segment a sequential set of images (e.g. CT or video) by segmenting each image independently. However, the proposed method not only considers the spatial dependency in the x-y plane, but also the spatial sequential dependency along the z-axis. The results show that classification DCNNs, trained on cylindrical transformed images, can achieve a higher segmentation performance value than FCNs using a limited number of annotated images."
Recent progress in semantic image segmentation,"Semantic image segmentation, which becomes one of the key applications in image processing and computer vision domain, has been used in multiple domains such as medical area and intelligent transportation. Lots of benchmark datasets are released for researchers to verify their algorithms. Semantic segmentation has been studied for many years. Since the emergence of Deep Neural Network (DNN), segmentation has made a tremendous progress. In this paper, we divide semantic image segmentation methods into two categories: traditional and recent DNN method. Firstly, we briefly summarize the traditional method as well as datasets released for segmentation, then we comprehensively investigate recent methods based on DNN which are described in the eight aspects: fully convolutional network, upsample ways, FCN joint with CRF methods, dilated convolution approaches, progresses in backbone network, pyramid methods, Multi-level feature and multi-stage method, supervised, weakly-supervised and unsupervised methods. Finally, a conclusion in this area is drawn."
Multispecies fruit flower detection using a refined semantic segmentation network,"In fruit production, critical crop management decisions are guided by bloom intensity, i.e., the number of flowers present in an orchard. Despite its importance, bloom intensity is still typically estimated by means of human visual inspection. Existing automated computer vision systems for flower identification are based on hand-engineered techniques that work only under specific conditions and with limited performance. This work proposes an automated technique for flower identification that is robust to uncontrolled environments and applicable to different flower species. Our method relies on an end-to-end residual convolutional neural network (CNN) that represents the state-of-the-art in semantic segmentation. To enhance its sensitivity to flowers, we fine-tune this network using a single dataset of apple flower images. Since CNNs tend to produce coarse segmentations, we employ a refinement method to better distinguish between individual flower instances. Without any pre-processing or dataset-specific training, experimental results on images of apple, peach and pear flowers, acquired under different conditions demonstrate the robustness and broad applicability of our method."
"Incorporating Luminance, Depth and Color Information by a Fusion-based Network for Semantic Segmentation","Semantic segmentation has made encouraging progress due to the success of deep convolutional networks in recent years. Meanwhile, depth sensors become prevalent nowadays, so depth maps can be acquired more easily. However, there are few studies that focus on the RGB-D semantic segmentation task. Exploiting the depth information effectiveness to improve performance is a challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel solution named LDFNet, which incorporates Luminance, Depth and Color information by a fusion-based network. It includes a sub-network to process depth maps and employs luminance images to assist the depth information in processes. LDFNet outperforms the other state-of-art systems on the Cityscapes dataset, and its inference speed is faster than most of the existing networks. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed multi-modal fusion network and its potential for practical applications."
3D Move to See: Multi-perspective visual servoing for improving object views with semantic segmentation,"In this paper, we present a new approach to visual servoing for robotics, referred to as 3D Move to See (3DMTS), based on the principle of finding the next best view using a 3D camera array and a robotic manipulator to obtain multiple samples of the scene from different perspectives. The method uses semantic vision and an objective function applied to each perspective to sample a gradient representing the direction of the next best view. The method is demonstrated within simulation and on a real robotic platform containing a custom 3D camera array for the challenging scenario of robotic harvesting in a highly occluded and unstructured environment. It was shown on a real robotic platform that by moving the end effector using the gradient of an objective function leads to a locally optimal view of the object of interest, even amongst occlusions. The overall performance of the 3DMTS method obtained a mean increase in target size by 29.3% compared to a baseline method using a single RGB-D camera, which obtained 9.17%. The results demonstrate qualitatively and quantitatively that the 3DMTS method performed better in most scenarios, and yielded three times the target size compared to the baseline method. The increased target size in the final view will improve the detection of key features of the object of interest for further manipulation, such as grasping and harvesting."
Efficient Dense Modules of Asymmetric Convolution for Real-Time Semantic Segmentation,"Real-time semantic segmentation plays an important role in practical applications such as self-driving and robots. Most semantic segmentation research focuses on improving estimation accuracy with little consideration on efficiency. Several previous studies that emphasize high-speed inference often fail to produce high-accuracy segmentation results. In this paper, we propose a novel convolutional network named Efficient Dense modules with Asymmetric convolution (EDANet), which employs an asymmetric convolution structure and incorporates dilated convolution and dense connectivity to achieve high efficiency at low computational cost and model size. EDANet is 2.7 times faster than the existing fast segmentation network, ICNet, while it achieves a similar mIoU score without any additional context module, post-processing scheme, and pretrained model. We evaluate EDANet on Cityscapes and CamVid datasets, and compare it with the other state-of-art systems. Our network can run with the high-resolution inputs at the speed of 108 FPS on one GTX 1080Ti."
DASNet: Reducing Pixel-level Annotations for Instance and Semantic Segmentation,"Pixel-level annotation demands expensive human efforts and limits the performance of deep networks that usually benefits from more such training data. In this work we aim to achieve high quality instance and semantic segmentation results over a small set of pixel-level mask annotations and a large set of box annotations. The basic idea is exploring detection models to simplify the pixel-level supervised learning task and thus reduce the required amount of mask annotations. Our architecture, named DASNet, consists of three modules: detection, attention, and segmentation. The detection module detects all classes of objects, the attention module generates multi-scale class-specific features, and the segmentation module recovers the binary masks. Our method demonstrates substantially improved performance compared to existing semi-supervised approaches on PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset."
Real-Time Joint Semantic Segmentation and Depth Estimation Using Asymmetric Annotations,"Deployment of deep learning models in robotics as sensory information extractors can be a daunting task to handle, even using generic GPU cards. Here, we address three of its most prominent hurdles, namely, i) the adaptation of a single model to perform multiple tasks at once (in this work, we consider depth estimation and semantic segmentation crucial for acquiring geometric and semantic understanding of the scene), while ii) doing it in real-time, and iii) using asymmetric datasets with uneven numbers of annotations per each modality. To overcome the first two issues, we adapt a recently proposed real-time semantic segmentation network, making changes to further reduce the number of floating point operations. To approach the third issue, we embrace a simple solution based on hard knowledge distillation under the assumption of having access to a powerful `teacher' network. We showcase how our system can be easily extended to handle more tasks, and more datasets, all at once, performing depth estimation and segmentation both indoors and outdoors with a single model. Quantitatively, we achieve results equivalent to (or better than) current state-of-the-art approaches with one forward pass costing just 13ms and 6.5 GFLOPs on 640x480 inputs. This efficiency allows us to directly incorporate the raw predictions of our network into the SemanticFusion framework for dense 3D semantic reconstruction of the scene."
Adapting Semantic Segmentation Models for Changes in Illumination and Camera Perspective,"Semantic segmentation using deep neural networks has been widely explored to generate high-level contextual information for autonomous vehicles. To acquire a complete 180^\circ semantic understanding of the forward surroundings, we propose to stitch semantic images from multiple cameras with varying orientations. However, previously trained semantic segmentation models showed unacceptable performance after significant changes to the camera orientations and the lighting conditions. To avoid time-consuming hand labeling, we explore and evaluate the use of data augmentation techniques, specifically skew and gamma correction, from a practical real-world standpoint to extend the existing model and provide more robust performance. The presented experimental results have shown significant improvements with varying illumination and camera perspective changes."
Normalization in Training U-Net for 2D Biomedical Semantic Segmentation,"2D biomedical semantic segmentation is important for robotic vision in surgery. Segmentation methods based on Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) can out-perform conventional methods in terms of both accuracy and levels of automation. One common issue in training a DCNN for biomedical semantic segmentation is the internal covariate shift where the training of convolutional kernels is encumbered by the distribution change of input features, hence both the training speed and performance are decreased. Batch Normalization (BN) is the first proposed method for addressing internal covariate shift and is widely used. Instance Normalization (IN) and Layer Normalization (LN) have also been proposed. Group Normalization (GN) is proposed more recently and has not yet been applied to 2D biomedical semantic segmentation, however, no specific validations on GN were given. Most DCNNs for biomedical semantic segmentation adopt BN as the normalization method by default, without reviewing its performance. In this paper, four normalization methods - BN, IN, LN and GN are compared in details, specifically for 2D biomedical semantic segmentation. U-Net is adopted as the basic DCNN structure. Three datasets regarding the Right Ventricle (RV), aorta, and Left Ventricle (LV) are used for the validation. The results show that detailed subdivision of the feature map, i.e. GN with a large group number or IN, achieves higher accuracy. This accuracy improvement mainly comes from better model generalization. Codes are uploaded and maintained at Xiao-Yun Zhou's Github."
Unbiasing Semantic Segmentation For Robot Perception using Synthetic Data Feature Transfer,"Robot perception systems need to perform reliable image segmentation in real-time on noisy, raw perception data. State-of-the-art segmentation approaches use large CNN models and carefully constructed datasets; however, these models focus on accuracy at the cost of real-time inference. Furthermore, the standard semantic segmentation datasets are not large enough for training CNNs without augmentation and are not representative of noisy, uncurated robot perception data. We propose improving the performance of real-time segmentation frameworks on robot perception data by transferring features learned from synthetic segmentation data. We show that pretraining real-time segmentation architectures with synthetic segmentation data instead of ImageNet improves fine-tuning performance by reducing the bias learned in pretraining and closing the \textit{transfer gap} as a result. Our experiments show that our real-time robot perception models pretrained on synthetic data outperform those pretrained on ImageNet for every scale of fine-tuning data examined. Moreover, the degree to which synthetic pretraining outperforms ImageNet pretraining increases as the availability of robot data decreases, making our approach attractive for robotics domains where dataset collection is hard and/or expensive."
Panoptic Segmentation with a Joint Semantic and Instance Segmentation Network,"We present a single network method for panoptic segmentation. This method combines the predictions from a jointly trained semantic and instance segmentation network using heuristics. Joint training is the first step towards an end-to-end panoptic segmentation network and is faster and more memory efficient than training and predicting with two networks, as done in previous work. The architecture consists of a ResNet-50 feature extractor shared by the semantic segmentation and instance segmentation branch. For instance segmentation, a Mask R-CNN type of architecture is used, while the semantic segmentation branch is augmented with a Pyramid Pooling Module. Results for this method are submitted to the COCO and Mapillary Joint Recognition Challenge 2018. Our approach achieves a PQ score of 17.6 on the Mapillary Vistas validation set and 27.2 on the COCO test-dev set."
Penalizing Top Performers: Conservative Loss for Semantic Segmentation Adaptation,"Due to the expensive and time-consuming annotations (e.g., segmentation) for real-world images, recent works in computer vision resort to synthetic data. However, the performance on the real image often drops significantly because of the domain shift between the synthetic data and the real images. In this setting, domain adaptation brings an appealing option. The effective approaches of domain adaptation shape the representations that (1) are discriminative for the main task and (2) have good generalization capability for domain shift. To this end, we propose a novel loss function, i.e., Conservative Loss, which penalizes the extreme good and bad cases while encouraging the moderate examples. More specifically, it enables the network to learn features that are discriminative by gradient descent and are invariant to the change of domains via gradient ascend method. Extensive experiments on synthetic to real segmentation adaptation show our proposed method achieves state of the art results. Ablation studies give more insights into properties of the Conservative Loss. Exploratory experiments and discussion demonstrate that our Conservative Loss has good flexibility rather than restricting an exact form."
Semantic Segmentation of 3D LiDAR Data in Dynamic Scene Using Semi-supervised Learning,"This work studies the semantic segmentation of 3D LiDAR data in dynamic scenes for autonomous driving applications. A system of semantic segmentation using 3D LiDAR data, including range image segmentation, sample generation, inter-frame data association, track-level annotation and semi-supervised learning, is developed. To reduce the considerable requirement of fine annotations, a CNN-based classifier is trained by considering both supervised samples with manually labeled object classes and pairwise constraints, where a data sample is composed of a segment as the foreground and neighborhood points as the background. A special loss function is designed to account for both annotations and constraints, where the constraint data are encouraged to be assigned to the same semantic class. A dataset containing 1838 frames of LiDAR data, 39934 pairwise constraints and 57927 human annotations is developed. The performance of the method is examined extensively. Qualitative and quantitative experiments show that the combination of a few annotations and large amount of constraint data significantly enhances the effectiveness and scene adaptability, resulting in greater than 10% improvement"
VoxSegNet: Volumetric CNNs for Semantic Part Segmentation of 3D Shapes,"Voxel is an important format to represent geometric data, which has been widely used for 3D deep learning in shape analysis due to its generalization ability and regular data format. However, fine-grained tasks like part segmentation require detailed structural information, which increases voxel resolution and thus causes other issues such as the exhaustion of computational resources. In this paper, we propose a novel volumetric convolutional neural network, which could extract discriminative features encoding detailed information from voxelized 3D data under a limited resolution. To this purpose, a spatial dense extraction (SDE) module is designed to preserve the spatial resolution during the feature extraction procedure, alleviating the loss of detail caused by sub-sampling operations such as max-pooling. An attention feature aggregation (AFA) module is also introduced to adaptively select informative features from different abstraction scales, leading to segmentation with both semantic consistency and high accuracy of details. Experiment results on the large-scale dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in 3D shape part segmentation."
Discriminative out-of-distribution detection for semantic segmentation,"Most classification and segmentation datasets assume a closed-world scenario in which predictions are expressed as distribution over a predetermined set of visual classes. However, such assumption implies unavoidable and often unnoticeable failures in presence of out-of-distribution (OOD) input. These failures are bound to happen in most real-life applications since current visual ontologies are far from being comprehensive. We propose to address this issue by discriminative detection of OOD pixels in input data. Different from recent approaches, we avoid to bring any decisions by only observing the training dataset of the primary model trained to solve the desired computer vision task. Instead, we train a dedicated OOD model which discriminates the primary training set from a much larger ""background"" dataset which approximates the variety of the visual world. We perform our experiments on high resolution natural images in a dense prediction setup. We use several road driving datasets as our training distribution, while we approximate the background distribution with the ILSVRC dataset. We evaluate our approach on WildDash test, which is currently the only public test dataset that includes out-of-distribution images. The obtained results show that the proposed approach succeeds to identify out-of-distribution pixels while outperforming previous work by a wide margin."
Deep multi-task learning for a geographically-regularized semantic segmentation of aerial images,"When approaching the semantic segmentation of overhead imagery in the decimeter spatial resolution range, successful strategies usually combine powerful methods to learn the visual appearance of the semantic classes (e.g. convolutional neural networks) with strategies for spatial regularization (e.g. graphical models such as conditional random fields). In this paper, we propose a method to learn evidence in the form of semantic class likelihoods, semantic boundaries across classes and shallow-to-deep visual features, each one modeled by a multi-task convolutional neural network architecture. We combine this bottom-up information with top-down spatial regularization encoded by a conditional random field model optimizing the label space across a hierarchy of segments with constraints related to structural, spatial and data-dependent pairwise relationships between regions. Our results show that such strategy provide better regularization than a series of strong baselines reflecting state-of-the-art technologies. The proposed strategy offers a flexible and principled framework to include several sources of visual and structural information, while allowing for different degrees of spatial regularization accounting for priors about the expected output structures."
Coarse-to-Fine Annotation Enrichment for Semantic Segmentation Learning,"Rich high-quality annotated data is critical for semantic segmentation learning, yet acquiring dense and pixel-wise ground-truth is both labor- and time-consuming. Coarse annotations (e.g., scribbles, coarse polygons) offer an economical alternative, with which training phase could hardly generate satisfactory performance unfortunately. In order to generate high-quality annotated data with a low time cost for accurate segmentation, in this paper, we propose a novel annotation enrichment strategy, which expands existing coarse annotations of training data to a finer scale. Extensive experiments on the Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC 2012 benchmarks have shown that the neural networks trained with the enriched annotations from our framework yield a significant improvement over that trained with the original coarse labels. It is highly competitive to the performance obtained by using human annotated dense annotations. The proposed method also outperforms among other state-of-the-art weakly-supervised segmentation methods."
Concept Mask: Large-Scale Segmentation from Semantic Concepts,"Existing works on semantic segmentation typically consider a small number of labels, ranging from tens to a few hundreds. With a large number of labels, training and evaluation of such task become extremely challenging due to correlation between labels and lack of datasets with complete annotations. We formulate semantic segmentation as a problem of image segmentation given a semantic concept, and propose a novel system which can potentially handle an unlimited number of concepts, including objects, parts, stuff, and attributes. We achieve this using a weakly and semi-supervised framework leveraging multiple datasets with different levels of supervision. We first train a deep neural network on a 6M stock image dataset with only image-level labels to learn visual-semantic embedding on 18K concepts. Then, we refine and extend the embedding network to predict an attention map, using a curated dataset with bounding box annotations on 750 concepts. Finally, we train an attention-driven class agnostic segmentation network using an 80-category fully annotated dataset. We perform extensive experiments to validate that the proposed system performs competitively to the state of the art on fully supervised concepts, and is capable of producing accurate segmentations for weakly learned and unseen concepts."
Self-Supervised Model Adaptation for Multimodal Semantic Segmentation,"Learning to reliably perceive and understand the scene is an integral enabler for robots to operate in the real-world. This problem is inherently challenging due to the multitude of object types as well as appearance changes caused by varying illumination and weather conditions. Leveraging complementary modalities can enable learning of semantically richer representations that are resilient to such perturbations. Despite the tremendous progress in recent years, most multimodal convolutional neural network approaches directly concatenate feature maps from individual modality streams rendering the model incapable of focusing only on relevant complementary information for fusion. To address this limitation, we propose a mutimodal semantic segmentation framework that dynamically adapts the fusion of modality-specific features while being sensitive to the object category, spatial location and scene context in a self-supervised manner. Specifically, we propose an architecture consisting of two modality-specific encoder streams that fuse intermediate encoder representations into a single decoder using our proposed self-supervised model adaptation fusion mechanism which optimally combines complementary features. As intermediate representations are not aligned across modalities, we introduce an attention scheme for better correlation. In addition, we propose a computationally efficient unimodal segmentation architecture termed AdapNet++ that incorporates a new encoder with multiscale residual units and an efficient atrous spatial pyramid pooling that has a larger effective receptive field with more than 10x fewer parameters, complemented with a strong decoder with a multi-resolution supervision scheme that recovers high-resolution details. Comprehensive empirical evaluations on several benchmarks demonstrate that both our unimodal and multimodal architectures achieve state-of-the-art performance."
Towards Closing the Gap in Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation with DCNNs: Combining Local and Global Models,"Generating training sets for deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) is a bottleneck for modern real-world applications. This is a demanding task for applications where annotating training data is costly, such as in semantic segmentation. In the literature, there is still a gap between the performance achieved by a network trained on full and on weak annotations. In this paper, we establish a strategy to measure this gap and to identify the ingredients necessary to reduce it.  On scribbles, we establish new state-of-the-art results: we obtain a mIoU of 75.6% without, and 75.7% with CRF post-processing. We reduce the gap by 64.2% whereas the current state-of-the-art reduces it only by 57.5%. Thanks to a systematic study of the different ingredients involved in the weakly supervised scenario and an original experimental strategy, we unravel a counter-intuitive mechanism that is simple and amenable to generalisations to other weakly-supervised scenarios: averaging poor local predicted annotations with the baseline ones and reuse them for training a DCNN yields new state-of-the-art results."
BiSeNet: Bilateral Segmentation Network for Real-time Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation requires both rich spatial information and sizeable receptive field. However, modern approaches usually compromise spatial resolution to achieve real-time inference speed, which leads to poor performance. In this paper, we address this dilemma with a novel Bilateral Segmentation Network (BiSeNet). We first design a Spatial Path with a small stride to preserve the spatial information and generate high-resolution features. Meanwhile, a Context Path with a fast downsampling strategy is employed to obtain sufficient receptive field. On top of the two paths, we introduce a new Feature Fusion Module to combine features efficiently. The proposed architecture makes a right balance between the speed and segmentation performance on Cityscapes, CamVid, and COCO-Stuff datasets. Specifically, for a 2048x1024 input, we achieve 68.4% Mean IOU on the Cityscapes test dataset with speed of 105 FPS on one NVIDIA Titan XP card, which is significantly faster than the existing methods with comparable performance."
Sparse and Dense Data with CNNs: Depth Completion and Semantic Segmentation,"Convolutional neural networks are designed for dense data, but vision data is often sparse (stereo depth, point clouds, pen stroke, etc.). We present a method to handle sparse depth data with optional dense RGB, and accomplish depth completion and semantic segmentation changing only the last layer. Our proposal efficiently learns sparse features without the need of an additional validity mask. We show how to ensure network robustness to varying input sparsities. Our method even works with densities as low as 0.8% (8 layer lidar), and outperforms all published state-of-the-art on the Kitti depth completion benchmark."
A Network Structure to Explicitly Reduce Confusion Errors in Semantic Segmentation,"Confusing classes that are ubiquitous in real world often degrade performance for many vision related applications like object detection, classification, and segmentation. The confusion errors are not only caused by similar visual patterns but also amplified by various factors during the training of our designed models, such as reduced feature resolution in the encoding process or imbalanced data distributions. A large amount of deep learning based network structures has been proposed in recent years to deal with these individual factors and improve network performance. However, to our knowledge, no existing work in semantic image segmentation is designed to tackle confusion errors explicitly. In this paper, we present a novel and general network structure that reduces confusion errors in more direct manner and apply the network for semantic segmentation. There are two major contributions in our network structure: 1) We ensemble subnets with heterogeneous output spaces based on the discriminative confusing groups. The training for each subnet can distinguish confusing classes within the group without affecting unrelated classes outside the group. 2) We propose an improved cross-entropy loss function that maximizes the probability assigned to the correct class and penalizes the probabilities assigned to the confusing classes at the same time. Our network structure is a general structure and can be easily adapted to any other networks to further reduce confusion errors. Without any changes in the feature encoder and post-processing steps, our experiments demonstrate consistent and significant improvements on different baseline models on Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC datasets (e.g., 3.05% over ResNet-101 and 1.30% over ResNet-38)."
Joint Learning of Intrinsic Images and Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation of outdoor scenes is problematic when there are variations in imaging conditions. It is known that albedo (reflectance) is invariant to all kinds of illumination effects. Thus, using reflectance images for semantic segmentation task can be favorable. Additionally, not only segmentation may benefit from reflectance, but also segmentation may be useful for reflectance computation. Therefore, in this paper, the tasks of semantic segmentation and intrinsic image decomposition are considered as a combined process by exploring their mutual relationship in a joint fashion. To that end, we propose a supervised end-to-end CNN architecture to jointly learn intrinsic image decomposition and semantic segmentation. We analyze the gains of addressing those two problems jointly. Moreover, new cascade CNN architectures for intrinsic-for-segmentation and segmentation-for-intrinsic are proposed as single tasks. Furthermore, a dataset of 35K synthetic images of natural environments is created with corresponding albedo and shading (intrinsics), as well as semantic labels (segmentation) assigned to each object/scene. The experiments show that joint learning of intrinsic image decomposition and semantic segmentation is beneficial for both tasks for natural scenes. Dataset and models are available at: https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/cv/intrinseg"
Modular Sensor Fusion for Semantic Segmentation,"Sensor fusion is a fundamental process in robotic systems as it extends the perceptual range and increases robustness in real-world operations. Current multi-sensor deep learning based semantic segmentation approaches do not provide robustness to under-performing classes in one modality, or require a specific architecture with access to the full aligned multi-sensor training data. In this work, we analyze statistical fusion approaches for semantic segmentation that overcome these drawbacks while keeping a competitive performance. The studied approaches are modular by construction, allowing to have different training sets per modality and only a much smaller subset is needed to calibrate the statistical models. We evaluate a range of statistical fusion approaches and report their performance against state-of-the-art baselines on both real-world and simulated data. In our experiments, the approach improves performance in IoU over the best single modality segmentation results by up to 5%. We make all implementations and configurations publicly available."
Efficient Uncertainty Estimation for Semantic Segmentation in Videos,"Uncertainty estimation in deep learning becomes more important recently. A deep learning model can't be applied in real applications if we don't know whether the model is certain about the decision or not. Some literature proposes the Bayesian neural network which can estimate the uncertainty by Monte Carlo Dropout (MC dropout). However, MC dropout needs to forward the model N times which results in N times slower. For real-time applications such as a self-driving car system, which needs to obtain the prediction and the uncertainty as fast as possible, so that MC dropout becomes impractical. In this work, we propose the region-based temporal aggregation (RTA) method which leverages the temporal information in videos to simulate the sampling procedure. Our RTA method with Tiramisu backbone is 10x faster than the MC dropout with Tiramisu backbone (N=5). Furthermore, the uncertainty estimation obtained by our RTA method is comparable to MC dropout's uncertainty estimation on pixel-level and frame-level metrics."
Uncertainty and Interpretability in Convolutional Neural Networks for Semantic Segmentation of Colorectal Polyps,"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are propelling advances in a range of different computer vision tasks such as object detection and object segmentation. Their success has motivated research in applications of such models for medical image analysis. If CNN-based models are to be helpful in a medical context, they need to be precise, interpretable, and uncertainty in predictions must be well understood. In this paper, we develop and evaluate recent advances in uncertainty estimation and model interpretability in the context of semantic segmentation of polyps from colonoscopy images. We evaluate and enhance several architectures of Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) for semantic segmentation of colorectal polyps and provide a comparison between these models. Our highest performing model achieves a 76.06\% mean IOU accuracy on the EndoScene dataset, a considerable improvement over the previous state-of-the-art."
Multi-Resolution Networks for Semantic Segmentation in Whole Slide Images,"Digital pathology provides an excellent opportunity for applying fully convolutional networks (FCNs) to tasks, such as semantic segmentation of whole slide images (WSIs). However, standard FCNs face challenges with respect to multi-resolution, inherited from the pyramid arrangement of WSIs. As a result, networks specifically designed to learn and aggregate information at different levels are desired. In this paper, we propose two novel multi-resolution networks based on the popular `U-Net' architecture, which are evaluated on a benchmark dataset for binary semantic segmentation in WSIs. The proposed methods outperform the U-Net, demonstrating superior learning and generalization capabilities."
Convolutional Simplex Projection Network (CSPN) for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Weakly supervised semantic segmentation has been a subject of increased interest due to the scarcity of fully annotated images. We introduce a new approach for solving weakly supervised semantic segmentation with deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The method introduces a novel layer which applies simplex projection on the output of a neural network using area constraints of class objects. The proposed method is general and can be seamlessly integrated into any CNN architecture. Moreover, the projection layer allows strongly supervised models to be adapted to weakly supervised models effortlessly by substituting ground truth labels. Our experiments have shown that applying such an operation on the output of a CNN improves the accuracy of semantic segmentation in a weakly supervised setting with image-level labels."
Actor-Action Semantic Segmentation with Region Masks,"In this paper, we study the actor-action semantic segmentation problem, which requires joint labeling of both actor and action categories in video frames. One major challenge for this task is that when an actor performs an action, different body parts of the actor provide different types of cues for the action category and may receive inconsistent action labeling when they are labeled independently. To address this issue, we propose an end-to-end region-based actor-action segmentation approach which relies on region masks from an instance segmentation algorithm. Our main novelty is to avoid labeling pixels in a region mask independently - instead we assign a single action label to these pixels to achieve consistent action labeling. When a pixel belongs to multiple region masks, max pooling is applied to resolve labeling conflicts. Our approach uses a two-stream network as the front-end (which learns features capturing both appearance and motion information), and uses two region-based segmentation networks as the back-end (which takes the fused features from the two-stream network as the input and predicts actor-action labeling). Experiments on the A2D dataset demonstrate that both the region-based segmentation strategy and the fused features from the two-stream network contribute to the performance improvements. The proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art results by more than 8% in mean class accuracy, and more than 5% in mean class IOU, which validates its effectiveness."
Future Semantic Segmentation with Convolutional LSTM,"We consider the problem of predicting semantic segmentation of future frames in a video. Given several observed frames in a video, our goal is to predict the semantic segmentation map of future frames that are not yet observed. A reliable solution to this problem is useful in many applications that require real-time decision making, such as autonomous driving. We propose a novel model that uses convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) to encode the spatiotemporal information of observed frames for future prediction. We also extend our model to use bidirectional ConvLSTM to capture temporal information in both directions. Our proposed approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on the benchmark dataset."
Guided Upsampling Network for Real-Time Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation architectures are mainly built upon an encoder-decoder structure. These models perform subsequent downsampling operations in the encoder. Since operations on high-resolution activation maps are computationally expensive, usually the decoder produces output segmentation maps by upsampling with parameters-free operators like bilinear or nearest-neighbor. We propose a Neural Network named Guided Upsampling Network which consists of a multiresolution architecture that jointly exploits high-resolution and large context information. Then we introduce a new module named Guided Upsampling Module (GUM) that enriches upsampling operators by introducing a learnable transformation for semantic maps. It can be plugged into any existing encoder-decoder architecture with little modifications and low additional computation cost. We show with quantitative and qualitative experiments how our network benefits from the use of GUM module. A comprehensive set of experiments on the publicly available Cityscapes dataset demonstrates that Guided Upsampling Network can efficiently process high-resolution images in real-time while attaining state-of-the art performances."
Accel: A Corrective Fusion Network for Efficient Semantic Segmentation on Video,"We present Accel, a novel semantic video segmentation system that achieves high accuracy at low inference cost by combining the predictions of two network branches: (1) a reference branch that extracts high-detail features on a reference keyframe, and warps these features forward using frame-to-frame optical flow estimates, and (2) an update branch that computes features of adjustable quality on the current frame, performing a temporal update at each video frame. The modularity of the update branch, where feature subnetworks of varying layer depth can be inserted (e.g. ResNet-18 to ResNet-101), enables operation over a new, state-of-the-art accuracy-throughput trade-off spectrum. Over this curve, Accel models achieve both higher accuracy and faster inference times than the closest comparable single-frame segmentation networks. In general, Accel significantly outperforms previous work on efficient semantic video segmentation, correcting warping-related error that compounds on datasets with complex dynamics. Accel is end-to-end trainable and highly modular: the reference network, the optical flow network, and the update network can each be selected independently, depending on application requirements, and then jointly fine-tuned. The result is a robust, general system for fast, high-accuracy semantic segmentation on video."
PointSeg: Real-Time Semantic Segmentation Based on 3D LiDAR Point Cloud,"In this paper, we propose PointSeg, a real-time end-to-end semantic segmentation method for road-objects based on spherical images. We take the spherical image, which is transformed from the 3D LiDAR point clouds, as input of the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to predict the point-wise semantic map. To make PointSeg applicable on a mobile system, we build the model based on the light-weight network, SqueezeNet, with several improvements. It maintains a good balance between memory cost and prediction performance. Our model is trained on spherical images and label masks projected from the KITTI 3D object detection dataset. Experiments show that PointSeg can achieve competitive accuracy with 90fps on a single GPU 1080ti. which makes it quite compatible for autonomous driving applications."
Effective Use of Synthetic Data for Urban Scene Semantic Segmentation,"Training a deep network to perform semantic segmentation requires large amounts of labeled data. To alleviate the manual effort of annotating real images, researchers have investigated the use of synthetic data, which can be labeled automatically. Unfortunately, a network trained on synthetic data performs relatively poorly on real images. While this can be addressed by domain adaptation, existing methods all require having access to real images during training. In this paper, we introduce a drastically different way to handle synthetic images that does not require seeing any real images at training time. Our approach builds on the observation that foreground and background classes are not affected in the same manner by the domain shift, and thus should be treated differently. In particular, the former should be handled in a detection-based manner to better account for the fact that, while their texture in synthetic images is not photo-realistic, their shape looks natural. Our experiments evidence the effectiveness of our approach on Cityscapes and CamVid with models trained on synthetic data only."
A Dataset of Laryngeal Endoscopic Images with Comparative Study on Convolution Neural Network Based Semantic Segmentation,"Purpose Automated segmentation of anatomical structures in medical image analysis is a prerequisite for autonomous diagnosis as well as various computer and robot aided interventions. Recent methods based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) have outperformed former heuristic methods. However, those methods were primarily evaluated on rigid, real-world environments. In this study, existing segmentation methods were evaluated for their use on a new dataset of transoral endoscopic exploration. Methods Four machine learning based methods SegNet, UNet, ENet and ErfNet were trained with supervision on a novel 7-class dataset of the human larynx. The dataset contains 536 manually segmented images from two patients during laser incisions. The Intersection-over-Union (IoU) evaluation metric was used to measure the accuracy of each method. Data augmentation and network ensembling were employed to increase segmentation accuracy. Stochastic inference was used to show uncertainties of the individual models. Patient-to-patient transfer was investigated using patient-specific fine-tuning. Results In this study, a weighted average ensemble network of UNet and ErfNet was best suited for the segmentation of laryngeal soft tissue with a mean IoU of 84.7 %. The highest efficiency was achieved by ENet with a mean inference time of 9.22 ms per image. It is shown that 10 additional images from a new patient are sufficient for patient-specific fine-tuning. Conclusion CNN-based methods for semantic segmentation are applicable to endoscopic images of laryngeal soft tissue. The segmentation can be used for active constraints or to monitor morphological changes and autonomously detect pathologies. Further improvements could be achieved by using a larger dataset or training the models in a self-supervised manner on additional unlabeled data."
Deep Learning for Semantic Segmentation on Minimal Hardware,"Deep learning has revolutionised many fields, but it is still challenging to transfer its success to small mobile robots with minimal hardware. Specifically, some work has been done to this effect in the RoboCup humanoid football domain, but results that are performant and efficient and still generally applicable outside of this domain are lacking. We propose an approach conceptually different from those taken previously. It is based on semantic segmentation and does achieve these desired properties. In detail, it is being able to process full VGA images in real-time on a low-power mobile processor. It can further handle multiple image dimensions without retraining, it does not require specific domain knowledge for achieving a high frame rate and it is applicable on a minimal mobile hardware."
Quantity beats quality for semantic segmentation of corrosion in images,"Dataset creation is typically one of the first steps when applying Artificial Intelligence methods to a new task; and the real world performance of models hinges on the quality and quantity of data available. Producing an image dataset for semantic segmentation is resource intensive, particularly for specialist subjects where class segmentation is not able to be effectively farmed out. The benefit of producing a large, but poorly labelled, dataset versus a small, expertly segmented dataset for semantic segmentation is an open question. Here we show that a large, noisy dataset outperforms a small, expertly segmented dataset for training a Fully Convolutional Network model for semantic segmentation of corrosion in images. A large dataset of 250 images with segmentations labelled by undergraduates and a second dataset of just 10 images, with segmentations labelled by subject matter experts were produced. The mean Intersection over Union and micro F-score metrics were compared after training for 50,000 epochs. This work is illustrative for researchers setting out to develop deep learning models for detection and location of specialist features."
Deep Semantic Segmentation in an AUV for Online Posidonia Oceanica Meadows identification,"Recent studies have shown evidence of a significant decline of the Posidonia oceanica (P.O.) meadows on a global scale. The monitoring and mapping of these meadows are fundamental tools for measuring their status. We present an approach based on a deep neural network to automatically perform a high-precision semantic segmentation of P.O. meadows in sea-floor images, offering several improvements over the state of the art techniques. Our network demonstrates outstanding performance over diverse test sets, reaching a precision of 96.57% and an accuracy of 96.81%, surpassing the reliability of labelling the images manually. Also, the network is implemented in an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV), performing an online P.O. segmentation, which will be used to generate real-time semantic coverage maps."
Attention to Refine through Multi-Scales for Semantic Segmentation,"This paper proposes a novel attention model for semantic segmentation, which aggregates multi-scale and context features to refine prediction. Specifically, the skeleton convolutional neural network framework takes in multiple different scales inputs, by which means the CNN can get representations in different scales. The proposed attention model will handle the features from different scale streams respectively and integrate them. Then location attention branch of the model learns to softly weight the multi-scale features at each pixel location. Moreover, we add an recalibrating branch, parallel to where location attention comes out, to recalibrate the score map per class. We achieve quite competitive results on PASCAL VOC 2012 and ADE20K datasets, which surpass baseline and related works."
Semantic Instance Meets Salient Object: Study on Video Semantic Salient Instance Segmentation,"Focusing on only semantic instances that only salient in a scene gains more benefits for robot navigation and self-driving cars than looking at all objects in the whole scene. This paper pushes the envelope on salient regions in a video to decompose them into semantically meaningful components, namely, semantic salient instances. We provide the baseline for the new task of video semantic salient instance segmentation (VSSIS), that is, Semantic Instance - Salient Object (SISO) framework. The SISO framework is simple yet efficient, leveraging advantages of two different segmentation tasks, i.e. semantic instance segmentation and salient object segmentation to eventually fuse them for the final result. In SISO, we introduce a sequential fusion by looking at overlapping pixels between semantic instances and salient regions to have non-overlapping instances one by one. We also introduce a recurrent instance propagation to refine the shapes and semantic meanings of instances, and an identity tracking to maintain both the identity and the semantic meaning of instances over the entire video. Experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of our SISO baseline, which can handle occlusions in videos. In addition, to tackle the task of VSSIS, we augment the DAVIS-2017 benchmark dataset by assigning semantic ground-truth for salient instance labels, obtaining SEmantic Salient Instance Video (SESIV) dataset. Our SESIV dataset consists of 84 high-quality video sequences with pixel-wisely per-frame ground-truth labels."
Semantic Segmentation with Scarce Data,"Semantic segmentation is a challenging vision problem that usually necessitates the collection of large amounts of finely annotated data, which is often quite expensive to obtain. Coarsely annotated data provides an interesting alternative as it is usually substantially more cheap. In this work, we present a method to leverage coarsely annotated data along with fine supervision to produce better segmentation results than would be obtained when training using only the fine data. We validate our approach by simulating a scarce data setting with less than 200 low resolution images from the Cityscapes dataset and show that our method substantially outperforms solely training on the fine annotation data by an average of 15.52% mIoU and outperforms the coarse mask by an average of 5.28% mIoU."
PointSIFT: A SIFT-like Network Module for 3D Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation,"Recently, 3D understanding research sheds light on extracting features from point cloud directly, which requires effective shape pattern description of point clouds. Inspired by the outstanding 2D shape descriptor SIFT, we design a module called PointSIFT that encodes information of different orientations and is adaptive to scale of shape. Specifically, an orientation-encoding unit is designed to describe eight crucial orientations, and multi-scale representation is achieved by stacking several orientation-encoding units. PointSIFT module can be integrated into various PointNet-based architecture to improve the representation ability. Extensive experiments show our PointSIFT-based framework outperforms state-of-the-art method on standard benchmark datasets. The code and trained model will be published accompanied by this paper."
Sample Efficient Semantic Segmentation using Rotation Equivariant Convolutional Networks,"We propose a semantic segmentation model that exploits rotation and reflection symmetries. We demonstrate significant gains in sample efficiency due to increased weight sharing, as well as improvements in robustness to symmetry transformations. The group equivariant CNN framework is extended for segmentation by introducing a new equivariant (G->Z2)-convolution that transforms feature maps on a group to planar feature maps. Also, equivariant transposed convolution is formulated for up-sampling in an encoder-decoder network. To demonstrate improvements in sample efficiency we evaluate on multiple data regimes of a rotation-equivariant segmentation task: cancer metastases detection in histopathology images. We further show the effectiveness of exploiting more symmetries by varying the size of the group."
Dilated Temporal Fully-Convolutional Network for Semantic Segmentation of Motion Capture Data,"Semantic segmentation of motion capture sequences plays a key part in many data-driven motion synthesis frameworks. It is a preprocessing step in which long recordings of motion capture sequences are partitioned into smaller segments. Afterwards, additional methods like statistical modeling can be applied to each group of structurally-similar segments to learn an abstract motion manifold. The segmentation task however often remains a manual task, which increases the effort and cost of generating large-scale motion databases. We therefore propose an automatic framework for semantic segmentation of motion capture data using a dilated temporal fully-convolutional network. Our model outperforms a state-of-the-art model in action segmentation, as well as three networks for sequence modeling. We further show our model is robust against high noisy training labels."
Efficient Semantic Segmentation using Gradual Grouping,"Deep CNNs for semantic segmentation have high memory and run time requirements. Various approaches have been proposed to make CNNs efficient like grouped, shuffled, depth-wise separable convolutions. We study the effectiveness of these techniques on a real-time semantic segmentation architecture like ERFNet for improving run time by over 5X. We apply these techniques to CNN layers partially or fully and evaluate the testing accuracies on Cityscapes dataset. We obtain accuracy vs parameters/FLOPs trade offs, giving accuracy scores for models that can run under specified runtime budgets. We further propose a novel training procedure which starts out with a dense convolution but gradually evolves towards a grouped convolution. We show that our proposed training method and efficient architecture design can improve accuracies by over 8% with depth wise separable convolutions applied on the encoder of ERFNet and attaching a light weight decoder. This results in a model which has a 5X improvement in FLOPs while only suffering a 4% degradation in accuracy with respect to ERFNet."
DFNet: Semantic Segmentation on Panoramic Images with Dynamic Loss Weights and Residual Fusion Block,"For the self-driving and automatic parking, perception is the basic and critical technique, moreover, the detection of lane markings and parking slots is an important part of visual perception. In this paper, we use the semantic segmentation method to segment the area and classify the class of lane makings and parking slots on panoramic surround view (PSV) dataset. We propose the DFNet and make two main contributions, one is dynamic loss weights, and the other is residual fusion block (RFB). Dynamic loss weights are varying from classes, calculated according to the pixel number of each class in a batch. RFB is composed of two convolutional layers, one pooling layer, and a fusion layer to combine the feature maps by pixel multiplication. We evaluate our method on PSV dataset, and achieve an advanced result."
Semantic Video Segmentation: A Review on Recent Approaches,"This paper gives an overview on semantic segmentation consists of an explanation of this field, it's status and relation with other vision fundamental tasks, different datasets and common evaluation parameters that have been used by researchers. This survey also includes an overall review on a variety of recent approaches (RDF, MRF, CRF, etc.) and their advantages and challenges and shows the superiority of CNN-based semantic segmentation systems on CamVid and NYUDv2 datasets. In addition, some areas that is ideal for future work have mentioned."
Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation by Iteratively Mining Common Object Features,"Weakly-supervised semantic segmentation under image tags supervision is a challenging task as it directly associates high-level semantic to low-level appearance. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose an iterative bottom-up and top-down framework which alternatively expands object regions and optimizes segmentation network. We start from initial localization produced by classification networks. While classification networks are only responsive to small and coarse discriminative object regions, we argue that, these regions contain significant common features about objects. So in the bottom-up step, we mine common object features from the initial localization and expand object regions with the mined features. To supplement non-discriminative regions, saliency maps are then considered under Bayesian framework to refine the object regions. Then in the top-down step, the refined object regions are used as supervision to train the segmentation network and to predict object masks. These object masks provide more accurate localization and contain more regions of object. Further, we take these object masks as initial localization and mine common object features from them. These processes are conducted iteratively to progressively produce fine object masks and optimize segmentation networks. Experimental results on Pascal VOC 2012 dataset demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by a large margin."
Robust Semantic Segmentation with Ladder-DenseNet Models,"We present semantic segmentation experiments with a model capable to perform predictions on four benchmark datasets: Cityscapes, ScanNet, WildDash and KITTI. We employ a ladder-style convolutional architecture featuring a modified DenseNet-169 model in the downsampling datapath, and only one convolution in each stage of the upsampling datapath. Due to limited computing resources, we perform the training only on Cityscapes Fine train+val, ScanNet train, WildDash val and KITTI train. We evaluate the trained model on the test subsets of the four benchmarks in concordance with the guidelines of the Robust Vision Challenge ROB 2018. The performed experiments reveal several interesting findings which we describe and discuss."
DSSLIC: Deep Semantic Segmentation-based Layered Image Compression,"Deep learning has revolutionized many computer vision fields in the last few years, including learning-based image compression. In this paper, we propose a deep semantic segmentation-based layered image compression (DSSLIC) framework in which the semantic segmentation map of the input image is obtained and encoded as the base layer of the bit-stream. A compact representation of the input image is also generated and encoded as the first enhancement layer. The segmentation map and the compact version of the image are then employed to obtain a coarse reconstruction of the image. The residual between the input and the coarse reconstruction is additionally encoded as another enhancement layer. Experimental results show that the proposed framework outperforms the H.265/HEVC-based BPG and other codecs in both PSNR and MS-SSIM metrics across a wide range of bit rates in RGB domain. Besides, since semantic segmentation map is included in the bit-stream, the proposed scheme can facilitate many other tasks such as image search and object-based adaptive image compression."
Efficient semantic image segmentation with superpixel pooling,"In this work, we evaluate the use of superpixel pooling layers in deep network architectures for semantic segmentation. Superpixel pooling is a flexible and efficient replacement for other pooling strategies that incorporates spatial prior information. We propose a simple and efficient GPU-implementation of the layer and explore several designs for the integration of the layer into existing network architectures. We provide experimental results on the IBSR and Cityscapes dataset, demonstrating that superpixel pooling can be leveraged to consistently increase network accuracy with minimal computational overhead. Source code is available at https://github.com/bermanmaxim/superpixPool"
Adaptive feature recombination and recalibration for semantic segmentation: application to brain tumor segmentation in MRI,"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successfully used for brain tumor segmentation, specifically, fully convolutional networks (FCNs). FCNs can segment a set of voxels at once, having a direct spatial correspondence between units in feature maps (FMs) at a given location and the corresponding classified voxels. In convolutional layers, FMs are merged to create new FMs, so, channel combination is crucial. However, not all FMs have the same relevance for a given class. Recently, in classification problems, Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks have been proposed to re-calibrate FMs as a whole, and suppress the less informative ones. However, this is not optimal in FCN due to the spatial correspondence between units and voxels. In this article, we propose feature recombination through linear expansion and compression to create more complex features for semantic segmentation. Additionally, we propose a segmentation SE (SegSE) block for feature recalibration that collects contextual information, while maintaining the spatial meaning. Finally, we evaluate the proposed methods in brain tumor segmentation, using publicly available data."
Performance Evaluation of Deep Learning Networks for Semantic Segmentation of Traffic Stereo-Pair Images,"Semantic image segmentation is one the most demanding task, especially for analysis of traffic conditions for self-driving cars. Here the results of application of several deep learning architectures (PSPNet and ICNet) for semantic image segmentation of traffic stereo-pair images are presented. The images from Cityscapes dataset and custom urban images were analyzed as to the segmentation accuracy and image inference time. For the models pre-trained on Cityscapes dataset, the inference time was equal in the limits of standard deviation, but the segmentation accuracy was different for various cities and stereo channels even. The distributions of accuracy (mean intersection over union - mIoU) values for each city and channel are asymmetric, long-tailed, and have many extreme outliers, especially for PSPNet network in comparison to ICNet network. Some statistical properties of these distributions (skewness, kurtosis) allow us to distinguish these two networks and open the question about relations between architecture of deep learning networks and statistical distribution of the predicted results (mIoU here). The results obtained demonstrated the different sensitivity of these networks to: (1) the local street view peculiarities in different cities that should be taken into account during the targeted fine tuning the models before their practical applications, (2) the right and left data channels in stereo-pairs. For both networks, the difference in the predicted results (mIoU here) for the right and left data channels in stereo-pairs is out of the limits of statistical error in relation to mIoU values. It means that the traffic stereo pairs can be effectively used not only for depth calculations (as it is usually used), but also as an additional data channel that can provide much more information about scene objects than simple duplication of the same street view images."
RedNet: Residual Encoder-Decoder Network for indoor RGB-D Semantic Segmentation,"Indoor semantic segmentation has always been a difficult task in computer vision. In this paper, we propose an RGB-D residual encoder-decoder architecture, named RedNet, for indoor RGB-D semantic segmentation. In RedNet, the residual module is applied to both the encoder and decoder as the basic building block, and the skip-connection is used to bypass the spatial feature between the encoder and decoder. In order to incorporate the depth information of the scene, a fusion structure is constructed, which makes inference on RGB image and depth image separately, and fuses their features over several layers. In order to efficiently optimize the network's parameters, we propose a `pyramid supervision' training scheme, which applies supervised learning over different layers in the decoder, to cope with the problem of gradients vanishing. Experiment results show that the proposed RedNet(ResNet-50) achieves a state-of-the-art mIoU accuracy of 47.8% on the SUN RGB-D benchmark dataset."
Bayesian Semantic Instance Segmentation in Open Set World,"This paper addresses the semantic instance segmentation task in the open-set conditions, where input images can contain known and unknown object classes. The training process of existing semantic instance segmentation methods requires annotation masks for all object instances, which is expensive to acquire or even infeasible in some realistic scenarios, where the number of categories may increase boundlessly. In this paper, we present a novel open-set semantic instance segmentation approach capable of segmenting all known and unknown object classes in images, based on the output of an object detector trained on known object classes. We formulate the problem using a Bayesian framework, where the posterior distribution is approximated with a simulated annealing optimization equipped with an efficient image partition sampler. We show empirically that our method is competitive with state-of-the-art supervised methods on known classes, but also performs well on unknown classes when compared with unsupervised methods."
Semantic-Aware Generative Adversarial Nets for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation in Chest X-ray Segmentation,"In spite of the compelling achievements that deep neural networks (DNNs) have made in medical image computing, these deep models often suffer from degraded performance when being applied to new test datasets with domain shift. In this paper, we present a novel unsupervised domain adaptation approach for segmentation tasks by designing semantic-aware generative adversarial networks (GANs). Specifically, we transform the test image into the appearance of source domain, with the semantic structural information being well preserved, which is achieved by imposing a nested adversarial learning in semantic label space. In this way, the segmentation DNN learned from the source domain is able to be directly generalized to the transformed test image, eliminating the need of training a new model for every new target dataset. Our domain adaptation procedure is unsupervised, without using any target domain labels. The adversarial learning of our network is guided by a GAN loss for mapping data distributions, a cycle-consistency loss for retaining pixel-level content, and a semantic-aware loss for enhancing structural information. We validated our method on two different chest X-ray public datasets for left/right lung segmentation. Experimental results show that the segmentation performance of our unsupervised approach is highly competitive with the upper bound of supervised transfer learning."
Superpixel-enhanced Pairwise Conditional Random Field for Semantic Segmentation,"Superpixel-based Higher-order Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) are effective in enforcing long-range consistency in pixel-wise labeling problems, such as semantic segmentation. However, their major short coming is considerably longer time to learn higher-order potentials and extra hyperparameters and/or weights compared with pairwise models. This paper proposes a superpixel-enhanced pairwise CRF framework that consists of the conventional pairwise as well as our proposed superpixel-enhanced pairwise (SP-Pairwise) potentials. SP-Pairwise potentials incorporate the superpixel-based higher-order cues by conditioning on a segment filtered image and share the same set of parameters as the conventional pairwise potentials. Therefore, the proposed superpixel-enhanced pairwise CRF has a lower time complexity in parameter learning and at the same time it outperforms higher-order CRF in terms of inference accuracy. Moreover, the new scheme takes advantage of the pre-trained pairwise models by reusing their parameters and/or weights, which provides a significant accuracy boost on the basis of CRF-RNN even without training. Experiments on MSRC-21 and PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset confirm the effectiveness of our method."
Pyramid Attention Network for Semantic Segmentation,"A Pyramid Attention Network(PAN) is proposed to exploit the impact of global contextual information in semantic segmentation. Different from most existing works, we combine attention mechanism and spatial pyramid to extract precise dense features for pixel labeling instead of complicated dilated convolution and artificially designed decoder networks. Specifically, we introduce a Feature Pyramid Attention module to perform spatial pyramid attention structure on high-level output and combining global pooling to learn a better feature representation, and a Global Attention Upsample module on each decoder layer to provide global context as a guidance of low-level features to select category localization details. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on PASCAL VOC 2012 and Cityscapes benchmarks with a new record of mIoU accuracy 84.0% on PASCAL VOC 2012, while training without COCO dataset."
Autofocus Layer for Semantic Segmentation,"We propose the autofocus convolutional layer for semantic segmentation with the objective of enhancing the capabilities of neural networks for multi-scale processing. Autofocus layers adaptively change the size of the effective receptive field based on the processed context to generate more powerful features. This is achieved by parallelising multiple convolutional layers with different dilation rates, combined by an attention mechanism that learns to focus on the optimal scales driven by context. By sharing the weights of the parallel convolutions we make the network scale-invariant, with only a modest increase in the number of parameters. The proposed autofocus layer can be easily integrated into existing networks to improve a model's representational power. We evaluate our models on the challenging tasks of multi-organ segmentation in pelvic CT and brain tumor segmentation in MRI and achieve very promising performance."
Comparison of Semantic Segmentation Approaches for Horizon/Sky Line Detection,"Horizon or skyline detection plays a vital role towards mountainous visual geo-localization, however most of the recently proposed visual geo-localization approaches rely on \textbf{user-in-the-loop} skyline detection methods. Detecting such a segmenting boundary fully autonomously would definitely be a step forward for these localization approaches. This paper provides a quantitative comparison of four such methods for autonomous horizon/sky line detection on an extensive data set. Specifically, we provide the comparison between four recently proposed segmentation methods; one explicitly targeting the problem of horizon detection\cite{Ahmad15}, second focused on visual geo-localization but relying on accurate detection of skyline \cite{Saurer16} and other two proposed for general semantic segmentation -- Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN) \cite{Long15} and SegNet\cite{Badrinarayanan15}. Each of the first two methods is trained on a common training set \cite{Baatz12} comprised of about 200 images while models for the third and fourth method are fine tuned for sky segmentation problem through transfer learning using the same data set. Each of the method is tested on an extensive test set (about 3K images) covering various challenging geographical, weather, illumination and seasonal conditions. We report average accuracy and average absolute pixel error for each of the presented formulation."
DifNet: Semantic Segmentation by Diffusion Networks,"Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have recently shown state of the art performance on semantic segmentation tasks, however, they still suffer from problems of poor boundary localization and spatial fragmented predictions. The difficulties lie in the requirement of making dense predictions from a long path model all at once since details are hard to keep when data goes through deeper layers. Instead, in this work, we decompose this difficult task into two relative simple sub-tasks: seed detection which is required to predict initial predictions without the need of wholeness and preciseness, and similarity estimation which measures the possibility of any two nodes belong to the same class without the need of knowing which class they are. We use one branch network for one sub-task each, and apply a cascade of random walks base on hierarchical semantics to approximate a complex diffusion process which propagates seed information to the whole image according to the estimated similarities. The proposed DifNet consistently produces improvements over the baseline models with the same depth and with the equivalent number of parameters, and also achieves promising performance on Pascal VOC and Pascal Context dataset. OurDifNet is trained end-to-end without complex loss functions."
DeLS-3D: Deep Localization and Segmentation with a 3D Semantic Map,"For applications such as autonomous driving, self-localization/camera pose estimation and scene parsing are crucial technologies. In this paper, we propose a unified framework to tackle these two problems simultaneously. The uniqueness of our design is a sensor fusion scheme which integrates camera videos, motion sensors (GPS/IMU), and a 3D semantic map in order to achieve robustness and efficiency of the system. Specifically, we first have an initial coarse camera pose obtained from consumer-grade GPS/IMU, based on which a label map can be rendered from the 3D semantic map. Then, the rendered label map and the RGB image are jointly fed into a pose CNN, yielding a corrected camera pose. In addition, to incorporate temporal information, a multi-layer recurrent neural network (RNN) is further deployed improve the pose accuracy. Finally, based on the pose from RNN, we render a new label map, which is fed together with the RGB image into a segment CNN which produces per-pixel semantic label. In order to validate our approach, we build a dataset with registered 3D point clouds and video camera images. Both the point clouds and the images are semantically-labeled. Each video frame has ground truth pose from highly accurate motion sensors. We show that practically, pose estimation solely relying on images like PoseNet may fail due to street view confusion, and it is important to fuse multiple sensors. Finally, various ablation studies are performed, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system. In particular, we show that scene parsing and pose estimation are mutually beneficial to achieve a more robust and accurate system."
Convolutional CRFs for Semantic Segmentation,"For the challenging semantic image segmentation task the most efficient models have traditionally combined the structured modelling capabilities of Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) with the feature extraction power of CNNs. In more recent works however, CRF post-processing has fallen out of favour. We argue that this is mainly due to the slow training and inference speeds of CRFs, as well as the difficulty of learning the internal CRF parameters. To overcome both issues we propose to add the assumption of conditional independence to the framework of fully-connected CRFs. This allows us to reformulate the inference in terms of convolutions, which can be implemented highly efficiently on GPUs. Doing so speeds up inference and training by a factor of more then 100. All parameters of the convolutional CRFs can easily be optimized using backpropagation. To facilitating further CRF research we make our implementation publicly available. Please visit: https://github.com/MarvinTeichmann/ConvCRF"
Revisiting Dilated Convolution: A Simple Approach for Weakly- and Semi- Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Despite the remarkable progress, weakly supervised segmentation approaches are still inferior to their fully supervised counterparts. We obverse the performance gap mainly comes from their limitation on learning to produce high-quality dense object localization maps from image-level supervision. To mitigate such a gap, we revisit the dilated convolution [1] and reveal how it can be utilized in a novel way to effectively overcome this critical limitation of weakly supervised segmentation approaches. Specifically, we find that varying dilation rates can effectively enlarge the receptive fields of convolutional kernels and more importantly transfer the surrounding discriminative information to non-discriminative object regions, promoting the emergence of these regions in the object localization maps. Then, we design a generic classification network equipped with convolutional blocks of different dilated rates. It can produce dense and reliable object localization maps and effectively benefit both weakly- and semi- supervised semantic segmentation. Despite the apparent simplicity, our proposed approach obtains superior performance over state-of-the-arts. In particular, it achieves 60.8% and 67.6% mIoU scores on Pascal VOC 2012 test set in weakly- (only image-level labels are available) and semi- (1,464 segmentation masks are available) supervised settings, which are the new state-of-the-arts."
ContextNet: Exploring Context and Detail for Semantic Segmentation in Real-time,"Modern deep learning architectures produce highly accurate results on many challenging semantic segmentation datasets. State-of-the-art methods are, however, not directly transferable to real-time applications or embedded devices, since naive adaptation of such systems to reduce computational cost (speed, memory and energy) causes a significant drop in accuracy. We propose ContextNet, a new deep neural network architecture which builds on factorized convolution, network compression and pyramid representation to produce competitive semantic segmentation in real-time with low memory requirement. ContextNet combines a deep network branch at low resolution that captures global context information efficiently with a shallow branch that focuses on high-resolution segmentation details. We analyse our network in a thorough ablation study and present results on the Cityscapes dataset, achieving 66.1% accuracy at 18.3 frames per second at full (1024x2048) resolution (41.9 fps with pipelined computations for streamed data)."
Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation with Representation Learning for Semantic Segmentation across Time,"Deep learning generates state-of-the-art semantic segmentation provided that a large number of images together with pixel-wise annotations are available. To alleviate the expensive data collection process, we propose a semi-supervised domain adaptation method for the specific case of images with similar semantic content but different pixel distributions. A network trained with supervision on a past dataset is finetuned on the new dataset to conserve its features maps. The domain adaptation becomes a simple regression between feature maps and does not require annotations on the new dataset. This method reaches performances similar to classic transfer learning on the PASCAL VOC dataset with synthetic transformations."
RiFCN: Recurrent Network in Fully Convolutional Network for Semantic Segmentation of High Resolution Remote Sensing Images,"Semantic segmentation in high resolution remote sensing images is a fundamental and challenging task. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), such as fully convolutional network (FCN) and SegNet, have shown outstanding performance in many segmentation tasks. One key pillar of these successes is mining useful information from features in convolutional layers for producing high resolution segmentation maps. For example, FCN nonlinearly combines high-level features extracted from last convolutional layers; whereas SegNet utilizes a deconvolutional network which takes as input only coarse, high-level feature maps of the last convolutional layer. However, how to better fuse multi-level convolutional feature maps for semantic segmentation of remote sensing images is underexplored. In this work, we propose a novel bidirectional network called recurrent network in fully convolutional network (RiFCN), which is end-to-end trainable. It has a forward stream and a backward stream. The former is a classification CNN architecture for feature extraction, which takes an input image and produces multi-level convolutional feature maps from shallow to deep; while in the later, to achieve accurate boundary inference and semantic segmentation, boundary-aware high resolution feature maps in shallower layers and high-level but low-resolution features are recursively embedded into the learning framework (from deep to shallow) to generate a fused feature representation that draws a holistic picture of not only high-level semantic information but also low-level fine-grained details. Experimental results on two widely-used high resolution remote sensing data sets for semantic segmentation tasks, ISPRS Potsdam and Inria Aerial Image Labeling Data Set, demonstrate competitive performance obtained by the proposed methodology compared to other studied approaches."
Semantic segmentation of mFISH images using convolutional networks,"Multicolor in situ hybridization (mFISH) is a karyotyping technique used to detect major chromosomal alterations using fluorescent probes and imaging techniques. Manual interpretation of mFISH images is a time consuming step that can be automated using machine learning; in previous works, pixel or patch wise classification was employed, overlooking spatial information which can help identify chromosomes. In this work, we propose a fully convolutional semantic segmentation network for the interpretation of mFISH images, which uses both spatial and spectral information to classify each pixel in an end-to-end fashion. The semantic segmentation network developed was tested on samples extracted from a public dataset using cross validation. Despite having no labeling information of the image it was tested on our algorithm yielded an average correct classification ratio (CCR) of 87.41%. Previously, this level of accuracy was only achieved with state of the art algorithms when classifying pixels from the same image in which the classifier has been trained. These results provide evidence that fully convolutional semantic segmentation networks may be employed in the computer aided diagnosis of genetic diseases with improved performance over the current methods of image analysis."
Semantic Binary Segmentation using Convolutional Networks without Decoders,"In this paper, we propose an efficient architecture for semantic image segmentation using the depth-to-space (D2S) operation. Our D2S model is comprised of a standard CNN encoder followed by a depth-to-space reordering of the final convolutional feature maps. Our approach eliminates the decoder portion of traditional encoder-decoder segmentation models and reduces the amount of computation almost by half. As a participant of the DeepGlobe Road Extraction competition, we evaluate our models on the corresponding road segmentation dataset. Our highly efficient D2S models exhibit comparable performance to standard segmentation models with much lower computational cost."
On the iterative refinement of densely connected representation levels for semantic segmentation,"State-of-the-art semantic segmentation approaches increase the receptive field of their models by using either a downsampling path composed of poolings/strided convolutions or successive dilated convolutions. However, it is not clear which operation leads to best results. In this paper, we systematically study the differences introduced by distinct receptive field enlargement methods and their impact on the performance of a novel architecture, called Fully Convolutional DenseResNet (FC-DRN). FC-DRN has a densely connected backbone composed of residual networks. Following standard image segmentation architectures, receptive field enlargement operations that change the representation level are interleaved among residual networks. This allows the model to exploit the benefits of both residual and dense connectivity patterns, namely: gradient flow, iterative refinement of representations, multi-scale feature combination and deep supervision. In order to highlight the potential of our model, we test it on the challenging CamVid urban scene understanding benchmark and make the following observations: 1) downsampling operations outperform dilations when the model is trained from scratch, 2) dilations are useful during the finetuning step of the model, 3) coarser representations require less refinement steps, and 4) ResNets (by model construction) are good regularizers, since they can reduce the model capacity when needed. Finally, we compare our architecture to alternative methods and report state-of-the-art result on the Camvid dataset, with at least twice fewer parameters."
Learning a Discriminative Feature Network for Semantic Segmentation,"Most existing methods of semantic segmentation still suffer from two aspects of challenges: intra-class inconsistency and inter-class indistinction. To tackle these two problems, we propose a Discriminative Feature Network (DFN), which contains two sub-networks: Smooth Network and Border Network. Specifically, to handle the intra-class inconsistency problem, we specially design a Smooth Network with Channel Attention Block and global average pooling to select the more discriminative features. Furthermore, we propose a Border Network to make the bilateral features of boundary distinguishable with deep semantic boundary supervision. Based on our proposed DFN, we achieve state-of-the-art performance 86.2% mean IOU on PASCAL VOC 2012 and 80.3% mean IOU on Cityscapes dataset."
Fully Convolutional Adaptation Networks for Semantic Segmentation,"The recent advances in deep neural networks have convincingly demonstrated high capability in learning vision models on large datasets. Nevertheless, collecting expert labeled datasets especially with pixel-level annotations is an extremely expensive process. An appealing alternative is to render synthetic data (e.g., computer games) and generate ground truth automatically. However, simply applying the models learnt on synthetic images may lead to high generalization error on real images due to domain shift. In this paper, we facilitate this issue from the perspectives of both visual appearance-level and representation-level domain adaptation. The former adapts source-domain images to appear as if drawn from the ""style"" in the target domain and the latter attempts to learn domain-invariant representations. Specifically, we present Fully Convolutional Adaptation Networks (FCAN), a novel deep architecture for semantic segmentation which combines Appearance Adaptation Networks (AAN) and Representation Adaptation Networks (RAN). AAN learns a transformation from one domain to the other in the pixel space and RAN is optimized in an adversarial learning manner to maximally fool the domain discriminator with the learnt source and target representations. Extensive experiments are conducted on the transfer from GTA5 (game videos) to Cityscapes (urban street scenes) on semantic segmentation and our proposal achieves superior results when comparing to state-of-the-art unsupervised adaptation techniques. More remarkably, we obtain a new record: mIoU of 47.5% on BDDS (drive-cam videos) in an unsupervised setting."
Vortex Pooling: Improving Context Representation in Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision, which can be considered as a per-pixel classification problem. Recently, although fully convolutional neural network (FCN) based approaches have made remarkable progress in such task, aggregating local and contextual information in convolutional feature maps is still a challenging problem. In this paper, we argue that, when predicting the category of a given pixel, the regions close to the target are more important than those far from it. To tackle this problem, we then propose an effective yet efficient approach named Vortex Pooling to effectively utilize contextual information. Empirical studies are also provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. To be specific, our approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art model named DeepLab v3 by 1.5% on the PASCAL VOC 2012 val set and 0.6% on the test set by replacing the Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) module in DeepLab v3 with the proposed Vortex Pooling. Moreover, our model (10.13FPS) shares similar computation cost with DeepLab v3 (10.37 FPS)."
Learning to Exploit the Prior Network Knowledge for Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for semantic segmentation typically requires to collect a large amount of accurate pixel-level annotations, a hard and expensive task. In contrast, simple image tags are easier to gather. With this paper we introduce a novel weakly-supervised semantic segmentation model able to learn from image labels, and just image labels. Our model uses the prior knowledge of a network trained for image recognition, employing these image annotations as an attention mechanism to identify semantic regions in the images. We then present a methodology that builds accurate class-specific segmentation masks from these regions, where neither external objectness nor saliency algorithms are required. We describe how to incorporate this mask generation strategy into a fully end-to-end trainable process where the network jointly learns to classify and segment images. Our experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset show that exploiting these generated class-specific masks in conjunction with our novel end-to-end learning process outperforms several recent weakly-supervised semantic segmentation methods that use image tags only, and even some models that leverage additional supervision or training data."
ExFuse: Enhancing Feature Fusion for Semantic Segmentation,"Modern semantic segmentation frameworks usually combine low-level and high-level features from pre-trained backbone convolutional models to boost performance. In this paper, we first point out that a simple fusion of low-level and high-level features could be less effective because of the gap in semantic levels and spatial resolution. We find that introducing semantic information into low-level features and high-resolution details into high-level features is more effective for the later fusion. Based on this observation, we propose a new framework, named ExFuse, to bridge the gap between low-level and high-level features thus significantly improve the segmentation quality by 4.0\% in total. Furthermore, we evaluate our approach on the challenging PASCAL VOC 2012 segmentation benchmark and achieve 87.9\% mean IoU, which outperforms the previous state-of-the-art results."
A Multi-Layer Approach to Superpixel-based Higher-order Conditional Random Field for Semantic Image Segmentation,"Superpixel-based Higher-order Conditional random fields (SP-HO-CRFs) are known for their effectiveness in enforcing both short and long spatial contiguity for pixelwise labelling in computer vision. However, their higher-order potentials are usually too complex to learn and often incur a high computational cost in performing inference. We propose an new approximation approach to SP-HO-CRFs that resolves these problems. Our approach is a multi-layer CRF framework that inherits the simplicity from pairwise CRFs by formulating both the higher-order and pairwise cues into the same pairwise potentials in the first layer. Essentially, this approach provides accuracy enhancement on the basis of pairwise CRFs without training by reusing their pre-trained parameters and/or weights. The proposed multi-layer approach performs especially well in delineating the boundary details (boarders) of object categories such as ""trees"" and ""bushes"". Multiple sets of experiments conducted on dataset MSRC-21 and PASCAL VOC 2012 validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methods."
Land use mapping in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area based on semantic segmentation deep learning method,"The Three Gorges Dam, a massive cross-century project spans the Yangtze River by the town of Sandouping, located in Yichang, Hubei province, China, was built to provide great power, improve the River shipping, control floods in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, and increase the dry season flow in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Benefits are enormous and comprehensive. However, the social and environmental impacts are also immense and far-reaching to its surrounding areas. Mapping land use /land cover changed (LUCC) is critical for tracking the impacts. Remote sensing has been proved to be an effective way to map and monitor land use change in real time and in large areas such as the Three Gorges Reservoir Area(TGRA) by using pixel based or oriented based classifier in different resolution. In this paper, we first test the state of the art semantic segmentation deep learning classifiers for LUCC mapping with 7 categories in the TGRA area with rapideye 5m resolution data. The topographic information was also added for better accuracy in mountain area. By compared with the pixel-based classifier, the semantic segmentation deep learning method has better accuracy and robustness at 5m resolution level."
Low-Latency Video Semantic Segmentation,"Recent years have seen remarkable progress in semantic segmentation. Yet, it remains a challenging task to apply segmentation techniques to video-based applications. Specifically, the high throughput of video streams, the sheer cost of running fully convolutional networks, together with the low-latency requirements in many real-world applications, e.g. autonomous driving, present a significant challenge to the design of the video segmentation framework. To tackle this combined challenge, we develop a framework for video semantic segmentation, which incorporates two novel components: (1) a feature propagation module that adaptively fuses features over time via spatially variant convolution, thus reducing the cost of per-frame computation; and (2) an adaptive scheduler that dynamically allocate computation based on accuracy prediction. Both components work together to ensure low latency while maintaining high segmentation quality. On both Cityscapes and CamVid, the proposed framework obtained competitive performance compared to the state of the art, while substantially reducing the latency, from 360 ms to 119 ms."
EarthMapper: A Tool Box for the Semantic Segmentation of Remote Sensing Imagery,"Deep learning continues to push state-of-the-art performance for the semantic segmentation of color (i.e., RGB) imagery; however, the lack of annotated data for many remote sensing sensors (i.e. hyperspectral imagery (HSI)) prevents researchers from taking advantage of this recent success. Since generating sensor specific datasets is time intensive and cost prohibitive, remote sensing researchers have embraced deep unsupervised feature extraction. Although these methods have pushed state-of-the-art performance on current HSI benchmarks, many of these tools are not readily accessible to many researchers. In this letter, we introduce a software pipeline, which we call EarthMapper, for the semantic segmentation of non-RGB remote sensing imagery. It includes self-taught spatial-spectral feature extraction, various standard and deep learning classifiers, and undirected graphical models for post-processing. We evaluated EarthMapper on the Indian Pines and Pavia University datasets and have released this code for public use."
Real-time Progressive 3D Semantic Segmentation for Indoor Scene,"The widespread adoption of autonomous systems such as drones and assistant robots has created a need for real-time high-quality semantic scene segmentation. In this paper, we propose an efficient yet robust technique for on-the-fly dense reconstruction and semantic segmentation of 3D indoor scenes. To guarantee (near) real-time performance, our method is built atop an efficient super-voxel clustering method and a conditional random field with higher-order constraints from structural and object cues, enabling progressive dense semantic segmentation without any precomputation. We extensively evaluate our method on different indoor scenes including kitchens, offices, and bedrooms in the SceneNN and ScanNet datasets and show that our technique consistently produces state-of-the-art segmentation results in both qualitative and quantitative experiments."
Learning Pixel-level Semantic Affinity with Image-level Supervision for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"The deficiency of segmentation labels is one of the main obstacles to semantic segmentation in the wild. To alleviate this issue, we present a novel framework that generates segmentation labels of images given their image-level class labels. In this weakly supervised setting, trained models have been known to segment local discriminative parts rather than the entire object area. Our solution is to propagate such local responses to nearby areas which belong to the same semantic entity. To this end, we propose a Deep Neural Network (DNN) called AffinityNet that predicts semantic affinity between a pair of adjacent image coordinates. The semantic propagation is then realized by random walk with the affinities predicted by AffinityNet. More importantly, the supervision employed to train AffinityNet is given by the initial discriminative part segmentation, which is incomplete as a segmentation annotation but sufficient for learning semantic affinities within small image areas. Thus the entire framework relies only on image-level class labels and does not require any extra data or annotations. On the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset, a DNN learned with segmentation labels generated by our method outperforms previous models trained with the same level of supervision, and is even as competitive as those relying on stronger supervision."
3DMV: Joint 3D-Multi-View Prediction for 3D Semantic Scene Segmentation,"We present 3DMV, a novel method for 3D semantic scene segmentation of RGB-D scans in indoor environments using a joint 3D-multi-view prediction network. In contrast to existing methods that either use geometry or RGB data as input for this task, we combine both data modalities in a joint, end-to-end network architecture. Rather than simply projecting color data into a volumetric grid and operating solely in 3D -- which would result in insufficient detail -- we first extract feature maps from associated RGB images. These features are then mapped into the volumetric feature grid of a 3D network using a differentiable backprojection layer. Since our target is 3D scanning scenarios with possibly many frames, we use a multi-view pooling approach in order to handle a varying number of RGB input views. This learned combination of RGB and geometric features with our joint 2D-3D architecture achieves significantly better results than existing baselines. For instance, our final result on the ScanNet 3D segmentation benchmark increases from 52.8\% to 75\% accuracy compared to existing volumetric architectures."
Adaptive Affinity Fields for Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation has made much progress with increasingly powerful pixel-wise classifiers and incorporating structural priors via Conditional Random Fields (CRF) or Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). We propose a simpler alternative that learns to verify the spatial structure of segmentation during training only. Unlike existing approaches that enforce semantic labels on individual pixels and match labels between neighbouring pixels, we propose the concept of Adaptive Affinity Fields (AAF) to capture and match the semantic relations between neighbouring pixels in the label space. We use adversarial learning to select the optimal affinity field size for each semantic category. It is formulated as a minimax problem, optimizing our segmentation neural network in a best worst-case learning scenario. AAF is versatile for representing structures as a collection of pixel-centric relations, easier to train than GAN and more efficient than CRF without run-time inference. Our extensive evaluations on PASCAL VOC 2012, Cityscapes, and GTA5 datasets demonstrate its above-par segmentation performance and robust generalization across domains."
WebSeg: Learning Semantic Segmentation from Web Searches,"In this paper, we improve semantic segmentation by automatically learning from Flickr images associated with a particular keyword, without relying on any explicit user annotations, thus substantially alleviating the dependence on accurate annotations when compared to previous weakly supervised methods.  To solve such a challenging problem, we leverage several low-level cues (such as saliency, edges, etc.) to help generate a proxy ground truth. Due to the diversity of web-crawled images, we anticipate a large amount of 'label noise' in which other objects might be present. We design an online noise filtering scheme which is able to deal with this label noise, especially in cluttered images. We use this filtering strategy as an auxiliary module to help assist the segmentation network in learning cleaner proxy annotations. Extensive experiments on the popular PASCAL VOC 2012 semantic segmentation benchmark show surprising good results in both our WebSeg (mIoU = 57.0%) and weakly supervised (mIoU = 63.3%) settings."
Low-Shot Learning for the Semantic Segmentation of Remote Sensing Imagery,"Recent advances in computer vision using deep learning with RGB imagery (e.g., object recognition and detection) have been made possible thanks to the development of large annotated RGB image datasets. In contrast, multispectral image (MSI) and hyperspectral image (HSI) datasets contain far fewer labeled images, in part due to the wide variety of sensors used. These annotations are especially limited for semantic segmentation, or pixel-wise classification, of remote sensing imagery because it is labor intensive to generate image annotations. Low-shot learning algorithms can make effective inferences despite smaller amounts of annotated data. In this paper, we study low-shot learning using self-taught feature learning for semantic segmentation. We introduce 1) an improved self-taught feature learning framework for HSI and MSI data and 2) a semi-supervised classification algorithm. When these are combined, they achieve state-of-the-art performance on remote sensing datasets that have little annotated training data available. These low-shot learning frameworks will reduce the manual image annotation burden and improve semantic segmentation performance for remote sensing imagery."
Context Encoding for Semantic Segmentation,"Recent work has made significant progress in improving spatial resolution for pixelwise labeling with Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) framework by employing Dilated/Atrous convolution, utilizing multi-scale features and refining boundaries. In this paper, we explore the impact of global contextual information in semantic segmentation by introducing the Context Encoding Module, which captures the semantic context of scenes and selectively highlights class-dependent featuremaps. The proposed Context Encoding Module significantly improves semantic segmentation results with only marginal extra computation cost over FCN. Our approach has achieved new state-of-the-art results 51.7% mIoU on PASCAL-Context, 85.9% mIoU on PASCAL VOC 2012. Our single model achieves a final score of 0.5567 on ADE20K test set, which surpass the winning entry of COCO-Place Challenge in 2017. In addition, we also explore how the Context Encoding Module can improve the feature representation of relatively shallow networks for the image classification on CIFAR-10 dataset. Our 14 layer network has achieved an error rate of 3.45%, which is comparable with state-of-the-art approaches with over 10 times more layers. The source code for the complete system are publicly available."
Fast Semantic Segmentation on Video Using Block Motion-Based Feature Interpolation,"Convolutional networks optimized for accuracy on challenging, dense prediction tasks are prohibitively slow to run on each frame in a video. The spatial similarity of nearby video frames, however, suggests opportunity to reuse computation. Existing work has explored basic feature reuse and feature warping based on optical flow, but has encountered limits to the speedup attainable with these techniques. In this paper, we present a new, two part approach to accelerating inference on video. First, we propose a fast feature propagation technique that utilizes the block motion vectors present in compressed video (e.g. H.264 codecs) to cheaply propagate features from frame to frame. Second, we develop a novel feature estimation scheme, termed feature interpolation, that fuses features propagated from enclosing keyframes to render accurate feature estimates, even at sparse keyframe frequencies. We evaluate our system on the Cityscapes and CamVid datasets, comparing to both a frame-by-frame baseline and related work. We find that we are able to substantially accelerate segmentation on video, achieving near real-time frame rates (20.1 frames per second) on large images (960 x 720 pixels), while maintaining competitive accuracy. This represents an improvement of almost 6x over the single-frame baseline and 2.5x over the fastest prior work."
Aerial LaneNet: Lane Marking Semantic Segmentation in Aerial Imagery using Wavelet-Enhanced Cost-sensitive Symmetric Fully Convolutional Neural Networks,"The knowledge about the placement and appearance of lane markings is a prerequisite for the creation of maps with high precision, necessary for autonomous driving, infrastructure monitoring, lane-wise traffic management, and urban planning. Lane markings are one of the important components of such maps. Lane markings convey the rules of roads to drivers. While these rules are learned by humans, an autonomous driving vehicle should be taught to learn them to localize itself. Therefore, accurate and reliable lane marking semantic segmentation in the imagery of roads and highways is needed to achieve such goals. We use airborne imagery which can capture a large area in a short period of time by introducing an aerial lane marking dataset. In this work, we propose a Symmetric Fully Convolutional Neural Network enhanced by Wavelet Transform in order to automatically carry out lane marking segmentation in aerial imagery. Due to a heavily unbalanced problem in terms of number of lane marking pixels compared with background pixels, we use a customized loss function as well as a new type of data augmentation step. We achieve a very high accuracy in pixel-wise localization of lane markings without using 3rd-party information. In this work, we introduce the first high-quality dataset used within our experiments which contains a broad range of situations and classes of lane markings representative of current transportation systems. This dataset will be publicly available and hence, it can be used as the benchmark dataset for future algorithms within this domain."
ESPNet: Efficient Spatial Pyramid of Dilated Convolutions for Semantic Segmentation,"We introduce a fast and efficient convolutional neural network, ESPNet, for semantic segmentation of high resolution images under resource constraints. ESPNet is based on a new convolutional module, efficient spatial pyramid (ESP), which is efficient in terms of computation, memory, and power. ESPNet is 22 times faster (on a standard GPU) and 180 times smaller than the state-of-the-art semantic segmentation network PSPNet, while its category-wise accuracy is only 8% less. We evaluated ESPNet on a variety of semantic segmentation datasets including Cityscapes, PASCAL VOC, and a breast biopsy whole slide image dataset. Under the same constraints on memory and computation, ESPNet outperforms all the current efficient CNN networks such as MobileNet, ShuffleNet, and ENet on both standard metrics and our newly introduced performance metrics that measure efficiency on edge devices. Our network can process high resolution images at a rate of 112 and 9 frames per second on a standard GPU and edge device, respectively."
Semantic Segmentation of Pathological Lung Tissue with Dilated Fully Convolutional Networks,"Early and accurate diagnosis of interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) is crucial for making treatment decisions, but can be challenging even for experienced radiologists. The diagnostic procedure is based on the detection and recognition of the different ILD pathologies in thoracic CT scans, yet their manifestation often appears similar. In this study, we propose the use of a deep purely convolutional neural network for the semantic segmentation of ILD patterns, as the basic component of a computer aided diagnosis (CAD) system for ILDs. The proposed CNN, which consists of convolutional layers with dilated filters, takes as input a lung CT image of arbitrary size and outputs the corresponding label map. We trained and tested the network on a dataset of 172 sparsely annotated CT scans, within a cross-validation scheme. The training was performed in an end-to-end and semi-supervised fashion, utilizing both labeled and non-labeled image regions. The experimental results show significant performance improvement with respect to the state of the art."
Training of Convolutional Networks on Multiple Heterogeneous Datasets for Street Scene Semantic Segmentation,"We propose a convolutional network with hierarchical classifiers for per-pixel semantic segmentation, which is able to be trained on multiple, heterogeneous datasets and exploit their semantic hierarchy. Our network is the first to be simultaneously trained on three different datasets from the intelligent vehicles domain, i.e. Cityscapes, GTSDB and Mapillary Vistas, and is able to handle different semantic level-of-detail, class imbalances, and different annotation types, i.e. dense per-pixel and sparse bounding-box labels. We assess our hierarchical approach, by comparing against flat, non-hierarchical classifiers and we show improvements in mean pixel accuracy of 13.0% for Cityscapes classes and 2.4% for Vistas classes and 32.3% for GTSDB classes. Our implementation achieves inference rates of 17 fps at a resolution of 520x706 for 108 classes running on a GPU."
ShuffleSeg: Real-time Semantic Segmentation Network,"Real-time semantic segmentation is of significant importance for mobile and robotics related applications. We propose a computationally efficient segmentation network which we term as ShuffleSeg. The proposed architecture is based on grouped convolution and channel shuffling in its encoder for improving the performance. An ablation study of different decoding methods is compared including Skip architecture, UNet, and Dilation Frontend. Interesting insights on the speed and accuracy tradeoff is discussed. It is shown that skip architecture in the decoding method provides the best compromise for the goal of real-time performance, while it provides adequate accuracy by utilizing higher resolution feature maps for a more accurate segmentation. ShuffleSeg is evaluated on CityScapes and compared against the state of the art real-time segmentation networks. It achieves 2x GFLOPs reduction, while it provides on par mean intersection over union of 58.3% on CityScapes test set. ShuffleSeg runs at 15.7 frames per second on NVIDIA Jetson TX2, which makes it of great potential for real-time applications."
"Driving Scene Perception Network: Real-time Joint Detection, Depth Estimation and Semantic Segmentation","As the demand for enabling high-level autonomous driving has increased in recent years and visual perception is one of the critical features to enable fully autonomous driving, in this paper, we introduce an efficient approach for simultaneous object detection, depth estimation and pixel-level semantic segmentation using a shared convolutional architecture. The proposed network model, which we named Driving Scene Perception Network (DSPNet), uses multi-level feature maps and multi-task learning to improve the accuracy and efficiency of object detection, depth estimation and image segmentation tasks from a single input image. Hence, the resulting network model uses less than 850 MiB of GPU memory and achieves 14.0 fps on NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 with a 1024x512 input image, and both precision and efficiency have been improved over combination of single tasks."
Fast and Accurate Semantic Mapping through Geometric-based Incremental Segmentation,"We propose an efficient and scalable method for incrementally building a dense, semantically annotated 3D map in real-time. The proposed method assigns class probabilities to each region, not each element (e.g., surfel and voxel), of the 3D map which is built up through a robust SLAM framework and incrementally segmented with a geometric-based segmentation method. Differently from all other approaches, our method has a capability of running at over 30Hz while performing all processing components, including SLAM, segmentation, 2D recognition, and updating class probabilities of each segmentation label at every incoming frame, thanks to the high efficiency that characterizes the computationally intensive stages of our framework. By utilizing a specifically designed CNN to improve the frame-wise segmentation result, we can also achieve high accuracy. We validate our method on the NYUv2 dataset by comparing with the state of the art in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency, and by means of an analysis in terms of time and space complexity."
RTSeg: Real-time Semantic Segmentation Comparative Study,"Semantic segmentation benefits robotics related applications especially autonomous driving. Most of the research on semantic segmentation is only on increasing the accuracy of segmentation models with little attention to computationally efficient solutions. The few work conducted in this direction does not provide principled methods to evaluate the different design choices for segmentation. In this paper, we address this gap by presenting a real-time semantic segmentation benchmarking framework with a decoupled design for feature extraction and decoding methods. The framework is comprised of different network architectures for feature extraction such as VGG16, Resnet18, MobileNet, and ShuffleNet. It is also comprised of multiple meta-architectures for segmentation that define the decoding methodology. These include SkipNet, UNet, and Dilation Frontend. Experimental results are presented on the Cityscapes dataset for urban scenes. The modular design allows novel architectures to emerge, that lead to 143x GFLOPs reduction in comparison to SegNet. This benchmarking framework is publicly available at ""https://github.com/MSiam/TFSegmentation""."
Decoupled Spatial Neural Attention for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Weakly supervised semantic segmentation receives much research attention since it alleviates the need to obtain a large amount of dense pixel-wise ground-truth annotations for the training images. Compared with other forms of weak supervision, image labels are quite efficient to obtain. In our work, we focus on the weakly supervised semantic segmentation with image label annotations. Recent progress for this task has been largely dependent on the quality of generated pseudo-annotations. In this work, inspired by spatial neural-attention for image captioning, we propose a decoupled spatial neural attention network for generating pseudo-annotations. Our decoupled attention structure could simultaneously identify the object regions and localize the discriminative parts which generates high-quality pseudo-annotations in one forward path. The generated pseudo-annotations lead to the segmentation results which achieve the state-of-the-art in weakly-supervised semantic segmentation."
Learning to Adapt Structured Output Space for Semantic Segmentation,"Convolutional neural network-based approaches for semantic segmentation rely on supervision with pixel-level ground truth, but may not generalize well to unseen image domains. As the labeling process is tedious and labor intensive, developing algorithms that can adapt source ground truth labels to the target domain is of great interest. In this paper, we propose an adversarial learning method for domain adaptation in the context of semantic segmentation. Considering semantic segmentations as structured outputs that contain spatial similarities between the source and target domains, we adopt adversarial learning in the output space. To further enhance the adapted model, we construct a multi-level adversarial network to effectively perform output space domain adaptation at different feature levels. Extensive experiments and ablation study are conducted under various domain adaptation settings, including synthetic-to-real and cross-city scenarios. We show that the proposed method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and visual quality."
Semantic segmentation of trajectories with agent models,"In many cases, such as trajectories clustering and classification, we often divide a trajectory into segments as preprocessing. In this paper, we propose a trajectory semantic segmentation method based on learned behavior models. In the proposed method, we learn some behavior models from video sequences. Next, using learned behavior models and a hidden Markov model, we segment a trajectory into semantic segments. Comparing with the Ramer-Douglas-Peucker algorithm, we show the effectiveness of the proposed method."
"Multi-Evidence Filtering and Fusion for Multi-Label Classification, Object Detection and Semantic Segmentation Based on Weakly Supervised Learning","Supervised object detection and semantic segmentation require object or even pixel level annotations. When there exist image level labels only, it is challenging for weakly supervised algorithms to achieve accurate predictions. The accuracy achieved by top weakly supervised algorithms is still significantly lower than their fully supervised counterparts. In this paper, we propose a novel weakly supervised curriculum learning pipeline for multi-label object recognition, detection and semantic segmentation. In this pipeline, we first obtain intermediate object localization and pixel labeling results for the training images, and then use such results to train task-specific deep networks in a fully supervised manner. The entire process consists of four stages, including object localization in the training images, filtering and fusing object instances, pixel labeling for the training images, and task-specific network training. To obtain clean object instances in the training images, we propose a novel algorithm for filtering, fusing and classifying object instances collected from multiple solution mechanisms. In this algorithm, we incorporate both metric learning and density-based clustering to filter detected object instances. Experiments show that our weakly supervised pipeline achieves state-of-the-art results in multi-label image classification as well as weakly supervised object detection and very competitive results in weakly supervised semantic segmentation on MS-COCO, PASCAL VOC 2007 and PASCAL VOC 2012."
Bonnet: An Open-Source Training and Deployment Framework for Semantic Segmentation in Robotics using CNNs,"The ability to interpret a scene is an important capability for a robot that is supposed to interact with its environment. The knowledge of what is in front of the robot is, for example, relevant for navigation, manipulation, or planning. Semantic segmentation labels each pixel of an image with a class label and thus provides a detailed semantic annotation of the surroundings to the robot. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are popular methods for addressing this type of problem. The available software for training and the integration of CNNs for real robots, however, is quite fragmented and often difficult to use for non-experts, despite the availability of several high-quality open-source frameworks for neural network implementation and training. In this paper, we propose a tool called Bonnet, which addresses this fragmentation problem by building a higher abstraction that is specific for the semantic segmentation task. It provides a modular approach to simplify the training of a semantic segmentation CNN independently of the used dataset and the intended task. Furthermore, we also address the deployment on a real robotic platform. Thus, we do not propose a new CNN approach in this paper. Instead, we provide a stable and easy-to-use tool to make this technology more approachable in the context of autonomous systems. In this sense, we aim at closing a gap between computer vision research and its use in robotics research. We provide an open-source codebase for training and deployment. The training interface is implemented in Python using TensorFlow and the deployment interface provides a C++ library that can be easily integrated in an existing robotics codebase, a ROS node, and two standalone applications for label prediction in images and videos."
Superpixel based Class-Semantic Texton Occurrences for Natural Roadside Vegetation Segmentation,"Vegetation segmentation from roadside data is a field that has received relatively little attention in present studies, but can be of great potentials in a wide range of real-world applications, such as road safety assessment and vegetation condition monitoring. In this paper, we present a novel approach that generates class-semantic color-texture textons and aggregates superpixel based texton occurrences for vegetation segmentation in natural roadside images. Pixel-level class-semantic textons are first learnt by generating two individual sets of bag-of-word visual dictionaries from color and filter-bank texture features separately for each object class using manually cropped training data. For a testing image, it is first oversegmented into a set of homogeneous superpixels. The color and texture features of all pixels in each superpixel are extracted and further mapped to one of the learnt textons using the nearest distance metric, resulting in a color and a texture texton occurrence matrix. The color and texture texton occurrences are aggregated using a linear mixing method over each superpixel and the segmentation is finally achieved using a simple yet effective majority voting strategy. Evaluations on two public image datasets from videos collected by the Department of Transport and Main Roads (DTMR), Queensland, Australia, and a public roadside grass dataset show high accuracy of the proposed approach. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach for vegetation segmentation in real-world scenarios."
Locally Adaptive Learning Loss for Semantic Image Segmentation,"We propose a novel locally adaptive learning estimator for enhancing the inter- and intra- discriminative capabilities of Deep Neural Networks, which can be used as improved loss layer for semantic image segmentation tasks. Most loss layers compute pixel-wise cost between feature maps and ground truths, ignoring spatial layouts and interactions between neighboring pixels with same object category, and thus networks cannot be effectively sensitive to intra-class connections. Stride by stride, our method firstly conducts adaptive pooling filter operating over predicted feature maps, aiming to merge predicted distributions over a small group of neighboring pixels with same category, and then it computes cost between the merged distribution vector and their category label. Such design can make groups of neighboring predictions from same category involved into estimations on predicting correctness with respect to their category, and hence train networks to be more sensitive to regional connections between adjacent pixels based on their categories. In the experiments on Pascal VOC 2012 segmentation datasets, the consistently improved results show that our proposed approach achieves better segmentation masks against previous counterparts."
Stereo obstacle detection for unmanned surface vehicles by IMU-assisted semantic segmentation,"A new obstacle detection algorithm for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) is presented. A state-of-the-art graphical model for semantic segmentation is extended to incorporate boat pitch and roll measurements from the on-board inertial measurement unit (IMU), and a stereo verification algorithm that consolidates tentative detections obtained from the segmentation is proposed. The IMU readings are used to estimate the location of horizon line in the image, which automatically adjusts the priors in the probabilistic semantic segmentation model. We derive the equations for projecting the horizon into images, propose an efficient optimization algorithm for the extended graphical model, and offer a practical IMU-camera-USV calibration procedure. Using an USV equipped with multiple synchronized sensors, we captured a new challenging multi-modal dataset, and annotated its images with water edge and obstacles. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the state of the art, with nearly 30% improvement in water-edge detection accuracy, an over 21% reduction of false positive rate, an almost 60% reduction of false negative rate, and an over 65% increase of true positive rate, while its Matlab implementation runs in real-time."
Adversarial Learning for Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"We propose a method for semi-supervised semantic segmentation using an adversarial network. While most existing discriminators are trained to classify input images as real or fake on the image level, we design a discriminator in a fully convolutional manner to differentiate the predicted probability maps from the ground truth segmentation distribution with the consideration of the spatial resolution. We show that the proposed discriminator can be used to improve semantic segmentation accuracy by coupling the adversarial loss with the standard cross entropy loss of the proposed model. In addition, the fully convolutional discriminator enables semi-supervised learning through discovering the trustworthy regions in predicted results of unlabeled images, thereby providing additional supervisory signals. In contrast to existing methods that utilize weakly-labeled images, our method leverages unlabeled images to enhance the segmentation model. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and Cityscapes datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."
Semantic Segmentation Refinement by Monte Carlo Region Growing of High Confidence Detections,"Despite recent improvements using fully convolutional networks, in general, the segmentation produced by most state-of-the-art semantic segmentation methods does not show satisfactory adherence to the object boundaries. We propose a method to refine the segmentation results generated by such deep learning models. Our method takes as input the confidence scores generated by a pixel-dense segmentation network and re-labels pixels with low confidence levels. The re-labeling approach employs a region growing mechanism that aggregates these pixels to neighboring areas with high confidence scores and similar appearance. In order to correct the labels of pixels that were incorrectly classified with high confidence level by the semantic segmentation algorithm, we generate multiple region growing steps through a Monte Carlo sampling of the seeds of the regions. Our method improves the accuracy of a state-of-the-art fully convolutional semantic segmentation approach on the publicly available COCO and PASCAL datasets, and it shows significantly better results on selected sequences of the finely-annotated DAVIS dataset."
Deep learning based supervised semantic segmentation of Electron Cryo-Subtomograms,"Cellular Electron Cryo-Tomography (CECT) is a powerful imaging technique for the 3D visualization of cellular structure and organization at submolecular resolution. It enables analyzing the native structures of macromolecular complexes and their spatial organization inside single cells. However, due to the high degree of structural complexity and practical imaging limitations, systematic macromolecular structural recovery inside CECT images remains challenging. Particularly, the recovery of a macromolecule is likely to be biased by its neighbor structures due to the high molecular crowding. To reduce the bias, here we introduce a novel 3D convolutional neural network inspired by Fully Convolutional Network and Encoder-Decoder Architecture for the supervised segmentation of macromolecules of interest in subtomograms. The tests of our models on realistically simulated CECT data demonstrate that our new approach has significantly improved segmentation performance compared to our baseline approach. Also, we demonstrate that the proposed model has generalization ability to segment new structures that do not exist in training data."
Generative ScatterNet Hybrid Deep Learning (G-SHDL) Network with Structural Priors for Semantic Image Segmentation,"This paper proposes a generative ScatterNet hybrid deep learning (G-SHDL) network for semantic image segmentation. The proposed generative architecture is able to train rapidly from relatively small labeled datasets using the introduced structural priors. In addition, the number of filters in each layer of the architecture is optimized resulting in a computationally efficient architecture. The G-SHDL network produces state-of-the-art classification performance against unsupervised and semi-supervised learning on two image datasets. Advantages of the G-SHDL network over supervised methods are demonstrated with experiments performed on training datasets of reduced size."
Encoder-Decoder with Atrous Separable Convolution for Semantic Image Segmentation,"Spatial pyramid pooling module or encode-decoder structure are used in deep neural networks for semantic segmentation task. The former networks are able to encode multi-scale contextual information by probing the incoming features with filters or pooling operations at multiple rates and multiple effective fields-of-view, while the latter networks can capture sharper object boundaries by gradually recovering the spatial information. In this work, we propose to combine the advantages from both methods. Specifically, our proposed model, DeepLabv3+, extends DeepLabv3 by adding a simple yet effective decoder module to refine the segmentation results especially along object boundaries. We further explore the Xception model and apply the depthwise separable convolution to both Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling and decoder modules, resulting in a faster and stronger encoder-decoder network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model on PASCAL VOC 2012 and Cityscapes datasets, achieving the test set performance of 89.0\% and 82.1\% without any post-processing. Our paper is accompanied with a publicly available reference implementation of the proposed models in Tensorflow at \url{https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/deeplab}."
Bitewing Radiography Semantic Segmentation Base on Conditional Generative Adversarial Nets,"Currently, Segmentation of bitewing radiograpy images is a very challenging task. The focus of the study is to segment it into caries, enamel, dentin, pulp, crowns, restoration and root canal treatments. The main method of semantic segmentation of bitewing radiograpy images at this stage is the U-shaped deep convolution neural network, but its accuracy is low. in order to improve the accuracy of semantic segmentation of bitewing radiograpy images, this paper proposes the use of Conditional Generative Adversarial network (cGAN) combined with U-shaped network structure (U-Net) approach to semantic segmentation of bitewing radiograpy images. The experimental results show that the accuracy of cGAN combined with U-Net is 69.7%, which is 13.3% higher than the accuracy of u-shaped deep convolution neural network of 56.4%."
Exploring Spatial Context for 3D Semantic Segmentation of Point Clouds,"Deep learning approaches have made tremendous progress in the field of semantic segmentation over the past few years. However, most current approaches operate in the 2D image space. Direct semantic segmentation of unstructured 3D point clouds is still an open research problem. The recently proposed PointNet architecture presents an interesting step ahead in that it can operate on unstructured point clouds, achieving encouraging segmentation results. However, it subdivides the input points into a grid of blocks and processes each such block individually. In this paper, we investigate the question how such an architecture can be extended to incorporate larger-scale spatial context. We build upon PointNet and propose two extensions that enlarge the receptive field over the 3D scene. We evaluate the proposed strategies on challenging indoor and outdoor datasets and show improved results in both scenarios."
Learning Semantic Segmentation with Diverse Supervision,"Models based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) have significantly improved the performance of semantic segmentation. However, learning these models requires a large amount of training images with pixel-level labels, which are very costly and time-consuming to collect. In this paper, we propose a method for learning CNN-based semantic segmentation models from images with several types of annotations that are available for various computer vision tasks, including image-level labels for classification, box-level labels for object detection and pixel-level labels for semantic segmentation. The proposed method is flexible and can be used together with any existing CNN-based semantic segmentation networks. Experimental evaluation on the challenging PASCAL VOC 2012 and SIFT-flow benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively make use of diverse training data to improve the performance of the learned models."
Learning random-walk label propagation for weakly-supervised semantic segmentation,"Large-scale training for semantic segmentation is challenging due to the expense of obtaining training data for this task relative to other vision tasks. We propose a novel training approach to address this difficulty. Given cheaply-obtained sparse image labelings, we propagate the sparse labels to produce guessed dense labelings. A standard CNN-based segmentation network is trained to mimic these labelings. The label-propagation process is defined via random-walk hitting probabilities, which leads to a differentiable parameterization with uncertainty estimates that are incorporated into our loss. We show that by learning the label-propagator jointly with the segmentation predictor, we are able to effectively learn semantic edges given no direct edge supervision. Experiments also show that training a segmentation network in this way outperforms the naive approach."
Virtual-to-Real: Learning to Control in Visual Semantic Segmentation,"Collecting training data from the physical world is usually time-consuming and even dangerous for fragile robots, and thus, recent advances in robot learning advocate the use of simulators as the training platform. Unfortunately, the reality gap between synthetic and real visual data prohibits direct migration of the models trained in virtual worlds to the real world. This paper proposes a modular architecture for tackling the virtual-to-real problem. The proposed architecture separates the learning model into a perception module and a control policy module, and uses semantic image segmentation as the meta representation for relating these two modules. The perception module translates the perceived RGB image to semantic image segmentation. The control policy module is implemented as a deep reinforcement learning agent, which performs actions based on the translated image segmentation. Our architecture is evaluated in an obstacle avoidance task and a target following task. Experimental results show that our architecture significantly outperforms all of the baseline methods in both virtual and real environments, and demonstrates a faster learning curve than them. We also present a detailed analysis for a variety of variant configurations, and validate the transferability of our modular architecture."
PDNet: Semantic Segmentation integrated with a Primal-Dual Network for Document binarization,"Binarization of digital documents is the task of classifying each pixel in an image of the document as belonging to the background (parchment/paper) or foreground (text/ink). Historical documents are often subjected to degradations, that make the task challenging. In the current work a deep neural network architecture is proposed that combines a fully convolutional network with an unrolled primal-dual network that can be trained end-to-end to achieve state of the art binarization on four out of seven datasets. Document binarization is formulated as an energy minimization problem. A fully convolutional neural network is trained for semantic segmentation of pixels that provides labeling cost associated with each pixel. This cost estimate is refined along the edges to compensate for any over or under estimation of the foreground class using a primal-dual approach. We provide necessary overview on proximal operator that facilitates theoretical underpinning required to train a primal-dual network using a gradient descent algorithm. Numerical instabilities encountered due to the recurrent nature of primal-dual approach are handled. We provide experimental results on document binarization competition dataset along with network changes and hyperparameter tuning required for stability and performance of the network. The network when pre-trained on synthetic dataset performs better as per the competition metrics."
A Classification Refinement Strategy for Semantic Segmentation,"Based on the observation that semantic segmentation errors are partially predictable, we propose a compact formulation using confusion statistics of the trained classifier to refine (re-estimate) the initial pixel label hypotheses. The proposed strategy is contingent upon computing the classifier confusion probabilities for a given dataset and estimating a relevant prior on the object classes present in the image to be classified. We provide a procedure to robustly estimate the confusion probabilities and explore multiple prior definitions. Experiments are shown comparing performances on multiple challenging datasets using different priors to improve a state-of-the-art semantic segmentation classifier. This study demonstrates the potential to significantly improve semantic labeling and motivates future work for reliable label prior estimation from images."
Long-term Visual Localization using Semantically Segmented Images,"Robust cross-seasonal localization is one of the major challenges in long-term visual navigation of autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we exploit recent advances in semantic segmentation of images, i.e., where each pixel is assigned a label related to the type of object it represents, to attack the problem of long-term visual localization. We show that semantically labeled 3-D point maps of the environment, together with semantically segmented images, can be efficiently used for vehicle localization without the need for detailed feature descriptors (SIFT, SURF, etc.). Thus, instead of depending on hand-crafted feature descriptors, we rely on the training of an image segmenter. The resulting map takes up much less storage space compared to a traditional descriptor based map. A particle filter based semantic localization solution is compared to one based on SIFT-features, and even with large seasonal variations over the year we perform on par with the larger and more descriptive SIFT-features, and are able to localize with an error below 1 m most of the time."
Semantic integration of UML class diagram with semantic validation on segments of mappings,"Recently, attention has focused on the software development, specially by differ-ent teams that are geographically distant to support collaborative work. Manage-ment, description and modeling in such collaborative approach are through sever-al tools and techniques based on UML models. It is now supported by a large number of tools. Most of these systems have the ability to compare different UML models, assist developers, designers and also provide operations for the merging and integration, to produce a coherent model. The contribution in this ar-ticle is both to integrate a set of UML class diagrams using mappings that are re-sult of alignment and assist designers and developers in the integration. In addi-tion, we will present a detail integration of UML models with the validation of mappings between them. Such validation helps to achieve correct, consistent and coherent integrated model."
Application of a semantic segmentation convolutional neural network for accurate automatic detection and mapping of solar photovoltaic arrays in aerial imagery,"We consider the problem of automatically detecting small-scale solar photovoltaic arrays for behind-the-meter energy resource assessment in high resolution aerial imagery. Such algorithms offer a faster and more cost-effective solution to collecting information on distributed solar photovoltaic (PV) arrays, such as their location, capacity, and generated energy. The surface area of PV arrays, a characteristic which can be estimated from aerial imagery, provides an important proxy for array capacity and energy generation. In this work, we employ a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network architecture, called SegNet (Badrinarayanan et. al., 2015), to semantically segment (or map) PV arrays in aerial imagery. This builds on previous work focused on identifying the locations of PV arrays, as opposed to their specific shapes and sizes. We measure the ability of our SegNet implementation to estimate the surface area of PV arrays on a large, publicly available, dataset that has been employed in several previous studies. The results indicate that the SegNet model yields substantial performance improvements with respect to estimating shape and size as compared to a recently proposed convolutional neural network PV detection algorithm."
Semantic Segmentation via Highly Fused Convolutional Network with Multiple Soft Cost Functions,"Semantic image segmentation is one of the most challenged tasks in computer vision. In this paper, we propose a highly fused convolutional network, which consists of three parts: feature downsampling, combined feature upsampling and multiple predictions. We adopt a strategy of multiple steps of upsampling and combined feature maps in pooling layers with its corresponding unpooling layers. Then we bring out multiple pre-outputs, each pre-output is generated from an unpooling layer by one-step upsampling. Finally, we concatenate these pre-outputs to get the final output. As a result, our proposed network makes highly use of the feature information by fusing and reusing feature maps. In addition, when training our model, we add multiple soft cost functions on pre-outputs and final outputs. In this way, we can reduce the loss reduction when the loss is back propagated. We evaluate our model on three major segmentation datasets: CamVid, PASCAL VOC and ADE20K. We achieve a state-of-the-art performance on CamVid dataset, as well as considerable improvements on PASCAL VOC dataset and ADE20K dataset"
Restricted Deformable Convolution based Road Scene Semantic Segmentation Using Surround View Cameras,"Understanding the surrounding environment of the vehicle is still one of the challenges for autonomous driving. This paper addresses 360-degree road scene semantic segmentation using surround view cameras, which are widely equipped in existing production cars. First, in order to address large distortion problem in the fisheye images, Restricted Deformable Convolution (RDC) is proposed for semantic segmentation, which can effectively model geometric transformations by learning the shapes of convolutional filters conditioned on the input feature map. Second, in order to obtain a large-scale training set of surround view images, a novel method called zoom augmentation is proposed to transform conventional images to fisheye images. Finally, an RDC based semantic segmentation model is built; the model is trained for real-world surround view images through a multi-task learning architecture by combining real-world images with transformed images. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the RDC to handle images with large distortions, and that the proposed approach shows a good performance using surround view cameras with the help of the transformed images."
Semantic Segmentation of Human Thigh Quadriceps Muscle in Magnetic Resonance Images,"This paper presents an end-to-end solution for MRI thigh quadriceps segmentation. This is the first attempt that deep learning methods are used for the MRI thigh segmentation task. We use the state-of-the-art Fully Convolutional Networks with transfer learning approach for the semantic segmentation of regions of interest in MRI thigh scans. To further improve the performance of the segmentation, we propose a post-processing technique using basic image processing methods. With our proposed method, we have established a new benchmark for MRI thigh quadriceps segmentation with mean Jaccard Similarity Index of 0.9502 and processing time of 0.117 second per image."
Context aware saliency map generation using semantic segmentation,"Saliency map detection, as a method for detecting important regions of an image, is used in many applications such as image classification and recognition. We propose that context detection could have an essential role in image saliency detection. This requires extraction of high level features. In this paper a saliency map is proposed, based on image context detection using semantic segmentation as a high level feature. Saliency map from semantic information is fused with color and contrast based saliency maps. The final saliency map is then generated. Simulation results for Pascal-voc11 image dataset show 99% accuracy in context detection. Also final saliency map produced by our proposed method shows acceptable results in detecting salient points."
ScanComplete: Large-Scale Scene Completion and Semantic Segmentation for 3D Scans,"We introduce ScanComplete, a novel data-driven approach for taking an incomplete 3D scan of a scene as input and predicting a complete 3D model along with per-voxel semantic labels. The key contribution of our method is its ability to handle large scenes with varying spatial extent, managing the cubic growth in data size as scene size increases. To this end, we devise a fully-convolutional generative 3D CNN model whose filter kernels are invariant to the overall scene size. The model can be trained on scene subvolumes but deployed on arbitrarily large scenes at test time. In addition, we propose a coarse-to-fine inference strategy in order to produce high-resolution output while also leveraging large input context sizes. In an extensive series of experiments, we carefully evaluate different model design choices, considering both deterministic and probabilistic models for completion and semantic inference. Our results show that we outperform other methods not only in the size of the environments handled and processing efficiency, but also with regard to completion quality and semantic segmentation performance by a significant margin."
MaskLab: Instance Segmentation by Refining Object Detection with Semantic and Direction Features,"In this work, we tackle the problem of instance segmentation, the task of simultaneously solving object detection and semantic segmentation. Towards this goal, we present a model, called MaskLab, which produces three outputs: box detection, semantic segmentation, and direction prediction. Building on top of the Faster-RCNN object detector, the predicted boxes provide accurate localization of object instances. Within each region of interest, MaskLab performs foreground/background segmentation by combining semantic and direction prediction. Semantic segmentation assists the model in distinguishing between objects of different semantic classes including background, while the direction prediction, estimating each pixel's direction towards its corresponding center, allows separating instances of the same semantic class. Moreover, we explore the effect of incorporating recent successful methods from both segmentation and detection (i.e. atrous convolution and hypercolumn). Our proposed model is evaluated on the COCO instance segmentation benchmark and shows comparable performance with other state-of-art models."
Per-Pixel Feedback for improving Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation is the task of assigning a label to each pixel in the image.In recent years, deep convolutional neural networks have been driving advances in multiple tasks related to cognition. Although, DCNNs have resulted in unprecedented visual recognition performances, they offer little transparency. To understand how DCNN based models work at the task of semantic segmentation, we try to analyze the DCNN models in semantic segmentation. We try to find the importance of global image information for labeling pixels.  Based on the experiments on discriminative regions, and modeling of fixations, we propose a set of new training loss functions for fine-tuning DCNN based models. The proposed training regime has shown improvement in performance of DeepLab Large FOV(VGG-16) Segmentation model for PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset. However, further test remains to conclusively evaluate the benefits due to the proposed loss functions across models, and data-sets.  Submitted in part fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Integrated Masters of Science in Applied Mathematics.  Update: Further Experiment showed minimal benefits.  Code Available [here](https://github.com/BardOfCodes/Seg-Unravel)."
Deep learning for semantic segmentation of remote sensing images with rich spectral content,"With the rapid development of Remote Sensing acquisition techniques, there is a need to scale and improve processing tools to cope with the observed increase of both data volume and richness. Among popular techniques in remote sensing, Deep Learning gains increasing interest but depends on the quality of the training data. Therefore, this paper presents recent Deep Learning approaches for fine or coarse land cover semantic segmentation estimation. Various 2D architectures are tested and a new 3D model is introduced in order to jointly process the spatial and spectral dimensions of the data. Such a set of networks enables the comparison of the different spectral fusion schemes. Besides, we also assess the use of a "" noisy ground truth "" (i.e. outdated and low spatial resolution labels) for training and testing the networks."
Mix-and-Match Tuning for Self-Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Deep convolutional networks for semantic image segmentation typically require large-scale labeled data, e.g. ImageNet and MS COCO, for network pre-training. To reduce annotation efforts, self-supervised semantic segmentation is recently proposed to pre-train a network without any human-provided labels. The key of this new form of learning is to design a proxy task (e.g. image colorization), from which a discriminative loss can be formulated on unlabeled data. Many proxy tasks, however, lack the critical supervision signals that could induce discriminative representation for the target image segmentation task. Thus self-supervision's performance is still far from that of supervised pre-training. In this study, we overcome this limitation by incorporating a ""mix-and-match"" (M&M) tuning stage in the self-supervision pipeline. The proposed approach is readily pluggable to many self-supervision methods and does not use more annotated samples than the original process. Yet, it is capable of boosting the performance of target image segmentation task to surpass fully-supervised pre-trained counterpart. The improvement is made possible by better harnessing the limited pixel-wise annotations in the target dataset. Specifically, we first introduce the ""mix"" stage, which sparsely samples and mixes patches from the target set to reflect rich and diverse local patch statistics of target images. A ""match"" stage then forms a class-wise connected graph, which can be used to derive a strong triplet-based discriminative loss for fine-tuning the network. Our paradigm follows the standard practice in existing self-supervised studies and no extra data or label is required. With the proposed M&M approach, for the first time, a self-supervision method can achieve comparable or even better performance compared to its ImageNet pre-trained counterpart on both PASCAL VOC2012 dataset and CityScapes dataset."
Recurrent Neural Networks for Semantic Instance Segmentation,"We present a recurrent model for semantic instance segmentation that sequentially generates binary masks and their associated class probabilities for every object in an image. Our proposed system is trainable end-to-end from an input image to a sequence of labeled masks and, compared to methods relying on object proposals, does not require post-processing steps on its output. We study the suitability of our recurrent model on three different instance segmentation benchmarks, namely Pascal VOC 2012, CVPPP Plant Leaf Segmentation and Cityscapes. Further, we analyze the object sorting patterns generated by our model and observe that it learns to follow a consistent pattern, which correlates with the activations learned in the encoder part of our network. Source code and models are available at https://imatge-upc.github.io/rsis/"
Real-time Semantic Image Segmentation via Spatial Sparsity,"We propose an approach to semantic (image) segmentation that reduces the computational costs by a factor of 25 with limited impact on the quality of results. Semantic segmentation has a number of practical applications, and for most such applications the computational costs are critical. The method follows a typical two-column network structure, where one column accepts an input image, while the other accepts a half-resolution version of that image. By identifying specific regions in the full-resolution image that can be safely ignored, as well as carefully tailoring the network structure, we can process approximately 15 highresolution Cityscapes images (1024x2048) per second using a single GTX 980 video card, while achieving a mean intersection-over-union score of 72.9% on the Cityscapes test set."
ROAD: Reality Oriented Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation of Urban Scenes,"Exploiting synthetic data to learn deep models has attracted increasing attention in recent years. However, the intrinsic domain difference between synthetic and real images usually causes a significant performance drop when applying the learned model to real world scenarios. This is mainly due to two reasons: 1) the model overfits to synthetic images, making the convolutional filters incompetent to extract informative representation for real images; 2) there is a distribution difference between synthetic and real data, which is also known as the domain adaptation problem. To this end, we propose a new reality oriented adaptation approach for urban scene semantic segmentation by learning from synthetic data. First, we propose a target guided distillation approach to learn the real image style, which is achieved by training the segmentation model to imitate a pretrained real style model using real images. Second, we further take advantage of the intrinsic spatial structure presented in urban scene images, and propose a spatial-aware adaptation scheme to effectively align the distribution of two domains. These two modules can be readily integrated with existing state-of-the-art semantic segmentation networks to improve their generalizability when adapting from synthetic to real urban scenes. We evaluate the proposed method on Cityscapes dataset by adapting from GTAV and SYNTHIA datasets, where the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."
Multi-class Semantic Segmentation of Skin Lesions via Fully Convolutional Networks,"Melanoma is clinically difficult to distinguish from common benign skin lesions, particularly melanocytic naevus and seborrhoeic keratosis. The dermoscopic appearance of these lesions has huge intra-class variations and high inter-class visual similarities. Most current research is focusing on single-class segmentation irrespective of classes of skin lesions. In this work, we evaluate the performance of deep learning on multi-class segmentation of ISIC-2017 challenge dataset, which consists of 2,750 dermoscopic images. We propose an end-to-end solution using fully convolutional networks (FCNs) for multi-class semantic segmentation to automatically segment the melanoma, seborrhoeic keratosis and naevus. To improve the performance of FCNs, transfer learning and a hybrid loss function are used. We evaluate the performance of the deep learning segmentation methods for multi-class segmentation and lesion diagnosis (with post-processing method) on the testing set of the ISIC-2017 challenge dataset. The results showed that the two-tier level transfer learning FCN-8s achieved the overall best result with \textit{Dice} score of 78.5% in a naevus category, 65.3% in melanoma, and 55.7% in seborrhoeic keratosis in multi-class segmentation and Accuracy of 84.62% for recognition of melanoma in lesion diagnosis."
3D Semantic Segmentation with Submanifold Sparse Convolutional Networks,"Convolutional networks are the de-facto standard for analyzing spatio-temporal data such as images, videos, and 3D shapes. Whilst some of this data is naturally dense (e.g., photos), many other data sources are inherently sparse. Examples include 3D point clouds that were obtained using a LiDAR scanner or RGB-D camera. Standard ""dense"" implementations of convolutional networks are very inefficient when applied on such sparse data. We introduce new sparse convolutional operations that are designed to process spatially-sparse data more efficiently, and use them to develop spatially-sparse convolutional networks. We demonstrate the strong performance of the resulting models, called submanifold sparse convolutional networks (SSCNs), on two tasks involving semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds. In particular, our models outperform all prior state-of-the-art on the test set of a recent semantic segmentation competition."
Large-scale Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation with Superpoint Graphs,"We propose a novel deep learning-based framework to tackle the challenge of semantic segmentation of large-scale point clouds of millions of points. We argue that the organization of 3D point clouds can be efficiently captured by a structure called superpoint graph (SPG), derived from a partition of the scanned scene into geometrically homogeneous elements. SPGs offer a compact yet rich representation of contextual relationships between object parts, which is then exploited by a graph convolutional network. Our framework sets a new state of the art for segmenting outdoor LiDAR scans (+11.9 and +8.8 mIoU points for both Semantic3D test sets), as well as indoor scans (+12.4 mIoU points for the S3DIS dataset)."
On the Robustness of Semantic Segmentation Models to Adversarial Attacks,"Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have demonstrated exceptional performance on most recognition tasks such as image classification and segmentation. However, they have also been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial examples. This phenomenon has recently attracted a lot of attention but it has not been extensively studied on multiple, large-scale datasets and structured prediction tasks such as semantic segmentation which often require more specialised networks with additional components such as CRFs, dilated convolutions, skip-connections and multiscale processing. In this paper, we present what to our knowledge is the first rigorous evaluation of adversarial attacks on modern semantic segmentation models, using two large-scale datasets. We analyse the effect of different network architectures, model capacity and multiscale processing, and show that many observations made on the task of classification do not always transfer to this more complex task. Furthermore, we show how mean-field inference in deep structured models, multiscale processing (and more generally, input transformations) naturally implement recently proposed adversarial defenses. Our observations will aid future efforts in understanding and defending against adversarial examples. Moreover, in the shorter term, we show how to effectively benchmark robustness and show which segmentation models should currently be preferred in safety-critical applications due to their inherent robustness."
Video Semantic Object Segmentation by Self-Adaptation of DCNN,"This paper proposes a new framework for semantic segmentation of objects in videos. We address the label inconsistency problem of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) by exploiting the fact that videos have multiple frames; in a few frames the object is confidently-estimated (CE) and we use the information in them to improve labels of the other frames. Given the semantic segmentation results of each frame obtained from DCNN, we sample several CE frames to adapt the DCNN model to the input video by focusing on specific instances in the video rather than general objects in various circumstances. We propose offline and online approaches under different supervision levels. In experiments our method achieved great improvement over the original model and previous state-of-the-art methods."
Learning from Synthetic Data: Addressing Domain Shift for Semantic Segmentation,"Visual Domain Adaptation is a problem of immense importance in computer vision. Previous approaches showcase the inability of even deep neural networks to learn informative representations across domain shift. This problem is more severe for tasks where acquiring hand labeled data is extremely hard and tedious. In this work, we focus on adapting the representations learned by segmentation networks across synthetic and real domains. Contrary to previous approaches that use a simple adversarial objective or superpixel information to aid the process, we propose an approach based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) that brings the embeddings closer in the learned feature space. To showcase the generality and scalability of our approach, we show that we can achieve state of the art results on two challenging scenarios of synthetic to real domain adaptation. Additional exploratory experiments show that our approach: (1) generalizes to unseen domains and (2) results in improved alignment of source and target distributions."
Transferable Semi-supervised Semantic Segmentation,"The performance of deep learning based semantic segmentation models heavily depends on sufficient data with careful annotations. However, even the largest public datasets only provide samples with pixel-level annotations for rather limited semantic categories. Such data scarcity critically limits scalability and applicability of semantic segmentation models in real applications. In this paper, we propose a novel transferable semi-supervised semantic segmentation model that can transfer the learned segmentation knowledge from a few strong categories with pixel-level annotations to unseen weak categories with only image-level annotations, significantly broadening the applicable territory of deep segmentation models. In particular, the proposed model consists of two complementary and learnable components: a Label transfer Network (L-Net) and a Prediction transfer Network (P-Net). The L-Net learns to transfer the segmentation knowledge from strong categories to the images in the weak categories and produces coarse pixel-level semantic maps, by effectively exploiting the similar appearance shared across categories. Meanwhile, the P-Net tailors the transferred knowledge through a carefully designed adversarial learning strategy and produces refined segmentation results with better details. Integrating the L-Net and P-Net achieves 96.5% and 89.4% performance of the fully-supervised baseline using 50% and 0% categories with pixel-level annotations respectively on PASCAL VOC 2012. With such a novel transfer mechanism, our proposed model is easily generalizable to a variety of new categories, only requiring image-level annotations, and offers appealing scalability in real applications."
Squeeze-SegNet: A new fast Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Semantic Segmentation,"The recent researches in Deep Convolutional Neural Network have focused their attention on improving accuracy that provide significant advances. However, if they were limited to classification tasks, nowadays with contributions from Scientific Communities who are embarking in this field, they have become very useful in higher level tasks such as object detection and pixel-wise semantic segmentation. Thus, brilliant ideas in the field of semantic segmentation with deep learning have completed the state of the art of accuracy, however this architectures become very difficult to apply in embedded systems as is the case for autonomous driving. We present a new Deep fully Convolutional Neural Network for pixel-wise semantic segmentation which we call Squeeze-SegNet. The architecture is based on Encoder-Decoder style. We use a SqueezeNet-like encoder and a decoder formed by our proposed squeeze-decoder module and upsample layer using downsample indices like in SegNet and we add a deconvolution layer to provide final multi-channel feature map. On datasets like Camvid or City-states, our net gets SegNet-level accuracy with less than 10 times fewer parameters than SegNet."
Investigating the feature collection for semantic segmentation via single skip connection,"Since the study of deep convolutional neural network became prevalent, one of the important discoveries is that a feature map from a convolutional network can be extracted before going into the fully connected layer and can be used as a saliency map for object detection. Furthermore, the model can use features from each different layer for accurate object detection: the features from different layers can have different properties. As the model goes deeper, it has many latent skip connections and feature maps to elaborate object detection. Although there are many intermediate layers that we can use for semantic segmentation through skip connection, still the characteristics of each skip connection and the best skip connection for this task are uncertain. Therefore, in this study, we exhaustively research skip connections of state-of-the-art deep convolutional networks and investigate the characteristics of the features from each intermediate layer. In addition, this study would suggest how to use a recent deep neural network model for semantic segmentation and it would therefore become a cornerstone for later studies with the state-of-the-art network models."
Rethinking Convolutional Semantic Segmentation Learning,"Deep convolutional semantic segmentation (DCSS) learning doesn't converge to an optimal local minimum with random parameters initializations; a pre-trained model on the same domain becomes necessary to achieve convergence.In this work, we propose a joint cooperative end-to-end learning method for DCSS. It addresses many drawbacks with existing deep semantic segmentation learning; the proposed approach simultaneously learn both segmentation and classification; taking away the essential need of the pre-trained model for learning convergence. We present an improved inception based architecture with partial attention gating (PAG) over encoder information. The PAG also adds to achieve faster convergence and better accuracy for segmentation task. We will show the effectiveness of this learning on a diabetic retinopathy classification and segmentation dataset."
SEGCloud: Semantic Segmentation of 3D Point Clouds,"3D semantic scene labeling is fundamental to agents operating in the real world. In particular, labeling raw 3D point sets from sensors provides fine-grained semantics. Recent works leverage the capabilities of Neural Networks (NNs), but are limited to coarse voxel predictions and do not explicitly enforce global consistency. We present SEGCloud, an end-to-end framework to obtain 3D point-level segmentation that combines the advantages of NNs, trilinear interpolation(TI) and fully connected Conditional Random Fields (FC-CRF). Coarse voxel predictions from a 3D Fully Convolutional NN are transferred back to the raw 3D points via trilinear interpolation. Then the FC-CRF enforces global consistency and provides fine-grained semantics on the points. We implement the latter as a differentiable Recurrent NN to allow joint optimization. We evaluate the framework on two indoor and two outdoor 3D datasets (NYU V2, S3DIS, KITTI, Semantic3D.net), and show performance comparable or superior to the state-of-the-art on all datasets."
Hierarchical semantic segmentation using modular convolutional neural networks,"Image recognition tasks that involve identifying parts of an object or the contents of a vessel can be viewed as a hierarchical problem, which can be solved by initial recognition of the main object, followed by recognition of its parts or contents. To achieve such modular recognition, it is necessary to use the output of one recognition method (which identifies the general object) as the input for a second method (which identifies the parts or contents). In recent years, convolutional neural networks have emerged as the dominant method for segmentation and classification of images. This work examines a method for serially connecting convolutional neural networks for semantic segmentation of materials inside transparent vessels. It applies one fully convolutional neural net to segment the image into vessel and background, and the vessel region is used as an input for a second net which recognizes the contents of the glass vessel. Transferring the segmentation map generated by the first nets to the second net was performed using the valve filter attention method that involves using different filters on different segments of the image. This modular semantic segmentation method outperforms a single step method in which both the vessel and its contents are identified using a single net. An advantage of the modular neural net is that it allows networks to be built from existing trained modules, as well the transfer and reuse of trained net modules without the need for any retraining of the assembled net."
Semantic Segmentation from Limited Training Data,"We present our approach for robotic perception in cluttered scenes that led to winning the recent Amazon Robotics Challenge (ARC) 2017. Next to small objects with shiny and transparent surfaces, the biggest challenge of the 2017 competition was the introduction of unseen categories. In contrast to traditional approaches which require large collections of annotated data and many hours of training, the task here was to obtain a robust perception pipeline with only few minutes of data acquisition and training time. To that end, we present two strategies that we explored. One is a deep metric learning approach that works in three separate steps: semantic-agnostic boundary detection, patch classification and pixel-wise voting. The other is a fully-supervised semantic segmentation approach with efficient dataset collection. We conduct an extensive analysis of the two methods on our ARC 2017 dataset. Interestingly, only few examples of each class are sufficient to fine-tune even very deep convolutional neural networks for this specific task."
Real-time Semantic Segmentation of Crop and Weed for Precision Agriculture Robots Leveraging Background Knowledge in CNNs,"Precision farming robots, which target to reduce the amount of herbicides that need to be brought out in the fields, must have the ability to identify crops and weeds in real time to trigger weeding actions. In this paper, we address the problem of CNN-based semantic segmentation of crop fields separating sugar beet plants, weeds, and background solely based on RGB data. We propose a CNN that exploits existing vegetation indexes and provides a classification in real time. Furthermore, it can be effectively re-trained to so far unseen fields with a comparably small amount of training data. We implemented and thoroughly evaluated our system on a real agricultural robot operating in different fields in Germany and Switzerland. The results show that our system generalizes well, can operate at around 20Hz, and is suitable for online operation in the fields."
One-Shot Learning for Semantic Segmentation,"Low-shot learning methods for image classification support learning from sparse data. We extend these techniques to support dense semantic image segmentation. Specifically, we train a network that, given a small set of annotated images, produces parameters for a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN). We use this FCN to perform dense pixel-level prediction on a test image for the new semantic class. Our architecture shows a 25% relative meanIoU improvement compared to the best baseline methods for one-shot segmentation on unseen classes in the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset and is at least 3 times faster."
An Adaptive Sampling Scheme to Efficiently Train Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation,"Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown excellent performance in object recognition tasks and dense classification problems such as semantic segmentation. However, training deep neural networks on large and sparse datasets is still challenging and can require large amounts of computation and memory. In this work, we address the task of performing semantic segmentation on large data sets, such as three-dimensional medical images. We propose an adaptive sampling scheme that uses a-posterior error maps, generated throughout training, to focus sampling on difficult regions, resulting in improved learning. Our contribution is threefold: 1) We give a detailed description of the proposed sampling algorithm to speed up and improve learning performance on large images. We propose a deep dual path CNN that captures information at fine and coarse scales, resulting in a network with a large field of view and high resolution outputs. We show that our method is able to attain new state-of-the-art results on the VISCERAL Anatomy benchmark."
Learning Dilation Factors for Semantic Segmentation of Street Scenes,"Contextual information is crucial for semantic segmentation. However, finding the optimal trade-off between keeping desired fine details and at the same time providing sufficiently large receptive fields is non trivial. This is even more so, when objects or classes present in an image significantly vary in size. Dilated convolutions have proven valuable for semantic segmentation, because they allow to increase the size of the receptive field without sacrificing image resolution. However, in current state-of-the-art methods, dilation parameters are hand-tuned and fixed. In this paper, we present an approach for learning dilation parameters adaptively per channel, consistently improving semantic segmentation results on street-scene datasets like Cityscapes and Camvid."
Dataset Augmentation with Synthetic Images Improves Semantic Segmentation,"Although Deep Convolutional Neural Networks trained with strong pixel-level annotations have significantly pushed the performance in semantic segmentation, annotation efforts required for the creation of training data remains a roadblock for further improvements. We show that augmentation of the weakly annotated training dataset with synthetic images minimizes both the annotation efforts and also the cost of capturing images with sufficient variety. Evaluation on the PASCAL 2012 validation dataset shows an increase in mean IOU from 52.80% to 55.47% by adding just 100 synthetic images per object class. Our approach is thus a promising solution to the problems of annotation and dataset collection."
Gaussian Filter in CRF Based Semantic Segmentation,"Artificial intelligence is making great changes in academy and industry with the fast development of deep learning, which is a branch of machine learning and statistical learning. Fully convolutional network [1] is the standard model for semantic segmentation. Conditional random fields coded as CNN [2] or RNN [3] and connected with FCN has been successfully applied in object detection [4]. In this paper, we introduce a multi-resolution neural network for FCN and apply Gaussian filter to the extended CRF kernel neighborhood and the label image to reduce the oscillating effect of CRF neural network segmentation, thus achieve higher precision and faster training speed."
Conditional Adversarial Network for Semantic Segmentation of Brain Tumor,"Automated medical image analysis has a significant value in diagnosis and treatment of lesions. Brain tumors segmentation has a special importance and difficulty due to the difference in appearances and shapes of the different tumor regions in magnetic resonance images. Additionally, the data sets are heterogeneous and usually limited in size in comparison with the computer vision problems. The recently proposed adversarial training has shown promising results in generative image modeling. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end trainable architecture for brain tumor semantic segmentation through conditional adversarial training. We exploit conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) and train a semantic segmentation Convolution Neural Network (CNN) along with an adversarial network that discriminates segmentation maps coming from the ground truth or from the segmentation network for BraTS 2017 segmentation task[15, 4, 2, 3]. We also propose an end-to-end trainable CNN for survival day prediction based on deep learning techniques for BraTS 2017 prediction task [15, 4, 2, 3]. The experimental results demonstrate the superior ability of the proposed approach for both tasks. The proposed model achieves on validation data a DICE score, Sensitivity and Specificity respectively 0.68, 0.99 and 0.98 for the whole tumor, regarding online judgment system."
Stacked Deconvolutional Network for Semantic Segmentation,"Recent progress in semantic segmentation has been driven by improving the spatial resolution under Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs). To address this problem, we propose a Stacked Deconvolutional Network (SDN) for semantic segmentation. In SDN, multiple shallow deconvolutional networks, which are called as SDN units, are stacked one by one to integrate contextual information and guarantee the fine recovery of localization information. Meanwhile, inter-unit and intra-unit connections are designed to assist network training and enhance feature fusion since the connections improve the flow of information and gradient propagation throughout the network. Besides, hierarchical supervision is applied during the upsampling process of each SDN unit, which guarantees the discrimination of feature representations and benefits the network optimization. We carry out comprehensive experiments and achieve the new state-of-the-art results on three datasets, including PASCAL VOC 2012, CamVid, GATECH. In particular, our best model without CRF post-processing achieves an intersection-over-union score of 86.6% in the test set."
VQS: Linking Segmentations to Questions and Answers for Supervised Attention in VQA and Question-Focused Semantic Segmentation,"Rich and dense human labeled datasets are among the main enabling factors for the recent advance on vision-language understanding. Many seemingly distant annotations (e.g., semantic segmentation and visual question answering (VQA)) are inherently connected in that they reveal different levels and perspectives of human understandings about the same visual scenes --- and even the same set of images (e.g., of COCO). The popularity of COCO correlates those annotations and tasks. Explicitly linking them up may significantly benefit both individual tasks and the unified vision and language modeling. We present the preliminary work of linking the instance segmentations provided by COCO to the questions and answers (QAs) in the VQA dataset, and name the collected links visual questions and segmentation answers (VQS). They transfer human supervision between the previously separate tasks, offer more effective leverage to existing problems, and also open the door for new research problems and models. We study two applications of the VQS data in this paper: supervised attention for VQA and a novel question-focused semantic segmentation task. For the former, we obtain state-of-the-art results on the VQA real multiple-choice task by simply augmenting the multilayer perceptrons with some attention features that are learned using the segmentation-QA links as explicit supervision. To put the latter in perspective, we study two plausible methods and compare them to an oracle method assuming that the instance segmentations are given at the test stage."
Bringing Background into the Foreground: Making All Classes Equal in Weakly-supervised Video Semantic Segmentation,"Pixel-level annotations are expensive and time-consuming to obtain. Hence, weak supervision using only image tags could have a significant impact in semantic segmentation. Recent years have seen great progress in weakly-supervised semantic segmentation, whether from a single image or from videos. However, most existing methods are designed to handle a single background class. In practical applications, such as autonomous navigation, it is often crucial to reason about multiple background classes. In this paper, we introduce an approach to doing so by making use of classifier heatmaps. We then develop a two-stream deep architecture that jointly leverages appearance and motion, and design a loss based on our heatmaps to train it. Our experiments demonstrate the benefits of our classifier heatmaps and of our two-stream architecture on challenging urban scene datasets and on the YouTube-Objects benchmark, where we obtain state-of-the-art results."
Video Deblurring via Semantic Segmentation and Pixel-Wise Non-Linear Kernel,"Video deblurring is a challenging problem as the blur is complex and usually caused by the combination of camera shakes, object motions, and depth variations. Optical flow can be used for kernel estimation since it predicts motion trajectories. However, the estimates are often inaccurate in complex scenes at object boundaries, which are crucial in kernel estimation. In this paper, we exploit semantic segmentation in each blurry frame to understand the scene contents and use different motion models for image regions to guide optical flow estimation. While existing pixel-wise blur models assume that the blur kernel is the same as optical flow during the exposure time, this assumption does not hold when the motion blur trajectory at a pixel is different from the estimated linear optical flow. We analyze the relationship between motion blur trajectory and optical flow, and present a novel pixel-wise non-linear kernel model to account for motion blur. The proposed blur model is based on the non-linear optical flow, which describes complex motion blur more effectively. Extensive experiments on challenging blurry videos demonstrate the proposed algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods."
Joint Multi-Person Pose Estimation and Semantic Part Segmentation,"Human pose estimation and semantic part segmentation are two complementary tasks in computer vision. In this paper, we propose to solve the two tasks jointly for natural multi-person images, in which the estimated pose provides object-level shape prior to regularize part segments while the part-level segments constrain the variation of pose locations. Specifically, we first train two fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs), namely Pose FCN and Part FCN, to provide initial estimation of pose joint potential and semantic part potential. Then, to refine pose joint location, the two types of potentials are fused with a fully-connected conditional random field (FCRF), where a novel segment-joint smoothness term is used to encourage semantic and spatial consistency between parts and joints. To refine part segments, the refined pose and the original part potential are integrated through a Part FCN, where the skeleton feature from pose serves as additional regularization cues for part segments. Finally, to reduce the complexity of the FCRF, we induce human detection boxes and infer the graph inside each box, making the inference forty times faster.  Since there's no dataset that contains both part segments and pose labels, we extend the PASCAL VOC part dataset with human pose joints and perform extensive experiments to compare our method against several most recent strategies. We show that on this dataset our algorithm surpasses competing methods by a large margin in both tasks."
Semantic Instance Segmentation with a Discriminative Loss Function,"Semantic instance segmentation remains a challenging task. In this work we propose to tackle the problem with a discriminative loss function, operating at the pixel level, that encourages a convolutional network to produce a representation of the image that can easily be clustered into instances with a simple post-processing step. The loss function encourages the network to map each pixel to a point in feature space so that pixels belonging to the same instance lie close together while different instances are separated by a wide margin. Our approach of combining an off-the-shelf network with a principled loss function inspired by a metric learning objective is conceptually simple and distinct from recent efforts in instance segmentation. In contrast to previous works, our method does not rely on object proposals or recurrent mechanisms. A key contribution of our work is to demonstrate that such a simple setup without bells and whistles is effective and can perform on par with more complex methods. Moreover, we show that it does not suffer from some of the limitations of the popular detect-and-segment approaches. We achieve competitive performance on the Cityscapes and CVPPP leaf segmentation benchmarks."
Depth Adaptive Deep Neural Network for Semantic Segmentation,"In this work, we present the depth-adaptive deep neural network using a depth map for semantic segmentation. Typical deep neural networks receive inputs at the predetermined locations regardless of the distance from the camera. This fixed receptive field presents a challenge to generalize the features of objects at various distances in neural networks. Specifically, the predetermined receptive fields are too small at a short distance, and vice versa. To overcome this challenge, we develop a neural network which is able to adapt the receptive field not only for each layer but also for each neuron at the spatial location. To adjust the receptive field, we propose the depth-adaptive multiscale (DaM) convolution layer consisting of the adaptive perception neuron and the in-layer multiscale neuron. The adaptive perception neuron is to adjust the receptive field at each spatial location using the corresponding depth information. The in-layer multiscale neuron is to apply the different size of the receptive field at each feature space to learn features at multiple scales. The proposed DaM convolution is applied to two fully convolutional neural networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed neural networks on the publicly available RGB-D dataset for semantic segmentation and the novel hand segmentation dataset for hand-object interaction. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods without any additional layers or pre/post-processing."
Semantic Instance Labeling Leveraging Hierarchical Segmentation,"Most of the approaches for indoor RGBD semantic la- beling focus on using pixels or superpixels to train a classi- fier. In this paper, we implement a higher level segmentation using a hierarchy of superpixels to obtain a better segmen- tation for training our classifier. By focusing on meaningful segments that conform more directly to objects, regardless of size, we train a random forest of decision trees as a clas- sifier using simple features such as the 3D size, LAB color histogram, width, height, and shape as specified by a his- togram of surface normals. We test our method on the NYU V2 depth dataset, a challenging dataset of cluttered indoor environments. Our experiments using the NYU V2 depth dataset show that our method achieves state of the art re- sults on both a general semantic labeling introduced by the dataset (floor, structure, furniture, and objects) and a more object specific semantic labeling. We show that training a classifier on a segmentation from a hierarchy of super pixels yields better results than training directly on super pixels, patches, or pixels as in previous work."
Occlusion Handling using Semantic Segmentation and Visibility-Based Rendering for Mixed Reality,"Real-time occlusion handling is a major problem in outdoor mixed reality system because it requires great computational cost mainly due to the complexity of the scene. Using only segmentation, it is difficult to accurately render a virtual object occluded by complex objects such as trees, bushes etc. In this paper, we propose a novel occlusion handling method for real-time, outdoor, and omni-directional mixed reality system using only the information from a monocular image sequence. We first present a semantic segmentation scheme for predicting the amount of visibility for different type of objects in the scene. We also simultaneously calculate a foreground probability map using depth estimation derived from optical flow. Finally, we combine the segmentation result and the probability map to render the computer generated object and the real scene using a visibility-based rendering method. Our results show great improvement in handling occlusions compared to existing blending based methods."
Curriculum Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation of Urban Scenes,"During the last half decade, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have triumphed over semantic segmentation, which is one of the core tasks in many applications such as autonomous driving. However, to train CNNs requires a considerable amount of data, which is difficult to collect and laborious to annotate. Recent advances in computer graphics make it possible to train CNNs on photo-realistic synthetic imagery with computer-generated annotations. Despite this, the domain mismatch between the real images and the synthetic data cripples the models' performance. Hence, we propose a curriculum-style learning approach to minimize the domain gap in urban scenery semantic segmentation. The curriculum domain adaptation solves easy tasks first to infer necessary properties about the target domain; in particular, the first task is to learn global label distributions over images and local distributions over landmark superpixels. These are easy to estimate because images of urban scenes have strong idiosyncrasies (e.g., the size and spatial relations of buildings, streets, cars, etc.). We then train a segmentation network while regularizing its predictions in the target domain to follow those inferred properties. In experiments, our method outperforms the baselines on two datasets and two backbone networks. We also report extensive ablation studies about our approach."
Cascaded Scene Flow Prediction using Semantic Segmentation,"Given two consecutive frames from a pair of stereo cameras, 3D scene flow methods simultaneously estimate the 3D geometry and motion of the observed scene. Many existing approaches use superpixels for regularization, but may predict inconsistent shapes and motions inside rigidly moving objects. We instead assume that scenes consist of foreground objects rigidly moving in front of a static background, and use semantic cues to produce pixel-accurate scene flow estimates. Our cascaded classification framework accurately models 3D scenes by iteratively refining semantic segmentation masks, stereo correspondences, 3D rigid motion estimates, and optical flow fields. We evaluate our method on the challenging KITTI autonomous driving benchmark, and show that accounting for the motion of segmented vehicles leads to state-of-the-art performance."
Efficient Yet Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic Segmentation using deep convolutional neural network pose more complex challenge for any GPU intensive task. As it has to compute million of parameters, it results to huge memory consumption. Moreover, extracting finer features and conducting supervised training tends to increase the complexity. With the introduction of Fully Convolutional Neural Network, which uses finer strides and utilizes deconvolutional layers for upsampling, it has been a go to for any image segmentation task. In this paper, we propose two segmentation architecture which not only needs one-third the parameters to compute but also gives better accuracy than the similar architectures. The model weights were transferred from the popular neural net like VGG19 and VGG16 which were trained on Imagenet classification data-set. Then we transform all the fully connected layers to convolutional layers and use dilated convolution for decreasing the parameters. Lastly, we add finer strides and attach four skip architectures which are element-wise summed with the deconvolutional layers in steps. We train and test on different sparse and fine data-sets like Pascal VOC2012, Pascal-Context and NYUDv2 and show how better our model performs in this tasks. On the other hand our model has a faster inference time and consumes less memory for training and testing on NVIDIA Pascal GPUs, making it more efficient and less memory consuming architecture for pixel-wise segmentation."
Residual Conv-Deconv Grid Network for Semantic Segmentation,"This paper presents GridNet, a new Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for semantic image segmentation (full scene labelling). Classical neural networks are implemented as one stream from the input to the output with subsampling operators applied in the stream in order to reduce the feature maps size and to increase the receptive field for the final prediction. However, for semantic image segmentation, where the task consists in providing a semantic class to each pixel of an image, feature maps reduction is harmful because it leads to a resolution loss in the output prediction. To tackle this problem, our GridNet follows a grid pattern allowing multiple interconnected streams to work at different resolutions. We show that our network generalizes many well known networks such as conv-deconv, residual or U-Net networks. GridNet is trained from scratch and achieves competitive results on the Cityscapes dataset."
Towards Semantic Query Segmentation,"Query Segmentation is one of the critical components for understanding users' search intent in Information Retrieval tasks. It involves grouping tokens in the search query into meaningful phrases which help downstream tasks like search relevance and query understanding. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to segment user queries using distributed query embeddings. Our key contribution is a supervised approach to the segmentation task using low-dimensional feature vectors for queries, getting rid of traditional hand tuned and heuristic NLP features which are quite expensive.  We benchmark on a 50,000 human-annotated web search engine query corpus achieving comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art techniques. The advantage of our technique is its fast and does not use external knowledge-base like Wikipedia for score boosting. This helps us generalize our approach to other domains like eCommerce without any fine-tuning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on another 50,000 human-annotated eCommerce query corpus from eBay search logs. Our approach is easy to implement and generalizes well across different search domains proving the power of low-dimensional embeddings in query segmentation task, opening up a new direction of research for this problem."
Semantic Segmentation with Reverse Attention,"Recent development in fully convolutional neural network enables efficient end-to-end learning of semantic segmentation. Traditionally, the convolutional classifiers are taught to learn the representative semantic features of labeled semantic objects. In this work, we propose a reverse attention network (RAN) architecture that trains the network to capture the opposite concept (i.e., what are not associated with a target class) as well. The RAN is a three-branch network that performs the direct, reverse and reverse-attention learning processes simultaneously. Extensive experiments are conducted to show the effectiveness of the RAN in semantic segmentation. Being built upon the DeepLabv2-LargeFOV, the RAN achieves the state-of-the-art mIoU score (48.1%) for the challenging PASCAL-Context dataset. Significant performance improvements are also observed for the PASCAL-VOC, Person-Part, NYUDv2 and ADE20K datasets."
Discovering Class-Specific Pixels for Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"We propose an approach to discover class-specific pixels for the weakly-supervised semantic segmentation task. We show that properly combining saliency and attention maps allows us to obtain reliable cues capable of significantly boosting the performance. First, we propose a simple yet powerful hierarchical approach to discover the class-agnostic salient regions, obtained using a salient object detector, which otherwise would be ignored. Second, we use fully convolutional attention maps to reliably localize the class-specific regions in a given image. We combine these two cues to discover class-specific pixels which are then used as an approximate ground truth for training a CNN. While solving the weakly supervised semantic segmentation task, we ensure that the image-level classification task is also solved in order to enforce the CNN to assign at least one pixel to each object present in the image. Experimentally, on the PASCAL VOC12 val and test sets, we obtain the mIoU of 60.8% and 61.9%, achieving the performance gains of 5.1% and 5.2% compared to the published state-of-the-art results. The code is made publicly available."
Beyond Forward Shortcuts: Fully Convolutional Master-Slave Networks (MSNets) with Backward Skip Connections for Semantic Segmentation,"Recent deep CNNs contain forward shortcut connections; i.e. skip connections from low to high layers. Reusing features from lower layers that have higher resolution (location information) benefit higher layers to recover lost details and mitigate information degradation. However, during inference the lower layers do not know about high layer features, although they contain contextual high semantics that benefit low layers to adaptively extract informative features for later layers. In this paper, we study the influence of backward skip connections which are in the opposite direction to forward shortcuts, i.e. paths from high layers to low layers. To achieve this -- which indeed runs counter to the nature of feed-forward networks -- we propose a new fully convolutional model that consists of a pair of networks. A `Slave' network is dedicated to provide the backward connections from its top layers to the `Master' network's bottom layers. The Master network is used to produce the final label predictions. In our experiments we validate the proposed FCN model on ADE20K (ImageNet scene parsing), PASCAL-Context, and PASCAL VOC 2011 datasets."
LinkNet: Exploiting Encoder Representations for Efficient Semantic Segmentation,"Pixel-wise semantic segmentation for visual scene understanding not only needs to be accurate, but also efficient in order to find any use in real-time application. Existing algorithms even though are accurate but they do not focus on utilizing the parameters of neural network efficiently. As a result they are huge in terms of parameters and number of operations; hence slow too. In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural network architecture which allows it to learn without any significant increase in number of parameters. Our network uses only 11.5 million parameters and 21.2 GFLOPs for processing an image of resolution 3x640x360. It gives state-of-the-art performance on CamVid and comparable results on Cityscapes dataset. We also compare our networks processing time on NVIDIA GPU and embedded system device with existing state-of-the-art architectures for different image resolutions."
"Deep Semantic Segmentation for Automated Driving: Taxonomy, Roadmap and Challenges","Semantic segmentation was seen as a challenging computer vision problem few years ago. Due to recent advancements in deep learning, relatively accurate solutions are now possible for its use in automated driving. In this paper, the semantic segmentation problem is explored from the perspective of automated driving. Most of the current semantic segmentation algorithms are designed for generic images and do not incorporate prior structure and end goal for automated driving. First, the paper begins with a generic taxonomic survey of semantic segmentation algorithms and then discusses how it fits in the context of automated driving. Second, the particular challenges of deploying it into a safety system which needs high level of accuracy and robustness are listed. Third, different alternatives instead of using an independent semantic segmentation module are explored. Finally, an empirical evaluation of various semantic segmentation architectures was performed on CamVid dataset in terms of accuracy and speed. This paper is a preliminary shorter version of a more detailed survey which is work in progress."
Superpixel-based Semantic Segmentation Trained by Statistical Process Control,"Semantic segmentation, like other fields of computer vision, has seen a remarkable performance advance by the use of deep convolution neural networks. However, considering that neighboring pixels are heavily dependent on each other, both learning and testing of these methods have a lot of redundant operations. To resolve this problem, the proposed network is trained and tested with only 0.37% of total pixels by superpixel-based sampling and largely reduced the complexity of upsampling calculation. The hypercolumn feature maps are constructed by pyramid module in combination with the convolution layers of the base network. Since the proposed method uses a very small number of sampled pixels, the end-to-end learning of the entire network is difficult with a common learning rate for all the layers. In order to resolve this problem, the learning rate after sampling is controlled by statistical process control (SPC) of gradients in each layer. The proposed method performs better than or equal to the conventional methods that use much more samples on Pascal Context, SUN-RGBD dataset."
Frame-Semantic Parsing with Softmax-Margin Segmental RNNs and a Syntactic Scaffold,"We present a new, efficient frame-semantic parser that labels semantic arguments to FrameNet predicates. Built using an extension to the segmental RNN that emphasizes recall, our basic system achieves competitive performance without any calls to a syntactic parser. We then introduce a method that uses phrase-syntactic annotations from the Penn Treebank during training only, through a multitask objective; no parsing is required at training or test time. This ""syntactic scaffold"" offers a cheaper alternative to traditional syntactic pipelining, and achieves state-of-the-art performance."
Rethinking Atrous Convolution for Semantic Image Segmentation,"In this work, we revisit atrous convolution, a powerful tool to explicitly adjust filter's field-of-view as well as control the resolution of feature responses computed by Deep Convolutional Neural Networks, in the application of semantic image segmentation. To handle the problem of segmenting objects at multiple scales, we design modules which employ atrous convolution in cascade or in parallel to capture multi-scale context by adopting multiple atrous rates. Furthermore, we propose to augment our previously proposed Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling module, which probes convolutional features at multiple scales, with image-level features encoding global context and further boost performance. We also elaborate on implementation details and share our experience on training our system. The proposed `DeepLabv3' system significantly improves over our previous DeepLab versions without DenseCRF post-processing and attains comparable performance with other state-of-art models on the PASCAL VOC 2012 semantic image segmentation benchmark."
Incorporating Network Built-in Priors in Weakly-supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Pixel-level annotations are expensive and time consuming to obtain. Hence, weak supervision using only image tags could have a significant impact in semantic segmentation. Recently, CNN-based methods have proposed to fine-tune pre-trained networks using image tags. Without additional information, this leads to poor localization accuracy. This problem, however, was alleviated by making use of objectness priors to generate foreground/background masks. Unfortunately these priors either require pixel-level annotations/bounding boxes, or still yield inaccurate object boundaries. Here, we propose a novel method to extract accurate masks from networks pre-trained for the task of object recognition, thus forgoing external objectness modules. We first show how foreground/background masks can be obtained from the activations of higher-level convolutional layers of a network. We then show how to obtain multi-class masks by the fusion of foreground/background ones with information extracted from a weakly-supervised localization network. Our experiments evidence that exploiting these masks in conjunction with a weakly-supervised training loss yields state-of-the-art tag-based weakly-supervised semantic segmentation results."
BiSeg: Simultaneous Instance Segmentation and Semantic Segmentation with Fully Convolutional Networks,"We present a simple and effective framework for simultaneous semantic segmentation and instance segmentation with Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs). The method, called BiSeg, predicts instance segmentation as a posterior in Bayesian inference, where semantic segmentation is used as a prior. We extend the idea of position-sensitive score maps used in recent methods to a fusion of multiple score maps at different scales and partition modes, and adopt it as a robust likelihood for instance segmentation inference. As both Bayesian inference and map fusion are performed per pixel, BiSeg is a fully convolutional end-to-end solution that inherits all the advantages of FCNs. We demonstrate state-of-the-art instance segmentation accuracy on PASCAL VOC."
Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation Based on Web Image Co-segmentation,"Training a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) for semantic segmentation requires a large number of masks with pixel level labelling, which involves a large amount of human labour and time for annotation. In contrast, web images and their image-level labels are much easier and cheaper to obtain. In this work, we propose a novel method for weakly supervised semantic segmentation with only image-level labels. The method utilizes the internet to retrieve a large number of images and uses a large scale co-segmentation framework to generate masks for the retrieved images. We first retrieve images from search engines, e.g. Flickr and Google, using semantic class names as queries, e.g. class names in the dataset PASCAL VOC 2012. We then use high quality masks produced by co-segmentation on the retrieved images as well as the target dataset images with image level labels to train segmentation networks. We obtain an IoU score of 56.9 on test set of PASCAL VOC 2012, which reaches the state-of-the-art performance."
Incorporating Depth into both CNN and CRF for Indoor Semantic Segmentation,"To improve segmentation performance, a novel neural network architecture (termed DFCN-DCRF) is proposed, which combines an RGB-D fully convolutional neural network (DFCN) with a depth-sensitive fully-connected conditional random field (DCRF). First, a DFCN architecture which fuses depth information into the early layers and applies dilated convolution for later contextual reasoning is designed. Then, a depth-sensitive fully-connected conditional random field (DCRF) is proposed and combined with the previous DFCN to refine the preliminary result. Comparative experiments show that the proposed DFCN-DCRF has the best performance compared with most state-of-the-art methods."
Deep Projective 3D Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds is a challenging problem with numerous real-world applications. While deep learning has revolutionized the field of image semantic segmentation, its impact on point cloud data has been limited so far. Recent attempts, based on 3D deep learning approaches (3D-CNNs), have achieved below-expected results. Such methods require voxelizations of the underlying point cloud data, leading to decreased spatial resolution and increased memory consumption. Additionally, 3D-CNNs greatly suffer from the limited availability of annotated datasets.  In this paper, we propose an alternative framework that avoids the limitations of 3D-CNNs. Instead of directly solving the problem in 3D, we first project the point cloud onto a set of synthetic 2D-images. These images are then used as input to a 2D-CNN, designed for semantic segmentation. Finally, the obtained prediction scores are re-projected to the point cloud to obtain the segmentation results. We further investigate the impact of multiple modalities, such as color, depth and surface normals, in a multi-stream network architecture. Experiments are performed on the recent Semantic3D dataset. Our approach sets a new state-of-the-art by achieving a relative gain of 7.9 %, compared to the previous best approach."
Improving Facial Attribute Prediction using Semantic Segmentation,"Attributes are semantically meaningful characteristics whose applicability widely crosses category boundaries. They are particularly important in describing and recognizing concepts where no explicit training example is given, \textit{e.g., zero-shot learning}. Additionally, since attributes are human describable, they can be used for efficient human-computer interaction. In this paper, we propose to employ semantic segmentation to improve facial attribute prediction. The core idea lies in the fact that many facial attributes describe local properties. In other words, the probability of an attribute to appear in a face image is far from being uniform in the spatial domain. We build our facial attribute prediction model jointly with a deep semantic segmentation network. This harnesses the localization cues learned by the semantic segmentation to guide the attention of the attribute prediction to the regions where different attributes naturally show up. As a result of this approach, in addition to recognition, we are able to localize the attributes, despite merely having access to image level labels (weak supervision) during training. We evaluate our proposed method on CelebA and LFWA datasets and achieve superior results to the prior arts. Furthermore, we show that in the reverse problem, semantic face parsing improves when facial attributes are available. That reaffirms the need to jointly model these two interconnected tasks."
ICNet for Real-Time Semantic Segmentation on High-Resolution Images,"We focus on the challenging task of real-time semantic segmentation in this paper. It finds many practical applications and yet is with fundamental difficulty of reducing a large portion of computation for pixel-wise label inference. We propose an image cascade network (ICNet) that incorporates multi-resolution branches under proper label guidance to address this challenge. We provide in-depth analysis of our framework and introduce the cascade feature fusion unit to quickly achieve high-quality segmentation. Our system yields real-time inference on a single GPU card with decent quality results evaluated on challenging datasets like Cityscapes, CamVid and COCO-Stuff."
Joint Semantic and Motion Segmentation for dynamic scenes using Deep Convolutional Networks,"Dynamic scene understanding is a challenging problem and motion segmentation plays a crucial role in solving it. Incorporating semantics and motion enhances the overall perception of the dynamic scene. For applications of outdoor robotic navigation, joint learning methods have not been extensively used for extracting spatio-temporal features or adding different priors into the formulation. The task becomes even more challenging without stereo information being incorporated. This paper proposes an approach to fuse semantic features and motion clues using CNNs, to address the problem of monocular semantic motion segmentation. We deduce semantic and motion labels by integrating optical flow as a constraint with semantic features into dilated convolution network. The pipeline consists of three main stages i.e Feature extraction, Feature amplification and Multi Scale Context Aggregation to fuse the semantics and flow features. Our joint formulation shows significant improvements in monocular motion segmentation over the state of the art methods on challenging KITTI tracking dataset."
A Review on Deep Learning Techniques Applied to Semantic Segmentation,"Image semantic segmentation is more and more being of interest for computer vision and machine learning researchers. Many applications on the rise need accurate and efficient segmentation mechanisms: autonomous driving, indoor navigation, and even virtual or augmented reality systems to name a few. This demand coincides with the rise of deep learning approaches in almost every field or application target related to computer vision, including semantic segmentation or scene understanding. This paper provides a review on deep learning methods for semantic segmentation applied to various application areas. Firstly, we describe the terminology of this field as well as mandatory background concepts. Next, the main datasets and challenges are exposed to help researchers decide which are the ones that best suit their needs and their targets. Then, existing methods are reviewed, highlighting their contributions and their significance in the field. Finally, quantitative results are given for the described methods and the datasets in which they were evaluated, following up with a discussion of the results. At last, we point out a set of promising future works and draw our own conclusions about the state of the art of semantic segmentation using deep learning techniques."
Universal Adversarial Perturbations Against Semantic Image Segmentation,"While deep learning is remarkably successful on perceptual tasks, it was also shown to be vulnerable to adversarial perturbations of the input. These perturbations denote noise added to the input that was generated specifically to fool the system while being quasi-imperceptible for humans. More severely, there even exist universal perturbations that are input-agnostic but fool the network on the majority of inputs. While recent work has focused on image classification, this work proposes attacks against semantic image segmentation: we present an approach for generating (universal) adversarial perturbations that make the network yield a desired target segmentation as output. We show empirically that there exist barely perceptible universal noise patterns which result in nearly the same predicted segmentation for arbitrary inputs. Furthermore, we also show the existence of universal noise which removes a target class (e.g., all pedestrians) from the segmentation while leaving the segmentation mostly unchanged otherwise."
Reformulating Level Sets as Deep Recurrent Neural Network Approach to Semantic Segmentation,"Variational Level Set (LS) has been a widely used method in medical segmentation. However, it is limited when dealing with multi-instance objects in the real world. In addition, its segmentation results are quite sensitive to initial settings and highly depend on the number of iterations. To address these issues and boost the classic variational LS methods to a new level of the learnable deep learning approaches, we propose a novel definition of contour evolution named Recurrent Level Set (RLS)} to employ Gated Recurrent Unit under the energy minimization of a variational LS functional. The curve deformation process in RLS is formed as a hidden state evolution procedure and updated by minimizing an energy functional composed of fitting forces and contour length. By sharing the convolutional features in a fully end-to-end trainable framework, we extend RLS to Contextual RLS (CRLS) to address semantic segmentation in the wild. The experimental results have shown that our proposed RLS improves both computational time and segmentation accuracy against the classic variations LS-based method, whereas the fully end-to-end system CRLS achieves competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art semantic segmentation approaches."
Loss Max-Pooling for Semantic Image Segmentation,"We introduce a novel loss max-pooling concept for handling imbalanced training data distributions, applicable as alternative loss layer in the context of deep neural networks for semantic image segmentation. Most real-world semantic segmentation datasets exhibit long tail distributions with few object categories comprising the majority of data and consequently biasing the classifiers towards them. Our method adaptively re-weights the contributions of each pixel based on their observed losses, targeting under-performing classification results as often encountered for under-represented object classes. Our approach goes beyond conventional cost-sensitive learning attempts through adaptive considerations that allow us to indirectly address both, inter- and intra-class imbalances. We provide a theoretical justification of our approach, complementary to experimental analyses on benchmark datasets. In our experiments on the Cityscapes and Pascal VOC 2012 segmentation datasets we find consistently improved results, demonstrating the efficacy of our approach."
Semantically-Guided Video Object Segmentation,"This paper tackles the problem of semi-supervised video object segmentation, that is, segmenting an object in a sequence given its mask in the first frame. One of the main challenges in this scenario is the change of appearance of the objects of interest. Their semantics, on the other hand, do not vary. This paper investigates how to take advantage of such invariance via the introduction of a semantic prior that guides the appearance model. Specifically, given the segmentation mask of the first frame of a sequence, we estimate the semantics of the object of interest, and propagate that knowledge throughout the sequence to improve the results based on an appearance model. We present Semantically-Guided Video Object Segmentation (SGV), which improves results over previous state of the art on two different datasets using a variety of evaluation metrics, while running in half a second per frame."
Not All Pixels Are Equal: Difficulty-aware Semantic Segmentation via Deep Layer Cascade,"We propose a novel deep layer cascade (LC) method to improve the accuracy and speed of semantic segmentation. Unlike the conventional model cascade (MC) that is composed of multiple independent models, LC treats a single deep model as a cascade of several sub-models. Earlier sub-models are trained to handle easy and confident regions, and they progressively feed-forward harder regions to the next sub-model for processing. Convolutions are only calculated on these regions to reduce computations. The proposed method possesses several advantages. First, LC classifies most of the easy regions in the shallow stage and makes deeper stage focuses on a few hard regions. Such an adaptive and 'difficulty-aware' learning improves segmentation performance. Second, LC accelerates both training and testing of deep network thanks to early decisions in the shallow stage. Third, in comparison to MC, LC is an end-to-end trainable framework, allowing joint learning of all sub-models. We evaluate our method on PASCAL VOC and Cityscapes datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance and fast speed."
Semantic Instance Segmentation via Deep Metric Learning,"We propose a new method for semantic instance segmentation, by first computing how likely two pixels are to belong to the same object, and then by grouping similar pixels together. Our similarity metric is based on a deep, fully convolutional embedding model. Our grouping method is based on selecting all points that are sufficiently similar to a set of ""seed points"", chosen from a deep, fully convolutional scoring model. We show competitive results on the Pascal VOC instance segmentation benchmark."
LabelBank: Revisiting Global Perspectives for Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation requires a detailed labeling of image pixels by object category. Information derived from local image patches is necessary to describe the detailed shape of individual objects. However, this information is ambiguous and can result in noisy labels. Global inference of image content can instead capture the general semantic concepts present. We advocate that holistic inference of image concepts provides valuable information for detailed pixel labeling. We propose a generic framework to leverage holistic information in the form of a LabelBank for pixel-level segmentation.  We show the ability of our framework to improve semantic segmentation performance in a variety of settings. We learn models for extracting a holistic LabelBank from visual cues, attributes, and/or textual descriptions. We demonstrate improvements in semantic segmentation accuracy on standard datasets across a range of state-of-the-art segmentation architectures and holistic inference approaches."
Semi and Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation Using Generative Adversarial Network,"Semantic segmentation has been a long standing challenging task in computer vision. It aims at assigning a label to each image pixel and needs significant number of pixellevel annotated data, which is often unavailable. To address this lack, in this paper, we leverage, on one hand, massive amount of available unlabeled or weakly labeled data, and on the other hand, non-real images created through Generative Adversarial Networks. In particular, we propose a semi-supervised framework ,based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which consists of a generator network to provide extra training examples to a multi-class classifier, acting as discriminator in the GAN framework, that assigns sample a label y from the K possible classes or marks it as a fake sample (extra class). The underlying idea is that adding large fake visual data forces real samples to be close in the feature space, enabling a bottom-up clustering process, which, in turn, improves multiclass pixel classification. To ensure higher quality of generated images for GANs with consequent improved pixel classification, we extend the above framework by adding weakly annotated data, i.e., we provide class level information to the generator. We tested our approaches on several challenging benchmarking visual datasets, i.e. PASCAL, SiftFLow, Stanford and CamVid, achieving competitive performance also compared to state-of-the-art semantic segmentation method"
Adversarial Examples for Semantic Segmentation and Object Detection,"It has been well demonstrated that adversarial examples, i.e., natural images with visually imperceptible perturbations added, generally exist for deep networks to fail on image classification. In this paper, we extend adversarial examples to semantic segmentation and object detection which are much more difficult. Our observation is that both segmentation and detection are based on classifying multiple targets on an image (e.g., the basic target is a pixel or a receptive field in segmentation, and an object proposal in detection), which inspires us to optimize a loss function over a set of pixels/proposals for generating adversarial perturbations. Based on this idea, we propose a novel algorithm named Dense Adversary Generation (DAG), which generates a large family of adversarial examples, and applies to a wide range of state-of-the-art deep networks for segmentation and detection. We also find that the adversarial perturbations can be transferred across networks with different training data, based on different architectures, and even for different recognition tasks. In particular, the transferability across networks with the same architecture is more significant than in other cases. Besides, summing up heterogeneous perturbations often leads to better transfer performance, which provides an effective method of black-box adversarial attack."
Object Region Mining with Adversarial Erasing: A Simple Classification to Semantic Segmentation Approach,"We investigate a principle way to progressively mine discriminative object regions using classification networks to address the weakly-supervised semantic segmentation problems. Classification networks are only responsive to small and sparse discriminative regions from the object of interest, which deviates from the requirement of the segmentation task that needs to localize dense, interior and integral regions for pixel-wise inference. To mitigate this gap, we propose a new adversarial erasing approach for localizing and expanding object regions progressively. Starting with a single small object region, our proposed approach drives the classification network to sequentially discover new and complement object regions by erasing the current mined regions in an adversarial manner. These localized regions eventually constitute a dense and complete object region for learning semantic segmentation. To further enhance the quality of the discovered regions by adversarial erasing, an online prohibitive segmentation learning approach is developed to collaborate with adversarial erasing by providing auxiliary segmentation supervision modulated by the more reliable classification scores. Despite its apparent simplicity, the proposed approach achieves 55.0% and 55.7% mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) scores on PASCAL VOC 2012 val and test sets, which are the new state-of-the-arts."
Self corrective Perturbations for Semantic Segmentation and Classification,"Convolutional Neural Networks have been a subject of great importance over the past decade and great strides have been made in their utility for producing state of the art performance in many computer vision problems. However, the behavior of deep networks is yet to be fully understood and is still an active area of research. In this work, we present an intriguing behavior: pre-trained CNNs can be made to improve their predictions by structurally perturbing the input. We observe that these perturbations - referred as Guided Perturbations - enable a trained network to improve its prediction performance without any learning or change in network weights. We perform various ablative experiments to understand how these perturbations affect the local context and feature representations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this idea can improve performance of several existing approaches on semantic segmentation and scene labeling tasks on the PASCAL VOC dataset and supervised classification tasks on MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets."
Predicting Deeper into the Future of Semantic Segmentation,"The ability to predict and therefore to anticipate the future is an important attribute of intelligence. It is also of utmost importance in real-time systems, e.g. in robotics or autonomous driving, which depend on visual scene understanding for decision making. While prediction of the raw RGB pixel values in future video frames has been studied in previous work, here we introduce the novel task of predicting semantic segmentations of future frames. Given a sequence of video frames, our goal is to predict segmentation maps of not yet observed video frames that lie up to a second or further in the future. We develop an autoregressive convolutional neural network that learns to iteratively generate multiple frames. Our results on the Cityscapes dataset show that directly predicting future segmentations is substantially better than predicting and then segmenting future RGB frames. Prediction results up to half a second in the future are visually convincing and are much more accurate than those of a baseline based on warping semantic segmentations using optical flow."
Algorithms for Semantic Segmentation of Multispectral Remote Sensing Imagery using Deep Learning,"Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have been used to achieve state-of-the-art performance on many computer vision tasks (e.g., object recognition, object detection, semantic segmentation) thanks to a large repository of annotated image data. Large labeled datasets for other sensor modalities, e.g., multispectral imagery (MSI), are not available due to the large cost and manpower required. In this paper, we adapt state-of-the-art DCNN frameworks in computer vision for semantic segmentation for MSI imagery. To overcome label scarcity for MSI data, we substitute real MSI for generated synthetic MSI in order to initialize a DCNN framework. We evaluate our network initialization scheme on the new RIT-18 dataset that we present in this paper. This dataset contains very-high resolution MSI collected by an unmanned aircraft system. The models initialized with synthetic imagery were less prone to over-fitting and provide a state-of-the-art baseline for future work."
LesionSeg: Semantic segmentation of skin lesions using Deep Convolutional Neural Network,"We present a method for skin lesion segmentation for the ISIC 2017 Skin Lesion Segmentation Challenge. Our approach is based on a Fully Convolutional Network architecture which is trained end to end, from scratch, on a limited dataset. Our semantic segmentation architecture utilizes several recent innovations in particularly in the combined use of (i) use of atrous convolutions to increase the effective field of view of the network's receptive field without increasing the number of parameters, (ii) the use of network-in-network 1\times1 convolution layers to add capacity to the network and (iii) state-of-art super-resolution upsampling of predictions using subpixel CNN layers. We reported a mean IOU score of 0.642 on the validation set provided by the organisers."
"End-to-end semantic face segmentation with conditional random fields as convolutional, recurrent and adversarial networks","Recent years have seen a sharp increase in the number of related yet distinct advances in semantic segmentation. Here, we tackle this problem by leveraging the respective strengths of these advances. That is, we formulate a conditional random field over a four-connected graph as end-to-end trainable convolutional and recurrent networks, and estimate them via an adversarial process. Importantly, our model learns not only unary potentials but also pairwise potentials, while aggregating multi-scale contexts and controlling higher-order inconsistencies. We evaluate our model on two standard benchmark datasets for semantic face segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art results on both of them."
Large Kernel Matters -- Improve Semantic Segmentation by Global Convolutional Network,"One of recent trends [30, 31, 14] in network architec- ture design is stacking small filters (e.g., 1x1 or 3x3) in the entire network because the stacked small filters is more ef- ficient than a large kernel, given the same computational complexity. However, in the field of semantic segmenta- tion, where we need to perform dense per-pixel prediction, we find that the large kernel (and effective receptive field) plays an important role when we have to perform the clas- sification and localization tasks simultaneously. Following our design principle, we propose a Global Convolutional Network to address both the classification and localization issues for the semantic segmentation. We also suggest a residual-based boundary refinement to further refine the ob- ject boundaries. Our approach achieves state-of-art perfor- mance on two public benchmarks and significantly outper- forms previous results, 82.2% (vs 80.2%) on PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset and 76.9% (vs 71.8%) on Cityscapes dataset."
High-Resolution Multispectral Dataset for Semantic Segmentation,"Unmanned aircraft have decreased the cost required to collect remote sensing imagery, which has enabled researchers to collect high-spatial resolution data from multiple sensor modalities more frequently and easily. The increase in data will push the need for semantic segmentation frameworks that are able to classify non-RGB imagery, but this type of algorithmic development requires an increase in publicly available benchmark datasets with class labels. In this paper, we introduce a high-resolution multispectral dataset with image labels. This new benchmark dataset has been pre-split into training/testing folds in order to standardize evaluation and continue to push state-of-the-art classification frameworks for non-RGB imagery."
SegICP: Integrated Deep Semantic Segmentation and Pose Estimation,"Recent robotic manipulation competitions have highlighted that sophisticated robots still struggle to achieve fast and reliable perception of task-relevant objects in complex, realistic scenarios. To improve these systems' perceptive speed and robustness, we present SegICP, a novel integrated solution to object recognition and pose estimation. SegICP couples convolutional neural networks and multi-hypothesis point cloud registration to achieve both robust pixel-wise semantic segmentation as well as accurate and real-time 6-DOF pose estimation for relevant objects. Our architecture achieves 1cm position error and <5^\circ$ angle error in real time without an initial seed. We evaluate and benchmark SegICP against an annotated dataset generated by motion capture."
Adversarial Examples for Semantic Image Segmentation,"Machine learning methods in general and Deep Neural Networks in particular have shown to be vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. So far this phenomenon has mainly been studied in the context of whole-image classification. In this contribution, we analyse how adversarial perturbations can affect the task of semantic segmentation. We show how existing adversarial attackers can be transferred to this task and that it is possible to create imperceptible adversarial perturbations that lead a deep network to misclassify almost all pixels of a chosen class while leaving network prediction nearly unchanged outside this class."
Label Refinement Network for Coarse-to-Fine Semantic Segmentation,We consider the problem of semantic image segmentation using deep convolutional neural networks. We propose a novel network architecture called the label refinement network that predicts segmentation labels in a coarse-to-fine fashion at several resolutions. The segmentation labels at a coarse resolution are used together with convolutional features to obtain finer resolution segmentation labels. We define loss functions at several stages in the network to provide supervisions at different stages. Our experimental results on several standard datasets demonstrate that the proposed model provides an effective way of producing pixel-wise dense image labeling.
Understanding Convolution for Semantic Segmentation,"Recent advances in deep learning, especially deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have led to significant improvement over previous semantic segmentation systems. Here we show how to improve pixel-wise semantic segmentation by manipulating convolution-related operations that are of both theoretical and practical value. First, we design dense upsampling convolution (DUC) to generate pixel-level prediction, which is able to capture and decode more detailed information that is generally missing in bilinear upsampling. Second, we propose a hybrid dilated convolution (HDC) framework in the encoding phase. This framework 1) effectively enlarges the receptive fields (RF) of the network to aggregate global information; 2) alleviates what we call the ""gridding issue"" caused by the standard dilated convolution operation. We evaluate our approaches thoroughly on the Cityscapes dataset, and achieve a state-of-art result of 80.1% mIOU in the test set at the time of submission. We also have achieved state-of-the-art overall on the KITTI road estimation benchmark and the PASCAL VOC2012 segmentation task. Our source code can be found at https://github.com/TuSimple/TuSimple-DUC ."
Analyzing Modular CNN Architectures for Joint Depth Prediction and Semantic Segmentation,"This paper addresses the task of designing a modular neural network architecture that jointly solves different tasks. As an example we use the tasks of depth estimation and semantic segmentation given a single RGB image. The main focus of this work is to analyze the cross-modality influence between depth and semantic prediction maps on their joint refinement. While most previous works solely focus on measuring improvements in accuracy, we propose a way to quantify the cross-modality influence. We show that there is a relationship between final accuracy and cross-modality influence, although not a simple linear one. Hence a larger cross-modality influence does not necessarily translate into an improved accuracy. We find that a beneficial balance between the cross-modality influences can be achieved by network architecture and conjecture that this relationship can be utilized to understand different network design choices. Towards this end we propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture that fuses the state of the state-of-the-art results for depth estimation and semantic labeling. By balancing the cross-modality influences between depth and semantic prediction, we achieve improved results for both tasks using the NYU-Depth v2 benchmark."
Progressively Diffused Networks for Semantic Image Segmentation,"This paper introduces Progressively Diffused Networks (PDNs) for unifying multi-scale context modeling with deep feature learning, by taking semantic image segmentation as an exemplar application. Prior neural networks, such as ResNet, tend to enhance representational power by increasing the depth of architectures and driving the training objective across layers. However, we argue that spatial dependencies in different layers, which generally represent the rich contexts among data elements, are also critical to building deep and discriminative representations. To this end, our PDNs enables to progressively broadcast information over the learned feature maps by inserting a stack of information diffusion layers, each of which exploits multi-dimensional convolutional LSTMs (Long-Short-Term Memory Structures). In each LSTM unit, a special type of atrous filters are designed to capture the short range and long range dependencies from various neighbors to a certain site of the feature map and pass the accumulated information to the next layer. From the extensive experiments on semantic image segmentation benchmarks (e.g., ImageNet Parsing, PASCAL VOC2012 and PASCAL-Part), our framework demonstrates the effectiveness to substantially improve the performances over the popular existing neural network models, and achieves state-of-the-art on ImageNet Parsing for large scale semantic segmentation."
The Ciona17 Dataset for Semantic Segmentation of Invasive Species in a Marine Aquaculture Environment,"An original dataset for semantic segmentation, Ciona17, is introduced, which to the best of the authors' knowledge, is the first dataset of its kind with pixel-level annotations pertaining to invasive species in a marine environment. Diverse outdoor illumination, a range of object shapes, colour, and severe occlusion provide a significant real world challenge for the computer vision community. An accompanying ground-truthing tool for superpixel labeling, Truth and Crop, is also introduced. Finally, we provide a baseline using a variant of Fully Convolutional Networks, and report results in terms of the standard mean intersection over union (mIoU) metric."
MORSE: Semantic-ally Drive-n MORpheme SEgment-er,"We present in this paper a novel framework for morpheme segmentation which uses the morpho-syntactic regularities preserved by word representations, in addition to orthographic features, to segment words into morphemes. This framework is the first to consider vocabulary-wide syntactico-semantic information for this task. We also analyze the deficiencies of available benchmarking datasets and introduce our own dataset that was created on the basis of compositionality. We validate our algorithm across datasets and present state-of-the-art results."
Learning Multi-level Region Consistency with Dense Multi-label Networks for Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic image segmentation is a fundamental task in image understanding. Per-pixel semantic labelling of an image benefits greatly from the ability to consider region consistency both locally and globally. However, many Fully Convolutional Network based methods do not impose such consistency, which may give rise to noisy and implausible predictions. We address this issue by proposing a dense multi-label network module that is able to encourage the region consistency at different levels. This simple but effective module can be easily integrated into any semantic segmentation systems. With comprehensive experiments, we show that the dense multi-label can successfully remove the implausible labels and clear the confusion so as to boost the performance of semantic segmentation systems."
"A New Convolutional Network-in-Network Structure and Its Applications in Skin Detection, Semantic Segmentation, and Artifact Reduction","The inception network has been shown to provide good performance on image classification problems, but there are not much evidences that it is also effective for the image restoration or pixel-wise labeling problems. For image restoration problems, the pooling is generally not used because the decimated features are not helpful for the reconstruction of an image as the output. Moreover, most deep learning architectures for the restoration problems do not use dense prediction that need lots of training parameters. From these observations, for enjoying the performance of inception-like structure on the image based problems we propose a new convolutional network-in-network structure. The proposed network can be considered a modification of inception structure where pool projection and pooling layer are removed for maintaining the entire feature map size, and a larger kernel filter is added instead. Proposed network greatly reduces the number of parameters on account of removed dense prediction and pooling, which is an advantage, but may also reduce the receptive field in each layer. Hence, we add a larger kernel than the original inception structure for not increasing the depth of layers. The proposed structure is applied to typical image-to-image learning problems, i.e., the problems where the size of input and output are same such as skin detection, semantic segmentation, and compression artifacts reduction. Extensive experiments show that the proposed network brings comparable or better results than the state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks for these problems."
Son of Zorn's Lemma: Targeted Style Transfer Using Instance-aware Semantic Segmentation,"Style transfer is an important task in which the style of a source image is mapped onto that of a target image. The method is useful for synthesizing derivative works of a particular artist or specific painting. This work considers targeted style transfer, in which the style of a template image is used to alter only part of a target image. For example, an artist may wish to alter the style of only one particular object in a target image without altering the object's general morphology or surroundings. This is useful, for example, in augmented reality applications (such as the recently released Pokemon GO), where one wants to alter the appearance of a single real-world object in an image frame to make it appear as a cartoon. Most notably, the rendering of real-world objects into cartoon characters has been used in a number of films and television show, such as the upcoming series Son of Zorn. We present a method for targeted style transfer that simultaneously segments and stylizes single objects selected by the user. The method uses a Markov random field model to smooth and anti-alias outlier pixels near object boundaries, so that stylized objects naturally blend into their surroundings."
Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation using Web-Crawled Videos,"We propose a novel algorithm for weakly supervised semantic segmentation based on image-level class labels only. In weakly supervised setting, it is commonly observed that trained model overly focuses on discriminative parts rather than the entire object area. Our goal is to overcome this limitation with no additional human intervention by retrieving videos relevant to target class labels from web repository, and generating segmentation labels from the retrieved videos to simulate strong supervision for semantic segmentation. During this process, we take advantage of image classification with discriminative localization technique to reject false alarms in retrieved videos and identify relevant spatio-temporal volumes within retrieved videos. Although the entire procedure does not require any additional supervision, the segmentation annotations obtained from videos are sufficiently strong to learn a model for semantic segmentation. The proposed algorithm substantially outperforms existing methods based on the same level of supervision and is even as competitive as the approaches relying on extra annotations."
Semantic Video Segmentation by Gated Recurrent Flow Propagation,"Semantic video segmentation is challenging due to the sheer amount of data that needs to be processed and labeled in order to construct accurate models. In this paper we present a deep, end-to-end trainable methodology to video segmentation that is capable of leveraging information present in unlabeled data in order to improve semantic estimates. Our model combines a convolutional architecture and a spatio-temporal transformer recurrent layer that are able to temporally propagate labeling information by means of optical flow, adaptively gated based on its locally estimated uncertainty. The flow, the recognition and the gated temporal propagation modules can be trained jointly, end-to-end. The temporal, gated recurrent flow propagation component of our model can be plugged into any static semantic segmentation architecture and turn it into a weakly supervised video processing one. Our extensive experiments in the challenging CityScapes and Camvid datasets, and based on multiple deep architectures, indicate that the resulting model can leverage unlabeled temporal frames, next to a labeled one, in order to improve both the video segmentation accuracy and the consistency of its temporal labeling, at no additional annotation cost and with little extra computation."
End-to-End Pedestrian Collision Warning System based on a Convolutional Neural Network with Semantic Segmentation,"Traditional pedestrian collision warning systems sometimes raise alarms even when there is no danger (e.g., when all pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk). These false alarms can make it difficult for drivers to concentrate on their driving. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for an end-to-end pedestrian collision warning system based on a convolutional neural network. Semantic segmentation information is used to train the convolutional neural network and two loss functions, such as cross entropy and Euclidean losses, are minimized. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in reducing false alarms and increasing warning accuracy compared to a traditional histogram of oriented gradients (HoG)-based system."
Feedback Neural Network for Weakly Supervised Geo-Semantic Segmentation,"Learning from weakly-supervised data is one of the main challenges in machine learning and computer vision, especially for tasks such as image semantic segmentation where labeling is extremely expensive and subjective. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network architecture to perform weakly-supervised learning by suppressing irrelevant neuron activations. It localizes objects of interest by learning from image-level categorical labels in an end-to-end manner. We apply this algorithm to a practical challenge of transforming satellite images into a map of settlements and individual buildings. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves superior performance and efficiency when compared with various baseline models."
Bottom-Up Top-Down Cues for Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"We consider the task of learning a classifier for semantic segmentation using weak supervision in the form of image labels which specify the object classes present in the image. Our method uses deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and adopts an Expectation-Maximization (EM) based approach. We focus on the following three aspects of EM: (i) initialization; (ii) latent posterior estimation (E-step) and (iii) the parameter update (M-step). We show that saliency and attention maps, our bottom-up and top-down cues respectively, of simple images provide very good cues to learn an initialization for the EM-based algorithm. Intuitively, we show that before trying to learn to segment complex images, it is much easier and highly effective to first learn to segment a set of simple images and then move towards the complex ones. Next, in order to update the parameters, we propose minimizing the combination of the standard softmax loss and the KL divergence between the true latent posterior and the likelihood given by the CNN. We argue that this combination is more robust to wrong predictions made by the expectation step of the EM method. We support this argument with empirical and visual results. Extensive experiments and discussions show that: (i) our method is very simple and intuitive; (ii) requires only image-level labels; and (iii) consistently outperforms other weakly-supervised state-of-the-art methods with a very high margin on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset."
Diverse Sampling for Self-Supervised Learning of Semantic Segmentation,"We propose an approach for learning category-level semantic segmentation purely from image-level classification tags indicating presence of categories. It exploits localization cues that emerge from training classification-tasked convolutional networks, to drive a ""self-supervision"" process that automatically labels a sparse, diverse training set of points likely to belong to classes of interest. Our approach has almost no hyperparameters, is modular, and allows for very fast training of segmentation in less than 3 minutes. It obtains competitive results on the VOC 2012 segmentation benchmark. More, significantly the modularity and fast training of our framework allows new classes to efficiently added for inference."
Classification With an Edge: Improving Semantic Image Segmentation with Boundary Detection,"We present an end-to-end trainable deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) for semantic segmentation with built-in awareness of semantically meaningful boundaries. Semantic segmentation is a fundamental remote sensing task, and most state-of-the-art methods rely on DCNNs as their workhorse. A major reason for their success is that deep networks learn to accumulate contextual information over very large windows (receptive fields). However, this success comes at a cost, since the associated loss of effecive spatial resolution washes out high-frequency details and leads to blurry object boundaries. Here, we propose to counter this effect by combining semantic segmentation with semantically informed edge detection, thus making class-boundaries explicit in the model, First, we construct a comparatively simple, memory-efficient model by adding boundary detection to the Segnet encoder-decoder architecture. Second, we also include boundary detection in FCN-type models and set up a high-end classifier ensemble. We show that boundary detection significantly improves semantic segmentation with CNNs. Our high-end ensemble achieves > 90% overall accuracy on the ISPRS Vaihingen benchmark."
Training Bit Fully Convolutional Network for Fast Semantic Segmentation,"Fully convolutional neural networks give accurate, per-pixel prediction for input images and have applications like semantic segmentation. However, a typical FCN usually requires lots of floating point computation and large run-time memory, which effectively limits its usability. We propose a method to train Bit Fully Convolution Network (BFCN), a fully convolutional neural network that has low bit-width weights and activations. Because most of its computation-intensive convolutions are accomplished between low bit-width numbers, a BFCN can be accelerated by an efficient bit-convolution implementation. On CPU, the dot product operation between two bit vectors can be reduced to bitwise operations and popcounts, which can offer much higher throughput than 32-bit multiplications and additions.  To validate the effectiveness of BFCN, we conduct experiments on the PASCAL VOC 2012 semantic segmentation task and Cityscapes. Our BFCN with 1-bit weights and 2-bit activations, which runs 7.8x faster on CPU or requires less than 1\% resources on FPGA, can achieve comparable performance as the 32-bit counterpart."
The One Hundred Layers Tiramisu: Fully Convolutional DenseNets for Semantic Segmentation,"State-of-the-art approaches for semantic image segmentation are built on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The typical segmentation architecture is composed of (a) a downsampling path responsible for extracting coarse semantic features, followed by (b) an upsampling path trained to recover the input image resolution at the output of the model and, optionally, (c) a post-processing module (e.g. Conditional Random Fields) to refine the model predictions.  Recently, a new CNN architecture, Densely Connected Convolutional Networks (DenseNets), has shown excellent results on image classification tasks. The idea of DenseNets is based on the observation that if each layer is directly connected to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion then the network will be more accurate and easier to train.  In this paper, we extend DenseNets to deal with the problem of semantic segmentation. We achieve state-of-the-art results on urban scene benchmark datasets such as CamVid and Gatech, without any further post-processing module nor pretraining. Moreover, due to smart construction of the model, our approach has much less parameters than currently published best entries for these datasets.  Code to reproduce the experiments is available here : https://github.com/SimJeg/FC-DenseNet/blob/master/train.py"
Improving Fully Convolution Network for Semantic Segmentation,"Fully Convolution Networks (FCN) have achieved great success in dense prediction tasks including semantic segmentation. In this paper, we start from discussing FCN by understanding its architecture limitations in building a strong segmentation network. Next, we present our Improved Fully Convolution Network (IFCN). In contrast to FCN, IFCN introduces a context network that progressively expands the receptive fields of feature maps. In addition, dense skip connections are added so that the context network can be effectively optimized. More importantly, these dense skip connections enable IFCN to fuse rich-scale context to make reliable predictions. Empirically, those architecture modifications are proven to be significant to enhance the segmentation performance. Without engaging any contextual post-processing, IFCN significantly advances the state-of-the-arts on ADE20K (ImageNet scene parsing), Pascal Context, Pascal VOC 2012 and SUN-RGBD segmentation datasets."
Did Evolution get it right? An evaluation of Near-Infrared imaging in semantic scene segmentation using deep learning,"Animals have evolved to restrict their sensing capabilities to certain region of electromagnetic spectrum. This is surprisingly a very narrow band on a vast scale which makes one think if there is a systematic bias underlying such selective filtration. The situation becomes even more intriguing when we find a sharp cutoff point at Near-infrared point whereby almost all animal vision systems seem to have a lower bound. This brings us to an interesting question: did evolution ""intentionally"" performed such a restriction in order to evolve higher visual cognition? In this work this question is addressed by experimenting with Near-infrared images for their potential applicability in higher visual processing such as semantic segmentation. A modified version of Fully Convolutional Networks are trained on NIR images and RGB images respectively and compared for their respective effectiveness in the wake of semantic segmentation. The results from the experiments show that visible part of the spectrum alone is sufficient for the robust semantic segmentation of the indoor as well as outdoor scenes."
Semantic Segmentation using Adversarial Networks,Adversarial training has been shown to produce state of the art results for generative image modeling. In this paper we propose an adversarial training approach to train semantic segmentation models. We train a convolutional semantic segmentation network along with an adversarial network that discriminates segmentation maps coming either from the ground truth or from the segmentation network. The motivation for our approach is that it can detect and correct higher-order inconsistencies between ground truth segmentation maps and the ones produced by the segmentation net. Our experiments show that our adversarial training approach leads to improved accuracy on the Stanford Background and PASCAL VOC 2012 datasets.
Full-Resolution Residual Networks for Semantic Segmentation in Street Scenes,"Semantic image segmentation is an essential component of modern autonomous driving systems, as an accurate understanding of the surrounding scene is crucial to navigation and action planning. Current state-of-the-art approaches in semantic image segmentation rely on pre-trained networks that were initially developed for classifying images as a whole. While these networks exhibit outstanding recognition performance (i.e., what is visible?), they lack localization accuracy (i.e., where precisely is something located?). Therefore, additional processing steps have to be performed in order to obtain pixel-accurate segmentation masks at the full image resolution. To alleviate this problem we propose a novel ResNet-like architecture that exhibits strong localization and recognition performance. We combine multi-scale context with pixel-level accuracy by using two processing streams within our network: One stream carries information at the full image resolution, enabling precise adherence to segment boundaries. The other stream undergoes a sequence of pooling operations to obtain robust features for recognition. The two streams are coupled at the full image resolution using residuals. Without additional processing steps and without pre-training, our approach achieves an intersection-over-union score of 71.8% on the Cityscapes dataset."
Recalling Holistic Information for Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation requires a detailed labeling of image pixels by object category. Information derived from local image patches is necessary to describe the detailed shape of individual objects. However, this information is ambiguous and can result in noisy labels. Global inference of image content can instead capture the general semantic concepts present. We advocate that high-recall holistic inference of image concepts provides valuable information for detailed pixel labeling. We build a two-stream neural network architecture that facilitates information flow from holistic information to local pixels, while keeping common image features shared among the low-level layers of both the holistic analysis and segmentation branches. We empirically evaluate our network on four standard semantic segmentation datasets. Our network obtains state-of-the-art performance on PASCAL-Context and NYUDv2, and ablation studies verify its effectiveness on ADE20K and SIFT-Flow."
Fully Convolutional Instance-aware Semantic Segmentation,"We present the first fully convolutional end-to-end solution for instance-aware semantic segmentation task. It inherits all the merits of FCNs for semantic segmentation and instance mask proposal. It performs instance mask prediction and classification jointly. The underlying convolutional representation is fully shared between the two sub-tasks, as well as between all regions of interest. The proposed network is highly integrated and achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and efficiency. It wins the COCO 2016 segmentation competition by a large margin. Code would be released at \url{https://github.com/daijifeng001/TA-FCN}."
RefineNet: Multi-Path Refinement Networks for High-Resolution Semantic Segmentation,"Recently, very deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown outstanding performance in object recognition and have also been the first choice for dense classification problems such as semantic segmentation. However, repeated subsampling operations like pooling or convolution striding in deep CNNs lead to a significant decrease in the initial image resolution. Here, we present RefineNet, a generic multi-path refinement network that explicitly exploits all the information available along the down-sampling process to enable high-resolution prediction using long-range residual connections. In this way, the deeper layers that capture high-level semantic features can be directly refined using fine-grained features from earlier convolutions. The individual components of RefineNet employ residual connections following the identity mapping mindset, which allows for effective end-to-end training. Further, we introduce chained residual pooling, which captures rich background context in an efficient manner. We carry out comprehensive experiments and set new state-of-the-art results on seven public datasets. In particular, we achieve an intersection-over-union score of 83.4 on the challenging PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset, which is the best reported result to date."
Chinese/English mixed Character Segmentation as Semantic Segmentation,"OCR character segmentation for multilingual printed documents is difficult due to the diversity of different linguistic characters. Previous approaches mainly focus on monolingual texts and are not suitable for multilingual-lingual cases. In this work, we particularly tackle the Chinese/English mixed case by reframing it as a semantic segmentation problem. We take advantage of the successful architecture called fully convolutional networks (FCN) in the field of semantic segmentation. Given a wide enough receptive field, FCN can utilize the necessary context around a horizontal position to determinate whether this is a splitting point or not. As a deep neural architecture, FCN can automatically learn useful features from raw text line images. Although trained on synthesized samples with simulated random disturbance, our FCN model generalizes well to real-world samples. The experimental results show that our model significantly outperforms the previous methods."
Mixed context networks for semantic segmentation,"Semantic segmentation is challenging as it requires both object-level information and pixel-level accuracy. Recently, FCN-based systems gained great improvement in this area. Unlike classification networks, combining features of different layers plays an important role in these dense prediction models, as these features contains information of different levels. A number of models have been proposed to show how to use these features. However, what is the best architecture to make use of features of different layers is still a question. In this paper, we propose a module, called mixed context network, and show that our presented system outperforms most existing semantic segmentation systems by making use of this module."
PCA-aided Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation of Multi-channel fMRI,"Semantic segmentation of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) makes great sense for pathology diagnosis and decision system of medical robots. The multi-channel fMRI provides more information of the pathological features. But the increased amount of data causes complexity in feature detections. This paper proposes a principal component analysis (PCA)-aided fully convolutional network to particularly deal with multi-channel fMRI. We transfer the learned weights of contemporary classification networks to the segmentation task by fine-tuning. The results of the convolutional network are compared with various methods e.g. k-NN. A new labeling strategy is proposed to solve the semantic segmentation problem with unclear boundaries. Even with a small-sized training dataset, the test results demonstrate that our model outperforms other pathological feature detection methods. Besides, its forward inference only takes 90 milliseconds for a single set of fMRI data. To our knowledge, this is the first time to realize pixel-wise labeling of multi-channel magnetic resonance image using FCN."
Exploiting Depth from Single Monocular Images for Object Detection and Semantic Segmentation,"Augmenting RGB data with measured depth has been shown to improve the performance of a range of tasks in computer vision including object detection and semantic segmentation. Although depth sensors such as the Microsoft Kinect have facilitated easy acquisition of such depth information, the vast majority of images used in vision tasks do not contain depth information. In this paper, we show that augmenting RGB images with estimated depth can also improve the accuracy of both object detection and semantic segmentation. Specifically, we first exploit the recent success of depth estimation from monocular images and learn a deep depth estimation model. Then we learn deep depth features from the estimated depth and combine with RGB features for object detection and semantic segmentation. Additionally, we propose an RGB-D semantic segmentation method which applies a multi-task training scheme: semantic label prediction and depth value regression. We test our methods on several datasets and demonstrate that incorporating information from estimated depth improves the performance of object detection and semantic segmentation remarkably."
Can Ground Truth Label Propagation from Video help Semantic Segmentation?,"For state-of-the-art semantic segmentation task, training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) requires dense pixelwise ground truth (GT) labeling, which is expensive and involves extensive human effort. In this work, we study the possibility of using auxiliary ground truth, so-called \textit{pseudo ground truth} (PGT) to improve the performance. The PGT is obtained by propagating the labels of a GT frame to its subsequent frames in the video using a simple CRF-based, cue integration framework. Our main contribution is to demonstrate the use of noisy PGT along with GT to improve the performance of a CNN. We perform a systematic analysis to find the right kind of PGT that needs to be added along with the GT for training a CNN. In this regard, we explore three aspects of PGT which influence the learning of a CNN: i) the PGT labeling has to be of good quality; ii) the PGT images have to be different compared to the GT images; iii) the PGT has to be trusted differently than GT. We conclude that PGT which is diverse from GT images and has good quality of labeling can indeed help improve the performance of a CNN. Also, when PGT is multiple folds larger than GT, weighing down the trust on PGT helps in improving the accuracy. Finally, We show that using PGT along with GT, the performance of Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) on Camvid data is increased by 2.7\% on IoU accuracy. We believe such an approach can be used to train CNNs for semantic video segmentation where sequentially labeled image frames are needed. To this end, we provide recommendations for using PGT strategically for semantic segmentation and hence bypass the need for extensive human efforts in labeling."
A CNN Cascade for Landmark Guided Semantic Part Segmentation,"This paper proposes a CNN cascade for semantic part segmentation guided by pose-specific information encoded in terms of a set of landmarks (or keypoints). There is large amount of prior work on each of these tasks separately, yet, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time in literature that the interplay between pose estimation and semantic part segmentation is investigated. To address this limitation of prior work, in this paper, we propose a CNN cascade of tasks that firstly performs landmark localisation and then uses this information as input for guiding semantic part segmentation. We applied our architecture to the problem of facial part segmentation and report large performance improvement over the standard unguided network on the most challenging face datasets. Testing code and models will be published online at http://cs.nott.ac.uk/~psxasj/."
CNN-aware Binary Map for General Semantic Segmentation,In this paper we introduce a novel method for general semantic segmentation that can benefit from general semantics of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Our segmentation proposes visually and semantically coherent image segments. We use binary encoding of CNN features to overcome the difficulty of the clustering on the high-dimensional CNN feature space. These binary codes are very robust against noise and non-semantic changes in the image. These binary encoding can be embedded into the CNN as an extra layer at the end of the network. This results in real-time segmentation. To the best of our knowledge our method is the first attempt on general semantic image segmentation using CNN. All the previous papers were limited to few number of category of the images (e.g. PASCAL VOC). Experiments show that our segmentation algorithm outperform the state-of-the-art non-semantic segmentation methods by large margin.
Deep Structured Features for Semantic Segmentation,"We propose a highly structured neural network architecture for semantic segmentation with an extremely small model size, suitable for low-power embedded and mobile platforms. Specifically, our architecture combines i) a Haar wavelet-based tree-like convolutional neural network (CNN), ii) a random layer realizing a radial basis function kernel approximation, and iii) a linear classifier. While stages i) and ii) are completely pre-specified, only the linear classifier is learned from data. We apply the proposed architecture to outdoor scene and aerial image semantic segmentation and show that the accuracy of our architecture is competitive with conventional pixel classification CNNs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the proposed architecture is data efficient in the sense of matching the accuracy of pixel classification CNNs when trained on a much smaller data set."
Semantic Segmentation of Earth Observation Data Using Multimodal and Multi-scale Deep Networks,"This work investigates the use of deep fully convolutional neural networks (DFCNN) for pixel-wise scene labeling of Earth Observation images. Especially, we train a variant of the SegNet architecture on remote sensing data over an urban area and study different strategies for performing accurate semantic segmentation. Our contributions are the following: 1) we transfer efficiently a DFCNN from generic everyday images to remote sensing images; 2) we introduce a multi-kernel convolutional layer for fast aggregation of predictions at multiple scales; 3) we perform data fusion from heterogeneous sensors (optical and laser) using residual correction. Our framework improves state-of-the-art accuracy on the ISPRS Vaihingen 2D Semantic Labeling dataset."
Built-in Foreground/Background Prior for Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Pixel-level annotations are expensive and time consuming to obtain. Hence, weak supervision using only image tags could have a significant impact in semantic segmentation. Recently, CNN-based methods have proposed to fine-tune pre-trained networks using image tags. Without additional information, this leads to poor localization accuracy. This problem, however, was alleviated by making use of objectness priors to generate foreground/background masks. Unfortunately these priors either require training pixel-level annotations/bounding boxes, or still yield inaccurate object boundaries. Here, we propose a novel method to extract markedly more accurate masks from the pre-trained network itself, forgoing external objectness modules. This is accomplished using the activations of the higher-level convolutional layers, smoothed by a dense CRF. We demonstrate that our method, based on these masks and a weakly-supervised loss, outperforms the state-of-the-art tag-based weakly-supervised semantic segmentation techniques. Furthermore, we introduce a new form of inexpensive weak supervision yielding an additional accuracy boost."
STFCN: Spatio-Temporal FCN for Semantic Video Segmentation,"This paper presents a novel method to involve both spatial and temporal features for semantic video segmentation. Current work on convolutional neural networks(CNNs) has shown that CNNs provide advanced spatial features supporting a very good performance of solutions for both image and video analysis, especially for the semantic segmentation task. We investigate how involving temporal features also has a good effect on segmenting video data. We propose a module based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture of a recurrent neural network for interpreting the temporal characteristics of video frames over time. Our system takes as input frames of a video and produces a correspondingly-sized output; for segmenting the video our method combines the use of three components: First, the regional spatial features of frames are extracted using a CNN; then, using LSTM the temporal features are added; finally, by deconvolving the spatio-temporal features we produce pixel-wise predictions. Our key insight is to build spatio-temporal convolutional networks (spatio-temporal CNNs) that have an end-to-end architecture for semantic video segmentation. We adapted fully some known convolutional network architectures (such as FCN-AlexNet and FCN-VGG16), and dilated convolution into our spatio-temporal CNNs. Our spatio-temporal CNNs achieve state-of-the-art semantic segmentation, as demonstrated for the Camvid and NYUDv2 datasets."
Clockwork Convnets for Video Semantic Segmentation,"Recent years have seen tremendous progress in still-image segmentation; however the naïve application of these state-of-the-art algorithms to every video frame requires considerable computation and ignores the temporal continuity inherent in video. We propose a video recognition framework that relies on two key observations: 1) while pixels may change rapidly from frame to frame, the semantic content of a scene evolves more slowly, and 2) execution can be viewed as an aspect of architecture, yielding purpose-fit computation schedules for networks. We define a novel family of ""clockwork"" convnets driven by fixed or adaptive clock signals that schedule the processing of different layers at different update rates according to their semantic stability. We design a pipeline schedule to reduce latency for real-time recognition and a fixed-rate schedule to reduce overall computation. Finally, we extend clockwork scheduling to adaptive video processing by incorporating data-driven clocks that can be tuned on unlabeled video. The accuracy and efficiency of clockwork convnets are evaluated on the Youtube-Objects, NYUD, and Cityscapes video datasets."
Learning Common and Specific Features for RGB-D Semantic Segmentation with Deconvolutional Networks,"In this paper, we tackle the problem of RGB-D semantic segmentation of indoor images. We take advantage of deconvolutional networks which can predict pixel-wise class labels, and develop a new structure for deconvolution of multiple modalities. We propose a novel feature transformation network to bridge the convolutional networks and deconvolutional networks. In the feature transformation network, we correlate the two modalities by discovering common features between them, as well as characterize each modality by discovering modality specific features. With the common features, we not only closely correlate the two modalities, but also allow them to borrow features from each other to enhance the representation of shared information. With specific features, we capture the visual patterns that are only visible in one modality. The proposed network achieves competitive segmentation accuracy on NYU depth dataset V1 and V2."
Approximate Policy Iteration for Budgeted Semantic Video Segmentation,"This paper formulates and presents a solution to the new problem of budgeted semantic video segmentation. Given a video, the goal is to accurately assign a semantic class label to every pixel in the video within a specified time budget. Typical approaches to such labeling problems, such as Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), focus on maximizing accuracy but do not provide a principled method for satisfying a time budget. For video data, the time required by CRF and related methods is often dominated by the time to compute low-level descriptors of supervoxels across the video. Our key contribution is the new budgeted inference framework for CRF models that intelligently selects the most useful subsets of descriptors to run on subsets of supervoxels within the time budget. The objective is to maintain an accuracy as close as possible to the CRF model with no time bound, while remaining within the time budget. Our second contribution is the algorithm for learning a policy for the sparse selection of supervoxels and their descriptors for budgeted CRF inference. This learning algorithm is derived by casting our problem in the framework of Markov Decision Processes, and then instantiating a state-of-the-art policy learning algorithm known as Classification-Based Approximate Policy Iteration. Our experiments on multiple video datasets show that our learning approach and framework is able to significantly reduce computation time, and maintain competitive accuracy under varying budgets."
Joint Optical Flow and Temporally Consistent Semantic Segmentation,"The importance and demands of visual scene understanding have been steadily increasing along with the active development of autonomous systems. Consequently, there has been a large amount of research dedicated to semantic segmentation and dense motion estimation. In this paper, we propose a method for jointly estimating optical flow and temporally consistent semantic segmentation, which closely connects these two problem domains and leverages each other. Semantic segmentation provides information on plausible physical motion to its associated pixels, and accurate pixel-level temporal correspondences enhance the accuracy of semantic segmentation in the temporal domain. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach on the KITTI benchmark, where we observe performance gains for flow and segmentation. We achieve state-of-the-art optical flow results, and outperform all published algorithms by a large margin on challenging, but crucial dynamic objects."
Region-based semantic segmentation with end-to-end training,"We propose a novel method for semantic segmentation, the task of labeling each pixel in an image with a semantic class. Our method combines the advantages of the two main competing paradigms. Methods based on region classification offer proper spatial support for appearance measurements, but typically operate in two separate stages, none of which targets pixel labeling performance at the end of the pipeline. More recent fully convolutional methods are capable of end-to-end training for the final pixel labeling, but resort to fixed patches as spatial support. We show how to modify modern region-based approaches to enable end-to-end training for semantic segmentation. This is achieved via a differentiable region-to-pixel layer and a differentiable free-form Region-of-Interest pooling layer. Our method improves the state-of-the-art in terms of class-average accuracy with 64.0% on SIFT Flow and 49.9% on PASCAL Context, and is particularly accurate at object boundaries."
A Local-Global Approach to Semantic Segmentation in Aerial Images,"Aerial images are often taken under poor lighting conditions and contain low resolution objects, many times occluded by other objects. In this domain, visual context could be of great help, but there are still very few papers that consider context in aerial image understanding and still remains an open problem in computer vision. We propose a dual-stream deep neural network that processes information along two independent pathways. Our model learns to combine local and global appearance in a complementary way, such that together form a powerful classifier. We test our dual-stream network on the task of buildings segmentation in aerial images and obtain state-of-the-art results on the Massachusetts Buildings Dataset. We study the relative importance of local appearance versus the larger scene, as well as their performance in combination on three new buildings datasets. We clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of visual context in conjunction with deep neural networks for aerial image understanding."
Can we unify monocular detectors for autonomous driving by using the pixel-wise semantic segmentation of CNNs?,"Autonomous driving is a challenging topic that requires complex solutions in perception tasks such as recognition of road, lanes, traffic signs or lights, vehicles and pedestrians. Through years of research, computer vision has grown capable of tackling these tasks with monocular detectors that can provide remarkable detection rates with relatively low processing times. However, the recent appearance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has revolutionized the computer vision field and has made possible approaches to perform full pixel-wise semantic segmentation in times close to real time (even on hardware that can be carried on a vehicle). In this paper, we propose to use full image segmentation as an approach to simplify and unify most of the detection tasks required in the perception module of an autonomous vehicle, analyzing major concerns such as computation time and detection performance."
Deep Learning Markov Random Field for Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation tasks can be well modeled by Markov Random Field (MRF). This paper addresses semantic segmentation by incorporating high-order relations and mixture of label contexts into MRF. Unlike previous works that optimized MRFs using iterative algorithm, we solve MRF by proposing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), namely Deep Parsing Network (DPN), which enables deterministic end-to-end computation in a single forward pass. Specifically, DPN extends a contemporary CNN to model unary terms and additional layers are devised to approximate the mean field (MF) algorithm for pairwise terms. It has several appealing properties. First, different from the recent works that required many iterations of MF during back-propagation, DPN is able to achieve high performance by approximating one iteration of MF. Second, DPN represents various types of pairwise terms, making many existing models as its special cases. Furthermore, pairwise terms in DPN provide a unified framework to encode rich contextual information in high-dimensional data, such as images and videos. Third, DPN makes MF easier to be parallelized and speeded up, thus enabling efficient inference. DPN is thoroughly evaluated on standard semantic image/video segmentation benchmarks, where a single DPN model yields state-of-the-art segmentation accuracies on PASCAL VOC 2012, Cityscapes dataset and CamVid dataset."
Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation for Weakly Labeled Semantic Video Object Segmentation,"Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been immensely successful in many high-level computer vision tasks given large labeled datasets. However, for video semantic object segmentation, a domain where labels are scarce, effectively exploiting the representation power of CNN with limited training data remains a challenge. Simply borrowing the existing pretrained CNN image recognition model for video segmentation task can severely hurt performance. We propose a semi-supervised approach to adapting CNN image recognition model trained from labeled image data to the target domain exploiting both semantic evidence learned from CNN, and the intrinsic structures of video data. By explicitly modeling and compensating for the domain shift from the source domain to the target domain, this proposed approach underpins a robust semantic object segmentation method against the changes in appearance, shape and occlusion in natural videos. We present extensive experiments on challenging datasets that demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared with the state-of-the-art methods."
ENet: A Deep Neural Network Architecture for Real-Time Semantic Segmentation,"The ability to perform pixel-wise semantic segmentation in real-time is of paramount importance in mobile applications. Recent deep neural networks aimed at this task have the disadvantage of requiring a large number of floating point operations and have long run-times that hinder their usability. In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural network architecture named ENet (efficient neural network), created specifically for tasks requiring low latency operation. ENet is up to 18\times faster, requires 75\times less FLOPs, has 79\times less parameters, and provides similar or better accuracy to existing models. We have tested it on CamVid, Cityscapes and SUN datasets and report on comparisons with existing state-of-the-art methods, and the trade-offs between accuracy and processing time of a network. We present performance measurements of the proposed architecture on embedded systems and suggest possible software improvements that could make ENet even faster."
Better Image Segmentation by Exploiting Dense Semantic Predictions,"It is well accepted that image segmentation can benefit from utilizing multilevel cues. The paper focuses on utilizing the FCNN-based dense semantic predictions in the bottom-up image segmentation, arguing to take semantic cues into account from the very beginning. By this we can avoid merging regions of similar appearance but distinct semantic categories as possible. The semantic inefficiency problem is handled. We also propose a straightforward way to use the contour cues to suppress the noise in multilevel cues, thus to improve the segmentation robustness. The evaluation on the BSDS500 shows that we obtain the competitive region and boundary performance. Furthermore, since all individual regions can be assigned with appropriate semantic labels during the computation, we are capable of extracting the adjusted semantic segmentations. The experiment on Pascal VOC 2012 shows our improvement to the original semantic segmentations which derives directly from the dense predictions."
Reinforcement Learning for Semantic Segmentation in Indoor Scenes,"Future advancements in robot autonomy and sophistication of robotics tasks rest on robust, efficient, and task-dependent semantic understanding of the environment. Semantic segmentation is the problem of simultaneous segmentation and categorization of a partition of sensory data. The majority of current approaches tackle this using multi-class segmentation and labeling in a Conditional Random Field (CRF) framework or by generating multiple object hypotheses and combining them sequentially. In practical settings, the subset of semantic labels that are needed depend on the task and particular scene and labelling every single pixel is not always necessary. We pursue these observations in developing a more modular and flexible approach to multi-class parsing of RGBD data based on learning strategies for combining independent binary object-vs-background segmentations in place of the usual monolithic multi-label CRF approach. Parameters for the independent binary segmentation models can be learned very efficiently, and the combination strategy---learned using reinforcement learning---can be set independently and can vary over different tasks and environments. Accuracy is comparable to state-of-art methods on a subset of the NYU-V2 dataset of indoor scenes, while providing additional flexibility and modularity."
"DeepLab: Semantic Image Segmentation with Deep Convolutional Nets, Atrous Convolution, and Fully Connected CRFs","In this work we address the task of semantic image segmentation with Deep Learning and make three main contributions that are experimentally shown to have substantial practical merit. First, we highlight convolution with upsampled filters, or 'atrous convolution', as a powerful tool in dense prediction tasks. Atrous convolution allows us to explicitly control the resolution at which feature responses are computed within Deep Convolutional Neural Networks. It also allows us to effectively enlarge the field of view of filters to incorporate larger context without increasing the number of parameters or the amount of computation. Second, we propose atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) to robustly segment objects at multiple scales. ASPP probes an incoming convolutional feature layer with filters at multiple sampling rates and effective fields-of-views, thus capturing objects as well as image context at multiple scales. Third, we improve the localization of object boundaries by combining methods from DCNNs and probabilistic graphical models. The commonly deployed combination of max-pooling and downsampling in DCNNs achieves invariance but has a toll on localization accuracy. We overcome this by combining the responses at the final DCNN layer with a fully connected Conditional Random Field (CRF), which is shown both qualitatively and quantitatively to improve localization performance. Our proposed ""DeepLab"" system sets the new state-of-art at the PASCAL VOC-2012 semantic image segmentation task, reaching 79.7% mIOU in the test set, and advances the results on three other datasets: PASCAL-Context, PASCAL-Person-Part, and Cityscapes. All of our code is made publicly available online."
Convolutional Random Walk Networks for Semantic Image Segmentation,"Most current semantic segmentation methods rely on fully convolutional networks (FCNs). However, their use of large receptive fields and many pooling layers cause low spatial resolution inside the deep layers. This leads to predictions with poor localization around the boundaries. Prior work has attempted to address this issue by post-processing predictions with CRFs or MRFs. But such models often fail to capture semantic relationships between objects, which causes spatially disjoint predictions. To overcome these problems, recent methods integrated CRFs or MRFs into an FCN framework. The downside of these new models is that they have much higher complexity than traditional FCNs, which renders training and testing more challenging.  In this work we introduce a simple, yet effective Convolutional Random Walk Network (RWN) that addresses the issues of poor boundary localization and spatially fragmented predictions with very little increase in model complexity. Our proposed RWN jointly optimizes the objectives of pixelwise affinity and semantic segmentation. It combines these two objectives via a novel random walk layer that enforces consistent spatial grouping in the deep layers of the network. Our RWN is implemented using standard convolution and matrix multiplication. This allows an easy integration into existing FCN frameworks and it enables end-to-end training of the whole network via standard back-propagation. Our implementation of RWN requires just 131 additional parameters compared to the traditional FCNs, and yet it consistently produces an improvement over the FCNs on semantic segmentation and scene labeling."
Bridging Category-level and Instance-level Semantic Image Segmentation,"We propose an approach to instance-level image segmentation that is built on top of category-level segmentation. Specifically, for each pixel in a semantic category mask, its corresponding instance bounding box is predicted using a deep fully convolutional regression network. Thus it follows a different pipeline to the popular detect-then-segment approaches that first predict instances' bounding boxes, which are the current state-of-the-art in instance segmentation. We show that, by leveraging the strength of our state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models, the proposed method can achieve comparable or even better results to detect-then-segment approaches. We make the following contributions. (i) First, we propose a simple yet effective approach to semantic instance segmentation. (ii) Second, we propose an online bootstrapping method during training, which is critically important for achieving good performance for both semantic category segmentation and instance-level segmentation. (iii) As the performance of semantic category segmentation has a significant impact on the instance-level segmentation, which is the second step of our approach, we train fully convolutional residual networks to achieve the best semantic category segmentation accuracy. On the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset, we obtain the currently best mean intersection-over-union score of 79.1%. (iv) We also achieve state-of-the-art results for instance-level segmentation."
Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation,"Convolutional networks are powerful visual models that yield hierarchies of features. We show that convolutional networks by themselves, trained end-to-end, pixels-to-pixels, improve on the previous best result in semantic segmentation. Our key insight is to build ""fully convolutional"" networks that take input of arbitrary size and produce correspondingly-sized output with efficient inference and learning. We define and detail the space of fully convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction tasks, and draw connections to prior models. We adapt contemporary classification networks (AlexNet, the VGG net, and GoogLeNet) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning to the segmentation task. We then define a skip architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations. Our fully convolutional network achieves improved segmentation of PASCAL VOC (30% relative improvement to 67.2% mean IU on 2012), NYUDv2, SIFT Flow, and PASCAL-Context, while inference takes one tenth of a second for a typical image."
CNN based texture synthesize with Semantic segment,"Deep learning algorithm display powerful ability in Computer Vision area, in recent year, the CNN has been applied to solve problems in the subarea of Image-generating, which has been widely applied in areas such as photo editing, image design, computer animation, real-time rendering for large scale of scenes and for visual effects in movies. However in the texture synthesize procedure. The state-of-art CNN can not capture the spatial location of texture in image, lead to significant distortion after texture synthesize, we propose a new way to generating-image by adding the semantic segment step with deep learning algorithm as Pre-Processing and analyze the outcome."
Fast Semantic Image Segmentation with High Order Context and Guided Filtering,"This paper describes a fast and accurate semantic image segmentation approach that encodes not only the discriminative features from deep neural networks, but also the high-order context compatibility among adjacent objects as well as low level image features. We formulate the underlying problem as the conditional random field that embeds local feature extraction, clique potential construction, and guided filtering within the same framework, and provide an efficient coarse-to-fine solver. At the coarse level, we combine local feature representation and context interaction using a deep convolutional network, and directly learn the interaction from high order cliques with a message passing routine, avoiding time-consuming explicit graph inference for joint probability distribution. At the fine level, we introduce a guided filtering interpretation for the mean field algorithm, and achieve accurate object boundaries with 100+ faster than classic learning methods. The two parts are connected and jointly trained in an end-to-end fashion. Experimental results on Pascal VOC 2012 dataset have shown that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art, and that it achieves the rank 1 performance at the time of submission, both of which prove the effectiveness of this unified framework for semantic image segmentation."
Laplacian Pyramid Reconstruction and Refinement for Semantic Segmentation,"CNN architectures have terrific recognition performance but rely on spatial pooling which makes it difficult to adapt them to tasks that require dense, pixel-accurate labeling. This paper makes two contributions: (1) We demonstrate that while the apparent spatial resolution of convolutional feature maps is low, the high-dimensional feature representation contains significant sub-pixel localization information. (2) We describe a multi-resolution reconstruction architecture based on a Laplacian pyramid that uses skip connections from higher resolution feature maps and multiplicative gating to successively refine segment boundaries reconstructed from lower-resolution maps. This approach yields state-of-the-art semantic segmentation results on the PASCAL VOC and Cityscapes segmentation benchmarks without resorting to more complex random-field inference or instance detection driven architectures."
Unsupervised Total Variation Loss for Semi-supervised Deep Learning of Semantic Segmentation,"We introduce a novel unsupervised loss function for learning semantic segmentation with deep convolutional neural nets (ConvNet) when densely labeled training images are not available. More specifically, the proposed loss function penalizes the L1-norm of the gradient of the label probability vector image , i.e. total variation, produced by the ConvNet. This can be seen as a regularization term that promotes piecewise smoothness of the label probability vector image produced by the ConvNet during learning. The unsupervised loss function is combined with a supervised loss in a semi-supervised setting to learn ConvNets that can achieve high semantic segmentation accuracy even when only a tiny percentage of the pixels in the training images are labeled. We demonstrate significant improvements over the purely supervised setting in the Weizmann horse, Stanford background and Sift Flow datasets. Furthermore, we show that using the proposed piecewise smoothness constraint in the learning phase significantly outperforms post-processing results from a purely supervised approach with Markov Random Fields (MRF). Finally, we note that the framework we introduce is general and can be used to learn to label other types of structures such as curvilinear structures by modifying the unsupervised loss function accordingly."
Joint Semantic Segmentation and Depth Estimation with Deep Convolutional Networks,"Multi-scale deep CNNs have been used successfully for problems mapping each pixel to a label, such as depth estimation and semantic segmentation. It has also been shown that such architectures are reusable and can be used for multiple tasks. These networks are typically trained independently for each task by varying the output layer(s) and training objective. In this work we present a new model for simultaneous depth estimation and semantic segmentation from a single RGB image. Our approach demonstrates the feasibility of training parts of the model for each task and then fine tuning the full, combined model on both tasks simultaneously using a single loss function. Furthermore we couple the deep CNN with fully connected CRF, which captures the contextual relationships and interactions between the semantic and depth cues improving the accuracy of the final results. The proposed model is trained and evaluated on NYUDepth V2 dataset outperforming the state of the art methods on semantic segmentation and achieving comparable results on the task of depth estimation."
ScribbleSup: Scribble-Supervised Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation,"Large-scale data is of crucial importance for learning semantic segmentation models, but annotating per-pixel masks is a tedious and inefficient procedure. We note that for the topic of interactive image segmentation, scribbles are very widely used in academic research and commercial software, and are recognized as one of the most user-friendly ways of interacting. In this paper, we propose to use scribbles to annotate images, and develop an algorithm to train convolutional networks for semantic segmentation supervised by scribbles. Our algorithm is based on a graphical model that jointly propagates information from scribbles to unmarked pixels and learns network parameters. We present competitive object semantic segmentation results on the PASCAL VOC dataset by using scribbles as annotations. Scribbles are also favored for annotating stuff (e.g., water, sky, grass) that has no well-defined shape, and our method shows excellent results on the PASCAL-CONTEXT dataset thanks to extra inexpensive scribble annotations. Our scribble annotations on PASCAL VOC are available at http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/jifdai/downloads/scribble_sup"
End-to-End Tracking and Semantic Segmentation Using Recurrent Neural Networks,"In this work we present a novel end-to-end framework for tracking and classifying a robot's surroundings in complex, dynamic and only partially observable real-world environments. The approach deploys a recurrent neural network to filter an input stream of raw laser measurements in order to directly infer object locations, along with their identity in both visible and occluded areas. To achieve this we first train the network using unsupervised Deep Tracking, a recently proposed theoretical framework for end-to-end space occupancy prediction. We show that by learning to track on a large amount of unsupervised data, the network creates a rich internal representation of its environment which we in turn exploit through the principle of inductive transfer of knowledge to perform the task of it's semantic classification. As a result, we show that only a small amount of labelled data suffices to steer the network towards mastering this additional task. Furthermore we propose a novel recurrent neural network architecture specifically tailored to tracking and semantic classification in real-world robotics applications. We demonstrate the tracking and classification performance of the method on real-world data collected at a busy road junction. Our evaluation shows that the proposed end-to-end framework compares favourably to a state-of-the-art, model-free tracking solution and that it outperforms a conventional one-shot training scheme for semantic classification."
High-performance Semantic Segmentation Using Very Deep Fully Convolutional Networks,"We propose a method for high-performance semantic image segmentation (or semantic pixel labelling) based on very deep residual networks, which achieves the state-of-the-art performance. A few design factors are carefully considered to this end.  We make the following contributions. (i) First, we evaluate different variations of a fully convolutional residual network so as to find the best configuration, including the number of layers, the resolution of feature maps, and the size of field-of-view. Our experiments show that further enlarging the field-of-view and increasing the resolution of feature maps are typically beneficial, which however inevitably leads to a higher demand for GPU memories. To walk around the limitation, we propose a new method to simulate a high resolution network with a low resolution network, which can be applied during training and/or testing. (ii) Second, we propose an online bootstrapping method for training. We demonstrate that online bootstrapping is critically important for achieving good accuracy. (iii) Third we apply the traditional dropout to some of the residual blocks, which further improves the performance. (iv) Finally, our method achieves the currently best mean intersection-over-union 78.3\% on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset, as well as on the recent dataset Cityscapes."
STD2P: RGBD Semantic Segmentation Using Spatio-Temporal Data-Driven Pooling,"We propose a novel superpixel-based multi-view convolutional neural network for semantic image segmentation. The proposed network produces a high quality segmentation of a single image by leveraging information from additional views of the same scene. Particularly in indoor videos such as captured by robotic platforms or handheld and bodyworn RGBD cameras, nearby video frames provide diverse viewpoints and additional context of objects and scenes. To leverage such information, we first compute region correspondences by optical flow and image boundary-based superpixels. Given these region correspondences, we propose a novel spatio-temporal pooling layer to aggregate information over space and time. We evaluate our approach on the NYU--Depth--V2 and the SUN3D datasets and compare it to various state-of-the-art single-view and multi-view approaches. Besides a general improvement over the state-of-the-art, we also show the benefits of making use of unlabeled frames during training for multi-view as well as single-view prediction."
Training Constrained Deconvolutional Networks for Road Scene Semantic Segmentation,"In this work we investigate the problem of road scene semantic segmentation using Deconvolutional Networks (DNs). Several constraints limit the practical performance of DNs in this context: firstly, the paucity of existing pixel-wise labelled training data, and secondly, the memory constraints of embedded hardware, which rule out the practical use of state-of-the-art DN architectures such as fully convolutional networks (FCN). To address the first constraint, we introduce a Multi-Domain Road Scene Semantic Segmentation (MDRS3) dataset, aggregating data from six existing densely and sparsely labelled datasets for training our models, and two existing, separate datasets for testing their generalisation performance. We show that, while MDRS3 offers a greater volume and variety of data, end-to-end training of a memory efficient DN does not yield satisfactory performance. We propose a new training strategy to overcome this, based on (i) the creation of a best-possible source network (S-Net) from the aggregated data, ignoring time and memory constraints; and (ii) the transfer of knowledge from S-Net to the memory-efficient target network (T-Net). We evaluate different techniques for S-Net creation and T-Net transferral, and demonstrate that training a constrained deconvolutional network in this manner can unlock better performance than existing training approaches. Specifically, we show that a target network can be trained to achieve improved accuracy versus an FCN despite using less than 1\% of the memory. We believe that our approach can be useful beyond automotive scenarios where labelled data is similarly scarce or fragmented and where practical constraints exist on the desired model size. We make available our network models and aggregated multi-domain dataset for reproducibility."
Variational reaction-diffusion systems for semantic segmentation,"A novel global energy model for multi-class semantic image segmentation is proposed that admits very efficient exact inference and derivative calculations for learning. Inference in this model is equivalent to MAP inference in a particular kind of vector-valued Gaussian Markov random field, and ultimately reduces to solving a linear system of linear PDEs known as a reaction-diffusion system. Solving this system can be achieved in time scaling near-linearly in the number of image pixels by reducing it to sequential FFTs, after a linear change of basis. The efficiency and differentiability of the model make it especially well-suited for integration with convolutional neural networks, even allowing it to be used in interior, feature-generating layers and stacked multiple times. Experimental results are shown demonstrating that the model can be employed profitably in conjunction with different convolutional net architectures, and that doing so compares favorably to joint training of a fully-connected CRF with a convolutional net."
Object Boundary Guided Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation is critical to image content understanding and object localization. Recent development in fully-convolutional neural network (FCN) has enabled accurate pixel-level labeling. One issue in previous works is that the FCN based method does not exploit the object boundary information to delineate segmentation details since the object boundary label is ignored in the network training. To tackle this problem, we introduce a double branch fully convolutional neural network, which separates the learning of the desirable semantic class labeling with mask-level object proposals guided by relabeled boundaries. This network, called object boundary guided FCN (OBG-FCN), is able to integrate the distinct properties of object shape and class features elegantly in a fully convolutional way with a designed masking architecture. We conduct experiments on the PASCAL VOC segmentation benchmark, and show that the end-to-end trainable OBG-FCN system offers great improvement in optimizing the target semantic segmentation quality."
"Fast, Exact and Multi-Scale Inference for Semantic Image Segmentation with Deep Gaussian CRFs","In this work we propose a structured prediction technique that combines the virtues of Gaussian Conditional Random Fields (G-CRF) with Deep Learning: (a) our structured prediction task has a unique global optimum that is obtained exactly from the solution of a linear system (b) the gradients of our model parameters are analytically computed using closed form expressions, in contrast to the memory-demanding contemporary deep structured prediction approaches that rely on back-propagation-through-time, (c) our pairwise terms do not have to be simple hand-crafted expressions, as in the line of works building on the DenseCRF, but can rather be `discovered' from data through deep architectures, and (d) out system can trained in an end-to-end manner. Building on standard tools from numerical analysis we develop very efficient algorithms for inference and learning, as well as a customized technique adapted to the semantic segmentation task. This efficiency allows us to explore more sophisticated architectures for structured prediction in deep learning: we introduce multi-resolution architectures to couple information across scales in a joint optimization framework, yielding systematic improvements. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on the challenging VOC PASCAL 2012 image segmentation benchmark, showing substantial improvements over strong baselines. We make all of our code and experiments available at {https://github.com/siddharthachandra/gcrf}"
Simple Does It: Weakly Supervised Instance and Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic labelling and instance segmentation are two tasks that require particularly costly annotations. Starting from weak supervision in the form of bounding box detection annotations, we propose a new approach that does not require modification of the segmentation training procedure. We show that when carefully designing the input labels from given bounding boxes, even a single round of training is enough to improve over previously reported weakly supervised results. Overall, our weak supervision approach reaches ~95% of the quality of the fully supervised model, both for semantic labelling and instance segmentation."
Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation using Motion Cues,"Fully convolutional neural networks (FCNNs) trained on a large number of images with strong pixel-level annotations have become the new state of the art for the semantic segmentation task. While there have been recent attempts to learn FCNNs from image-level weak annotations, they need additional constraints, such as the size of an object, to obtain reasonable performance. To address this issue, we present motion-CNN (M-CNN), a novel FCNN framework which incorporates motion cues and is learned from video-level weak annotations. Our learning scheme to train the network uses motion segments as soft constraints, thereby handling noisy motion information. When trained on weakly-annotated videos, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art EM-Adapt approach on the PASCAL VOC 2012 image segmentation benchmark. We also demonstrate that the performance of M-CNN learned with 150 weak video annotations is on par with state-of-the-art weakly-supervised methods trained with thousands of images. Finally, M-CNN substantially outperforms recent approaches in a related task of video co-localization on the YouTube-Objects dataset."
Combining the Best of Convolutional Layers and Recurrent Layers: A Hybrid Network for Semantic Segmentation,"State-of-the-art results of semantic segmentation are established by Fully Convolutional neural Networks (FCNs). FCNs rely on cascaded convolutional and pooling layers to gradually enlarge the receptive fields of neurons, resulting in an indirect way of modeling the distant contextual dependence. In this work, we advocate the use of spatially recurrent layers (i.e. ReNet layers) which directly capture global contexts and lead to improved feature representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ReNet layers by building a Naive deep ReNet (N-ReNet), which achieves competitive performance on Stanford Background dataset. Furthermore, we integrate ReNet layers with FCNs, and develop a novel Hybrid deep ReNet (H-ReNet). It enjoys a few remarkable properties, including full-image receptive fields, end-to-end training, and efficient network execution. On the PASCAL VOC 2012 benchmark, the H-ReNet improves the results of state-of-the-art approaches Piecewise, CRFasRNN and DeepParsing by 3.6%, 2.3% and 0.2%, respectively, and achieves the highest IoUs for 13 out of the 20 object classes."
Optical Flow with Semantic Segmentation and Localized Layers,"Existing optical flow methods make generic, spatially homogeneous, assumptions about the spatial structure of the flow. In reality, optical flow varies across an image depending on object class. Simply put, different objects move differently. Here we exploit recent advances in static semantic scene segmentation to segment the image into objects of different types. We define different models of image motion in these regions depending on the type of object. For example, we model the motion on roads with homographies, vegetation with spatially smooth flow, and independently moving objects like cars and planes with affine motion plus deviations. We then pose the flow estimation problem using a novel formulation of localized layers, which addresses limitations of traditional layered models for dealing with complex scene motion. Our semantic flow method achieves the lowest error of any published monocular method in the KITTI-2015 flow benchmark and produces qualitatively better flow and segmentation than recent top methods on a wide range of natural videos."
Exploring Context with Deep Structured models for Semantic Segmentation,"State-of-the-art semantic image segmentation methods are mostly based on training deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this work, we proffer to improve semantic segmentation with the use of contextual information. In particular, we explore `patch-patch' context and `patch-background' context in deep CNNs. We formulate deep structured models by combining CNNs and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) for learning the patch-patch context between image regions. Specifically, we formulate CNN-based pairwise potential functions to capture semantic correlations between neighboring patches. Efficient piecewise training of the proposed deep structured model is then applied in order to avoid repeated expensive CRF inference during the course of back propagation. For capturing the patch-background context, we show that a network design with traditional multi-scale image inputs and sliding pyramid pooling is very effective for improving performance. We perform comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method. We achieve new state-of-the-art performance on a number of challenging semantic segmentation datasets including NYUDv2, PASCAL-VOC2012, Cityscapes, PASCAL-Context, SUN-RGBD, SIFT-flow, and KITTI datasets. Particularly, we report an intersection-over-union score of 77.8 on the PASCAL-VOC2012 dataset."
A Survey of Semantic Segmentation,"This survey gives an overview over different techniques used for pixel-level semantic segmentation. Metrics and datasets for the evaluation of segmentation algorithms and traditional approaches for segmentation such as unsupervised methods, Decision Forests and SVMs are described and pointers to the relevant papers are given. Recently published approaches with convolutional neural networks are mentioned and typical problematic situations for segmentation algorithms are examined. A taxonomy of segmentation algorithms is given."
Deconvolutional Feature Stacking for Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"A weakly-supervised semantic segmentation framework with a tied deconvolutional neural network is presented. Each deconvolution layer in the framework consists of unpooling and deconvolution operations. 'Unpooling' upsamples the input feature map based on unpooling switches defined by corresponding convolution layer's pooling operation. 'Deconvolution' convolves the input unpooled features by using convolutional weights tied with the corresponding convolution layer's convolution operation. The unpooling-deconvolution combination helps to eliminate less discriminative features in a feature extraction stage, since output features of the deconvolution layer are reconstructed from the most discriminative unpooled features instead of the raw one. This results in reduction of false positives in a pixel-level inference stage. All the feature maps restored from the entire deconvolution layers can constitute a rich discriminative feature set according to different abstraction levels. Those features are stacked to be selectively used for generating class-specific activation maps. Under the weak supervision (image-level labels), the proposed framework shows promising results on lesion segmentation in medical images (chest X-rays) and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PASCAL VOC segmentation dataset in the same experimental condition."
Global Deconvolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic image segmentation is a principal problem in computer vision, where the aim is to correctly classify each individual pixel of an image into a semantic label. Its widespread use in many areas, including medical imaging and autonomous driving, has fostered extensive research in recent years. Empirical improvements in tackling this task have primarily been motivated by successful exploitation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) pre-trained for image classification and object recognition. However, the pixel-wise labelling with CNNs has its own unique challenges: (1) an accurate deconvolution, or upsampling, of low-resolution output into a higher-resolution segmentation mask and (2) an inclusion of global information, or context, within locally extracted features. To address these issues, we propose a novel architecture to conduct the equivalent of the deconvolution operation globally and acquire dense predictions. We demonstrate that it leads to improved performance of state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models on the PASCAL VOC 2012 benchmark, reaching 74.0% mean IU accuracy on the test set."
Actor-Action Semantic Segmentation with Grouping Process Models,"Actor-action semantic segmentation made an important step toward advanced video understanding problems: what action is happening; who is performing the action; and where is the action in space-time. Current models for this problem are local, based on layered CRFs, and are unable to capture long-ranging interaction of video parts. We propose a new model that combines these local labeling CRFs with a hierarchical supervoxel decomposition. The supervoxels provide cues for possible groupings of nodes, at various scales, in the CRFs to encourage adaptive, high-order groups for more effective labeling. Our model is dynamic and continuously exchanges information during inference: the local CRFs influence what supervoxels in the hierarchy are active, and these active nodes influence the connectivity in the CRF; we hence call it a grouping process model. The experimental results on a recent large-scale video dataset show a large margin of 60% relative improvement over the state of the art, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the dynamic, bidirectional flow between labeling and grouping."
Learning Transferrable Knowledge for Semantic Segmentation with Deep Convolutional Neural Network,"We propose a novel weakly-supervised semantic segmentation algorithm based on Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN). Contrary to existing weakly-supervised approaches, our algorithm exploits auxiliary segmentation annotations available for different categories to guide segmentations on images with only image-level class labels. To make the segmentation knowledge transferrable across categories, we design a decoupled encoder-decoder architecture with attention model. In this architecture, the model generates spatial highlights of each category presented in an image using an attention model, and subsequently generates foreground segmentation for each highlighted region using decoder. Combining attention model, we show that the decoder trained with segmentation annotations in different categories can boost the performance of weakly-supervised semantic segmentation. The proposed algorithm demonstrates substantially improved performance compared to the state-of-the-art weakly-supervised techniques in challenging PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset when our model is trained with the annotations in 60 exclusive categories in Microsoft COCO dataset."
SR-Clustering: Semantic Regularized Clustering for Egocentric Photo Streams Segmentation,"While wearable cameras are becoming increasingly popular, locating relevant information in large unstructured collections of egocentric images is still a tedious and time consuming processes. This paper addresses the problem of organizing egocentric photo streams acquired by a wearable camera into semantically meaningful segments. First, contextual and semantic information is extracted for each image by employing a Convolutional Neural Networks approach. Later, by integrating language processing, a vocabulary of concepts is defined in a semantic space. Finally, by exploiting the temporal coherence in photo streams, images which share contextual and semantic attributes are grouped together. The resulting temporal segmentation is particularly suited for further analysis, ranging from activity and event recognition to semantic indexing and summarization. Experiments over egocentric sets of nearly 17,000 images, show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods."
Instance-aware Semantic Segmentation via Multi-task Network Cascades,"Semantic segmentation research has recently witnessed rapid progress, but many leading methods are unable to identify object instances. In this paper, we present Multi-task Network Cascades for instance-aware semantic segmentation. Our model consists of three networks, respectively differentiating instances, estimating masks, and categorizing objects. These networks form a cascaded structure, and are designed to share their convolutional features. We develop an algorithm for the nontrivial end-to-end training of this causal, cascaded structure. Our solution is a clean, single-step training framework and can be generalized to cascades that have more stages. We demonstrate state-of-the-art instance-aware semantic segmentation accuracy on PASCAL VOC. Meanwhile, our method takes only 360ms testing an image using VGG-16, which is two orders of magnitude faster than previous systems for this challenging problem. As a by product, our method also achieves compelling object detection results which surpass the competitive Fast/Faster R-CNN systems.  The method described in this paper is the foundation of our submissions to the MS COCO 2015 segmentation competition, where we won the 1st place."
ReSeg: A Recurrent Neural Network-based Model for Semantic Segmentation,"We propose a structured prediction architecture, which exploits the local generic features extracted by Convolutional Neural Networks and the capacity of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to retrieve distant dependencies. The proposed architecture, called ReSeg, is based on the recently introduced ReNet model for image classification. We modify and extend it to perform the more challenging task of semantic segmentation. Each ReNet layer is composed of four RNN that sweep the image horizontally and vertically in both directions, encoding patches or activations, and providing relevant global information. Moreover, ReNet layers are stacked on top of pre-trained convolutional layers, benefiting from generic local features. Upsampling layers follow ReNet layers to recover the original image resolution in the final predictions. The proposed ReSeg architecture is efficient, flexible and suitable for a variety of semantic segmentation tasks. We evaluate ReSeg on several widely-used semantic segmentation datasets: Weizmann Horse, Oxford Flower, and CamVid; achieving state-of-the-art performance. Results show that ReSeg can act as a suitable architecture for semantic segmentation tasks, and may have further applications in other structured prediction problems. The source code and model hyperparameters are available on https://github.com/fvisin/reseg."
Learning High-level Prior with Convolutional Neural Networks for Semantic Segmentation,"This paper proposes a convolutional neural network that can fuse high-level prior for semantic image segmentation. Motivated by humans' vision recognition system, our key design is a three-layer generative structure consisting of high-level coding, middle-level segmentation and low-level image to introduce global prior for semantic segmentation. Based on this structure, we proposed a generative model called conditional variational auto-encoder (CVAE) that can build up the links behind these three layers. These important links include an image encoder that extracts high level info from image, a segmentation encoder that extracts high level info from segmentation, and a hybrid decoder that outputs semantic segmentation from the high level prior and input image. We theoretically derive the semantic segmentation as an optimization problem parameterized by these links. Finally, the optimization problem enables us to take advantage of state-of-the-art fully convolutional network structure for the implementation of the above encoders and decoder. Experimental results on several representative datasets demonstrate our supreme performance for semantic segmentation."
Semantic Segmentation of Colon Glands with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks and Total Variation Segmentation,"Segmentation of histopathology sections is an ubiquitous requirement in digital pathology and due to the large variability of biological tissue, machine learning techniques have shown superior performance over standard image processing methods. As part of the GlaS@MICCAI2015 colon gland segmentation challenge, we present a learning-based algorithm to segment glands in tissue of benign and malignant colorectal cancer. Images are preprocessed according to the Hematoxylin-Eosin staining protocol and two deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) are trained as pixel classifiers. The CNN predictions are then regularized using a figure-ground segmentation based on weighted total variation to produce the final segmentation result. On two test sets, our approach achieves a tissue classification accuracy of 98% and 94%, making use of the inherent capability of our system to distinguish between benign and malignant tissue."
Learning Dense Convolutional Embeddings for Semantic Segmentation,"This paper proposes a new deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) architecture that learns pixel embeddings, such that pairwise distances between the embeddings can be used to infer whether or not the pixels lie on the same region. That is, for any two pixels on the same object, the embeddings are trained to be similar; for any pair that straddles an object boundary, the embeddings are trained to be dissimilar. Experimental results show that when this embedding network is used in conjunction with a DCNN trained on semantic segmentation, there is a systematic improvement in per-pixel classification accuracy. Our contributions are integrated in the popular Caffe deep learning framework, and consist in straightforward modifications to convolution routines. As such, they can be exploited for any task involving convolution layers."
Attention to Scale: Scale-aware Semantic Image Segmentation,"Incorporating multi-scale features in fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs) has been a key element to achieving state-of-the-art performance on semantic image segmentation. One common way to extract multi-scale features is to feed multiple resized input images to a shared deep network and then merge the resulting features for pixelwise classification. In this work, we propose an attention mechanism that learns to softly weight the multi-scale features at each pixel location. We adapt a state-of-the-art semantic image segmentation model, which we jointly train with multi-scale input images and the attention model. The proposed attention model not only outperforms average- and max-pooling, but allows us to diagnostically visualize the importance of features at different positions and scales. Moreover, we show that adding extra supervision to the output at each scale is essential to achieving excellent performance when merging multi-scale features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model with extensive experiments on three challenging datasets, including PASCAL-Person-Part, PASCAL VOC 2012 and a subset of MS-COCO 2014."
Semantic Image Segmentation with Task-Specific Edge Detection Using CNNs and a Discriminatively Trained Domain Transform,"Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the backbone of state-of-art semantic image segmentation systems. Recent work has shown that complementing CNNs with fully-connected conditional random fields (CRFs) can significantly enhance their object localization accuracy, yet dense CRF inference is computationally expensive. We propose replacing the fully-connected CRF with domain transform (DT), a modern edge-preserving filtering method in which the amount of smoothing is controlled by a reference edge map. Domain transform filtering is several times faster than dense CRF inference and we show that it yields comparable semantic segmentation results, accurately capturing object boundaries. Importantly, our formulation allows learning the reference edge map from intermediate CNN features instead of using the image gradient magnitude as in standard DT filtering. This produces task-specific edges in an end-to-end trainable system optimizing the target semantic segmentation quality."
Semantic Segmentation with Boundary Neural Fields,"The state-of-the-art in semantic segmentation is currently represented by fully convolutional networks (FCNs). However, FCNs use large receptive fields and many pooling layers, both of which cause blurring and low spatial resolution in the deep layers. As a result FCNs tend to produce segmentations that are poorly localized around object boundaries. Prior work has attempted to address this issue in post-processing steps, for example using a color-based CRF on top of the FCN predictions. However, these approaches require additional parameters and low-level features that are difficult to tune and integrate into the original network architecture. Additionally, most CRFs use color-based pixel affinities, which are not well suited for semantic segmentation and lead to spatially disjoint predictions.  To overcome these problems, we introduce a Boundary Neural Field (BNF), which is a global energy model integrating FCN predictions with boundary cues. The boundary information is used to enhance semantic segment coherence and to improve object localization. Specifically, we first show that the convolutional filters of semantic FCNs provide good features for boundary detection. We then employ the predicted boundaries to define pairwise potentials in our energy. Finally, we show that our energy decomposes semantic segmentation into multiple binary problems, which can be relaxed for efficient global optimization. We report extensive experiments demonstrating that minimization of our global boundary-based energy yields results superior to prior globalization methods, both quantitatively as well as qualitatively."
Multiresolution hierarchy co-clustering for semantic segmentation in sequences with small variations,"This paper presents a co-clustering technique that, given a collection of images and their hierarchies, clusters nodes from these hierarchies to obtain a coherent multiresolution representation of the image collection. We formalize the co-clustering as a Quadratic Semi-Assignment Problem and solve it with a linear programming relaxation approach that makes effective use of information from hierarchies. Initially, we address the problem of generating an optimal, coherent partition per image and, afterwards, we extend this method to a multiresolution framework. Finally, we particularize this framework to an iterative multiresolution video segmentation algorithm in sequences with small variations. We evaluate the algorithm on the Video Occlusion/Object Boundary Detection Dataset, showing that it produces state-of-the-art results in these scenarios."
"Segment-Phrase Table for Semantic Segmentation, Visual Entailment and Paraphrasing","We introduce Segment-Phrase Table (SPT), a large collection of bijective associations between textual phrases and their corresponding segmentations. Leveraging recent progress in object recognition and natural language semantics, we show how we can successfully build a high-quality segment-phrase table using minimal human supervision. More importantly, we demonstrate the unique value unleashed by this rich bimodal resource, for both vision as well as natural language understanding. First, we show that fine-grained textual labels facilitate contextual reasoning that helps in satisfying semantic constraints across image segments. This feature enables us to achieve state-of-the-art segmentation results on benchmark datasets. Next, we show that the association of high-quality segmentations to textual phrases aids in richer semantic understanding and reasoning of these textual phrases. Leveraging this feature, we motivate the problem of visual entailment and visual paraphrasing, and demonstrate its utility on a large dataset."
STC: A Simple to Complex Framework for Weakly-supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Recently, significant improvement has been made on semantic object segmentation due to the development of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs). Training such a DCNN usually relies on a large number of images with pixel-level segmentation masks, and annotating these images is very costly in terms of both finance and human effort. In this paper, we propose a simple to complex (STC) framework in which only image-level annotations are utilized to learn DCNNs for semantic segmentation. Specifically, we first train an initial segmentation network called Initial-DCNN with the saliency maps of simple images (i.e., those with a single category of major object(s) and clean background). These saliency maps can be automatically obtained by existing bottom-up salient object detection techniques, where no supervision information is needed. Then, a better network called Enhanced-DCNN is learned with supervision from the predicted segmentation masks of simple images based on the Initial-DCNN as well as the image-level annotations. Finally, more pixel-level segmentation masks of complex images (two or more categories of objects with cluttered background), which are inferred by using Enhanced-DCNN and image-level annotations, are utilized as the supervision information to learn the Powerful-DCNN for semantic segmentation. Our method utilizes 40K simple images from Flickr.com and 10K complex images from PASCAL VOC for step-wisely boosting the segmentation network. Extensive experimental results on PASCAL VOC 2012 segmentation benchmark well demonstrate the superiority of the proposed STC framework compared with other state-of-the-arts."
Semantic Image Segmentation via Deep Parsing Network,"This paper addresses semantic image segmentation by incorporating rich information into Markov Random Field (MRF), including high-order relations and mixture of label contexts. Unlike previous works that optimized MRFs using iterative algorithm, we solve MRF by proposing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), namely Deep Parsing Network (DPN), which enables deterministic end-to-end computation in a single forward pass. Specifically, DPN extends a contemporary CNN architecture to model unary terms and additional layers are carefully devised to approximate the mean field algorithm (MF) for pairwise terms. It has several appealing properties. First, different from the recent works that combined CNN and MRF, where many iterations of MF were required for each training image during back-propagation, DPN is able to achieve high performance by approximating one iteration of MF. Second, DPN represents various types of pairwise terms, making many existing works as its special cases. Third, DPN makes MF easier to be parallelized and speeded up in Graphical Processing Unit (GPU). DPN is thoroughly evaluated on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset, where a single DPN model yields a new state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy."
Semantic Video Segmentation : Exploring Inference Efficiency,"We explore the efficiency of the CRF inference beyond image level semantic segmentation and perform joint inference in video frames. The key idea is to combine best of two worlds: semantic co-labeling and more expressive models. Our formulation enables us to perform inference over ten thousand images within seconds and makes the system amenable to perform video semantic segmentation most effectively. On CamVid dataset, with TextonBoost unaries, our proposed method achieves up to 8% improvement in accuracy over individual semantic image segmentation without additional time overhead. The source code is available at https://github.com/subtri/video_inference"
Semantic Amodal Segmentation,"Common visual recognition tasks such as classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation are rapidly reaching maturity, and given the recent rate of progress, it is not unreasonable to conjecture that techniques for many of these problems will approach human levels of performance in the next few years. In this paper we look to the future: what is the next frontier in visual recognition?  We offer one possible answer to this question. We propose a detailed image annotation that captures information beyond the visible pixels and requires complex reasoning about full scene structure. Specifically, we create an amodal segmentation of each image: the full extent of each region is marked, not just the visible pixels. Annotators outline and name all salient regions in the image and specify a partial depth order. The result is a rich scene structure, including visible and occluded portions of each region, figure-ground edge information, semantic labels, and object overlap.  We create two datasets for semantic amodal segmentation. First, we label 500 images in the BSDS dataset with multiple annotators per image, allowing us to study the statistics of human annotations. We show that the proposed full scene annotation is surprisingly consistent between annotators, including for regions and edges. Second, we annotate 5000 images from COCO. This larger dataset allows us to explore a number of algorithmic ideas for amodal segmentation and depth ordering. We introduce novel metrics for these tasks, and along with our strong baselines, define concrete new challenges for the community."
Mapping Auto-context Decision Forests to Deep ConvNets for Semantic Segmentation,"We consider the task of pixel-wise semantic segmentation given a small set of labeled training images. Among two of the most popular techniques to address this task are Decision Forests (DF) and Neural Networks (NN). In this work, we explore the relationship between two special forms of these techniques: stacked DFs (namely Auto-context) and deep Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNet). Our main contribution is to show that Auto-context can be mapped to a deep ConvNet with novel architecture, and thereby trained end-to-end. This mapping can be used as an initialization of a deep ConvNet, enabling training even in the face of very limited amounts of training data. We also demonstrate an approximate mapping back from the refined ConvNet to a second stacked DF, with improved performance over the original. We experimentally verify that these mappings outperform stacked DFs for two different applications in computer vision and biology: Kinect-based body part labeling from depth images, and somite segmentation in microscopy images of developing zebrafish. Finally, we revisit the core mapping from a Decision Tree (DT) to a NN, and show that it is also possible to map a fuzzy DT, with sigmoidal split decisions, to a NN. This addresses multiple limitations of the previous mapping, and yields new insights into the popular Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), and more recently proposed concatenated ReLU (CReLU), activation functions."
Joint Calibration for Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation is the task of assigning a class-label to each pixel in an image. We propose a region-based semantic segmentation framework which handles both full and weak supervision, and addresses three common problems: (1) Objects occur at multiple scales and therefore we should use regions at multiple scales. However, these regions are overlapping which creates conflicting class predictions at the pixel-level. (2) Class frequencies are highly imbalanced in realistic datasets. (3) Each pixel can only be assigned to a single class, which creates competition between classes. We address all three problems with a joint calibration method which optimizes a multi-class loss defined over the final pixel-level output labeling, as opposed to simply region classification. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art on the popular SIFT Flow [18] dataset in both the fully and weakly supervised setting by a considerably margin (+6% and +10%, respectively)."
Beyond Semantic Image Segmentation : Exploring Efficient Inference in Video,"We explore the efficiency of the CRF inference module beyond image level semantic segmentation. The key idea is to combine the best of two worlds of semantic co-labeling and exploiting more expressive models. Similar to [Alvarez14] our formulation enables us perform inference over ten thousand images within seconds. On the other hand, it can handle higher-order clique potentials similar to [vineet2014] in terms of region-level label consistency and context in terms of co-occurrences. We follow the mean-field updates for higher order potentials similar to [vineet2014] and extend the spatial smoothness and appearance kernels [DenseCRF13] to address video data inspired by [Alvarez14]; thus making the system amenable to perform video semantic segmentation most effectively."
Decoupled Deep Neural Network for Semi-supervised Semantic Segmentation,"We propose a novel deep neural network architecture for semi-supervised semantic segmentation using heterogeneous annotations. Contrary to existing approaches posing semantic segmentation as a single task of region-based classification, our algorithm decouples classification and segmentation, and learns a separate network for each task. In this architecture, labels associated with an image are identified by classification network, and binary segmentation is subsequently performed for each identified label in segmentation network. The decoupled architecture enables us to learn classification and segmentation networks separately based on the training data with image-level and pixel-wise class labels, respectively. It facilitates to reduce search space for segmentation effectively by exploiting class-specific activation maps obtained from bridging layers. Our algorithm shows outstanding performance compared to other semi-supervised approaches even with much less training images with strong annotations in PASCAL VOC dataset."
What's the Point: Semantic Segmentation with Point Supervision,"The semantic image segmentation task presents a trade-off between test time accuracy and training-time annotation cost. Detailed per-pixel annotations enable training accurate models but are very time-consuming to obtain, image-level class labels are an order of magnitude cheaper but result in less accurate models. We take a natural step from image-level annotation towards stronger supervision: we ask annotators to point to an object if one exists. We incorporate this point supervision along with a novel objectness potential in the training loss function of a CNN model. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC 2012 benchmark reveal that the combined effect of point-level supervision and objectness potential yields an improvement of 12.9% mIOU over image-level supervision. Further, we demonstrate that models trained with point-level supervision are more accurate than models trained with image-level, squiggle-level or full supervision given a fixed annotation budget."
Improving Spatial Codification in Semantic Segmentation,"This paper explores novel approaches for improving the spatial codification for the pooling of local descriptors to solve the semantic segmentation problem. We propose to partition the image into three regions for each object to be described: Figure, Border and Ground. This partition aims at minimizing the influence of the image context on the object description and vice versa by introducing an intermediate zone around the object contour. Furthermore, we also propose a richer visual descriptor of the object by applying a Spatial Pyramid over the Figure region. Two novel Spatial Pyramid configurations are explored: Cartesian-based and crown-based Spatial Pyramids. We test these approaches with state-of-the-art techniques and show that they improve the Figure-Ground based pooling in the Pascal VOC 2011 and 2012 semantic segmentation challenges."
Learning Deconvolution Network for Semantic Segmentation,"We propose a novel semantic segmentation algorithm by learning a deconvolution network. We learn the network on top of the convolutional layers adopted from VGG 16-layer net. The deconvolution network is composed of deconvolution and unpooling layers, which identify pixel-wise class labels and predict segmentation masks. We apply the trained network to each proposal in an input image, and construct the final semantic segmentation map by combining the results from all proposals in a simple manner. The proposed algorithm mitigates the limitations of the existing methods based on fully convolutional networks by integrating deep deconvolution network and proposal-wise prediction; our segmentation method typically identifies detailed structures and handles objects in multiple scales naturally. Our network demonstrates outstanding performance in PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset, and we achieve the best accuracy (72.5%) among the methods trained with no external data through ensemble with the fully convolutional network."
Deep Learning for Semantic Part Segmentation with High-Level Guidance,"In this work we address the task of segmenting an object into its parts, or semantic part segmentation. We start by adapting a state-of-the-art semantic segmentation system to this task, and show that a combination of a fully-convolutional Deep CNN system coupled with Dense CRF labelling provides excellent results for a broad range of object categories. Still, this approach remains agnostic to high-level constraints between object parts. We introduce such prior information by means of the Restricted Boltzmann Machine, adapted to our task and train our model in an discriminative fashion, as a hidden CRF, demonstrating that prior information can yield additional improvements. We also investigate the performance of our approach ``in the wild'', without information concerning the objects' bounding boxes, using an object detector to guide a multi-scale segmentation scheme. We evaluate the performance of our approach on the Penn-Fudan and LFW datasets for the tasks of pedestrian parsing and face labelling respectively. We show superior performance with respect to competitive methods that have been extensively engineered on these benchmarks, as well as realistic qualitative results on part segmentation, even for occluded or deformable objects. We also provide quantitative and extensive qualitative results on three classes from the PASCAL Parts dataset. Finally, we show that our multi-scale segmentation scheme can boost accuracy, recovering segmentations for finer parts."
Object detection via a multi-region & semantic segmentation-aware CNN model,"We propose an object detection system that relies on a multi-region deep convolutional neural network (CNN) that also encodes semantic segmentation-aware features. The resulting CNN-based representation aims at capturing a diverse set of discriminative appearance factors and exhibits localization sensitivity that is essential for accurate object localization. We exploit the above properties of our recognition module by integrating it on an iterative localization mechanism that alternates between scoring a box proposal and refining its location with a deep CNN regression model. Thanks to the efficient use of our modules, we detect objects with very high localization accuracy. On the detection challenges of PASCAL VOC2007 and PASCAL VOC2012 we achieve mAP of 78.2% and 73.9% correspondingly, surpassing any other published work by a significant margin."
Semantic Motion Segmentation Using Dense CRF Formulation,"While the literature has been fairly dense in the areas of scene understanding and semantic labeling there have been few works that make use of motion cues to embellish semantic performance and vice versa. In this paper, we address the problem of semantic motion segmentation, and show how semantic and motion priors augments performance. We pro- pose an algorithm that jointly infers the semantic class and motion labels of an object. Integrating semantic, geometric and optical ow based constraints into a dense CRF-model we infer both the object class as well as motion class, for each pixel. We found improvement in performance using a fully connected CRF as compared to a standard clique-based CRFs. For inference, we use a Mean Field approximation based algorithm. Our method outperforms recently pro- posed motion detection algorithms and also improves the semantic labeling compared to the state-of-the-art Automatic Labeling Environment algorithm on the challenging KITTI dataset especially for object classes such as pedestrians and cars that are critical to an outdoor robotic navigation scenario."
Efficient piecewise training of deep structured models for semantic segmentation,"Recent advances in semantic image segmentation have mostly been achieved by training deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We show how to improve semantic segmentation through the use of contextual information; specifically, we explore `patch-patch' context between image regions, and `patch-background' context. For learning from the patch-patch context, we formulate Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) with CNN-based pairwise potential functions to capture semantic correlations between neighboring patches. Efficient piecewise training of the proposed deep structured model is then applied to avoid repeated expensive CRF inference for back propagation. For capturing the patch-background context, we show that a network design with traditional multi-scale image input and sliding pyramid pooling is effective for improving performance. Our experimental results set new state-of-the-art performance on a number of popular semantic segmentation datasets, including NYUDv2, PASCAL VOC 2012, PASCAL-Context, and SIFT-flow. In particular, we achieve an intersection-over-union score of 78.0 on the challenging PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset."
Text Segmentation based on Semantic Word Embeddings,"We explore the use of semantic word embeddings in text segmentation algorithms, including the C99 segmentation algorithm and new algorithms inspired by the distributed word vector representation. By developing a general framework for discussing a class of segmentation objectives, we study the effectiveness of greedy versus exact optimization approaches and suggest a new iterative refinement technique for improving the performance of greedy strategies. We compare our results to known benchmarks, using known metrics. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance for an untrained method with our Content Vector Segmentation (CVS) on the Choi test set. Finally, we apply the segmentation procedure to an in-the-wild dataset consisting of text extracted from scholarly articles in the arXiv.org database."
Deep Hierarchical Parsing for Semantic Segmentation,"This paper proposes a learning-based approach to scene parsing inspired by the deep Recursive Context Propagation Network (RCPN). RCPN is a deep feed-forward neural network that utilizes the contextual information from the entire image, through bottom-up followed by top-down context propagation via random binary parse trees. This improves the feature representation of every super-pixel in the image for better classification into semantic categories. We analyze RCPN and propose two novel contributions to further improve the model. We first analyze the learning of RCPN parameters and discover the presence of bypass error paths in the computation graph of RCPN that can hinder contextual propagation. We propose to tackle this problem by including the classification loss of the internal nodes of the random parse trees in the original RCPN loss function. Secondly, we use an MRF on the parse tree nodes to model the hierarchical dependency present in the output. Both modifications provide performance boosts over the original RCPN and the new system achieves state-of-the-art performance on Stanford Background, SIFT-Flow and Daimler urban datasets."
BoxSup: Exploiting Bounding Boxes to Supervise Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation,"Recent leading approaches to semantic segmentation rely on deep convolutional networks trained with human-annotated, pixel-level segmentation masks. Such pixel-accurate supervision demands expensive labeling effort and limits the performance of deep networks that usually benefit from more training data. In this paper, we propose a method that achieves competitive accuracy but only requires easily obtained bounding box annotations. The basic idea is to iterate between automatically generating region proposals and training convolutional networks. These two steps gradually recover segmentation masks for improving the networks, and vise versa. Our method, called BoxSup, produces competitive results supervised by boxes only, on par with strong baselines fully supervised by masks under the same setting. By leveraging a large amount of bounding boxes, BoxSup further unleashes the power of deep convolutional networks and yields state-of-the-art results on PASCAL VOC 2012 and PASCAL-CONTEXT."
Context Tricks for Cheap Semantic Segmentation,"Accurate semantic labeling of image pixels is difficult because intra-class variability is often greater than inter-class variability. In turn, fast semantic segmentation is hard because accurate models are usually too complicated to also run quickly at test-time. Our experience with building and running semantic segmentation systems has also shown a reasonably obvious bottleneck on model complexity, imposed by small training datasets. We therefore propose two simple complementary strategies that leverage context to give better semantic segmentation, while scaling up or down to train on different-sized datasets.  As easy modifications for existing semantic segmentation algorithms, we introduce Decorrelated Semantic Texton Forests, and the Context Sensitive Image Level Prior. The proposed modifications are tested using a Semantic Texton Forest (STF) system, and the modifications are validated on two standard benchmark datasets, MSRC-21 and PascalVOC-2010. In Python based comparisons, our system is insignificantly slower than STF at test-time, yet produces superior semantic segmentations overall, with just push-button training."
Weakly- and Semi-Supervised Learning of a DCNN for Semantic Image Segmentation,"Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) trained on a large number of images with strong pixel-level annotations have recently significantly pushed the state-of-art in semantic image segmentation. We study the more challenging problem of learning DCNNs for semantic image segmentation from either (1) weakly annotated training data such as bounding boxes or image-level labels or (2) a combination of few strongly labeled and many weakly labeled images, sourced from one or multiple datasets. We develop Expectation-Maximization (EM) methods for semantic image segmentation model training under these weakly supervised and semi-supervised settings. Extensive experimental evaluation shows that the proposed techniques can learn models delivering competitive results on the challenging PASCAL VOC 2012 image segmentation benchmark, while requiring significantly less annotation effort. We share source code implementing the proposed system at https://bitbucket.org/deeplab/deeplab-public."
Beyond Pixels: A Comprehensive Survey from Bottom-up to Semantic Image Segmentation and Cosegmentation,"Image segmentation refers to the process to divide an image into nonoverlapping meaningful regions according to human perception, which has become a classic topic since the early ages of computer vision. A lot of research has been conducted and has resulted in many applications. However, while many segmentation algorithms exist, yet there are only a few sparse and outdated summarizations available, an overview of the recent achievements and issues is lacking. We aim to provide a comprehensive review of the recent progress in this field. Covering 180 publications, we give an overview of broad areas of segmentation topics including not only the classic bottom-up approaches, but also the recent development in superpixel, interactive methods, object proposals, semantic image parsing and image cosegmentation. In addition, we also review the existing influential datasets and evaluation metrics. Finally, we suggest some design flavors and research directions for future research in image segmentation."
Semantic Image Segmentation with Deep Convolutional Nets and Fully Connected CRFs,"Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) have recently shown state of the art performance in high level vision tasks, such as image classification and object detection. This work brings together methods from DCNNs and probabilistic graphical models for addressing the task of pixel-level classification (also called ""semantic image segmentation""). We show that responses at the final layer of DCNNs are not sufficiently localized for accurate object segmentation. This is due to the very invariance properties that make DCNNs good for high level tasks. We overcome this poor localization property of deep networks by combining the responses at the final DCNN layer with a fully connected Conditional Random Field (CRF). Qualitatively, our ""DeepLab"" system is able to localize segment boundaries at a level of accuracy which is beyond previous methods. Quantitatively, our method sets the new state-of-art at the PASCAL VOC-2012 semantic image segmentation task, reaching 71.6% IOU accuracy in the test set. We show how these results can be obtained efficiently: Careful network re-purposing and a novel application of the 'hole' algorithm from the wavelet community allow dense computation of neural net responses at 8 frames per second on a modern GPU."
Semantic Part Segmentation using Compositional Model combining Shape and Appearance,"In this paper, we study the problem of semantic part segmentation for animals. This is more challenging than standard object detection, object segmentation and pose estimation tasks because semantic parts of animals often have similar appearance and highly varying shapes. To tackle these challenges, we build a mixture of compositional models to represent the object boundary and the boundaries of semantic parts. And we incorporate edge, appearance, and semantic part cues into the compositional model. Given part-level segmentation annotation, we develop a novel algorithm to learn a mixture of compositional models under various poses and viewpoints for certain animal classes. Furthermore, a linear complexity algorithm is offered for efficient inference of the compositional model using dynamic programming. We evaluate our method for horse and cow using a newly annotated dataset on Pascal VOC 2010 which has pixelwise part labels. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."
Combining the Best of Graphical Models and ConvNets for Semantic Segmentation,"We present a two-module approach to semantic segmentation that incorporates Convolutional Networks (CNNs) and Graphical Models. Graphical models are used to generate a small (5-30) set of diverse segmentations proposals, such that this set has high recall. Since the number of required proposals is so low, we can extract fairly complex features to rank them. Our complex feature of choice is a novel CNN called SegNet, which directly outputs a (coarse) semantic segmentation. Importantly, SegNet is specifically trained to optimize the corpus-level PASCAL IOU loss function. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first CNN specifically designed for semantic segmentation. This two-module approach achieves 52.5\% on the PASCAL 2012 segmentation challenge."
Feedforward semantic segmentation with zoom-out features,"We introduce a purely feed-forward architecture for semantic segmentation. We map small image elements (superpixels) to rich feature representations extracted from a sequence of nested regions of increasing extent. These regions are obtained by ""zooming out"" from the superpixel all the way to scene-level resolution. This approach exploits statistical structure in the image and in the label space without setting up explicit structured prediction mechanisms, and thus avoids complex and expensive inference. Instead superpixels are classified by a feedforward multilayer network. Our architecture achieves new state of the art performance in semantic segmentation, obtaining 64.4% average accuracy on the PASCAL VOC 2012 test set."
Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation,"Convolutional networks are powerful visual models that yield hierarchies of features. We show that convolutional networks by themselves, trained end-to-end, pixels-to-pixels, exceed the state-of-the-art in semantic segmentation. Our key insight is to build ""fully convolutional"" networks that take input of arbitrary size and produce correspondingly-sized output with efficient inference and learning. We define and detail the space of fully convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction tasks, and draw connections to prior models. We adapt contemporary classification networks (AlexNet, the VGG net, and GoogLeNet) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning to the segmentation task. We then define a novel architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations. Our fully convolutional network achieves state-of-the-art segmentation of PASCAL VOC (20% relative improvement to 62.2% mean IU on 2012), NYUDv2, and SIFT Flow, while inference takes one third of a second for a typical image."
Semantic-based Detection of Segment Outliers and Unusual Events for Wireless Sensor Networks,"Environmental scientists have increasingly been deploying wireless sensor networks to capture valuable data that measures and records precise information about our environment. One of the major challenges associated with wireless sensor networks is the quality of the data and more specifically the detection of segment outliers and unusual events. Most previous research has focused on detecting outliers that are errors that are caused by unreliable sensors and sensor nodes. However, there is an urgent need for the development of new tools capable of identifying, tagging and visualizing erroneous segment outliers and unusual events from sensor data streams. In this paper, we present a SOUE Detector (Segment Outlier and Unusual Event-Detector) system for wireless sensor networks that combines statistical analyses using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) with domain expert knowledge (captured via an ontology and semantic inferencing rules). The resulting Web portal enables scientist to efficiently search across a collection of wireless sensor data streams and identify, retrieve and display segment outliers (both erroneous and genuine) within the data streams. In this paper, we firstly describe the detection algorithms, the implementation details and the functionality of the SOUE Detector system. Secondly we evaluate our approach using data that comprises sensor observations collected from a sensor network deployed in the Springbrook National Park in Queensland, Australia. The experimental results show that the SOUE-Detector can efficiently detect segment outliers and unusual events with high levels of precision and recall."
Incorporating Near-Infrared Information into Semantic Image Segmentation,"Recent progress in computational photography has shown that we can acquire near-infrared (NIR) information in addition to the normal visible (RGB) band, with only slight modifications to standard digital cameras. Due to the proximity of the NIR band to visible radiation, NIR images share many properties with visible images. However, as a result of the material dependent reflection in the NIR part of the spectrum, such images reveal different characteristics of the scene. We investigate how to effectively exploit these differences to improve performance on the semantic image segmentation task. Based on a state-of-the-art segmentation framework and a novel manually segmented image database (both indoor and outdoor scenes) that contain 4-channel images (RGB+NIR), we study how to best incorporate the specific characteristics of the NIR response. We show that adding NIR leads to improved performance for classes that correspond to a specific type of material in both outdoor and indoor scenes. We also discuss the results with respect to the physical properties of the NIR response."
Parsing Semantic Parts of Cars Using Graphical Models and Segment Appearance Consistency,"This paper addresses the problem of semantic part parsing (segmentation) of cars, i.e.assigning every pixel within the car to one of the parts (e.g.body, window, lights, license plates and wheels). We formulate this as a landmark identification problem, where a set of landmarks specifies the boundaries of the parts. A novel mixture of graphical models is proposed, which dynamically couples the landmarks to a hierarchy of segments. When modeling pairwise relation between landmarks, this coupling enables our model to exploit the local image contents in addition to spatial deformation, an aspect that most existing graphical models ignore. In particular, our model enforces appearance consistency between segments within the same part. Parsing the car, including finding the optimal coupling between landmarks and segments in the hierarchy, is performed by dynamic programming. We evaluate our method on a subset of PASCAL VOC 2010 car images and on the car subset of 3D Object Category dataset (CAR3D). We show good results and, in particular, quantify the effectiveness of using the segment appearance consistency in terms of accuracy of part localization and segmentation."
Find my mug: Efficient object search with a mobile robot using semantic segmentation,"In this paper, we propose an efficient semantic segmentation framework for indoor scenes, tailored to the application on a mobile robot. Semantic segmentation can help robots to gain a reasonable understanding of their environment, but to reach this goal, the algorithms not only need to be accurate, but also fast and robust. Therefore, we developed an optimized 3D point cloud processing framework based on a Randomized Decision Forest, achieving competitive results at sufficiently high frame rates. We evaluate the capabilities of our method on the popular NYU depth dataset and our own data and demonstrate its feasibility by deploying it on a mobile service robot, for which we could optimize an object search procedure using our results."
Constrained Parametric Proposals and Pooling Methods for Semantic Segmentation in RGB-D Images,"We focus on the problem of semantic segmentation based on RGB-D data, with emphasis on analyzing cluttered indoor scenes containing many instances from many visual categories. Our approach is based on a parametric figure-ground intensity and depth-constrained proposal process that generates spatial layout hypotheses at multiple locations and scales in the image followed by a sequential inference algorithm that integrates the proposals into a complete scene estimate. Our contributions can be summarized as proposing the following: (1) a generalization of parametric max flow figure-ground proposal methodology to take advantage of intensity and depth information, in order to systematically and efficiently generate the breakpoints of an underlying spatial model in polynomial time, (2) new region description methods based on second-order pooling over multiple features constructed using both intensity and depth channels, (3) an inference procedure that can resolve conflicts in overlapping spatial partitions, and handles scenes with a large number of objects category instances, of very different scales, (4) extensive evaluation of the impact of depth, as well as the effectiveness of a large number of descriptors, both pre-designed and automatically obtained using deep learning, in a difficult RGB-D semantic segmentation problem with 92 classes. We report state of the art results in the challenging NYU Depth v2 dataset, extended for RMRC 2013 Indoor Segmentation Challenge, where currently the proposed model ranks first, with an average score of 24.61% and a number of 39 classes won. Moreover, we show that by combining second-order and deep learning features, over 15% relative accuracy improvements can be additionally achieved. In a scene classification benchmark, our methodology further improves the state of the art by 24%."
A Study of Actor and Action Semantic Retention in Video Supervoxel Segmentation,"Existing methods in the semantic computer vision community seem unable to deal with the explosion and richness of modern, open-source and social video content. Although sophisticated methods such as object detection or bag-of-words models have been well studied, they typically operate on low level features and ultimately suffer from either scalability issues or a lack of semantic meaning. On the other hand, video supervoxel segmentation has recently been established and applied to large scale data processing, which potentially serves as an intermediate representation to high level video semantic extraction. The supervoxels are rich decompositions of the video content: they capture object shape and motion well. However, it is not yet known if the supervoxel segmentation retains the semantics of the underlying video content. In this paper, we conduct a systematic study of how well the actor and action semantics are retained in video supervoxel segmentation. Our study has human observers watching supervoxel segmentation videos and trying to discriminate both actor (human or animal) and action (one of eight everyday actions). We gather and analyze a large set of 640 human perceptions over 96 videos in 3 different supervoxel scales. Furthermore, we conduct machine recognition experiments on a feature defined on supervoxel segmentation, called supervoxel shape context, which is inspired by the higher order processes in human perception. Our ultimate findings suggest that a significant amount of semantics have been well retained in the video supervoxel segmentation and can be used for further video analysis."
Rich feature hierarchies for accurate object detection and semantic segmentation,"Object detection performance, as measured on the canonical PASCAL VOC dataset, has plateaued in the last few years. The best-performing methods are complex ensemble systems that typically combine multiple low-level image features with high-level context. In this paper, we propose a simple and scalable detection algorithm that improves mean average precision (mAP) by more than 30% relative to the previous best result on VOC 2012---achieving a mAP of 53.3%. Our approach combines two key insights: (1) one can apply high-capacity convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to bottom-up region proposals in order to localize and segment objects and (2) when labeled training data is scarce, supervised pre-training for an auxiliary task, followed by domain-specific fine-tuning, yields a significant performance boost. Since we combine region proposals with CNNs, we call our method R-CNN: Regions with CNN features. We also compare R-CNN to OverFeat, a recently proposed sliding-window detector based on a similar CNN architecture. We find that R-CNN outperforms OverFeat by a large margin on the 200-class ILSVRC2013 detection dataset. Source code for the complete system is available at http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~rbg/rcnn."
Learning a Loopy Model For Semantic Segmentation Exactly,"Learning structured models using maximum margin techniques has become an indispensable tool for com- puter vision researchers, as many computer vision applications can be cast naturally as an image labeling problem. Pixel-based or superpixel-based conditional random fields are particularly popular examples. Typ- ically, neighborhood graphs, which contain a large number of cycles, are used. As exact inference in loopy graphs is NP-hard in general, learning these models without approximations is usually deemed infeasible. In this work we show that, despite the theoretical hardness, it is possible to learn loopy models exactly in practical applications. To this end, we analyze the use of multiple approximate inference techniques together with cutting plane training of structural SVMs. We show that our proposed method yields exact solutions with an optimality guarantees in a computer vision application, for little additional computational cost. We also propose a dynamic caching scheme to accelerate training further, yielding runtimes that are comparable with approximate methods. We hope that this insight can lead to a reconsideration of the tractability of loopy models in computer vision."
Semantic Context Forests for Learning-Based Knee Cartilage Segmentation in 3D MR Images,"The automatic segmentation of human knee cartilage from 3D MR images is a useful yet challenging task due to the thin sheet structure of the cartilage with diffuse boundaries and inhomogeneous intensities. In this paper, we present an iterative multi-class learning method to segment the femoral, tibial and patellar cartilage simultaneously, which effectively exploits the spatial contextual constraints between bone and cartilage, and also between different cartilages. First, based on the fact that the cartilage grows in only certain area of the corresponding bone surface, we extract the distance features of not only to the surface of the bone, but more informatively, to the densely registered anatomical landmarks on the bone surface. Second, we introduce a set of iterative discriminative classifiers that at each iteration, probability comparison features are constructed from the class confidence maps derived by previously learned classifiers. These features automatically embed the semantic context information between different cartilages of interest. Validated on a total of 176 volumes from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) dataset, the proposed approach demonstrates high robustness and accuracy of segmentation in comparison with existing state-of-the-art MR cartilage segmentation methods."
A Bag of Words Approach for Semantic Segmentation of Monitored Scenes,"This paper proposes a semantic segmentation method for outdoor scenes captured by a surveillance camera. Our algorithm classifies each perceptually homogenous region as one of the predefined classes learned from a collection of manually labelled images. The proposed approach combines two different types of information. First, color segmentation is performed to divide the scene into perceptually similar regions. Then, the second step is based on SIFT keypoints and uses the bag of words representation of the regions for the classification. The prediction is done using a Naïve Bayesian Network as a generative classifier. Compared to existing techniques, our method provides more compact representations of scene contents and the segmentation result is more consistent with human perception due to the combination of the color information with the image keypoints. The experiments conducted on a publicly available data set demonstrate the validity of the proposed method."
Indoor Semantic Segmentation using depth information,"This work addresses multi-class segmentation of indoor scenes with RGB-D inputs. While this area of research has gained much attention recently, most works still rely on hand-crafted features. In contrast, we apply a multiscale convolutional network to learn features directly from the images and the depth information. We obtain state-of-the-art on the NYU-v2 depth dataset with an accuracy of 64.5%. We illustrate the labeling of indoor scenes in videos sequences that could be processed in real-time using appropriate hardware such as an FPGA."
Semantic snippet construction for search engine results based on segment evaluation,The result listing from search engines includes a link and a snippet from the web page for each result item. The snippet in the result listing plays a vital role in assisting the user to click on it. This paper proposes a novel approach to construct the snippets based on a semantic evaluation of the segments in the page. The target segment(s) is/are identified by applying a model to evaluate segments present in the page and selecting the segments with top scores. The proposed model makes the user judgment to click on a result item easier since the snippet is constructed semantically after a critical evaluation based on multiple factors. A prototype implementation of the proposed model confirms the empirical validation.
